ridley pearson pied piper chapter the train left the station headed for nowhere its destination also its point of embarkation its purpose not to transport its passengers but to feed them by early march western washington neared the end of the rinse cycle a nearly perpetual curtain of ocean rain that blanketed the region for the winter months unleashing in its wake a promise of summer dark saturated clouds hung low on the eastern horizon well to the west where the sun retreated in a violent display a glimpse of blue cracked the marbled gray as welcome to the residents of seattle as any sight alive arrival at the dinner train surprised doris shotz she had thought her husband paul was taking her to ivars one of seattles more popular fishhouse chains a simple dinner date had presented her with a test of sorts being that it was her first evening leaving her fourmonthold baby girl rhonda with a sitter shed finally decided she could handle an hour or two a few blocks away from home but an entire evening stuck on a train in the woods was unimaginable unthinkable surprised he asked displaying the tickets proudly on the verge of total panic doris reminded herself that julie was an experienced sitter having taken care of henry for the last year as responsible a fifteenyearold as one could ask for better to give paul his moment than to start a fight theyd been talking about the dinner train for years and doris had to concede that over the last nine months paul had been a saint she owed him i cant believe it she said truthfully i know you didnt guess did you not for an instant i promise its a complete surprise good he reached down and took her hand and squeezed she felt flushed she wanted to be home with the kids all aboard he said the train lurched doris shotz shifted to avoid spilling the cheap champagne that paul had ordered although she didnt want to drink while nursing she knew paul would consider it an act of defiance to say no to any part of the celebration and given that she had already gone this far to please her husband she wasnt going to let one glass of champagne ruin the evening when the train turned east the frosted mountains flooded crimson with the sunset paul said with obvious satisfaction this is a long way from the backside of a computer paul repaired pcs for micro system workshop a name his employer had invented because it could be reduced to ms workshop and in an area dominated by microsoft those two initials meant dollars paul drove a blue ms workshop van around the city crisis to crisis fire to fire hard drives networks irq portsdoris had heard all the buzzwords enough times to think she might be capable of a repair or two herself paul provided for them adequately he loved her in his own way she loved him too though differently than she once had now the children absorbed most of her time and much of her love too she wasnt sure exactly how to categorize her love for paul she simply knew that she would always be at his side would attempt to put up with his moods but the truth was that she lived for her children rhonda and henry she had never before known such a complete feeling it warmed her just thinking about it she politely refused a refill of champagne as she watched her husbands cheeks redden behind the alcohols effects clearly carried away with happiness and the light buzz that came from the champagne he talked at her but she didnt hear boys and trains she thought do you think i should call home she asked him call she motioned to the rear of the train car theres a pay phone cellular i could call them you know how much those things cost fifteen minutes doro he pointed out checking his casio and saying sarcastically weve been gone a whole fifteen minutes he leaned closer and she could smell the sweet alcohol on his breath a smell that reminded her of the occasional drunken violence that paul had sometimes brought with him to their bed theyre fine julies perfectly capable youre right she said offering him a fragile smile he nodded and stared out the window she felt sick with anxiety it occurred to her that in a few minutes she could excuse herself to go to the bathroom and use the phone paul would probably never know the champagne bottles white plastic cork rolled noisily at his feet the train clattered past condominiums that reminded her of a monopoly board a few of the couples had dressed for the occasion though most wore jeans and sweatshirts it wasnt exactly the orient express it soon became clear that pauls romance was with the train rather than her flushed cheeks pressed to the glass his right foot tapping quickly as it always did when he drank in excess her husband disappeared into the alcohol and she retreated into thoughts about her children ten minutes passed with minimal conversation doris excused herself and made the call home it rang and rang but there was no answer wrong number she decided at those prices for the first minute each portion of a minute thereafterpaul was certain to catch the charge on the credit card bill but so what she pressed new call she redialed again suffering under the weight of its endless ringing she could envision julie busy with a diaper or in the middle of feeding it didnt necessarily mean trouble a fire she thought pauls home entertainment centera sports center was more like itcrowded the outlets with far too many wires what would julie do in a fire the knot in her stomach twisted more tightly her fingers went cold and numb julie might be in the bathroom nothing more than that but her imagination wouldnt let it go perhaps julie had a boyfriend with her in the house in that case she wouldnt be paying attention to either the kids or the phone doris stole a look around the corner and down the shifting train cars center aisle to the back of her husbands head she had already been gone a few minutes and it would ruin everything if he caught her at the pay phone she had promised him she would wait to call until after dinner she hung up the receiver deciding to slip into the washroom and then try again when she came out but she emerged only to find someone else using the phone ironically a mother happily talking to her children when the woman hung up doris tried again this time the phones endless ringing seemed a kind of punishment for trying at all she glanced up the aisle at paul but now all she could think about was that there was something terrible going on she decided to call her neighbor tina who answered on the second ring doris concentrated on removing any panic from her voice tina its doris i have a really weird favor to ask of you in her mothers heart she knew something was dreadfully wrong chapter hope sprang eternal for lou boldt who lived in a world of innocent or guilty alive or dead where the patrol officers drove cars painted black and white hope rarely surfaced though always lingered teasing and enticing a womans railthin body lay in the hospital bed before him dressed not in the familiar hospital gown but in the pink seersucker he had brought her two weeks before their fifteenth anniversary beneath that gown as well as on the exposed skin not a single hair the chemotherapy had claimed the body fat the hair even any expression of joy from her sunken eyes her alien looks signified either a preparation for death or a rebirth the vomiting and complete lack of energy left boldt with the impression of a woman halfdead despite his hope he placed a do not enteroxygen in use sign on the door to the room a door that he shut tightly before jamming a white towel up against the crack at its base he briefly caught sight of himself in the bathrooms mirror a tired fortytwo thinner than hed been since college tough in the face but kind in the eyes even dressed in his ubiquitous khakis and blue blazer he no longer looked professorial but more like retired militarya dog trainer one friend had laid on him the cop shop lived for such

lymphoma life expectancy three to six months this lodged in boldts throat like a stuck bone the two windows looked out on a parking lot filled with the cars of visitors to the c wardsad people carrying flowers on the way in burdened by tears on the way out boldt parked out there among them he opened both windows compliments of bear he explained to his wife producing a perfectly rolled joint bear berenson a friend of twenty years owned the comedy club jokes on you over on th near stoneway liz smirked a twentyfouryear veteran a homicide cop pushing drugs medication he corrected and im not homicide any longer intelligence she said theres an oxymoron he stood on a chair unsteadily and slipped a glassine bag normally used for evidence collection over the smoke alarm his advancement to lieutenant had necessitated a transfer from homicide in a year or so hed be back and at a higher rank better pay better benefits all made necessary by the mounting bills and loss of her bankers income changeboldts nemesis homicide was home this woman was home home was changing disabling the lavatory smoke alarm can get you thrown off the flight you know roberta had been an alaska airlines flight attendant for eleven years boldt put the finishing touches on his effort and climbed down liz grinned widelya moment boldt lived for she put the joint between her lips saying times like this i miss the jefferson airplane boldt lit it for her and sat between the two beds passing the joint back and forth between the two women roberta smoked greedily and coughed loudly bellowing smoke into the room worrying boldt that he too might get high i dont know why we ever gave this up liz said her eyes bloodshot a wry smile forming god i feel good we had children roberta answered and both women laughed hysterically although boldt missed the humor music liz requested snuffing out the roach and eating it she chased it with a glass of water and smacked her lips some good old rock and roll boldt tuned in a local tv channel that used an oldies fm station as its background music creedence clearwater liz asked for more volume not until all the smoke is out boldt answered use the flower spray in the bathroom roberta suggested cranking up the volume from her remote boldt sprayed the room with an aerosol labeled fields of dreams it smelled chemical not floral he removed the plastic bag as the two women began to sing along with john fogerty their transformation nothing short of miraculous pizza liz hollered over the music pizza roberta echoed followed by a roar of laughter boldt felt gratified by their request hed succeeded he told liz that he would head off for the pizza if she would prep herself for the kids you mean the wig the bald woman asked im already wigged out both women erupted yet again okay okay okay his wife added seeing the frustration on her husbands face im all eyebrows and hair you get the pizza boldt drove into the heart of the udistrict to angelos and bought a medium sausage and mushroom a milk and a pepsi pot smoking and pizza purchaseshe felt transported back to college his concept of time had evolved from an internal clock predictable to within a matter of minutes to where days now stretched on endlessly driven by a doctors prediction of a shortened life span and a husbands prayers for miracles he returned to the c ward to find liz and roberta in hysterics liz had drawn a pair of wire rim glasses around her eyes with eyebrow pencil as well as a marilyn monroe birthmark mole on her cheek boldt made no comment he simply served them the pizza while liz ate her husband erased her spectacles with a face cloth and made an attempt at adding eyebrows to the hairless skin liz was well into her third slice by the time he offered her a hand mirror chewing she nodded approval he then placed her wig on in reverse which caused roberta to spit out some pizza in laughter how much time liz asked sobering slightly realizing that the arrival of her children was imminent ten minutes he answered well ill say one thing at least the pot allows me to smile i want my kids to see me smiling roberta struggled with her own hairpiece boldt offered to help but she declined ive seen your work she teased liz hooked a finger into her husbands belt and pulled him in for a kiss a knock sounded boldt expected the pizza aroma to cover any evidence of the potever the policeman he rose and answered it thinking that nurses and doctors rarely knocked john lamoia stood an inch over six feet with sunken cheeks and a full mustache he dressed like someone in a calvin klein ad lamoia said your pager and cell phone must be off im on private time here boldt reminded lamoia had been on his homicide squad for the last seven years he had taken the sergeants post boldt had vacated intelligence doesnt do oncall john liz called out lamoia stepped in and said hello to both women by name the room no stranger to him he and liz boldt were gin rummy opponents we got the call lamoia said meeting boldts eyes seriously i tried calling you judging by lamoias tone of voice boldt knew which call he meant boldt reminded i dont handle fieldwork the words stung him he missed it badly lamoia had come to exploit that as a favor then lamoia suggested appealing to liz to help with lou she was the one in the hospital but it was her husband who had lost forty pounds and the glint in his eye the desk job was killing him go on lovehumor him liz encouraged what kind of case is it john lamoia started to mumble but did not answer no wife and mother would want her husband the father of her children on such a case wait for me downstairs boldt told his former detective ill wait with you until marina and the kids arrive he told his wife after lamoia had left no need all humor had left the room go she said but boldt stayed five minutes passed in relative silence before liz sat up sharply and boldt recognized the sound of his sons voice approaching you all set boldt asked she nodded faintly squeezed her husbands arm and mouthed the words i love you boldt leaned over and kissed her on the cheek likewise he whispered her cheek felt inhumanly cold chapter john lamoia doubleparked his red camaro in front of st north and set its wide taillights flashing amid a veritable light show of emergency vehicles he sat behind the wheel for a moment gathering his strength any apparent kidnapping automatically evolved into an enormous investigation requiring tact and diligence on the part of the lead investigator and hed been named lead tact was not necessarily lamoias long suit and he knew it his fellow officers called him floorshow what with his creased blue jeans steel gray ostrich boots and rock star hair because of the biga attitude lamoia knew he wore an attitude but to hell with it he was good at what he did people talked about talking the talk but john lamoia talked it hed been the same cocky sonofabitch since junior high he wasnt about to change now boldts beatup departmentissue chevy slipped in behind him and parked this particular kidnappingof a white infantwould stir not only the citys conscience but quite likely the nations before even stepping out of the car at the crime scene lamoia already had a few suspicions about how it had happened but for the moment he pushed them away not for anyone including his ambitious crimes against persons captain sheila hill would lamoia guess at a crimes solution before he could gather the necessary evidence witnesses and facts its my job to make the call he told boldt either i group it with the others or it stands alone domestics and gang killings had occupied his past few monthsgrounders for the most part a serial kidnapping case with national importance he tried not to think of himself as lou boldts replacement even though others saw his promotion that way so why drag me along boldt asked maybe im insecure yeah right and its going to be sunny tomorrow they ducked under the police tape onto the lawn officer jonny filgrim said to lamoia bad guy used the back door detec sergeant he corrected himself its him right keep the vultures back jonny lamoia said indicating the press they want an interview its hill not me mulwrights here back door already lamoia asked he and boldt met eyes in the flashing blues and reds of the emergency lights boldt questioned mulwright at a crime scene early any of his boys lamoia asked the uniformed officer special ops yeah any of mulwrights guys lamoia answered some of the patrolmen were thick as bricks aint seen none filgrim answered there was a woman watching the child boldt said filgrim nodded though seemed bewildered that boldt already knew this the sitter yeah knocked out cold whered they take her university hospital boldt offered lamoia a look they had passed an arriving ambulance on their way out of the hospital lamoia ordered get someone over to the hospital as he took in the chaotic scene of the reporters and cameras at the edge of the property and make sure sid gets room to park their van close by you got it boldt caught him by the arm the baby sitter was unconscious like i said out cold on the kitchen floor its gotta be him right floorshow filgrim said excitedly a kid right i mean weve been expecting this right the parents boldt asked releasing the man mulwright spoke to a neighbor lady shed heard from the parents which is how come she was here she got the other kid other kid a little boy she took him home with her boldt nodded go lamoia ordered filgrim hurried off at a run grabbing his gun to keep it from beating his side lamoia tongued his mustache nervously and said softly ill tell ya i am not calling it until we can rule out a copycat or a coincidence he looked to boldt for help but was met with the blank face of a teacher waiting out his pupil i suppose it is him baby sitter unconscious the kids age is right both parents out of the house even so boldt cautioned i know i know lamoia said nervously where the hell is sid he checked his watch once the lab techs controlled a crime scene the feds would have a hell of a time trying to take over no one in the seattle police department wanted to play second fiddle to the feds an investigations power remained with whoever controlled the evidence lamoia studied the house trying for a moment of calm he then said to boldt youre thinking the baby sitter is by definition also a victim boldt maintained that a victim dead or alive could tell an investigator more than a dozen witnesses but the true victim had been taken from the crime scene the sitter wont remember much boldt cautioned none of the others have so ive got shit to go on youve got a crime scene and the chance for physical evidence a missing victim a hospitalized victim youve got neighbors the possibility of unfamiliar vehicles in the neighborhoodmaybe neighborhood watch boldt listed for the man thats what im saying weve got shit lamoia repeated another patrolman approached name tag read rodriguez these guys were all over him at a crime scene working for brownie points hoping their names would be mentioned to someone that theyd get a shot at something better than driving the streets the advancement to sergeant had made lamoia painfully aware of just how servile these guys could be the female uniforms were a lot less so too bad he raised his index finger to stop rodriguez from interrupting his thoughts he spoke to boldt some asshole comes here to lift a toddler hes got it all planned out right use the back door where no ones gonna see him whack the baby sitter heist the little thumbsucker and make tracks so is he alone or does he have company hed have a wheel man i guess rodriguez answered not you lamoia chided im asking the lieutenant let him answer boldt said you dont need me the two exchanged a look teacher to student rodriguez waited until lamoia nodded approval for him to speak wheel man parked out front where the neighbors can see him lamoia wanted the man to think keeps moving maybe driving around you know until the doer needs him and if theres a sudden problem with their little visit lamoia asked whats the bad guy gonna do make a phone call stand on the curb with his thumb in the air think the patrolman paled how would you do it lamoia asked as boldt had asked of him dozens of times thats what a detective asks himself rodriguez how would i do it i gotta get me inside the house i come on as a plumber or something lamoia looked back toward the house nodding yeah a plumber a fireman a cop hes played them all if hes who we think he is no shit no child boldt supplied i zap the sitter in the kitchen and grab the kid out of the crib rodriguez said getting into it wrap it up in something i suppose i dont know shes not an it boldt corrected harshly shes a fourmonthold baby girl who has been abducted from her home boldt had kids of his own kids lamoia thought of as his own niece and nephew lamoia patted the uniformed officer on the cheek youre excused they found mulwright on the back stoop smoking a nonfilter cigarette he looked about sixty he was fortyone part native american indian part irish with a liver to prove it teeth that looked like a rotted picket fence hit by a truck skin that made enough oil for a refinery black hair and unibrow and five oclock shadow one eye green the other nearly brown like a junkyard dog he held the constant expression of a person who didnt feel well lieutenant boldt said from a distance well look what the fucking dog drug in mulwrights resentment of lamoias assignment to lead the task force was public knowledge the task force itself was the source of much politicking because it had been formed ahead of any kidnapping effectively limiting the fbis powers by assuming that power for itself it was the brainchild of sheila hill captain of crimes against persons who now commanded the task force she had created mulwright was next in line senioritywise but as lieutenant of special operations he was more accustomed to surveillance and busting down doors than conducting an evidencedriven investigation for that reason hill had chosen lamoia whose experience was mainly as a homicide detective as lead investigator which left mulwright with an ambiguous job assignment until and unless they had surveillance to conduct to make matters worse mulwright blamed boldt for ending his twentysevenyear drinking spree which had culminated in suspension and treatment programs rumor had it that the latter had not worked the thick cone of cigarette smoke he blew into the air fairly reeked of resentment who called you to the scene lieutenant boldt asked i got a scanner in the kitchen you you got no business being here you aint got nothing to do with this task force adviser boldt reminded as a division intelligence intimidated some detectives especially those like mulwright who got themselves into trouble im one of the task force links to the bureau it occurred to boldt that mulwright should not have arrived on the scene until after a call from lamoia im also supposed to prevent press leaks is that right lamoia said the national insider is offering two grand for task force information dont know nothing about it so who called it in boldt asked i dont have to answer to you no you dont boldt waited along with the man through several long seconds of silence a neighbor lady mulwright had no fondness for women other than as the objects of obscene humor name of wasserman tina down the street he checked his notesevery detective carried a notebook even mulwright fiftythree hundred fiftyfirst north was asked to check on the place by the mother when the baby sitter failed to answer the phone you ever heard of a dinner train takes off from renton sure lamoia answered yeah well i hadnt the parents are still stuck on the train due back any minute boldt asked does the press know about this neighbor how the fuck should i know do we have someone meeting the parents i put someone with the neighbor that redhead with the big tits you know her motor patrol mckinney lamoia supplied mckinneys with her and whos meeting the parents at the station boldt asked checking his watch dont know mulwright answered lamoia said you did or did not assign someone to pick up the parents this isnt my scene mulwright reminded youre senior officer present lamoia countered are the parents covered or not boldt turned to lamoia what are the chances our kidnapper has someone watching the parents to make sure they dont return unexpectedly lamoia judged the question hesitated then nodded i can see that hed be on the fucking dinner train mulwright answered tossing his cigarette into the grass boldt took note of where it landed the cigarette had contaminated the crime scene mulwrights eyes awakened his face expanding we should have both the train station and the parents under surveillance can we handle that lamoia asked as innocentsounding as possible he agreed with boldts attempt to lead mulwright away from the crime scene few officers despite all the training understood the delicate nature of a crime scene lamoia realized that if mulwright had read the advance briefing papers he would have known the fbi had all but ruled out surveillance by the kidnapperhe was believed to be a solo operator got it mulwright announced standing well watch the station and the train for strays well work out a way to notify the parents were with them well make sure they head straight to the neighbors he asked id how do we id them wait here a moment boldt said leaning his weight against a sapling and slipping on a pair of paper shoe covers he donned a pair of latex gloves and entered the kitchen stepping carefully mulwright or the first officer on the scene had used blue painters tape to indicate the position of the baby sitters body on the floor boldt stayed clear of what looked like red confetti and the medical litter the paramedics had left behind he located a family photo hanging to the side of the kitchen sink it reminded him of his four favorite photos of liz and the kidsthree at home one at the office he suddenly wished that he had more photos of liz in the prime of her healthhe thought of her this way her face full of color her limbs lean but strong he removed the photo from the wall feeling painedhe hated to disturb any evidence no matter its apparent insignificance he renegotiated his way out of the house and handed the framed photo to mulwright if you spot a suspect he said hes better followed than confronted i know the drill boldt ive worked a hell of a lot more hostage situations than you lamoia believed that boldt could probably recite the names of each of those hostages for mulwright if pushed but it wasnt boldts way to throw around his knowledge he hid himself from all but the most intimate friends what times that train arrive boldt asked checking his watch mulwright hurried off calling back to them tell hill were on it lamoia watched him go and said with admiration you knew hed take the bait knew he hadnt read the briefings mulwright is special opstranslated hes a thrill seeker and likes working from the seat of his pants he needs credibility to shore up support after this drinking thing he stays around here he looks bad he goes off on surveillance hes on familiar ground you hosed him pocketing mulwrights discarded cigarette butt boldt said i offered him what he wanted a dignified way out the meet and greet with the parents is important he wants to feel important daphne plays those head games every day maybe shes rubbing off on me i wouldnt mind if she rubbed off on me lamoia said spare me daphne matthews the departments resident psychologist was goodlooking to a fault as an interrogation team few were better than boldt and matthews lamoia and boldt stood just inside the kitchen door studying the litter of the discarded gauze left behind by the medics and the unusual red confetti sprinkled across the floor lamoia snapped his gloves in place whats with the red shit lamoia asked afids boldt answered an air taser not a stun gun air tasers fired a projectile carrying a pair of probes that delivered the devices electrical charge via thin wiresa stun stick capable of being fired from a distance when the projectile cartridge fired the weapon released confettilike id tags called afids first ive heard of it we can assume its need to know boldt suggested in repeat offenses law enforcement never revealed every piece of evidence so as to separate out copycat crimes near the litter was a tangle of thin wire and the probes yeah well i need to know if im going to make the call that its task force jurisdiction flemming knows more about these kidnappings than we do hes got ten children and six months on us if their guys beat us to the evidence if flemming takes control it wont be the worst thing tell that to hill lamoia said thankfully i dont have to thats your job thats what im saying lamoia added and dont forget you end up with shoswitzs desk and youll be reporting to her as well one day at a time boldt said to invoke task force jurisdiction was to invite national attention internal power struggles and regular four oclock meetings with the feds it was all laid out mulwright by showing up had already made the call lamoia sketched the kitchen indicating the litter and the afids she meets him at the back door makes it about five steps and he zaps her boldt said nothing he orbited the spot where the girl had fallen lamoia wrote meaning into boldts silence he studied the blue tape outline and reconsidered his opinion of course it depends if he fried her from the back or the front yes it does if from the back yeah she makes it a couple steps and goes down but if hes over here when he hits her he said moving across the room boldt finished for him she may have let him inside without panicking the girl gets the door shut guy takes a minute to make sure theyre alone and then he zaps her she goes down boldt stood to the side allowing his former detective to think it through lamoia continued the doer starts his search for the infantproviding he doesnt already know which room he looked to boldt for support youre doing a pretty good imitation of marcel marceau over there you dont need me for this john i tried to tell you that so you came along to humor me no to compare what ive read in the briefing papers with what i might see at the actual scene analysis comparison what the bureau has or hasnt included in their briefing material not only tells me about the suspect but about what the bureau wants us to know how a guy like flemming operates he added wheres the little boy all this time glued to a tv maybe boldt allowed hiding in the corner more likely they moved as a pair through the house slowly and carefully as they had at dozens of other crime scenes thing about a death investigation lamoia said its over and done with i mean theres urgency sure but not like this nine kids ten now boldt corrected where the hell is sid lamoia moaned they walked single file through the living room checked the first bedroom for a crib but found it in the second approaching the crib boldt remaining in the doorway lamoia felt a crunch under his shoe hold it he exclaimed stepping back and away fearing he had destroyed possible evidence he dug into the carpet his gloved fingers moving through the nap slowly and carefully and came up with a piece of thick glass the size of a small pearl he held it up toward the ceiling light so that boldt could see it as well thick square cut bluish tint maybe how thick lead crystal maybe or one of those mexican drinking glassesthe blue ones its not window glass not kitchenware he elected to bag it which he didmarking the glassine bag with the date and location foundbut wondered if he would have done so without boldt looking over his shoulder probably nothing he said parents will know if it belongs he realized he worked a crime scene differently with boldt in the room and wondered silently if that was why he had wanted so badly for the man to accompany him you coming in he asked better if i dont keep traffic down until bernie arrives lamoia pocketed the glass and leaned over the crib catching sight of an object lying where little rhonda shotz should have been he felt an ache in the center of this chest beneath his ribs sarge the yellow smudge boldt asked i can see it from hereabout knee height well want bernie to sample it for the lab no in the crib lamoia said leaning back and seeing the smudge of a fine yellow powder on the cribs frame its a penny flute i think one of those dimestorevariety penny flutes well at least that explains how they named him boldt said another convenient detail the feds neglected to share a fucking calling card we wouldnt have shared it either john he added you know just because hill feels competition with the bureau doesnt mean i have to lamoia completed i know that it gets a little contagious though daphne can help you with the penny flute his leaving a calling card presents an entirely different profile baiting taunting it helps explain some of flemmings reticence to share the afids and the penny flute if theyre this guys signatures theyre certainly the angles hes working id wondered how they came up with that handle lamoia said again referring to the fbis nickname his job to make the call lamoia spoke the words that would set into motion one of the highest profile cases in the citys history involving three states and nine missing babies ten lamoia corrected himself staring back into the crib the words came out of his throat stubbornly its the pied piper he said if im not mistaken boldt advised we have visitors captain sheila hills yelling at the media filtered through the walls lamoia confirmed her presence through the window over the long haul police work typically hardened many of its womenlanguage toughened even a womans walk became more angular less gracious but sheila hill was the exception at fortytwo she looked thirtyfive she wore her blonde hair shoulder length and today wore a navy blue sport jacket khaki shirt and a pair of brown corduroy pants her italian loafers gleamed divorced with an eightyearold son named tommy sheila hill still managed to work twelvehour days six sometimes seven days a week no one on the force including lamoia expected her to stop at captain she carried a knowing selfimportance in her posture transforming her five feet six inches into a much taller figure her voice strident and defiant carried through the walls as she addressed the press we have confirmed an apparent kidnapping a missing infant by the name of rhonda shotz the relation of this crime to the nine earlier kidnappings in california and oregon currently being investigated by the fbi is not known at this time so please spare me any such questions youre wasting your breath you can help the parents of this girl and all of us in law enforcement by getting an image or a description of that child in front of the public just as quickly as possible we should have an image for you shortly beyond that its far too early to comment please allow us the room to do our jobs efficiently and i promise you a full press conference in the next six to nine hours thats all people thank you she walked away from the shouting as if unable to hear it sensuous and fluid right toward lamoia sergeant she looked lamoia up and down captain he locked eyes with her lou she addressed boldt while continuing to look at lamoia i asked the lieutenant to join me captain we paged you hill reminded boldt as if it had been her idea not lamoias to include boldt ever the politician i was on private time he explained one of the luxuries of intelligence was its lack of being oncall john chased me down i see she said weighing boldts presence as long as boldt was around lamoia would listen to him regardless of assignments and hill wanted full control you heard me just now she said how much of what i just told that horde is bullshit lamoia knew that boldt would leave it to him to answer the bureau withheld a couple signatures from all of us he added she glanced at boldtintelligence was expected to know everything about anything even fbi investigations we can assume theyve withheld some of those crime scene reports to protect the need to know not all of them he cautioned but some of them he reminded we would have done the same if the fbi had asked she countered no we wouldnt have its a oneway street lieutenant we both know that she pursed her lips lamoia considered them full and luscious lipskissable lips surprisingly void of any age lines afids lamoia said an air taser not a stun stick he carried his own stun stick under the camaros front seat and a penny flute left behind in the crib hes leaving a calling card she exclaimed hes proud of these kidnappings what kind of creature are we dealing with matthews can help there boldt contributed one of those dimestore flutes lamoia said perplexed hill asked incredulously he wants us to connect these kidnappings what the hell is that about she nodded thinking to herself her expression grim shit she mumbled lamoia explained well get the parents permission to trapandtrace the phone get tech services over here to put a tape recorder on the line until flemming confirms the signatures well still hope its not him and that there might be a ransom call the pied piper had yet to request a ransom the suspicions ranged from a child molester to an illegal adoption ring glancing at her watch hill said how long has he had twohour lead lamoia answered thats an eternity her ice blue eyes flickered with worry lamoia reminded dispatch has already notified the airlines rail and bus carriers canadian immigration sheriffs department the ferries two hours shit she filled her chest with a deep breath and exhaled slowly shaking her head shit she glanced around as if the press might be overhearing them she ordered lamoia get in that house and find me a picture i can use if we dont fax that image around we havent got a chance of saving this baby lamoia returned inside and searched in the living room he found a stack of photos showing a tiny baby in the arms and on the breast of her mother any of three closeups in the pile would fax well enough a tiny glowing face with bulging cheeks and clear blue eyes he suddenly felt unbearably cold as he rejoined boldt and hill sids black panel truck pulled up into the space cleared for them hill took the packet of photos from lamoia and leafed through them she said god i hate this job sometimes as a group the three caught up to bernie lofgrin heading toward them the scientific identification divisions director a small man with a beer belly wore thick glasses that grossly enlarged his eyes he walked quickly with stiff legs carrying a large red toolbox at his side that weighed him down and tilted him to his right as a group they spun around and matched pace with him we need it quick but we need it right bernie she told him this time of night and you hit me with cliches tell me something new captain lofgrin quipped i was in the middle of dinner i stepped on this lamoia interrupted reaching out to hand lofgrin the evidence bag may be nothing hill snatched it up for herself held it up closely to her eyes and passed it on to lofgrin i didnt hear about this she complained lofgrin stopped as did lamoia boldt and hill his team of technicians raced past the four of them afids where the body fell boldt added and a calling card in the the cry of tire squelches cut him off as a town car and a black van blocked the narrow residential street boldt had seen the fbis evidence van enough times to recognize it the town car produced two men and a woman get your people to work bernie hill ordered ive got this she announced peeling away and cutting to intercept the feds as lamoia followed hill with his eyes he saw beyond her to a set of six balloons waving in the wind up the street lofgrin asked you coming john flemming hale and kalidja boldt told his former detective at hills request boldt had done background checks on all three this is the wrong place the wrong situation for me he said hill is going to squirrel the moment i need to be able to work with these people well talk later john sure lamoia confirmed still intrigued with what he saw across the street later he called out to lofgrin who hurried on boldt headed to his car he stopped and shook hands with the fbi agents on his way lamoia followed but steered clear of hill and the fbi agents as he approached the officers responsible for crowd control they all noticed him another of those effects of being a sergeant that bothered him as a detective the uniforms had rarely noticed two of the officers anticipating him lifted the yellow police tape and cleared a hole in the gawkersneighbors and policescanner junkies who had nothing better to doand helped him through lamoia walked straight to those balloons and their ribbons stretched tight the small metal realtor sign flapped lightly in the breeze represented by sherry daechmccann daech fenton the sergeant tugged on the balloons tight fresh helium open house tonite it read on a smaller sign if the open house had been the day before the balloons would have sagged by now it meant that the open house had been this same evening out came his notepad if the realtor had kept track of her visitors then the police had possible witnesses coming and going throughout the evening on occasion potential buyers even took photos lamoia finished writing this down closed his eyes and whispered please behind him hill and the fbi agents were marching in lockstep toward the shotz house chapter lamoia toed the cracks in the sidewalk in front of the wasserman home tracing them like veins beneath the skin he felt in no particular hurry to get inside a steady cool breeze blew east out of the olympics and up into the heart of the city daphne matthews arrived in her red honda she deftly parallel parked behind lamoias camaro as staff psychologist matthews was an anomaly within the department she operated on a cerebral plane erudite always choosing her words carefully lamoia guessed that her dark brooding beauty had forced her as a young woman to erect a wall that as an adult she now found difficult to dismantle he found her remote whatever the case her controlled distance and unavailability attracted him just as it did so many others her close friendship with boldt was a matter of departmental history the two had collaborated successfully on several major investigations other rumors surrounded them as well but lamoia discounted these matthews approached him with her game face firmly in place she held a leather briefcase her wrist laden in bracelets that rattled like dull bells whos in there she asked all business lamoia answered father paul mother doris their little boy henry the neighbors the wassermans shes tina dont know his name theyve got kids i think mckinneys inside she wanted full control of the environment well lose mckinney for the time being lets try to get henry moved upstairs with the neighbors i doubt the mother will let him out of her sight but ultimately we want only the shotzes downstairs with us once were settled we offer our sympathies we try to avoid letting them find out that neither of us has kids because we lose rapport there we give them a little background about the task force try to build up their hope their faith in us all this before we ask a single question ill handle it when we reach question time youll take the wheel start all your questions with your eyes toward the floor she acted this out as she explained lifting them slowly as you work into the question punctuated by eye contact as the question is completed soft voice and something new for you john humility there are things you should know she continued for a parent a kidnapping is more difficult to endure than a death we can expect some guilt maybe blame between them they may even blame us they are desperate vulnerable theyll turn to anything anyone that they believe might return their child to them psychics private investigators clergy you name it part of our job is to protect them from this we want their faith in us this is more than likely their first contact with spd beyond a traffic cop this first impression will carry lots of weight as to how much cooperation we get you like to fly by the seat of your pants fine youre great in the box because of that but this is not an interrogation keep reminding yourself of that they are convinced they know nothing that could help us tv movies novels make them expect miracles so we go easy with reality for now we soften them up if we do our jobs properly tonightwe go slowlyby tomorrow theyll be feeding us information even they didnt know they knew we step on the gas too hard she said adjusting to his language and well flood it and it wont restart im with you lieutenant she knew that her senior rank bothered lamoia most psychologists would have been on the civilian payroll she had done the academy carried a weapon and a shield believing one could not consult and advise cops without knowing everything there was to know she said for the record were going to get her back john never mind that the other cities failed that doesnt have to affect us if we start discouraged well never overcome it looking toward the house she said these people have information for us we both know that they doubt it the clock is running if everyone does their joband were part of thatthen by morning that child is back in her crib she glanced over at him believe it save the cheerleader routine for them lieutenant theyre the ones who need it the womanthe mother daphne thoughtlooked a wreck the father was drunk and had been for some time daphne introduced lamoia and herself twice but knew the only thing that registered was their occupation police the mother clung to her threeyearold son like life itself daphne offered her sympathies and the husband burst into tears mumbling apologies to his wife who clearly did not want to hear them the parents had been briefed by mulwright concerning the baby sitters ordeal as the victim of a stun gun and that she had been transferred to the hospital daphne drew this out of the mother regretting she had not had the opportunity to tell them herself and gauge their reactions doris shotz then rambled on about asking her neighbor to check the house for her and the neighbors discovery of the unconscious sitter and little henry who had been found safe hiding in a corner of the kitchen the neighbor had rescued henry phoned the police and had called back the train cars cellular pay phone connecting with doriswhich according to the husband was when all hell broke loose lamoia mentioned the string of kidnappings that had swept up the west coast and that the feds attributed the abductions to a man they had dubbed the pied piper doris shotz said shed heard about the kidnappings but her next words were absorbed in her sobs and lost to both police officers together daphne and lamoia then filled in the blanks the fbis involvement in the investigation the task force headed by spd determining that the husband had purchased the dinnertrain tickets lamoia directed to him do you remember who you told about the dinner train no one he said numbly a coworker a secretary a neighbor no one it was a surprise doro thought we were going to ivars doris shotz nodded you made the arrangements yourself lamoia inquired yeah yeah had the tickets mailed to the shop lamoia checked his pad micro system workshop doro the husband chastised his wife are you listening these other kidnappings they have not gotten one of these kids back he asked lamoia isnt that right lamoia avoided an answer directing himself to the wife can you explain some pieces of broken glass found in front of your daughters crib a drinking glass maybea mirror there was nothing like that when we left the wife replied i cleaned the room just this morning vacuumed daphne asked softly doubting the woman could focus on anything but her missing child lamoia sat forward on the edge of his chair the detective in him smelling hard evidence the pied pipers shoes his pants cuffs his pockets doris shotz mumbled nearly incoherently theres never been any broken glass in rhondas room that carpet was laid a month before she was born thats true the husband responded reaching for his wifes hand if theres glass in that carpet this bastard brought it with him my baby doris shotz pleaded were going to bring her home daphne declared she met eyes with the mother doris shotz did not believe chapter no one knew better than a homicide cop the ability of the human mind to forget not only was lamoia required to locate and interview any potential witness but on occasion such a witness had the potential to blow a case wide open a realtorwhose job requirements included sizing up potential clientsseemed a decent place to invest his energies the doortodoor work conducted by a combination of task force detectives fbi and spd alike had produced little of value if sherry daech had seen anythingsuspicious or notthe night before lamoia needed to interview her immediately memories deteriorated quickly he feared that any attempt to bring her downtown would send the wrong message he did not want attorneys involved a quiet chat in her office seemed more the thing but when his first two attempts to make an appointment failed he placed his third call as a prospective buyer and this time he scored convincing him that sherry daech wanted nothing to do with the police good citizen or not something in the high threes low fours on mercer island if you have anything that fits a secretary returned a call less than thirty minutes later daech would meet him out on mercer in an hour if he had the time lamoia scribbled down an address the house was off an unbearably steep lane that serviced three others and led to a private dock on lake washington lamoia squeezed the red whale through a gauntlet of stone walls that would have sheared a fender off without thinking anything of it and swung a hard left into the tight driveway daffodils blooming in regimented rows like little suns lit the front of the house and cut a hole through the interminable gray of seattle daech presented herself perched on a low garden wall wearing a red mexican skirt a flouncy blouse marked by enormous breasts and the wide warm smile of a woman who knew her business she wore a lot of silver and turquoise on her ears neck and wrists she had blonde hair and if it was dyed it was a pro jobno dark roots it looked like the hair of a surfer girl in her twenties she had smooth unwrinkled skin and if the product of a tuck or two it was again the work of one hell of a razor man as lamoia referred to surgeons she straightened up as the detective swaggered toward her he knew he had a good walk women had been telling him that since junior high that your ride parked up there he asked the hummer business has been good she said not breaking the practiced smile hell of a set of wheels he said lowering his eyes to her chest and then back to the emerald green that sat beneath the warm arcs of darkly penciledor were they dyed eyebrows he smiled back for the first time john he said offering his hand and squeezing hers so that she understood his strength he liked to get things straight right off the top gulf war right the hummer yes hell of a set of wheels he repeated knowing the car cost over two years of pay for him it makes a statement she said honestly he liked that standing smoothing her blouse and skirt until she approved of the contours she added some people respond to that you dont do you not in terms of a persons ride he replied other things i respond to sure nice boots she stabbed quickly and efficiently calling his number some kind of endangered snake or something leading the way toward the front door she let him have two very active cheeks she was no stranger to the stairmaster the woman was a prepared wellconceived package he warned himself to watch out hed have his checkbook out in a minute if he wasnt careful she keyed the front door owners are overseas microsoft paris they have it priced at fivefifteen they bought high a couple years back comps would put it closer to four and a half i dont represent themonly youso i can tell you all this he realized his mistake then and he chastised himself sometimes he was too flip too impressed by his own genius to step back and look at what he was doing boldt was forever on his case lose just a little of the attitude john and maybe theres no one better at what you do he had picked the wrong house he should have manipulated her into the house across the street from the shotzes the visual environment was a great stimulus to memory he tuned her out briefly while debating how to pull the switch on her he could claim poverty the one across from shotz had to be in the twos if that if someone puts a chain saw to those four pines down there then the lake view might justify the low fives she said pointing down the hill she wore fireengine red nail polish it worked with the mexican skirt its a killer view im sure but those trees are our bargaining chip she moved well knew her body she did a slight spin and faced him her skirt still following you single or married she added as an afterthought theyre ostrich theyre expensive dont you mean she played her game right to the edge the hummer is eightyk before the extras thats what you want to know am i right the expressionam i rightwas one his lieutenant shoswitz used all the time it sounded funny coming from a pair of moist red lips single he said she bit the corner of her lip lowered her head demurely and looked out the tops of her eyes at himher little girl look convincing too were going to do some business here john allowing a full grin she asked do you get that feeling i got all sorts of feelings going at the moment he answered she barked a small laugh of surprise maybe he had scored one on her she whisked past him close enough for her skirt to drag on his jeans and make a whispering sound let me show you the rest id like that he added so quickly it sounded as if hed expected the line she stopped at the bottom of the stairs yes you will its dreamy everything youre looking for and more is it built to take it he asked following her up a single guy can kind of put a place to the test oh i think it can handle a guy like you john i think weve got a good match here it was a little too much fun for him to want to spoil things he enjoyed this kind of sparring didnt find much of it anymore maybe hed been pursuing women too young he thought how about you he asked reaching the top landing all those rings a guy cant tell if youre married or not she held up her left hand and examined the assortment of jewelry is that right she said well youd never make much of a detective would you do you see a wedding band anywhere here she held out the hand for him pulled it into a fist and motioned with her index finger for him to follow she walked him to the end of the hall and the splendid elevated view of the lake rings come off you know she threw open the door it was to the master bedroom now this she said returning to her saleswoman voice this is a room you can really sink your teeth into do tell lamoia said wondering if he dare follow her inside the bathroom was marble and large enough to park the camaro she was wearing a good scent warm and suggestive in the close confines it grew stronger what do i call you lamoia asked sherry i keep thinking of the wine you can call me anything you like sweetheart i answer to sherry but i can get used to change real quickly in my line of work you learn to adapt even four and a half is steep for me and to be honest its more house than i need im kind of a bedroom and kitchen guy my needs are small dont underrate yourself and i hadnt considered the bridge traffic which was stupid im thinking maybe i should be looking north of town above fortyfifth didnt i see a sign of yours on fiftysecond fiftyfirst fiftyfirst she sounded disappointed he had just cut her commission in half whats that one going for asking twothirty i think theyll probably get it could we see it take a look this is a steal at fourfifty its worth the offer the spark went out of her eye as if he had pointed out the mole on her neck below her ear which did bother him when he failed to reply to her suggestion she said sure thing today if you have the time well youre the client sweetheart she said her engines running again what works for you works for me lamoia felt awkward turning his back on the shotz residence as he walked up the short front path to the house a white van belonging to komo news was parked out front topped with all kinds of antennae the shotzes had yet to grant interviews thank god for small favors he thought sherry daechs backside kept his attention as she climbed the short steps to the front door you know that kidnapping yesterday she asked as she worked with the realtors combination box to get the key happened right there she turned around to point but saw lamoias badge first and it registered with shock lamoia flipped the badge wallet closed and slipped it into his pants pocket its detective sergeant crimes against persons division homicide you had an open house last night she stammered the house on mercer i tried to make an appointment through your receptionist you little shit she looked him over you come on to me hoping for an interrogation i ought to file a complaint i came on to you because you came on to me is that so because youre an attractive woman he said hoping to annul some of the damage you know how to talk the talk i like that is that so she replied in a more approving tone a finger nervously hooking some of the blonde hair and stashing it behind her left ear the open house was during the time we believe the baby was kidnapped was it the pied piper chances are you may have seen something a car a man so you tricked me is that how you do it every hour that baby is missing means were less likely to return her to her parents there are over thirty of us on this case not one of us has slept in the past seventeen hours i didnt see anything she glanced at the key in her hand you dont want to see this house she realized you little shit god i cant believe this this is my tax dollars at work are you the best weve got detective sergeant he corrected thinking that boldt was the best they had feeling inferior suddenly id like to go inside please shit she said keying the door for him why didnt you just ask but she caught herself realizing he had cops you guys are a different species lamoia followed her inside saying i want you to stand right here for a minute he took her shoulders gently and turned her toward the shotz residence how many times you must have opened this door last night he left his hands on her shoulders which were warm to the touch it was dangerous ground she could file a complaint about his misleading her and the physical contact if mentioned would be difficult to justify to a review board lamoia had a history with the review board and it wasnt all rosy how many people came by to look at the house she stood at an angle facing the shotz residence down the street he could sense her searching her memory he asked can you remember standing here she gave him a faint nod can you glance over the shoulder of those people and see the street beyond ive never done anything like this thats okay he coached are my hands bothering you no not at all you can close your eyes it helps sometimes he leaned around her to steal a peek her eyes were pinched tightly shut the house was all lit up over there i remember that remember more he silently encouraged the baby sitter had confirmed the lights she had turned on as many as she could find she hadnt remembered much else a man wearing goggles at the back dooran exterminator daech pointed an oldmodel wagoneer a white minivan a black sts my hummer an ancient pickup kinda bluegray driveway blue toyota camry the sts and the camry were minethe open house you know your rides he said somewhat disbelieving they could check her recollections against vehicles owned by the residents of the other houses honestly listen this may sound crude sweetheart but you are what you drive when i see someone pull up to an open house first thing i do is look at the car you can judge one hell of a lot by that she added a couple getting out of a foreign car thats got good strong legs for me i pay attention the sts fits that cadillac you know a guy alone climbing out of something american and a couple years old probably just killing time free glass of wine and someone to talk to i get a lot of that maybe hes got enough for the down but im not betting on it if its during a weekday and its a woman maybe a young kid or two in tow a volvo an audi outofstate plates im thinking the wife is out shopping for a home while the hubbys at the office you check the tags im telling you outofstate plates means theyre in a hurrytheyre looking to buy usually a little less concerned about price more concerned about contents kitchen if its a woman men are interested in the living room and the master bedroom women think about closets and tubs the pickup truck or the minivan made sense to him for a person posing as an exterminator a minivan or a panel van lamoia asked trying to keep excitement out of his voice the woman clearly studied her clients and applied her own skewed science to what she observed she was a good witnesssomeone a jury would find believable he couldnt help but jump ahead hope was a detectives only fuel white minivan a mommymobile you know pretty new might have been something printed on the drivers door what a name a business lamoia encouraged listen im not sure about any of this parked where he didnt want to lose her just down the street there she pointed again though this time hesitantly maybe two cars ahead of where youre parked i was just about where you are but not in front of the house the shotz house he clarified she grimaced pretty damn close parking wasnt easy last night a lot easier this time of day lamoia took notes the driver was the driver the kidnapper she blurted out quickly i dont know about any of this he removed his hands from her shoulders take your time she turned around and faced him maybe it wasnt last night hell i see a lot of cars you know the driver you were watching to see who got out he reminded a worker bee i wasnt interested worker bee overalls coveralls you know a worker bee he wasnt there for me i tuned him out lamoia asked her can you describe him i tuned him out she repeated seeming confused whether to answer or not i dont know she said searching his face for the right answer maybe that wasnt last night a quick retreat lamoia had seen it dozens of times almost always in the suburbs people tended to be excited at first by the idea of having witnessed a crime they felt important listened to wanted then it slowly dawned on them that like jury duty police involvement meant a commitment of time and energy lamoia decided to try an end run to play on her apparent tendency to make a show of herself listen if its the publicity youre worried about the tv the paperstheyre likely to swarm a possible witnessthere are precautions we can take we can keep you off the front page he left it hanging there as a carrot her face brightened her finger wormed that curl of hair again no no it isnt that you sounded as if you werent sure about the minivan oh no she corrected im pretty damn sure about that minivan detective and the driver just a worker bee in overalls overalls lamoia repeated jotting it down color description shaking her head she confessed i dont know he pulled up over there and i was thinking housewife until he climbed out then i was thinking what did i care because he was a worker bee and no worker bee is going to pay over two for a home not in my experience oneeightys the ceiling in that market and i dont even list that stuff the only people im interested in at an open house are the ones with that glint in their eyes you know someone shopping someone in a buying mood she looked at lamoia you were shopping when i saw you but it wasnt for a house am i right i understand that now but at the time i saw that car all buffed out like that the boots that hunger in your eyes and i thought i had a live one the minivan windows or a panel truck he thought of little rhonda shotz in the back of that minivan and felt sick windows she winced she wasnt sure listen it was white windows no clue about the windows looking around nervously she said tell me about the tv people who do we contact about that chapter since the birth of her son hayes six months earlier trish weinstein had felt out of synch as if a week or a month had been stolen from her and she had never made up that loss at twentyseven she was feeling tired and old her body had not come back the way she had hoped her stomach still looked like a fivedayold balloon she still couldnt get into her favorite jeansthe standard by which she measured her progress life as a mother was not what shed expected not always the maternally blissful state of joy everyone made it out to be thursdays were her haven a day she eagerly anticipated all week on these days her motherinlaw phyllis weinstein arrived right on time shortly after lunch same schedule every week hello dearie phyllis called out in that slightly condescending tone of hers letting herself in through the back door without knocking first overbearing and protective of her son phyllis weinstein seemed to view trish as little more than a baby factory for furthering the diluted family line as a gentile trish was never going to win the womans full affections she felt toleratedin the worst waybut her son hayes had gained her some unexpected points hi phyllis trish responded belatedly a bit wearily wheres my little hayes phyllis asked pushing past her daughterinlaw without any further attempts at niceties she moved about the small house trish following the woman just couldnt stand still stop talking or avoid mentioning bowel movements just waking up trish explained no matter her own relationship with phyllis it was good for all to have a grandmother around in a voice that grated like bad brakes phyllis admonished dont forget some shower scrub will you sidney says the shower is growing into a rain forest phyllis then turned in time to watch trish blush scarlet at the idea that her husband was reporting her housecleaning abilities to his mother its the climate trish explained with the knowingness of a transplanted californian hang out a fresh towel its damp by evening which though its bad for a lot of things is good for the skin you know trish you could use a little moisturizer around the eyes she winked a little harder and the entire fake lash would have fallen off trish reminded im at the gym til two then the market same as always the older woman said im not stupid you know home at three she reminded heading to the back door glad to be out of there throughout the crunches the leg lifts the treadmill the northwest news station carried updates on the pied piper kidnapping a blondeit had to be dyedrealtor was said to be a possible eyewitness that police and fbi were questioning an adorable picture of the missing child was repeatedly shown and an number superimposed on the screen trish felt godawful for the poor parents the tv reporter said something about thirty thousand children going missing each year though most were over six years old but for trish and the rest of seattle it was only one child that mattered right now and that was rhonda shotz she didnt know what she would do if she ever lost hayes the kidnapper had overcome some teenage baby sitter thank god for phyllis she thought in a rare moment of appreciation she pitied the man who crossed phyllis chapter on friday morning march two days after the shotz kidnapping boldt pulled a chair into his former office cubicle now occupied by lamoia a lesson he said opening a file flemmings people loaned us a look at their report on the afids found at the various crime scenes stolen lamoia guessed but of course boldt answered an entire shipment of the replacement cartridges for the air taser went missing when an eighteenwheeler was hijacked west of chicago two years ago until the first child was kidnapped in san diego the fbi had lost track of it the atf had not three dozen of the cartridges were bought out of las vegas seven months ago using a counterfeit card surprise at a gun shop that dealt blackmarket goods these militia boys love untraceable hardware the atf did some good work the owner of the card was under surveillance by the fbi for three weeks before any questions were asked this cardholder lives in kansas city runs a commercial airconditioning companywife kids the whole number when they get around to questioning him he says that only the one errant charge was ever madesix hundred and changeand this is supported by his formal complaint to the card company but as you and i know its not how a stolen card is typically used so the bureau takes a handoff from atf and grinds this one in with their toes they ran every possible leadtracked this guys movements for a twoyear period his wifes their phone records even ups and fedex histories clean bill of healthhes not connected too bad lamoia said but they have the las vegas connection so they pursue itmaybe they bust the rest of the cartridges and plea bargain information on the three dozen sold together they had two dozen agents on it including a half dozen undercover but did they find the cartridges lamoia asked hills dislike of the federal agencies had infected lamoia no they chased some informationits all in hereconducted maybe twenty interrogations but the cartridges were long gone and not one of the gun dealers was saying to where the bureau now believes that maybe a third of the original shipment made las vegas trail went cold but keep in mind the afids found at each of the ten crime scenes are for cartridges part of that original shipment so cold or not its still a trail to follow lamoia suggested exactly the bureau followed the evidence but lamoia said sharply all too familiar with boldts inflection he considered where boldt might take this and said you would pursue the victim yes and the only real victim in sight is this credit card holder lamoia thought a moment and said they considered him a suspect but never made the jump back to victim they chased the cartridges insteadthe evidence for which no one can fault them but whoever used this guys credit card number had to get it somehow a discarded carbon telephone mail order boldt contributed a waiter at a restaurant any number of cashiers ticketmaster boldt nodded and said random or not they got hold of this guys card number the pied piper made contact directly or indirectly he could have bought it off any of hundreds of counterfeiters who knew the number was valid maybe boldt agreed but theres still a bridge there between the kidnapper and that cardholder and you want me to pursue it lamoia added sarcastically because ive got nothing better to do intelligence doesnt investigate boldt reminded we collect and analyze lamoia mimicked the man making faces and mouthing his words his pager vibrated at his side he held it into the light its message screen carried a string of ten numbers boldt tapped the file and picked it up if you need any specifics ive got this happy to help he stood and left before lamoia could think of a way to beg some investigative work from him he looked back at the pager the time of day told him as much as the page itself an hour before lunch he dialed the first seven numbers an operators voice answered mayflower hotel he hung up fancy digs he thought he had logged nearly fifteen hours of ot since wednesday night one thing about a major crime it made you rich but he had traded sleep for the ot and knew that despite his surface energy he would pay lack of sleep seemed to galvanize him at least for the first three days after that it was all downhill he was in a holding pattern awaiting results from the lab on the broken glassthe penny flute had come up clean boldt had pointed him toward a good chase the credit card doris shotz mother of the abducted child maintained a vigil on the oak bench out in the hallway her young son at her side to pass by her out there made lamoia sick to his stomach his offers of coffee or pop went refused attempts to communicate went unreciprocated she sat there an icon to the task forces incompetence which in turn reminded him of the four oclock meeting the day before thursdays four oclock task force meeting the first of its kind had run about as smoothly as an elementary school play with the fbi and spd in the same room both believing themselves in control the meeting had ended in a confrontation sheila hill lorded over the head of the table passing judgment with her stern facial expressions homicides situation room a glorified conference room wrapped around a large oval table that sat twelve doubled as task force headquarters at the near end behind hill a white board held scribbled notes in colorful markers to hills right a wellworn cork bulletin board adorned with crime scene photographs carried family photos not only of the shotz residence and child but of nine other small and smiling faces matthews and mulwright looked up as a sharp rap on the door announced the entrance of two gray suits and a gray skirt that was occupied by a long and slender pair of dark legs as special agent in charge gary flemming headed the fbis investigation and had done so since the first kidnapping in san diego he had arrived in seattle expecting that he and his team would control any and all kidnapping investigations an opportunity removed by spds advance formation of the task force and sheila hills appointment as its commander flemming had lost the upper hand hill had warned all her subordinates to expect flemming to do everything in his power to regain it a substantial man with ebony skin and a head nearly shaved clean to hide encroaching baldness flemming had a worriedlooking face and bloodshot eyes he sat in the chair immediately to hills left and spoke in a deeply rich voice he made no apology for his late arrival nor did hill for starting without him flemmings reputation preceded him meticulous ambitious firm demanding he got results an astute politician and negotiator flemming not only understood law enforcement politics but had overseen six hostagekidnapping investigations and had never lost a victim he held the highest clearance rate for kidnappings in the bureaus history one listened carefully to his words and looked for hidden content were coming up on fortyeight hours he cautioned he and his victim are long gone from the city by now wed like to help with the glass samples you recovered he informed lamoia who stared back stunned by the mans information and his arrogance you have some pollen as well as i understand it he referred to the yellow smudge boldt had noticed on the crib lamoia didnt know where he got his information but earlier that day the departments lab had ided the yellow powder as pollen genus unknown flemming continued this pollen was found on the childs crib as well as on some carpet fibers your lab obtained from the crime scene he editorialized sarcastically of course i know you were going to share this with us but as i understand it the fibers came off a floor mat from last years tauruswhich according to color schemes should make it a champagnebrown exterior i believe lamoia understood then that flemmings people had already interrogated the shotzes and had made inquiries at the lab all with no one the wiser strangely he did not dislike flemming for this but found himself admiring him flemming continued our lab people would like to review the pollen as well as the taurus fibers asap wed also like to conduct our own interview with this realtor daech quite frankly captain he said addressing sheila hill were a little disappointed we werent included in the first round with daech i have a decent relationship established with daech lamoia informed him im sure you do flemming returned staring him down cop to witness lamoia explained his admiration melting away from what we know of your reputation the linebacker dunkin hale contributed that would be something of a first only mulwright laughed hill cautioned the fbi man thats enough of that shes lamoias witness and shes assisting this investigation for the sake of the investigation hale questioned or for the publicity hill decided youre welcome to the sergeants notes lets leave the witness to him shall we you gangbang her and well lose her the notes will do fine flemming acknowledged having never taken his eyes off lamoia and perhaps the sergeant will allow us to add a few questions to his script for their next session flemming hesitated holding the attention of everyone in the room he said let me be perfectly candid shall i this is my investigation has been since san diego and that first kidnapping task force special crimes unitdress it up however you want make all the claims of ownership you want its not going to affect me sticks and stones as far as im concerned its these kids im worried about not the name tags or the stripes on the sleevesthe kids and its mine not yours he said to hill or yours he said to lamoia mine you play games with meconcealing evidence delaying reportsand youll regret it thats about as clear as i can make it to you and why will you regret it because i dont give a shit about you or your careers ill walk right over you if necessary looking at hill he added destroy you if necessary any one of you all of you any of my people as well and they know this about me hale and kalidja did not so much as blink they know its about the kids and only the kids its about catching this guy and doing whatever it takes to find those kids rant rave scream bitch kickcomplain to whomever you wish washington dci dont care it wont do you a bit of good why because its mine to win or lose and lose is not an option remember this and remember it clearly you are working for me you are working for these kids and i am their guardian angel i am bringing them home and the first person to get in my way the first person to slow me down even a step is going to wish theyd never seen this thing wish theyd never heard of it he met eyes with each person sighed deeply and said ah feels good to get that off my chest daphne matthews spoke in a near whisper thereby commanding everyones attention as if reviewing the fundamentals she said a task force is assembled to facilitate an openminded exchange the fbi can run an investigation without usas we can without them the point the intention of such a task force is to bring us all under one tent she looked at flemming so that we dont double up the lab work to lamoia so we dont monopolize a witness the daily four oclock is our chance as a team to share our progress and our hurdles to communicate to facilitate a more efficient investigation mulwright interrupted they withheld critical information the afids the penny flute lamoia said we would have withheld those as well the lack of team support angered mulwright true to form he had not heard a word of what matthews had to say flemming said i think ive made my position perfectly clear or are there questions dunkin hale a thirtyfiveyearold redheaded jock with an attitude chewed gum violently and wore a thick gold wedding ring on his left hand they didnt make ties to fit necks like his the silk knot stood out like a large thumb protruding from his adams apple his attention remained primarily on flemming a dog awaiting a scrap his loyalty unmistakable flemming informed them we are looking for this taurus he nodded to hale who said were running rental car contractsall contracts made here in the past four days compared against all rentals contracted in the week prior to the portland and san francisco kidnappings credit card comparison model requests its slow going but maybe it kicks a match who informed the press of the hundredthousanddollar reward mulwright challenged the phone number in that release was the task force hot line not an fbi number i noticed which means its us getting a couple hundred calls an hour all of which have to be followed up meaning were out chasing ghost stories while you guys are working real leads is that cooperation lieutenant hill chided although we were in fact blindsided by the reward and the flood of calls it caused let none of us forget that the task force phone number was our idea we asked for this flemming spoke in his low warm voice special agent kalidja is our research expert and our factfinder delegate the problems what every bureaucrat learns early on kay kalidjas parents had immigrated from the caribbean she had lighter skin than flemming and widely set asian eyes bone thin she looked more like a runway model than an fbi agent she wore a starched white shirt and crisp gray suit her tobaccocolored hair was done in corn rows with terracotta beads that clicked if she shook her head quickly she kept her attention on flemming like a benched athlete watching her coach and took her cue her voice was musical her accent vaguely british the moment she spoke she captivated everyone the press release was our doing it is true we have case history to support that an informed public an alert public a motivated public can and does lead to arrests also although there is no apparent direct link between widespread publicity and the abrupt end to the kidnappings in the prior cities its influence cannot be discounted in each case the louder the cry of the press the quicker the kidnapper moved on daphne matthews objected moved on yes but thats all flemming reminded its to our benefit if we keep this guy on the run daphne matthews contested the penny flutes indicate a person intent on making a statement we put him between twentyfive and forty high school graduate at least organizedhe knows what the hell hes doing what comes next most likely scenario he never met his father mother died before he was fifteen hes never known any family if hes using the children sexually then he will have been arrested on similar though lesser offenseshe may or may not have served time if hes selling the children then we can be fairly certain he was an only child and that his mother either sexually abused physically mistreated or abandoned him we have a disturbed but rational individual who suffers no remorse the children are either a form of companywe call it the boo radley syndrome a source of physical pleasure for hima diddler or a means to financial enrichment hes a con artist now wait just a minute flemming said cutting her off this is where you and five of this agencys best criminal behaviorists happen to disagree ms matthews lieutenant she corrected it won a grin from flemming an act that seemed foreign to his face irrespective of your profile our people give great weight to the influence of publicity on the perpetrators behavior hes monitoring the press daphne confirmed i have no argument there but allowing it to dictate his actions hes an organized personality a control freak hes not going to let the news services the fbi or the police run his show there is no consistent thread linking news reporting and his abandoning a city to the contrary the decision seems randomdesigned to keep law enforcement off guard she paused the silence in the room suffocating how thoroughly have you investigated known confidence men con men dunkin hale asked chiding her these are kidnappers flemming focused on daphne clearly interested our man is an actor she explained he enjoys playing roles its the one consistent element to every kidnapping a person doesnt develop such abilities overnight only a con man has such talents forget it hale said rudely his wide neck florid and bulging like a blowfish what we will do flemming answered her calmly ignoring hale and nodding toward kalidja is check for releases from correctional facilities six months and prior the club feds and state minimum security facilities kalidja copied all this down sheila hill spoke up for the first time in several minutes were crossing the fortyeighthour mark a mark none of us wanted to see some of us are preciously low on sleep we need to pull together if were going to be an effective task force judging by his history we have another five to fifteen days before hes back for another one if were not going to work as a task force then lets drop the charade right now issue a joint press release and go to our corners sac flemming she said knowing that with the evidence controlled by spd flemming had little choice flemming looked up and said were in lamoia reviewed all this as he left the office scrawling lunch onto the scheduling board between the numbers and he took the stairs not the elevator an act that had nothing to do with fitness and everything with impatience he had never been a person to wait his motto was this aint no dress rehearsal and he lived accordingly the air heavy with fog delivered a bonecutting chill every persons face advertised their eagerness for spring lamoia charged through this malaise like a beam of light through darkness grinning to himself his long legs stretching out before him in defiant strides to hell with those poor slobsyou either swam with them or against them and lamoia had made his choice a long time ago he jumped a bus and rode it eight blocks and walked the rest of the way to the mayflower a corner hotel with a lot of class the last three digits on his pager referred to the room number codes little games hed been doing this for months an unfamiliar feeling blossomed in the heart of a cynic formerly confused by easy sex and his own silver tongue attracting women had never been a problem for lamoia only staying interested in them he rode them hard put them away wet and rarely returned the first attempt at hand holding or sweet talking and lamoia launched into his litany of excuses only to find himself in a bar or the gym or a coffee shop working his magic all over again the bounce in his step had little to do with the promise of a nooner and everything to do with a light flutter in his chest he didnt tire of this new woman in his life didnt look for ways out of their next encounter as unlikely a match as he might have ever imagined he nonetheless felt an attachment a profound desire a need to spend increasing amounts of time with her the hotel rendezvous was getting old he wanted to share a bed a sunrise a shower a cup of coffee he wanted to test himself to see how real or unreal these feelings actually were he believed he wanted a relationship with heran unthinkable thought given his history he felt terrified to mention this change in himself partly because she remained always at an arms length he hoped like hell that wasnt part of his attraction he rode the elevator to the seventh floor wondering if he was in control or on a leash light headed and slightly afraid the idea of sleeping with the teacher had always appealed to himhe had done so more than oncebut his current arrangement threatened his career not just an a in math he knocked sharply already aroused by expectation the door cracked open and by the time he stepped inside she was nothing more than a terry cloth robe walking away toward the bed then the robe fell away as lamoia helped the door shut and threw the security bar in place he turned to face a black teddy overflowing out the top with soft flesh and tight and bulging where her legs met he hurried out of his crisply pressed jeans every square inch of her was darkly tanned no bikini line whatsoever as she unsnapped the teddy in three short pops leave it he said she enjoyed instruction come and get it she offered though not necessarily in that order she grinned behind eyes flashing with excitement in the bedroom sheila hill put rank aside and willingly took orders the resulting forty minutes of athletics left the thick scent of woman in the air and a sheen on their skin the bedding off the mattress and sheila hill still on all fours her hands holding loosely to the headboard her glistening back heaving from her panting oh god she said deliciously youre going to kill me if we keep this up it would be more fun if we didnt have to leave he risked saying if we could wake up at three in the morning and go again not this lifetime she quipped i like my job besides she added my bed never would have made it through that she let go the headboard and slouched down so that her head found the pillow but her buttocks remained hoisted high in the air with her he found himself in a nearly constant state of arousal he felt seventeen again she lowered herself and stretched out and he wished she would have stayed like that a little longer they cant dictate what we do in our off hours he reminded one of us would be off the task force in a heartbeat flemming would see to that count on it it would look wrong and it would damage both of us weve been over this god she moaned get me a cigarette would you he obeyed though he wondered why no woman had ever ordered him about and the lighter she reminded he didnt like the smoking but he never said anything he climbed off the bed and found her purse and delivered the cigarettes and lighter she rolled over her upperchest rash red and shiny with sweat lit the cigarette and inhaled deeply okay fun is fun and that was fun but weve got work to do she worked the cigarette down hungrily arched her back and lifted her pelvis god youre something she whispered through the smoke a dinner over at your place early to bed but not to sleep whos going to know we start that and it wont stop so he complained whats wrong with that she said soberly we agreed up front about all this john things change this hasnt were attracted to each other we enjoy each others company the sex is out of this worldand i mean that but were both crimes against persons were both on the task force thats conflict of interest thats a nono we are not taking this to the next step not so long as the present situation exists lamoia felt a tightening in his throat and chest and felt almost obliged to break something bernie says the glass chips are automotive she rolled up onto an elbow and cast a knee forward she looked like a model to him despite a few extra pounds he would never get tired of looking at her he had tired so quickly of the others she smiled coyly you got this when he gave her the answer required of him this morning captain she knew immediately that he had received the information ahead of yesterdays four oclock well you little shit she grinned widely i love the way you operate you rogue sonofabitch have i told you that he wanted a different statement of love from her and the comment stung him in a way she wouldnt understand the glass is from a side window not the windshield they picked up some tiny lettering on one of the chips ironically the bureau may be able to help us trace the manufacturer ford taurus no anything else i should know the pollen has been passed along to the botany department at the university for analysis if flemming finds out and grabs the sample theres not much we can do the university needs federal money the bureau can make up all kinds of shit to justify taking the samples flemming doesnt need any justification hes going to do what he likes a seagull cried outside the window lamoia looked up to see a gray and white blur a second echoing cry farther away he wondered about the shotz baby and if she was crying too yeah flemmings little speech she said to herself got to respect him though did you know that he worked that ceo in new jersey found buried alive intelligence dug this up she said meaning boldt lamoia could feel her nervousness he didnt want to operate in flemmings shadow any more than she did consulted hale from the start of thisfrom san diego on theyd worked other kidnappings together didnt bring hale or kalidja on until portland after hed cleaned house a few times she added softly he meant what he said about walking right over us but then again he doesnt know us lamoia had not seen her like thisflemming had knocked the wind out of her not an easy thing to do hale bothers me he confessed hes flemmings hit man hes the one thats going to do the damage if anys done flemming keeps himself squeaky clean knows what hes doing fraternity types were never my favorites hale is ambitious tough hes marriedthe only one of the three of them whos married three kids he must feel these kidnappings as much as boldt and i do yet flemmings the one whos all passionate about the kids protecting his rank is more like it thats not how it felt to me he meant that shit hale made a name for himself with the bureau down in texas by solving some border kidnappingskidsmexican fathers taking their kids away from mom and back across the border i agree that hales the wild card we keep an eye on him and kalidja he asked appreciating the information boldt couldnt dig much up came out of the washington metropolitan field office background in analysis is about all that boldt did find that would imply shes flemmings factchecker but she may be more than that with her ties to washington flemming buys himself a field agent with good contacts at headquarters he gets a spy a liaison with the kind of heat he must be taking that would be invaluable exactly she stubbed out the cigarette in a water glass he said we gotta do something for the motherdoris shotz counseling i dont know she sits outside the fifthfloor door all day long barely moves just sits there we find her kid the rest will take care of itself were not in the baby sitting business she shouldnt be spending so much time with us it doesnt help anyone youre a mother he reminded where would you spend your time she rolled onto her back and put her knees up you want to hear something strange she asked rhetorically that child went missing and i had an incredible urge to have another baby youd think just the opposite you know but not me i wanted a child i could arrange that he said oh no you dont you keep those things on i mean a family a child of our own she didnt say anything for a long long time a nude in a rubens oil he thought round in all the right ways she cast her hair off her face and behind her ear exaggerating her graceful neck spare me your reputation precedes you pal people change people maybe but not men she said believe me i have a divorce to prove it she said we shouldnt be talking about kids not with rhonda shotz out there somewhere probably shouldnt be here at all although i work better when im relaxed and you do relax me you want the shower first no lamoia said edging closer to her i want something else first he ran his hand lightly from her ankle to her pubis and watched her hair stand on end under his touch oh jesus im going to be late for my onethirty she sighed you want me to stop he asked his fingers gently massaging her what do you think she asked separating her legs for him i think youre going to be late for your onethirty he answered he no longer cared about nights with her another half hour would have to do thats absolutely perfect she said leaning her head deeply back into the pillow with a warm smile of satisfaction curling her lips absolutely perfect she arched her back higher and sighed music to his ears chapter accustomed to his wifes bald head and lack of eyebrows boldt decided she looked wise like a buddhist monk not sick like a cancer patient he hated the smell of hospitals its early she said priorities progress the adjacent bed lay empty and made its surrounding tables neat and cleared of anything personal in a ward where people went missing for good the void pulled at boldt had rhonda shotz gone missing for good as well distracted boldt answered five days now precious little to go on weve lost her for the time being worse we know hell strike again in the next few days whats he doing with them he shrugged speculation youre in a sick business with sick people lamoia calls the kidnapped children thumbsuckers one of the feds a guy named hale he calls them milk cartons because their pictures used to be on the sides he saw a dying mother not a sick womanthis happened occasionally you dont need to hear this you could use some sleep she said kindly he couldnt take sympathy coming from her she needed the sleep not him the insomnia having come with the bed rest the bed rest with the treatment the treatment with the disease she refused the pills she gladly accepted his reading to her if and when his schedule allowed which depended on marinas schedule lately everything depended on something nothing stood alone even the grandest of trees anchored itself in the earth did you see the kids at all today she asked in a tone that bordered on accusation he answered with silence for he would never lie to her he devoted every spare minute to his two children but to a mother in a hospital room this would seem like too little she suggested maybe if you drove them to day care instead of marina ill bring them by to see you tomorrow night after dinner he drove them to day care three days a week argument had no place here he and his wife had fallen deeply in love again if only he might be given a second chance can i read to you he asked please he dug around on her cluttered end table looking for the mahfouz novel she had been reading not there here she strained to her right fingers searching her nightgown fell open and he saw the broad freckled skin of her back her ribs showed he didnt know that back it belonged to a different woman he subscribed to the belief that two could solve their individual problems better than one person alone he felt terrified by the thought he might lose her read this liz said handing him a leatherbound bible that boldt had never seen numbered metal tabs marked sections start at seven the text is marked in chalk sight of the bible sent a shiver through him did she sense the end had she spoken with her doctor panic flooded through him anything you want to tell me he asked his voice breaking the bible shaking slightly in his hands number seven she said its marked he fumbled with the book he had ridden this roller coaster for months he wasnt sure how much longer he could endure it he cleared his throat and read aloud his voice warm and resonant she loved his reading voice liz closed her eyes and smiled some things were worth the wait chapter the town car stuck out black and gleaming showroom fresh it was parked out front of boldts home beneath a street light ostentatious and isolated as if none of the other neighborhood cars unwaxed and dull from a winter of rain wanted to socialize with it boldt slowed the chevy as he drove past turned into his drive and pulled to a stop gary flemming sat at the kitchen table with miles on his lap speaking spanish to marina who was doing dishes sarah in an outrigger high chair had a cherub face smeared in pulverized pears caught in the midst of a euphoric laugh marina glanced toward boldt registering disappointment as if hed spoiled the party flemming put down sarahs baby spoonit was boldts joy to feed his daughter in the eveningsand met eyes with boldt who immediately felt uncomfortable in his own home he wished miles would get off the mans lap sensing this flemming eased the boy down to the floor miles ran for boldts leg and attached himself flemming wiped sarahs chin with her bib mr flemming with fbi marina explained eyes to the dishwater yes weve met boldt said a handshake at a crime scene is hardly what i would call an introduction flemming said youll pardon my intrusion but ive seen nothing but hotel rooms and offices for the past six months i thought we should meet boldt motioned reluctantly toward the living room there was something not right about flemming coming here marina stole another glance toward her employer miles clawed to be held boldt hoisted him into his arms stopped at the high chair and took sarah as well standing flemming made the chair look small and the kitchen table like something from a kids set the two men sat across from each other boldt on a couch miles bailed out and went running back to the kitchen boldt held sarah in his arms and cleaned her up with his handkerchief flemmings voice resonated in the small space you know when we looked toward seattle we were quite convinced that you would be behind the wheel of this one its good to be wrong once in a while ive offended you by coming into your home i apologize your housekeeper offered i shouldnt have accepted as i said the hotels surprised is all fresh start sure boldt agreed but he didnt like the individual attention he didnt like this man being in his house at all ten kids six months and few leads youve worked some big cases here worked them successfully i might add thats why we were so convinced this would be yours but its not on paper at least its not my case an intelligence officer at crime scenes i was asked to have a look around thats all my point exactly flemming said and i like to know the players am i a player boldt asked rhetorically finishing with sarahs hands i suppose so but on the bench i doubt im worth your time in the bullpen is more like it flemming corrected third base coach maybe i can see you standing out there waving lamoia toward home hes good youll find that out if you give him a chance you see me as a control freak you are a control freak boldt corrected you made that point at the four oclock from what im told as intelligence officer youve run background checks on me and hale and kalidja anything i can clarify as intelligence officer ive waited for crime scene reports that have never arrived interviews with the parents local cop reports you want to do this alone in a vacuum thats your business special agent you want to look down your nose at us thats your business a pitcher cant win a game all by himself then you like baseball hate it but my cap lieutenant loved the game lived for it softball pal league some city intramural stuff the analogies kind of wear off on you its a great game and your point is taken i have no intention of fighting this battle alone he hesitated before saying i just like to make it clear where i stand and that is where in the corner at the head of the table where i had hoped that you would be lead the cross killer that product tampering thingyou know this kind of pressure theres a difference that you and i understand between being a good cop and doing good work under unusual circumstances between a realtime case and working a dead body boldt didnt want to be grouped with flemming the man was far too sure of himself far too in control for someone with ten kids on his mind he said maybe youre good with that kind of pressure but it crushes the life out of me makes me crazy honestly it does i cant sit around with that kind of pressure on me so i act thats just the way it works with me and me flemming said if you had connected a kidnapping here to one in a small town in the middle of the state what would you have said at the four oclock boldt nodded yeah but i wouldnt stonewall reports if the catcher isnt sending the pitcher signals he cant expect to catch every pitch flemming smiled huge white teeth dark black skin with peachcolored lips it was slightly too friendly for boldt an unwanted intimacy stonewalling you think i think and i have to wonder why we know about the penny flute now the afids whats to hide he nodded let me talk to kay kalidja he smiled again you see you are a part of this one i took that for granted lamoia having been on your squad all those years you have much more influence on this case than you give yourself credit for will you support me sarah arched her back and struggled for a new position boldt held her facing out he leaned and kissed the top of her head he loved the smell of the very top of her head she kicked enjoying the kiss he gave her another i understand you boldt said perhaps better than the others i understand that kind of pressure and i dont envy it flemming stared at him boldt said you came for my advice i think flemming grinned and my advice is to avoid mulwright work with lamoia and trust that we want this as badly as you do sheila hill will be consumed with whose collar it is maybe you are too for all i know but i doubt it and they dont know that about you they think that by trying to control it all you want it all for yourself rather than understanding you just want it done right perhaps you could explain that to them flemming said this was what he had come forboldts support in the trenches it wouldnt do any good youll have to convince them not me we dont have to love each other we just have to work together what you may not know is that this is not some town in the middle of the state this is a good team youve got to work with what you do with it is your decision flemming pulled his substantial weight out of the couch they should have made you lead in spite of your transfer im okay with the way things are boldt said hugging sarah a little tighter sorry about your wife flemming said hope shes better she is boldt said he watched the town car pull away from the curb and drive off he wanted to see it for himself wanted to make sure flemming was gone he checked the kitchen for bugs checked the phone as well he trusted gary flemming about as far as he could throw him chapter trish weinstein had been in the car only fifteen minutes when she felt the first cramps with the initial nauseating wave she knew the gym time was out some months hit her hard she didnt even feel like shopping more than anything she wanted a midol and a hotwater bottle she drove faster than usual eager to be home the nausea worsening a bath maybe phyllis would stay and let her get a short nap in herself in an act impossible for her to later understand or explain trish weinstein headed to the front door not the back the door immediately bumped against something and caught trish looked down to see a pair of hairy bootsuggs phyllis wore uggs she thought not making the connection at first she pushed harder against the door only then realizing she was sliding her motherinlaw across the carpet her cry of terror caught in her throat with sight of the womans foaming mouth and convulsions a heart attack but a heart attack didnt explain the large cardboard box torn open in the living room nor did it explain the door to the nursery being open it was then that her vision collapsed her ears rang and darkness swarmed her she tingled with cold and reached out to steady herself for she had lost her balance she missed the doorknob for which she was aiming and sagged to her knees crawling toward the nursery h a y e s she bellowed chapter on thursday march a hysterical call was received by the emergency communications center at pm announcing that a child was missing and that an older woman needed immediate medical attention an ambulance dispatched from a local fire company arrived at pm followed less than ten minutes later by daphne matthews and john lamoia who intercepted the emt crew as they loaded the stricken woman into the ambulance convulsions the ambulance driver informed lamoia as daphne consoled the parents seizure of some kind stun gun could be i suppose but epilepsy more like been lying there the better part of an hour id guess shes lucky to be alivereal lucky if its epilepsy lamoia mumbled to himself not believing it was a minute later the ambulance charged off im going to follow them daphne announced what i got was that the wife was out for her regular aerobics class and grocery shop motherinlaw watching the kid wife started her period and felt lousy came home finds her baby boy hayes gone motherinlaw down by the front door in convulsions lamoia scribbled it down ill be in touch she said turning toward her car later lamoia called out after her he pulled the front door shut behind him only a few neighbors out on the sidewalk he said to the first officer the first uniform on the scene nice job on keeping this low profile lets see if we cant keep it that way send the neighbors home nice and quietthe woman had a medical problem shes being taken care of no mention of any kidnapping got it the man hurried off the ecc had gotten it right using landline telephones instead of contacting spd dispatch over the radio keeping it away from the media and the curious boldt had written the suggestion up as a memo after the shotz kidnapping the result not a single reporter outside and lamoia had some breathing room he sketched a rough look of the front door area in his notebook including a large empty cardboard box as he did so the crime scene came alive for him with a patrolman shadowing him he walked through the motions and explained man arrives with a package large heavy by the look of it nearly empty in fact convinces the motherinlaw to let him in to put it down does so turns around and zaps her with a taser its all a ruse in case of neighbors inside the box is a smaller oneseen entering with one box leaving with a different one inside the smaller is the kid climbs back into his delivery trucka white minivan im thinking with some kind of delivery name on the sideand is gone no one the wiser you think the patrolman had the stupidity to voice no lamoia barked im telling stories here to entertain you go do something productive theres some phone equipment in the briefcase set it up hayes weinstein might have been kidnapped by a copycat someone who might attempt to ransom the child unaware the pied piper never did so the convulsing motherinlaw told him differently the taser had struck the diaphragm or too close to the heart jarring her nervous system and sending her into the seizures it was the pied piper a sense of failure and guilt stole through himas lead it was his job to stop this bastard he made more sketches of the homes interior and wrote notes to later remind him of what he saw a few minutes later at the door to the empty nursery he announced sharply carpet patrol he and the first officer took to their knees picking at the rug working a grid imposed by lamoia and pictured in his notepad he started too fast too anxious and had to settle himself before beginning again they then moved with caution and no eye on the clock carefully working deep into the nap crumbs pet hairs thread pebblescollected into white paper sandwich bags and labeled with ink this before other shoes arrived contaminating the scene they spent fifteen minutes in the nursery and another ten near the front door sids crime scene van pulled up outside as lamoia reached the front doors threshold he carefully worked the carpet there knowing that shoes flexed as they bridged the gap between the doors threshold and the carpet as his fingers pinched a small hard object he released a grunt of excitement his heart pounding he lifted his find to the light beyond the uniformed officer on hands and knees and took in his prize a small but thick chunk of translucent blue glass daphne used her badge and an implied sense of urgency to secure an empty office at the hospital the hospital reminded her of liz boldt who in turn reminded her of lou who in turn reminded her of her own lover owen adler her hopes and fears cascaded over her as she awaited the weinsteins her life pattern was to immerse herself alternately in work and then a lover then work then another lover she could trace this history in the few tiny worry lines that insinuated themselves at the edges of her eyes a history that had culminated over a year ago in her breaking off her engagement to owen and now he was back the flowers had never stopped although the calls had he had given her the time and space to think things outto feel them outbut never let her fully forget him irises one week lilies the next daffodils peonies never roses which were far too obvious for a man of owens subtleties she had placed the first call and the second she had arranged a reunion dinner for weeks now they had dated and he had never once pushed it past a goodnight kiss even though lately she had wanted him to a selfmade millionaire who haunted the fundraiser circuit daphne had come to accept his money his prestige the publics seeking out his time and funds she could do pearls and black velvet as easily as jeans and birkenstocks footsteps approached and she called herself back to her work effortlessly though did not entirely let go of owen adler and this spoke volumes to her would he ask again or would it be up to her while phyllis weinstein remained with doctors daphne spoke with the husband and wife sidney and trish emphasizing the importance of fresh memory to the recovery of their child over the past two weeks daphne had studied more than fifteen child abductions in preparation for her appointment to the pied piper task force nine were attributed to the pied piper the six others all involved illegal adoption four overseas two in the united states given such short notice she felt as prepared as she could hope to be as it turned out nothing prepared her for sidney weinstein the small man had a predatory look about him average looking made older in appearance by a balding head weinstein sat hunched forward on the edge of his chair his fingers laced together his eyes wide almost bulging the vein in his forehead swollen and popped out like a long pulsing blister dressed in casual clothes his buttondown shirt was soaked through at the armpits his throat and voice tight with venom his wife sat curled in on herself as close to the fetal position as an adult could achieve paste white her tearstained face carried blotches of pink like hives her mouth hung open in a frozen state of disbelief and she stared at daphne with dead unflinching eyes is it him weinstein asked with difficulty clearing his gravelly throat daphne felt willing to allow in him some disdain for the police and for the fbis failure to solve the case but his hostility seemed more deepseated what we know at this time mr weinstein is that your son has gone missing and that your mother she paused to make sure she had it correct has been assaulted most likely during the abduction she paused expecting something back anger resentment impatience the wife remained in shock the husband boiled internally by him i assume youre referring to the pied piper the wife lifted her head sharply a sleeping animal startled damn right i am that bears further investigation bullshit the husband spit out sid the wife chided sharply it isnt something we do sir daphne explained we do not attribute a criminal act to any individual without due cause we treat each crime uniquely your sons included to group his abduction with the other kidnappings would be premature and unfair to hayes to the wife she said i need you both to answer some questions the sooner we get those answers the better our chances of recovering hayes you know exactly who did this the father objected erupting to his feet you let this man into our house what good are you people time daphne said maintaining her calm and poise is working in our favor now every minute wasted every minute lost diminishes those odds directing herself to the father she said you want to make assumptions mr weinstein i dont blame you this could well be the work of the pied piper of course it is and you know it i told you people he blurted i beg your pardon she said ten days ago i told you people that someone was watching our house and you ignored me gave me the runaround ignored me now our son is missing and goddamn it you are to blame this did not have to happen back up daphne said her composure lost ten days ago you told us what exactly what go ask your nineoneone operators for gods sake theyre the ones that screwed me over you actually saw the individual no i didnt say that what then i felt him oh you know that feeling of being watched dont tell me you dont weinstein complained its not like anything else he glanced searchingly between his wife and daphne for support but found little you never told me any of this the wife complained sure i did you told me some kidnapper was watching our house i dont think so a look of discovery swept the wifes face is that what has been bugging you to daphne she explained hes been acting like a nutcase for two weeks returning to her husband she told him i thought you were having an affair however unlikely that is she returned her chin to between her knees daphne said slowly tell me how you knew you were being watched mr weinstein first off there were noises one night i heard them even if she didnt thats when i called you people right outside the house they were someone out there i told the woman who answered send someone but did you she wanted a full description can you imagine im being burglarized and the person who answers wants a description of every sound oh hang on a minute i say to her ill go get my tape recorder it sounds like a burglar i tell her he sought sympathy between them found none she told me a car would do the neighborhood but did i ever see one were you burglarized daphne asked a patrol car may have in fact come by thats a crock of shit and we both know it on any other occasions did you the next time i was in my car i was driving the neighborhood coming home from work two three blocks north i passed a guy getting into his van you know what do you call them a bug sprayer an exterminator daphne answered feeling weak in her stomach this matched daechs information an exterminator weinstein agreed and i swear he was watching me even though he looked away it may sound crazy to you but it doesnt daphne assured him she appreciated witness testimonies and put more faith in them than her colleagues sometimes the content was off but the littlest details right on target and so i called again right same thing from you people was he on my property did he make a verbal threat was there any physical contact he shook his head disgustedly and now this he mumbled the vehicle daphne asked displaying no excitement in her voice a van you said what color van so now you care is that what youre saying you people are too much you know that the color of the van daphne pressed white tell me about the driver she encouraged whats to tell he asked face was covered up goggles one of those mouth things a respirator she supplied yeah and what do i get from the cops questions and here you are again same thing whats any of it matter to hayes a dollar short and a day late is what it is im going to sue you people goddamn it im going to sue you the door was opened by a woman doctor wearing a white lab coat and a grim expression she took in both weinsteins with her sad eyes and slowly shook her head im sorry to have to tell you this she said chapter lou we have a situation daphne shouted frantically as she ran past his office door boldt knew her well enough not to question he left his office at a run and followed her down the stairs two at a time the fifth floor crimes against personshomicideremained his emotional home his time with intelligence required for his advancement felt more like a probationary sentence he guessed two officers going at it a suspect loose a threatened suicidepolice work did strange things to people they reached the entrance to homicide and peered through the safety glass who is that boldt asked seeing a man waving a policeissue mm at a semicircle of a dozen uniformed and plainclothes officers all perfectly still sidney weinstein father of the second child she answered his mother is the homicide we asked him down to view mug shots because he may have had a look at the pied piper her breath fogged the glass this is not good he said you see who i see she asked wish i didnt well behind sidney weinstein and just around the corner dunkin hale and gary flemming there for the four oclock task force meeting observed the chaos boldt signaled the receptionist to admit them weinstein was shouting obscenities and complaints about the incompetence of the police my mother and my child he cried out the receptionist slowly lifted her arm and depressed the button that freed the secured door sidney weinstein hearing the electronic buzzing waved the gun frantically parting the semicircle no one comes in here he shouted its only me daphne announced stepping inside im with lieutenant boldt hes the one who has been looking into those nineoneone calls your grudge is with them sidney not any of these people boldt stepped through behind her knowing nothing of any calls the heavy door closed with a thump distracting weinstein in that instant boldt caught a signal from flemming who pointed to the coffee loungethe glass wall on which weinstein was leaning formerly a copy room the lounge had two doors around the corner from each other flemming intended to reach weinstein through the lounge if boldt could shift the man closer to the door that stood open to weinsteins left daphne continued to work with the man boldt blocking out her words his attention riveted on flemming who gently twisted the doorknob and slipped into the lounge daphne ignored flemming her methods psychological not physical lets think about hayes for a moment she encouraged winning back weinsteins attention she didnt want any mention of his deceased motherthere was still hope for hayes she stepped closer you stay where you are he thundered shaking the gun at her daphne stopped short okay okay lets think about this together sidney okay you are an intelligent man not a criminal if you shoot one of us where does that leave you where does that leave hayes you are going to be shot dead or locked up if you fire that weapon thats what theyll do to you she said indicating the gathering of uniforms and detectives where does that leave hayes hes never coming back not one of those kids has been found are you giving up daphne asked do you want us to give up weinstein strained to make a decision my mother he moaned put down the weapon sidney daphne advised right now the man continued to wave the gun what if hayes right this minute has a weapon aimed at him the same way youre aiming it at us are you going to condone that the weapon bobbed in weinsteins grip his finger dangerously on the trigger daphne took another step forward no boldt hissed at her she motioned boldt away she had spotted flemming and wanted to prevent a violent solution boldt knew that her ambitions could blind her she carried an ugly scar on her neck from an encounter with the cross killer and wore turtlenecks and scarves to cover her mistake she asked weinstein how do you think these people feel with a gun trained at them weinstein swept the crowd with the barrel of the weapon to boldt he looked unpredictable and crazed flemming unseen on hands and knees reappeared briefly at the door nearest weinstein he needed boldt to move weinstein closer boldt edged right threw his hands over his head and said loudly most of us in this room have children mr weinstein i have two miles and sarah weinstein tracked boldt with the gun and in the process shifted slightly closer to flemming you stay where you are daphne glared at boldt angry that he would assist a violent solution yes she said you stay where you are keeping his hands over his head boldt continued to his right maintaining weinsteins attention you see this man daphne asked weinstein gesturing at boldt he has been working around the clock on these kidnappings and now here he is having to deal with you instead is that fair to hayes sidney think about it put the gun down flemming still on all fours again appeared in the doorway to weinsteins left everyone saw him but weinstein whose back remained pressed against the wall youre incompetent all of you the man shouted stop he ordered boldt taking yet another step closer to the door boldt moved with him one final step weinstein tracked him nervously pulled in the same direction flemming looked prepared to spring put the gun down daphne begged not wanting the risk of a physical intervention please sidney for trish for hayes put the gun down now weinsteins face bunched in grief and his shoulders shook he could no longer support the weight of the weapon its barrel sagged toward the floor flemming sprang like a cat chopped the mans arm to the floor dislodging the gun yanked an arm back hard and threw a choke hold onto the man all in one fluid movement he kneed the back of the mans legs dropped him to the floor face down and fell atop him boldt reached them fished under flemming and cuffed weinsteins wrists got him boldt announced check it flemming demanded not letting up the pressure charged with anger a uniformed cop toed the fallen weapon away and retrieved it boldt tugged okay hes cuffed he overheard flemming whisper menacingly into weinsteins ear youre a sonofabitch you know how hard these people are working for you flemming smacked the mans forehead to the floor and then climbed off panting as he stood the room exploded into applause weinstein was hauled off to booking daphne by his side boldt hale and flemming gathered in the coffee lounge hale shook flemmings hand like a player to the coach flemmings black face shined bright with sweat as he met eyes with boldt and said youre thinking i was a little rough with him im thinking youre fast for your size and im grateful for it hed lost control of himself thats something i abhor emotion and reasonits a delicate balance got the better of me for a moment hed flipped out hale said eager to be part of the conversation not that i dont empathize flemming added i can imagine the loss hes suffered a parents grief the guilt who wants to sit on the sidelines i wouldnt and given his historyhaving called nineoneone but to no goodone can hardly blame him for the anger the frustration the rage boldt said you dont settle it with a gun you have children flemming said how would you feel if the situation were reversed how i would feel and what i would do about it are separate matters boldt said are they only if you have reason and emotion balanced and in check flemming explained weinstein didnt once a person loses that balance theres no telling whats going to happen what hell do ive seen it firsthand maybe you have too i even feel that way myself sometimes he said more quietly on the edge like that ive been there hale sounded proud of himself we all have our breaking points boldt agreed weinstein certainly found his boldt realized he and flemming had not broken eye contact since the start of their conversation flemming came off as an intense man he took over without any apparent effort on his part a born leader men like flemming were called thanks for what you did out there the two men shook hands again thanks for moving him toward me we made a pretty good team out there boldt didnt want to think of himself as part of flemmings team he took the stairs back to his own floor considering the line between emotion and reason wondering what it had felt like inside weinsteins mind at that moment of uncontrollable rage and knowing it was not a place he ever wanted to be chapter a sympathetic judge prevented an overnight stay for weinstein in city lockup reducing the charge to reckless endangerment his bail waived weinstein was released on his own recognizance and ordered to appear in two weeks time friday morning march arrived on the back of monsoon rains and wind gusts to fifty knots rain pellets struck public safetys fifthfloor windows sounding like handfuls of gravel forcing those with adjacent desks to shout into their phones morale was low moods sour the task force team sagged the further away from a kidnapping the further away from the hope of recovering the victim john lamoia slept three hours showered changed clothes and returned to public safety in a pair of unpressed blue jeans making himself as noticeable as if hed set himself afire after three consecutive lattes he felt as if someone had sewn a string through his scalp and was tugging hard in poorly timed jerks two missing kids and a dead grandmother the shit was well through the fan and it was sticking to him he had long since learned from boldt that in police work one expected the unexpected he thought he had had about all he could take again he was proved wrong detective bobbie gaynes marched stridently toward lamoias upholstered office cubicle her shoulders arched forward as if fighting a wind or climbing a long hill small and strong gaynes had short brown hair and hands like a man homicides first female detectiveboldts protegeegaynes was known for thoroughness punctuality and professionalism lamoia had no desire to meet with her he had assigned her an accidental death in fremont a case he wanted closed and out of the way allowing him and his squad to focus on the pied piper he had assigned her the case thinking she could clear it without his involvement he had his own dead body nowhe didnt want hers i dont want this right now he groaned raising his hands like a traffic cop to stop her oh yes you do she informed him obstinately coming to a breathless stop like lamoia gaynes took the stairs most of the time not the elevator she was smallchested and firm carrying twice the strength her looks suggested this will have you changing your shorts its so good from the mouths of babes he unwound the string from the paper button that sealed the heavy manila envelope she delivered and withdrew the contents a lab prelim he asked incredulously and i was hoping for eightbyten glossies of first avenue strippers this is better believe me tossing the folder aside he said you want to give me the cliff notes he caught himself using a boldt line and wondered how much of his job he did on autopilot and how much was he himself this socalled accidental death she reminded the belly flop in the tub with the crushed windpipe name of anderson white male midforties first officers report had it down as an accident dont do this to me lamoia said just clear the thing would you so i do the scene search the guys crib make the sketches hit the neighbors the usual dime tour hes neat and tidy a woman notices that hes got a tshirt folded up under his pillow for crying out loud everything in its place hes found by a neighbor face down in the tub the idea is hes taking a shower slips and does the funky chicken busted neck it happens sureto eightyyearolds this guys midforties it happens lamoia encouraged people slip in the tub thing is prince charming is wearing a rug in the shower and thats not right could have been a bath a quickie at that keeps his wig on pulls the plug stands up and gets the blue meanies goes down hard whats the big deal no no its not like that the shower was running when they found him didnt i say that neighbor in the next apartment got curious it was a shower not a bath and if its a shower then he should have had the hairpiece on the little styrofoam head over by the sink that rug being up on the chrome dome does not make sense clear the case bobsie you got nothing he knew the nickname bothered her he hoped it might rid him of her im just warming up here she announced you think id bother my sergeant with a toupee she crossed her arms just be glad you sent a woman to this one im thrilled cant you see he forced a yawn the stiffs clothes are in a messy pile on the floorthis anally neat guy right worse six pair of laced shoes in the closet every single one with the laces untied but the shoes found in the bathroom the ones he was apparently wearing prior to his shower the laces are found tied tugged off the foot that goes straight to behavior that can be taken to the bank shoelaces come on detective listen this is the circumstantial stuff it just gets my juices going right gets me looking around the smoking gun is in the hamper where i find a pair of khakis stained yellow around the knees knee height as in the shotzes crib she leaned over him and tapped the lab report he had chosen not to read yellow as in pollen lamoia shook his head to clear it and replayed her words inside his head she spoke deliberately slowly the yellow smudge on the cribpollenwas at knee height the taurus carpet fibers vacuumed from the nursery also contained pollen she crossed her arms you still want me to clear this one sergeant lay off she wasnt the only one teasing him about his promotion she had turned up a possible link to the shotz kidnapping he couldnt ignore it even if he wanted to she explained lofgrin worked the shotz evidence samantha hiller worked andersons two different techs same result yellow pollen weve got to pursue it her eyes sparkled lamoia missed that feeling he pushed back his chair faced her and said reluctantly who is he she was pretty when she smiled he has a pretty long sheet trespass couple counts of invasion of privacytapping phone lines snapping polaroids a private dick lamoia guessed but without the license i checked boldt might know lamoia suggested intelligence had files on everyone i thought you werent interested in anderson she crowed put a sock in it were going upstairs hes a camera for hire boldt informed them studying his computer screen or he was lowrent surveillance the husband doing the secretary the wife doing the tennis pro maybe run some drug or gambling money if hes desperate for rent maybe use a baseball bat if the pays good enough and im not talking softball hes small change a troublemaker a bottom feeder good riddance lamoia said is he was he the pied piper gaynes inquired is that possible she had briefed boldt on the pollen connection he scowled hes trash bobbie a sucker fish a local room temperature iq hes not capable of something like this the pollen is a coincidence gaynes asked knowing boldt hated the word lamoia tossed out what if the pied piper hires lowrent guys to do his legwork once its done he clips em the suggestion won boldts interest not the actual abduction boldt protested some of the advance work maybe weve seen stranger things i suppose gaynes suggested they arrange a meeting and both come away carrying pollen the pied piper carries it to the crib anderson leaves it in the hamper why not circumstantial but its still a direct link between the shotz kidnapping and this vic one of those coincidences my former sergeant told me never to accept she glared at boldt and one we must pursue boldt agreed we need the source of that pollen he reminded lamoia a garden near the shotzes a commercial nursery a rendezvous between the pied piper and anderson as bobbie suggested maybe this pollen gives us the pipers location he continued no matter what its worth pursuing he asked her autopsy when they can get to it she answered several days at least ill push dixie boldt said dr ronald dixon was one of boldts few close friends you two have a minute to brainstorm this they nodded okay bobbies right about not taking the hairpiece into the shower lamoia jumped in so the doer smokes him missed the hairpiece strips him naked and leaves him in the tub for us to find gaynes said in stripping him he leaves the shoes tied doesnt notice that anderson is the neat and tidy type he leaves the clothes in a pile lamoia spoke excitedly lets say they didnt meet until andersons crib its anderson with this pollen on him the piper does anderson gets the pollen all over himself and the rule of mutual exchange leaves it on the crib and the floor mat of his taurus boldt cautioned possible but the pollen is on the knees of andersons pants in the hamper he said checking with gaynes who nodded and the smudge on the crib is at knee height could mutual exchange explain that more likely anderson and the piper were in the same garden or nursery or field but no matter what we need a second look at andersons apartment gaynes interrupted lamoia didnt want boldt running his investigation advice was one thing taking control another he spoke quickly sarge checks his snitches for any word about anderson on the street you he said to gaynes sit in on dixies autopsy cause of death is critical here lamoia ignored her attempt to interrupt i chat up bernie lofgrin and ask for some comparison microscopy on the pollen hoping pollen a matches pollen b sid returns to andersons for a more thorough pass you know why i love this shit sarge he asked boldt rhetorically not pausing weve got ourselves some lunch meat a bag in the fridge a toetagger a good old naked stiff hairpiece and all a body he felt elated so shoot me he said catching gayness disapproving expression i love dead bodies ill take a bloody crime scene over a missing baby any day of the week youve still got two missing babies boldt reminded the dead body is bobbies shes lead on it and i happen to be free at the moment he stood and offered gaynes an expression that asked if she were ready to go she nodded sid can do andersons again but it needs a detectives eye first foul ball lamoia complained searching for some support boldt said slowly your job is to deliver all this to the task force our job is to keep you from making a fool of yourself and make sure its worth it well get back to you gaynes said proud as a peacock lamoia grimaced at her he felt as if his head were in a vice he checked his watch hayes weinstein had been missing for twentytwo hours rhonda shotz for ten days shit lamoia said chapter andersons apartment occupied the left half of a s clapboard that had been converted to a duplex situated behind a video store it shared space with a jc penney catalog outlet the potholed alley leading into it was partially buried in fastfood litter and soggy newsprint and smelled of cats reaching the mouth of the alley boldt grabbed the elbow of bobbie gaynes and stopped her he listened hard and then looked around studying every crack and crevice the sun would be up for another few hours but wedged between two towering brick walls the alley was in the midst of an artificial twilight boldt looked around his unease contagious okay he said though unsure hed been out of the field too long they walked on andersons bangedup door had three keyholes at varying heights and a dayglo police sticker laid across the doorjamb sealing it they both donned latex gloves boldt felt a rush of satisfaction a crime scene at the same time he experienced a pang for the two missing kids if anything ever happened to miles and sarah he didnt blame weinstein for breaking no one could gaynes slit the police sticker and keyed the top and bottom locks as she told him its a walkup to the kitchen and living room another flight up to the bedroom and bath boldt noticed the home security panel immediately you said the neighbor found him she shut the door behind them locked one of the dead bolts and switched on the light the walls needed paint the stairs some new treads a bare bulb hung high over the stairwell too bright for the small space it obscured the top of the stairs climbing she said neighbor hears the shower running pounds on the wall gives up goes to the front door locked she stopped on the stairs and looked back at him quizzically or maybe impressed she turned and continued up right tried the fire escape next boldt guessed right bathroom window saw him in the tub called nineeleven there was another door at the top of the stairs that could be deadbolted anticipating him she said this one was not locked when the first officer arrived front door was opened by the landlord tried it the neighbor called him at the request of the nineeleven operator she explained landlord couldnt get in new locks and more of them locksmith did the work the security alarm boldt asked entering a small room that shared the kitchen gaynes pushed past him is there one hadnt noticed to be truthful and the bathroom shade neighbor explained that one it was pulled down but with an eye to one edge you can pick up a reflection of the tub in the mirror i tried it its legit but the alarm was off i guess so must have been she considered this as boldt walked slowly around the crowded sitting room television rack of electronics desk computer telephone printer two yardsale chairs two metal file cabinets different makes and colors but he was home boldt studied the rooms ceiling and walls a motion sensor high in the far corner shades and extra thick curtains on the windows a heat alarm in the kitchen installed the security stuff himself i bet he bent over and yanked up a cheap throw rug put it back down and pulled up another by the top of the stairs whats that she asked seeing what he had discovered pressure switch you step on the rug and it trips the alarm same as a motion detector he moved on checking the interior of a small pantry whats up she asked he didnt answer it wasnt what he was looking for an upstairs closet he asked yeah he stopped at the bottom of the stairway which was a tight turn to the left he stooped and eyed it carefully again the overhead stairway light was twice the wattage it needed to be again it obscured ones vision of the top of the stairs another motion detector directly overhead the guy was careful boldt allowed a guy like this probably made more than a few people mad or broke or both you think about it he considered aloud no shortage of enemies i know it doesnt help our case any she said discouraged pressure pads under his carpets i tell you what i arm that security system whenever im home anyone tries to sneak in on me i know about it boldt asked her to walk on the outer edges of the carpeted stairs they ascended awkwardly the upstairs floor plan nearly mirrored the second story the bathroom over the kitchen the bedroom over the living room the closet space stacked vertically boldt headed directly to the closet while gaynes called out to him that the bathroom was the other room he didnt answer he opened the closet door and studied what he saw what are you doing she asked you checked this sure and what did you find a cedarlined closet she answered clothes shoes sweaters telephone what are you talking about he pushed some hanging clothes out of the way and pointed down the rear wall of the closet showing her the phone what the hell sarge his promotion clearly didnt register with anyone but the bookkeeper none of those who had served under him were going to call him lieutenant you notice the closet door he pointed two interior dead bolts top and bottom a telephone behind the cedar youll find sheet metal at the very least plate steel if he had the bucks and somewhere in here boldt pushed the clothes around but didnt see what he was looking for he dropped to his knees and clawed at the carpet the far corner came up beneath it a piece of particleboard had been cut out of the subfloor he hooked a finger into the joint and lifted my god gaynes said on her knees alongside him inside was a glock mm and three loaded magazines headlamp batteries and a variety of uglylooking grenades grenades probably phosphorus and stun grenades its his safe room a phone line to the outside hardened walls lots of weapons a place to hide if the boogeyman shows up well want to catalog it all get it down to property sorry i missed this she apologized back in the bedroom boldt explained i know his type thats why i say the security would have been armed once he was inside he gave people trouble at his level that could mean some vicious reprisals the alarm should have been armed it was at some point i dont get it by the time we responded the alarm was off he reminded testing her her face knotted in concentration front door was found locked boldt added with gaynes as his shadow they moved over to the door to the bathroom and boldt leaned his head in not stepping inside the clothes you found on the floor here did he have possessions in his pockets change pens wallet yes she spoke as a student to the teacher but we dont necessarily accept that the dead guy put them there no we dont boldt agreed still not venturing inside the small room wheres his stuff personal possessions the contents of his pants were bagged along with the clothes themselves keys i could call in she offered have somebody check for me call it in boldt advised number of keys and make especially yale how many yale keys whats up anyway boldt looked around the bathroom once more and then met eyes with gaynes mr anderson had a visitor a very smart very careful visitor boldt ate a piece of cheddar cheese he found in andersons refrigerator was just going to go to waste dead mans cheese eaten wearing latex gloves he followed it with some triscuits from an overhead cabinet and a warm up he sat at the kitchen counter snacking while gaynes watched him her ear to the phone awaiting an answer you could use the weight she said grief diet he told her that made him check his watch and think about his son his daughter and his wife lying in that hospital bed the crackers helped ease the pain in his belly hed had ulcers there wasnt anything new under the sun gaynes mumbled thanks into the phone and hung up eleven keys two were yale two boldt stated he nodded okay then thats it sarge i dont mean to be the front door he told her just to make sure youd better check it he grabbed another handful of triscuits ill finish my lunch if you dont mind gaynes maintained her curious expression she had a pleasant boyish face they had built a history together she had worked undercover for him on the cross killer case and had impressed him with her nerve and good instincts she didnt demand the spotlight she reminded him of himself a cop who wanted the challenge of difficult work the lure of homicide she headed back down to check the locks when she returned hurrying she announced all three are yale top of the stairs is an omni you caught that on the way in didnt you had to make sure he said and thanked her for the legwork he put the crackers away washed off his gloved fingers so she announced loudly nervously after a long silence so someone comes to the front door boldt said moving from the kitchen toward the stairs our boy checks it out he walked over to the television remote turned on the tv and began to surf the channels gaynes looked confused and anxious after thirtyfour channels he hit gray sparkles and continued on into the sixties mumbling its here somewhere got to be he then keyed in the tv screen showed a fisheye blackandwhite image of the area outside andersons door no way gaynes groaned impressed boldt said he concealed it behind that row of mirrors over the front door did you catch those i feel like i should go back to the academy just lucky right she replied sarcastically he continued with his theory presumably he liked what he saw approved of whomever was standing there he asked her do you know home electronics a little check that mess for an extra vcr if im james bond anderson i run a twentyfourhour video loop of all the action at my front door she was on it immediately checking the gear two vcrs she confirmed glancing back at him as if he were some kind of specter ones running im telling you just lucky i know these guys youre freaking me out here sarge the tapes long erased itself by now no use to us but still lets log it as evidence and you take it home with you and play with your fast forward button watch it all the way through just to cover our bases she turned off the machine and popped the tape she made a note in her spiral notebook and boldt signed alongside as a witness he goes down to answer the door boldt walked down the stairs followed by gaynes close on his heels turns off the security and greets the person at the door he locks back up but does not arm the system and the two go upstairs he turned and motioned gaynes upstairs guests first hes not going to give anyone his back gaynes preceded him up in the sitting area boldt motioned her into a chair he said maybe this guy accepts the chair maybe not probably they know each other well enough for anderson to be relaxed i wonder big mistake as it turns out what you look for when you and dixie have got him on the butcher block is lividity consistent with some kind of choke hold or strangulation toxins poisons and make sure dixie works the earwax that is extremely important earwax she mumbled he turned his back on her at some point he made the mistake of offering his back she looked down at the floor as if seeing the body there she returned to the carpeted stairs and squatted as boldt had earlier she said dragged up the stairs you can see it in the nap of the carpet the visitor is strong enough to haul him up the stairs if i hadnt worked with you before hold the compliments this is all smoke no real proof this is amazing is what it is she said you saw that earlier she said pointing up the stairs the nap of the carpet yes i did i didnt even look he shrugged victims talk if you listen undresses him stages the shower she thought a minute ill be damned she exclaimed when she understood takes one of the three keys off andersons key chain and locks the front door boldt agreed nodding basic to the ruse the place has to be locked up tight and anderson found alone dead from a nasty slip whos going to investigate that but the security is not on thats what tipped you she showed boldt to the clothes hamper this is where i found the pants youll want to see em covered in that yellow pollen sargeat the knees im talking about theyre lousy with the stuff he said it makes anderson important to us its good work bobbie we can only make an extremely circumstantial case thats all if were right then were up against someone whos thinking he assumed we would not check for the door key he understood that the door being locked was crucial that kind of guy scares me we certainly have enough to investigate this we need to bring in sid again photograph everything maybe bernie and his boy wonders can turn up something useful carpets phone records and finances if we find them we give it a shakedown something falls out we run with it boldt nodded unanswered questions all around him a part of him hadnt felt this good in ages but he ached for those missing babies and their parents who had to endure another night without them chapter several hours later boldt was paged by lamoia while on his way to the university hospital making the visit with liz brief but memorable she had natural color in her cheeks light in her eyes and warm hands she called him over to sit on her bed and announced proudly im coming home he felt a pang of hope tears you can go back to being an outpatient the doctors will tell you its the drugs but i know better she looked over at the bible and next to it a copy of a religious textbook he gasped liz dont keep that comment to yourself until we have a chance to talk about it the chemo took thats all that isnt all she objected that isnt any of it but dont do this now lets wait til im home okay tomorrow or sunday at the latest he squeezed her hand thrilled and troubled we need to talk about this we will let me get home first he nodded then he saw a look he knew too well dr woods approves doesnt she of your going home a resonating fear penetrated through him she was giving up on treatment dr woods is somewhat baffled by my improvement love she would like to hold me for observation improvement he said skeptically my count is down significantly katherine cant explain such a quick change but i can and i dont need observation love i need to go home to you the children home the work that needs to be done is better done there the work youre scaring me speaking like a transylvanian she mimicked it vill all be revealed to you in time and then she smiled a smile that could have filled a stadium with light or a cathedral with warmth a smile that had nothing to do with illness a smile that came from a liz before their marriage their children their trials a smile that convinced him that she knew what was best ill be damned he whispered no you wont she said a different allknowing smile taking its place lamoia appeared disheveled and tense first hail then rain im getting a little sick of this bobbie gaynes on the other hand looked positively radiant what did i miss boldt asked the fifth floor was near empty lamoia said sid discovered a callerid box at andersons gaynes declared enthusiastically the callerid unit kept a record of the last ninetynine calls made to andersons apartment she repeated every incoming call technology is a beautiful thing lamoia said gaynes handed boldt a list of the calls these are the last thirty incoming calls were thinking maybe his visitor might have paid anderson the courtesy of an advance phone call before coming over if so it might be the pied piper if the two had a relationship and boldt asked handling the pages what do we have lamoia explained the guy had an obvious network going look at all the pay phones nine of the last thirty calls he got both detectives looked up at boldt simultaneously with wanting expressions oh i get it boldt said its your field lieutenant lamoia fired back with emphasis on the rank wed like to talk to all the people who called anderson including whoever used these pay phones gaynes said maybe we find out why both anderson and the shotz crime scene had pollen all over them no no no boldt cautioned sarge its a homicide gaynes pleaded a homicide that ties directly to the pied piper investigation through that pollen match you want me to run the pay phone numbers for you boldt said scanning the list and see if anderson was running any of our snitches a number jumped off the page at him as he said this he concealed his reaction by forcing a cough the number belonged to one of his more reliable snitches the pay phone in a tittie bar by the airport the air strip he tallied the number of its appearances three calls all just prior to andersons demise sarge lamoia asked its nothing boldt answered intelligence operated in its own sphere the squad worked autonomously gathering its information creating its files running its snitches from fivehundredanight call girls to mayoral aides boldt had to protect the identity of his snitches even from his own detectives let me work with this boldt said sarge lamoia inquired noticing the change of voice ill run the phone numbers for you be thankful for small favors sarge gaynes asked in an equally accusatory tone she exchanged looks with lamoia then back to boldt were on the same team here right ill run em for you boldt repeated a little more sternly both excitement and concern competing inside him along with the secrecy the moment required of him ill handle it lamoia said something else but boldt didnt hear he was thinking about his snitch raymond and why the hell the man might repeatedly have been calling a chump like anderson a few days before the mans murder chapter the air strips facade glowed peptobismol pink with a metal awning that proclaimed in chipped lettering live girlsall nude boldt had never seen a sign advertising dead ones he stepped inside faced with a potbellied doorman wearing a tuxedo tshirt black leather army boots dark shades and a hoop earring the doorman said to boldt fivebuck cover twodrink minimum boldts first reaction was to offer his gold badge but he owed it to raymond to keep his identity as a cop hidden he paid the five tina turner blared from the enormous speakers about wanting his love the doorman said enjoy yourself boldt stepped in overwhelmed by the smoke and smell of salty flesh there were fifteen or twenty men scattered among twice that many tables most wore business suits or sport coats their ties loosened the air held a low cloud of cigarette and cigar smoke salesmen boldt figured regulars a couple nights a week a couple nights a month in the dark shadows to boldts right a pair of young women moved like painted horses on a carousel as they lapdanced for two sets of legs and two pair of hands that gripped the arms of the chairs like a strong wind was blowing to boldts left a girl in her late teens stood with her hands on her hips her young breasts bare her crotch barely within a sequined gstring rocking her pelvis in time to the pounding music throwing her brown hair forward like a curtain of water she hooked her thumbs into the gstring intent to remove it and boldt looked straight ahead to the bored bartender and his gaggle of barflies coming into raymonds bar was a blatant violation of their agreement the mana darkly handsome latinosat at a stool at the far end leaning against the wall he wore mirrored sunglasses that fit his face like swimming goggles trained onto boldt as he closed the distance and perched on an aluminum stool next to the man boldt ordered a ginger ale winning a snort from the bartender and a comment that the first two cost five bucks no matter what you ordered and you had to order two boldt changed his order to a up this is not cool man raymond said in as much of a hush as he could manage over the music very uncool you think shes eighteen boldt asked of the woman writhing against a vertical bar on stage no clue man nice jugs and trim thats all the man cares about you dont see no drivers license on her do you raymond enjoyed his own jokes what you gonna pull her over for speeding up your ticker man he lit a cigarette a guy your age she probably gives you a woodie dont do nothing for me how about we take it outside boldt asked dude raymond called out to the bartender who glanced over we gonna party for a minute behind the curtains dont bother the girls damn you raymond led boldt through a pair of velvet curtains through a door and into a brightly lit area where three barebreasted women were in the process of applying too much makeup two shared a joint the other chewed gum they walked past the women boldt careful not to brush up against a bare back all three seemed fascinated with boldts attempts not to look heat one of the youngest asked eyeing boldt raymond said get real like im gonna bring heat on you this here is my man we gonna hang back in the coatrack for a minute or two the coatrack was a wardrobe area sequins boas spike heels hats of every description and a variety of props including rubber snakes dildoes a saddle and stuffed animals that smell of cigarettes and sour skin was concentrated here like opening a leftover container kept too long in the refrigerator raymond found them both inverted milk crates and they sat down this sucks man had to happen you didnt answer my page one page i was busy so am i it couldnt wait they entered a staring contest boldt won this is bullshit weve got a guy who slipped in his tub and ate his teeth probably didnt use one of those rubber mats you know raymond looked to be in his midtwenties he was thirtynine in another era he would have been called a dandy he dressed sharp and greased back his hair into a ducktail so that his chocolatebrown eyes appeared to come right out of his face like a pair of dark olives his teeth were too white to be real and his smile approached an icy glee that warned of a stiletto or a piece hidden somewhere on his person his pants were so tight that boldt took them as explanation of the mans unusually constricted voice you and i are supposed to have a warm rapport raymond raymoan a nice fuzzy relationship free of surprises for either of us boldt allowed the comment to hang in the thick air now ive got to wonder if i can still trust you because if i cant your name comes out of my book and the cash stops coming your way we get off the bus at the next corner know what i mean wait one damn minute raymond protested what the hell you talking about the dead guy in the bathtub went by the name of andy anderson boldt watched for a response and won it never heard of him raymond knew to stay clear of a dead body you called him three times in the past ten days and you never heard of him im the one that never heard about him and im not happy about that now hes in the fridge downtown wearing nothing but a string around his big toe and my homicide friends come and tell me you two were chummy right before he slipped hey man this the first i heard about him going down swear to god way theyre thinkingmy friends in homicidemaybe someone put a bar of soap under his feet kind of helped things along you know dont look at me man im not looking raymond but i am listening im the guy keeping homicide off your case for the time being im sure its me or them your choice personally id like to keep you as a sourcewe work wellbut if you surface because of this then our relationships over it was warm in the small room and raymonds face shined with perspiration he wouldnt like losing the occasional payoff whatever else raymond did for money he managed to keep his name off the pink sheets which made him all right with boldt hes a pussy chaser raymond said laconically a guy gets into some pussy he shouldnt and andersons the one rigging the motel room for panavision and dolby know what i mean a little private screening for the wife hes been in here a couple times asking questions the girls here some do more than dance he pays well we had a little business from time to time no big deal thats not answering my question the man grimaced sources did not like discussing their deals boldt understood this he said make an exception raymond the man is dead yeah but something got him that way he said cautiously that shit gets contagious and i be a fuckedup dude work with me boldt zeroed in on the mans eyes and locked up good and tight he was stoned or high on something boldt repeated work with me anderson says the fremont neighborhood gonna get hit some heavy lifting you know its too big an area to watch by himselfalone he saysand that any news about such an activity would be appreciated so i put out the word you understand and the only shit i hear about is some white dude about to get fried for using the wrong house for surveillance two to five oclock in the morning some chemists are cooking meth in the basement of this vacant house see three oclock in the afternoon along comes this white boy who looks like hes snuffing termites but no he aint he goes inside for a little hideandpeek up on the second story the chemists put it out on the street wanting to know if this is heat or just some stupid jackass not good business to whack heat which is how come my man hears about it and how come i hear about it after him and you told anderson figured it might play could be his boy you know watching for a house to hit did anderson bite you know the drill paid me light until he checked it out more on the back side if it proves good he eyed boldt did it prove out had anderson run smack into the pied piper scouting his kidnaps he was gonna check it out get back to me sure he was damn right and now you telling me hes tits up fucking guy has a fifty belongs to me this be bullshit address of the vacant house boldt asked it was quintessential raymond just weird enough to ring of truth a huge grin overcame the mans face reminding boldt of the grille of a chrysler new yorker im smelling that fifty raymond chortled if the drug lab existed and they busted it they would have probable cause to turn the house upside down and shake if something fell out pertinent to the pied piper then it would later be admissible in court the shotzes baby sitter had mentioned an exterminator as had sherry daech the connection was enough to get a judge behind a warrant it was the first place boldt started busting a drug lab was second in risk only to defusing a known bomb the cookers were typically heavily armed and sitting on a powder keg of volatile chemicals the raid had to be sanctioned by narcotics for warrants boldt processed it accordingly and got lucky narcotics had been after the roving lab for weeks with the word of a reliable snitch behind it authorization came down quickly behind it was the full force of special operations and its elite emergency response teamwith an abundance of firepower and expertise by pm all necessary warrants had been walked through the system and the first of three neighboring families was quietly evacuated from its home adjacent to the suspected lab under instruction by telephone the parents and their child simply drove out of their garage and were met downtown by a woman from city services who housed them in the westin at am as the second of three surveillance units was established and the second home evacuated a special listening device was sequestered onto one of four basement windows all of which had been painted black from the inside and it was established that the structure was empty working on a combination of collected information the third surveillance unit was in place by believed to be ahead of the arrival of the cookers combat units followed the street cleaner that had broken down across from the target structure was receiving mechanical assistance from three undercover narco detectives the commercial dumpster left on the street in front of the evacuated neighbors house contained two ert sharpshooters with slits cut by acetylene torch the dumpster was one of spds cheapest and most easily disguised fortresses and had been dubbed the trojan horse one street to the south of the target residence was parked a tractor traileran allied moving vancontaining eight special ops officers a sixfoot battering ram and enough armament to start and finish a small war in the evacuated homes to either side four ert officers all medalwinning sharpshooters sat behind darkened windows at the ready communications devices hissing in their ears mulwright his field dispatcher and a lieutenant of narcotics manned the departments mobile command vehicle a confiscated steamcleaning van parked with a view of the vacant house boldt technically was not involved even though he had helped plan the operation he waited impatiently in his car along with sids bernie lofgrin a handheld radio listening in on a special ops frequency there was no idle chatter amet amali ustad squad leader of mulwrights special ops unit waited inside the allied moving van along with seven ert officers egyptian and indian by heritage his parents had moved as children to the northwest following world war ii and had met in seattle in the eisenhower era a fierce fighter tagged the warrior by his fellow officers ustad was darkly handsome with unexpected green eyes he wore a tightfitting charcoal gray uniform that distinguished itself from erts allblack across the back of every special ops field agent the word police was printed in bold yellow letters amet ustad looked over his men worried only for devon long whose personal problems with an invalid mother made him more of a burden than an asset to the team ustad made it his business to hear about any problems with his officers he had consulted lou boldts intelligence unit more than once about rumors concerning members of his elite team the radio traffic delivered no surprises three separate surveillance teams tracked any and all movement surrounding the target while six unmarked patrol cars worked the surrounding blocks alert for the arrival of the meth lab cookers stay loose ustad said addressing devon long worried about him more than any other his squadthe ramrodsworked with precision timing striking a target with a fierce intensity and heavy firepower there was no room for a straggler no room for error the regular radio reporting of the various units rolled through predictably there were good raids and bad raids and ustad expected the current one to fall in the latter category because it had been conceived hastily by a group of desk jockeys in desperate need of warm inkfavorable publicity to feed the media monster he knew all the warning signs multiple command being at the top a woman captain and an admitted drunk were running this one ustad needed little more than this to fuel his concern stay alert people he told his troops i think weve got a live fish he pressed the earpiece farther into his ear and listened in proper order each unit responded ustad taking his turn his elite unit looked up at him as he spoke into the small microphone positioned by a flexible boom in front of his lips besides the various shooters in the trojan horse and adjacent buildings ert had a sixman unit in a black panel van two blocks away ready to strike within one minute of a summons ustad knew the ert leader unit well and respected him together their squads would constitute the advance strike ustad to the rear the ert boys at the front door if all went well a swarm of narcotics officers would follow and actually lead the hit behind the protection of the two squads the choreography and timing were rehearsed regularly in a policeconfiscated warehouse on the south end of boeing field inside of which stage sets of house and apartment interiors had been constructed amet ustad was a believer in such mock exercises and his team was so well trained that they were the advance unit of washington states elite quick response police squad querps consisting of various units from a variety of state and city law enforcement agencies traveled to crisis scenesterrorism hostage or armored drug raidsand put out the fire surveillance weve got joy surveillance tallyho i count four going in through the back door surveillance roger that count operations weve got four birds people vehicles tag number does not check as the owner of the house weve got a green light from the top surveillance door is shut theyre inside operations this is it people lets look alive and end up that way okay allied its your lead ustad copy that our lead ustad looked to each of his rangershis nickname for themand silently made contact each of his boys nodded in return they knew the drill they had heard the words our lead and understood it was time training had its rewards devon longs eyes were dead void of the fear his squad leader wanted to see there if a person didnt find some form of terror in the prospect of ramming down a door and charging into a darkened house filled with bad guys then ustad didnt want him along ustad told him softly long youre doorman here the rest of the squad glanced at the man knowing it meant he was being left behind and obviously curious as to why long for all his personal problems was one of ustads two or three natural leaders yes sir squad leader long returned in a hushed voice in true spirit and form although ustad saw something else entirely in his eyes something he didnt like ustad told his team we go on three i want this done smart weve got a lot of firepower out there so watch what the hell youre doing verify targets and dont shoot any yellow letters weve got four birds in the roost he said lifting his right hand and holding up four fingers four he repeated give it back four in the roost sir squad leader the squad whispered in unison on the count of three sir squad leader radio check he demanded each of his men counted down into their headsets ram up he ordered four of the men took hold of the heavy device termed the big dick by his squad it was a steel battering ram with rubberpadded handles on the side and a wedgelike tip carrying four onefoot stripes of luminescent paint that sharpened to its point like an arrow it was scuffed and scarred from its many operations both practice and reallife the four men on the handles had the weight and size to deliver the big dick with the force of a small truck ustads squad was anything but dainty officer devon long moved past ustad to the back of the trailer to take care of the trailers large door ustad turned around away from his other men and switched off his mike at his belt you okay son he asked long roger that sir the boy answered in a hushed voice stay alert ustad ordered yes sir ustad switched on his radio and contacted operations blood pulsed loudly in his ears as his remaining men came up off the steel bench behind him he counted down in rehearsed rhythm one two three long threw the two halves of the trailers reinforced doors open and the squad disembarked as silently as a snake ustad took the lead followed by the big dick and then the remaining two rangers ustad turned sharply left having memorized the route straight down the driveway into an overgrown backyard up the steps and right through that door no turns no tricks surveillance reported his squads actions the only other sound the uniform rhythmic crunching of gravel beneath his teams feet halfway there and closing he lifted the shotgun he carried silently reminding himself he had five rounds to use before abandoning it for his sidearm he mentally rehearsed his every footstep as he gained on the house ahead of him seconds to go he knew that the trojan horse and the snipers were prepared to provide cover to defend them if needed one of his rangers would let ert in through the front door narcotics to follow his own ert unit he brushed his thumb against the protective vest just to assure himself he had remembered to wear it drug labs were the absolute worst if the small weapons fire didnt take you out the fire would he bounded silently to the platform of the back porch his crew coming to a halt below he handsignaled their surveillance technician forward the man snaked a thin tube of fiberoptic wire beneath the crack in the door viewed a small monitor strapped to his chest withdrew the wire and pronounced a thumbsup to his squad leader ustad signaled the two trailing rangers to break formation armed with a bolt cutter they would attempt an incursion through the locked storm cellar on the buildings south side but only in the event of weapons fire so far so good the back of the house was empty the intelligence was proving sound the lab was believed to be in the basement from that moment out ustad feared a shooting gallery the key element missing was the floor plan they had no idea of it other than a generalized opinion that similar structures of a similar era accessed the basement from a door in or near the kitchen that was the door theyd be looking for ustad waved the big dick up the stairs leaving the device to two men the two others readied their weapons he held his five fingers out straight and folded them in thumb first one by one until his hand became a fist as he began his count the ram swung back once forward once back again and then blew the door frame hinges and all right to the kitchen floor the team flooded into the kitchen within seconds officer randy deschutes signaled that he had found the basement door the big dick rocked once twice and smashed into the door it held reinforced back it came the glowing arrow on its nose aimed for the doorknob again the huge ram lunged into the door splinters of wood flew through the air but again the door held ustad cursed in arabic sitting ducksthe worst of situations on the third attempt the doorjamb dislodged the next two collisions drove the door down the basement stairs in a cacophony of destruction ustad heard the all too familiar hand clap of small weapons fire and saw a member of his team spin and fall to the floor the man rolled over wincing in agony but not bleeding the vest had saved his life he had four broken ribs ustad shouted police stuck the barrel of the shotgun down the dark hole and fired off two rounds three to go weapons firing voices shouting the sound of banging metal told ustad the storm cellar had been breached as well they had them from two perimeter positions the bad guys were pinned drop the weapons echoed from below more gunfire short and percussive ustad heard a sliding sound directly overhead followed by the distinct snap of a marksmans rifle he turned in time to see a body tumble off the roof into the backyard the cookers had placed a lookout on the top floor watching the street instead of the backyard he had missed the approach of the ert unit and was hellbent on escape coming to his feet he spun and let loose automatic weapons fire ustad was clipped in the shoulder by a bullet charged with adrenaline he barely felt it instead he hoisted his shotgun got off a round and watched the fleeing man stagger with the hit the escapee limped away following the same route ustad and his squad had used ustad depressed his radiocom button and shouted devon armed bird coming right at you lightheaded he sank to his knees his full attention fixed on the shooter limping at a run toward the allied moving van the back door of the trailer swung open and devon long jumped out weapon in hand ustad saw him open his mouth to shout a warning but did not hear him over the surrounding chaos the escapee came to an abrupt stop and raised his weapon at long ustad mumbled no no long elevated the barrel of his assault rifle but immediately identified that his weapon was trained in the direction of his own people he could not fire at the escaping shooter without risk to his colleagues overeager he had jumped from the trailer too soon long dove to the dirt and rolled for a safer angle as the sniper unloaded his weapon wildly a volley of muzzle flashes followed the sniper spun and fell to the dirt long favoring his right side and obviously hit was over the man in an instant kicking the weapon away and one good boot toe into the mans ribs ustad smiled he slumped forward and passed out no deaths boldt reminded himself as he patiently waited for lofgrins sid technicians to finish with the downstairs so he could examine the second floor no deaths four woundedtwo on each side but the bad guys were worse off and the meth lab was the second largest lab bust in the citys history netting huge quantities of meth and lsd the kitchen and basement were disaster areas of splintered wood blood discharged weapon shells glass and debris all was marked all recorded there would be more reports more internal hearings than could possibly be justified to anyone outside the system they would still be sorting things out on the fourth of july labor day if they werent careful the kitchen was an evidentiary wasteland lofgrin wasnt going to find anything of interest to boldt there the grounds surrounding the house were no better thanks to the army that had come and gone when he shouted ahead at lofgrin it was three in the morning he was going to need a cup of tea soon you kept everyone out of there for a reason lofgrin reminded meaning the upstairs a pair of ert officers had conducted a body hunt upstairs and then boldt had sealed the area he was anxious to get up there but only behind lofgrins evidence technicians with this extreme contamination he wanted to maintain the best crime scene possible according to the evacuated neighbors the house had been lived in by an elderly couple without children the wife had recently died sending the husband into a nursing home and leaving the place all but abandoned for the past few months the neighbor to the east had removed the junk mail and tended to the flower beds newspapers found downstairs suggested the basement had been in use as a drug lab for the last six weeks pointing narcotics into a new area of investigation meth cookers in decent neighborhoods boldt walked a block and a half to air out his head picked up a tea for himself and an armful of coffees and donuts and returned to the crime scene where press and the departments people of power shared microphones mulwright and hill were there as was dunkin hale from the fbi and a deputy prosecuting attorney boldt steered clear of all of them he passed out the coffees winning points with the id technicians and then joined lofgrin on the back porch the man was smoking a cigarette since when do you smoke boldt asked astonished dont start okay i got enough with diane ive known you twentysome years i turn fifty next week okay boldt knew about the birthday he and dixie had once planned to take bernie to victoria for a menonly jazz weekend but lizs illness and the task force had put the plan on hold okay boldt said making it sound as if he didnt know about this birthday in case they could still cook up a surprise when i quit this shitty habit twentyseven years ago i promised myself that for the week leading up to my fiftieth birthday i could smoke then not again until im sixtyfive when i earn an entire month at eighty if i make it that far all bets are off no time limits smoke as much as i like nonfilter or whatever and to hell with anybody who has a problem with that including diane boldt tried the tea it was strong and to his liking despite the styrofoam cup youre about as strange as they come you know that yeah i know it so what so nothing boldt replied he returned to his tea lofgrin smoked the thing like it was his last on earth you got lucky the man said exhaling a cloud if you could call it that extremely boldt replied a little bit this way or that and im responsible for a screwup learn anything lofgrin asked him he couldnt tell if the man was serious or not as a civilian lofgrin operated under a different set of rules than sworn officers boldt replied only that im not looking forward to turning fifty he finished the tea as lofgrin laughed through his smoke and coughed until he had tears in his eyes they returned inside together lou you can come on up lofgrin told him forty minutes later the sky was lighter in the east a few birds made song in anticipation of dawn the second story contained old furniture worn carpeting and tired wallpaper there were two bedrooms a bath and a linen closet the rearfacing bedroom had been used as a sewing room and faced a slowly rising hill that offered a view of dozens of other homes at fourthirty in the morning these homes were dark streetlights etching their outlines in the fog boldt heard heavy footsteps approaching and knew immediately that they belonged to lamoias ostrich boots john stopped at the doorway and leaned against the jamb boldt was on his hands and knees engaged in carpet patrol you know lamoia said if someone had bet me i would have put big money on us tagging this asshole before he went for another one now weve lost weinstein and im worried about a third dont think like that boldt warned deadlines make you crazy especially when the deadline passes motioning for lamoia to join him he said carpet patrol what about id busy with the mess downstairs bernie asked us to take the carpet what weve got is slightly confusing boldt explained we think the lookout for the cookers primarily used the front room hes a smoker and that room reeks of it and there are butts and roaches everywhere this room smells clean and no butts and yet that he said pointing out a cane seat chair by the window seems to indicate someone spent time at the back window a different sentry they took turns up here one smoked one didnt lamoia hypothesized boldt had not shared raymonds bit about the possibility of an exterminator on the premises with anyone if he stumbled onto supporting evidence then it was admissible but to do what he had doneuse narcotics to assist his own needswas an outright manipulation of the system to inform lamoia would make him subject to the same risks that boldt was taking he said id found some peat moss kicked up on the sill in the rocker with his feet up lamoia suggested exactly and peat moss flower beds lamoias jaw dropped why do i get the feeling a bunch of meth rats would not be tending the primroses he sagged to his knees and joined boldt in fingering through the carpet boldt said ps no peat moss was found in the front room they worked methodically using coins to mark the areas they searched you know what i got to ask myself lamoia said busy with his fingers whats that what the hell a lieutenantintelligence no lessis doing on carpet patrol at four in the morning on a drug bust or are you just a renaissance man the same could be asked of a homicide sergeant running a task force investigation yeah except im here because you rudely woke me up and told me to get my butt down here two officers were wounded i thought you were on rotation to investigate an officerinvolved shooting sure you did lamoia said sarcastically im here because you needed someone assigned to the task force and you werent about to work with mulwright even though his squad made the raid curiosity is what got me out of bed sarge it wasnt loyalty this time im too tired for loyalty you know what daphne says boldt asked avoiding a direct answer im figuring youre about to tell me that the pied piper is a planner mention of the pied piper caused lamoia to look up and lose his spot in the carpet boldt said an advance man he identifies them we dont know how watches them we dont know from where and only then strikes gets his advance work out of the way before the first kidnapping because he knows the public becomes more aware after the publicity hits he either does the advance work himself or uses chumps like anderson is that what im doing on my hands and knees lamoia asked it better be boldt said or were going to have some rumors to live down lamoia barked a laugh an attempt at humor at four in the morning i ever tell you i love this job it took several minutes for them to finish boldts knees cracked loudly as he stood lamoia wielded a small penlight training its beam beneath the furniture he ran the light up the wall and down into the windowsill sarge he asked expectantly boldt moved to get a look at the object in the center of the light a tiny chip of thick glass caught against the screens frame with lamoia training the light boldt opened the window saying he opens the window for some air kicks his feet up on the windowsill boldt placed the glass chip into a plastic evidence bag and marked it old times lamoia said excitedly this guy is picking up automobile glass in shoes work boots waffle sole that sort of thing yes he is boldt agreed studying the chip jumping to conclusions was both dangerous and foolish the lab would have to check it against the other glass found at the shotz and weinstein homes nonetheless boldt was already wondering if the glass could be used to tie the pied piper to a location an auto glass shop a car dealership they turned the evidence over to bernie lofgrin who signed for it twenty minutes later the eastern horizon wore an azure blue boldt drove away marina who had spent the night would be awakening soon his kids needed to be dressed and fed and taken to day care his worlds ran together interdependent where were the missing kids alive dead locked in a closet or a basement try as he did to focus on his upcoming parental duties he kept returning to an image of the pied piper dressed as an exterminator sitting in the rocking chair feet kicked up out the windowsill the question that begged to be asked was whether or not dead anderson had been after a possible thief stalking a neighborhood as he had represented himself to his snitches or was somehow involved with the pied piper anyone could have killed andersona client a victim of andersons pryingone of the many names on the callerid list but the pollen on the knees of his laundry matched the pollen found on the shotz crib and in the taurus carpet fibers evidence boldt could not ignore anderson was clearly involvedup to his knees boldt thought gaynes had checked the entire block surrounding the shotz residence and had found no beds of kneeheight yellow flowers boldt slowed for a red light but ran it at five in the morning he wasnt about to stop the callerid list he suddenly understood the next logical step he dialed lamoias cellular he had left him at the crime scene with lofgrin yo the man answered andersons callerid boldt said right anderson wasnt a guy working out of the kindness of his heart he worked for hire im with you i know gaynes is checking his callerid list john that she intends to speak with each of them but crosschecking those calls by address and comparing those addresses with the neighborhood that the pied piper may have had under surveillance addresses lamoia repeated softly allowing a long silence as he attempted to follow boldts train of thought gimme a second here he vamped oh shit lamoia gasped it had obviously connected for him the same way it had for boldt weinsteins house is in that direction anderson wasnt working for the pied piper he was working for weinstein pleasant dreams boldt said disconnecting knowing damn well that lamoia wouldnt sleep a wink chapter daphne selected the task force situation room for impact its walls littered with photos both of the kidnapped children and of andersons corpse an arm dangling half in half out of the bathtub suspects responded to environment and she intended to treat weinstein as a suspect kay kalidja held the door for flemming not the other way around they entered ceremonially flemming instinctively reaching for the chair at the head of the large oval table and then reconsidering where do you want me he asked daphne wherever youre comfortable she replied the head is fine i want the suspect here she pointed where hes forced to look at the shots of anderson kalidja shook hands with daphne i wouldnt want to get on your bad side no you wouldnt flemming contributed letting daphne know that hed done his homework and knew about her motivational resources in the criminally disposed im impressed daphne said as flemming came up with the title of one of her papers she searched her memory and fired back human extortionnegotiating to freedom gold star flemming faced kalidja and demanded of her background father of victim number eleven goes by sidney graduated high school in ohio antioch college earns sixtyeight thousand jewish wife is a gentile trish donations include greenpeace and the democratic national partysmall change flemming clucked his tongue at mention of greenpeace kalidja continued has an eightythousanddollar mortgage twelve thousand left on his car loan credit cards pretty run up no arrests one moving violation three years ago doesnt telephone out of state very often when he does its to a cousin and an aunt and uncle home phone number found on andersons callerid list seven calls total three in the week prior to the accident murder dont you mean daphne inquired of flemming accident flemming insisted leaning on the word you have two hundred and six hours of court time ms matthews she didnt even know this number herself as an expert witness i would doubt seriously that even once that testimony involved evidentiary assets of any kind your realm is speculation its science she countered feeling her face burn into motive environment a suspects mental state all helpful to the judicial process but evidence is quite another matter i have sixteen hundred hours in that same chair at this point in time anderson was an accident something comes in to dispute this well review it circumstantial evidence is just that it may work for columbo but it doesnt work in that chair the bureau doesnt arrest suspects we convict them therein lies the difference between me and ms hill she could feel resentment oozing from his every pore he wanted control of the task force he was a formidable presence one didnt miss gary flemming didnt pass him over with a casual glance his black skin appeared iridescent in the rooms artificial light his voice warmed her chest like a preachers flemming held a degree in psychology from georgetown a masters in criminology from usc he had been a federal marshal with the ins border patrol before joining the bureau with each twoyear transfer he had received promotion he served on the girl scouts national board and did the speaker circuit during vacation to promote a minor best seller hed penned about his celebrity kidnapping cases single daphne recalled never married this struck her as hard to believe as a woman she found the selfconfidence the penetrating brown eyes incredibly attractive perhaps she thought women came to him too easily like lamoia she thought flemming drank a diet coke from the can his strong black hand gripping the soda kalidja drank a starbucks coffee the psychologist in daphne was glad for these few minutes of evaluationit was important to know ones teammates flemming struck her as all business his researcher kalidja was all woman sensual and fluid she had expressive eyes and the lilting singsong voice of an islander the ceramic beads ticked percussively behind her selfconscious toying with her hair daphne wondered if flemming and kalidja were more than colleagues flemmings toy was a stainless steel pen he made notations in his leather day timer unable to sit still when he allowed his face to settle it carried exhaustion tension and impatience he worked to keep those from showing he checked his watch and grunted disapproval his life ran according to those two hands lamoia appeared looking unusually tired he was followed in lockstep by sidney weinstein and a gray suit named caldwell lamoia made a halfbaked gesture of greeting to flemming offered kalidja an annoyingly fawning smile and acquiesced to daphnes placement of the participants weinstein and his representative caldwell sat across from the crime scene photos daphne focused on weinstein alert for changes in body language and expression following introductions caldwell spoke first expounding his legal rhetoric lamoia reminded everyone that the interview was nothing more than an informal inquiry a factfinding mission he said mr weinstein are you familiar with callerid an electronic device that allows i know about it over a twoweek period you or your wife made four calls to one bernard chalmers anderson known locally as ricky anderson richey anderson and most recently andy anderson daphne logged the mans pained expression weinstein was no innocent caldwell the mans attorney said mr anderson was a private detective as such correction lamoia said interrupting anderson installed home security devices he also provided everything from polaroids of the wife caught doing the dirty to a dislocated limb or two when the situation called for it now wait just a minute the attorney protested easy flemming said in his low resonant voice the sound of which melted daphne the sergeant just told you there are no charges stemming from this settle down caldwell the lawyer now focused on the sac knowing he was the one to watch lamoia asked when did you last speak with anderson mr weinstein monday or tuesday of this week came the nervous answer and have you tried since he advised think carefully tuesday night lamoia nodded at to be precise lucky for you that was two hours after mr andersons windpipe had been slightly rearranged leaving him a little blue in the face im afraid looking right at weinstein he said tongue as black as tire rubber and about the size of a rat dead a nasty fall in the tub serves as a keen reminder of the importance of those rubber mats with the suction cups know the ones i mean weinstein went the color of toilet porcelain caldwell offguard recovered in time to issue a line of objections as if in a trial lamoia continued calmly so what were wondering about motioning to the others is the nature of your professional arrangement with aka andy anderson and i should caution you mr weinstein that we take no prisoners here at spd if you know what i mean if we all do the dance its a fun party you sit in the corner like a wallflower with her finger up her nose and agent flemming lieutenant matthews and i are gonna rain on your parade until youre changing your shorts he cut off caldwell with a raised hand and this georgetown law professor can piss all over us as much as he likes and we wont even feel it because we got nothing to do with him our business is with you just like your business was with andy anderson know what i mean so my advice personally what im trying to say here is that you talk you walk you hold out on us and youre holding out on little hayes flemming viewed lamoia with an open mouth caldwell coughed got something stuck in his throat and gargled some phlegm to clear it flemming said cautiously now is the time for the truth mr weinstein we dont need any fabrications embellishments or avoidances sergeant lamoia is conducting a homicide investigation thats all you need to know you are not a suspect at this time we need a statement is all lamoia added if you needed some knees broken were fine with that dirty pictures hell thats your business a phone tapped a house watched its a free country he flashed another of those disturbing smiles caldwell whispered into the mans ear weinstein nodded the attorney asked given that there is no recording taking place and that this is an informal discussion where have you been lamoia asked interrupting why dont we all just get out of mr weinsteins way for a minute and let him have some air for weinstein there was no one else in the room but lamoia daphne marveled at the detectives ability to win control in interrogations nothing he did was orthodox he violated every rule of questioning but one he gained the subjects attention you people wouldnt help weinstein complained i called told you someone was watching us so i asked this friend if he knew someone who could help me not too expensive he gives me andersons name says he caught this guys wife with a neighbor said anderson had gotten photos for him you guys didnt believe me so id find out for myself he stabbed a finger toward lamoia so i hire anderson to check it out am i being watched or not had you heard about the kidnapped child at this point flemming asked shotz weinstein asked this was way before that he stated firmly la san francisco and portland that was enough for me daphne spoke up you sensed you were being watched by someone before the shotz abduction it supported her belief that the pied piper did his legwork in advance reducing his profile once the kidnappings began thats what im telling you flemming said bluntly you hired anderson in case it was the pied piper watching you silence fell weinstein whined you put it like that i guess thats right he hung his head it wasnt exactly how i was thinking about it no he corrected anderson said it was probably a thief that made sense burglars stake out houses all the time so we put some stuff in the safe deposit his eyes clouded and daphne knew he was thinking about his missing son he cleared his eyes and said hell you know anyone in seattle hasnt had their car stolen or their house broken into anderson said catching these guys isnt so easy they make you they take off stake out someplace else i offered two hundred on the back side that sealed the deal too much television daphne thought every john doe a cop weinstein didnt strike daphne as a target for a secondstory man car theft maybe she wondered if anderson had simply strung the man along for the down payment you called anderson to check in to see how he was doing lamoia stated flemming glared at lamoia unhappy with the leading statements unorthodox protect my investment of course i did weinstein answered and what did he tell you first time said he didnt have anything so call back next time a day or two later two lamoia refreshed him said maybe some progress he renegotiated said he could get pictures but that expenses had gone up cleared it with me i guess you could say expenses plus another fifty and so you continued your arrangement daphne stated sure i did he all but confirmed someone was watching the house actually all he said was that he was working on it i didnt like him stretching me out for more money that bothered me plus a couple times he tried to sell me a home security system an alarm system he hesitated and asked do you guys use them at home i mean did you flemming asked buy one no im not sure why i just didnt feel like it i guess i will now hayes kidnapped anderson murdered andersons death has been ruled an accident flemming corrected lamoia and daphne exchanged glances but neither challenged flemming the attorney barked an accident or a homicide weinstein interrupted listen if you people had responded to my calls i wouldnt have hired him in the first place dont dump this on me is that what this is about he sounded a little hysterical his attorney placed his hand on the mans arm to settle him but weinstein shook it off you guys got the pictures didnt you it was a statement you just dont know whos in them and you want me to tell you but i didnt see them either there had been no mention of a camera in andersons property inventory he had pictures for you flemming asked lamoia reminded you said he renegotiated to include photographs thats right i agreed to the fifty flemming said heatedly did he notify you about having these pictures no he didnt weinstein answered never listen screw the photos what about my boy flemming ignored him arguing to the group he would have wanted payment for any such photographs i think its fairly safe to say he did not have any such photographs daphne said everything were doing is in an attempt to get hayes back as quickly as possible lamoia made notes what do you think about the photos he asked weinstein i think he had shot some and was going back for more and why is that daphne inquired the attorney leaned over and whispered into his clients ear weinstein shook his head no he answered audibly and then to the others i never saw any photographs i was never expressly told they existed daphne pressed but you believed they did exist why weinstein turned slightly to face her he wore a boyish surprised expression he said he had something going for him i dont remember the exact words weinstein anticipated her next question and said this came after the call about the extra fifty bucks see then a spark filled his eyes and he said matteroffactly you know what it was he said that hed get his money when he delivered mr stranger danger thats what it was daphne felt a spike of heat from head to toe to police mr stranger danger referred to child abductors the association with the pied piper seemed unmistakable pencils went to paper anderson had identified a suspect he believed a kidnapper of children if weinstein had it right it was the pied piper when weinstein and his attorney had left lamoia offered for flemmings agents to join in a second search of andersons duplex in a surprise move flemming politely refused implying he was happy to have spd run his errands for him so long as any evidence discovered was shared flemming and kalidja left together leaving lamoia and daphne alone so lamoia inquired she said confidently weinstein was nervous at first intimidated but he loosened up hes bankable his respiration stayed regular no noticeable perspiration squinting twitching not even much chair adjustment he remained alert focusedand we were throwing a lot at him had caldwell prepped him its a possibility that would account for some of it so we buy his statement yes absolutely what lamoia asked aware that something was bothering her she pursed her lips its not weinstein its flemming he remained pretty quiet until mention of the photography at that point he became much more animated she asked why did he pass on your offer to search andersons place for the camera that stunned me i gotta admit and what about his attempt to convince us that the photos didnt exist lamoia hung his head in thought he said it makes sense if theyve already worked the anderson crime scene he mumbled fuckinga pouring ice into his veins daphne asked what if they already have andersons photos chapter the box a small rectangular interrogation room with gray walls white vinyl floor tile and an acoustical ceiling was hot it held a single wartorn table the metal legs of which were bolted to the floor and on that day five gunmetal gray straightbacked chairs with padded seat cushions that whooshed when sat upon a woman officer by the name of marsh accompanied boldt and daphne somehow mcnee had identified the vacant house used for the drug lab the pied piper had identified this same house and that methodology was now critical to the investigation as a narcotics detective marsh had the collar but she granted boldt this chance to work the suspect since the meth lab raid had been his idea a previous interrogation already complete marsh was content merely to be present she looked and dressed like an art student returned from europe she sat at the head of the table and remained silent boldts plan was a simple one hit the man with everything they had on paper jeffry mcnee was not someone daphne had expected to find cooking at a meth lab white midtwenties with a degree in chemistry daphne had coached boldt that mcnee would likely test them to measure his opponents he would sort them out identify the weak player and work only with this person she advised boldt that if he wanted to lead he should play dumb mcnee being assigned a public defender surprised boldt it implied he hadnt the money or contacts to hire a lawyer specializing in drug defense that fact suggested a rogue freelance operation and offered boldt some leverage he might fear returning to the street more than going to jail drug turf was violently defended mcnee had a boyish face with alert green eyes with his black hair and ruddy complexion he belonged either in a scottish kilt or selling junk bonds on wall street the orange jumpsuit marked king co jail on the back did him an injustice his attorney was a hundred and seventy pounds of hawaiian mama with enough mascara and lizard green eye shadow to qualify for stage work she chewed gum vigorously and wore smudged eyeglasses her tent dress hung from her enormous breasts like a waterfall of lime green in a loud print her voice was a deep baritone her teeth fake my client wants to know whats in this for him she said from a chair all but swallowed by its gelatinous occupant were part of a homicide investigation daphne said playing the role of the intelligent one to the suspect she said a man who may have had your drug lab under surveillance was found murdered anyone in your position would take a dim view of such surveillance give me a break the muumuu sputtered like a big truck attempting to start a conviction for which will earn you life daphne addressed mcnee not ten years not sixteen not with the current administration life without parole mcnee didnt seem the least bit ruffled as she had expected the stage was set for boldt to do some damage you sure about that boldt asked daphne wearing a gumshoe expression of fatigue cant we plea him down if we want to trust me on this daphne said while simultaneously measuring the muumuu for her take on boldt he had a reputation if she knew of him their ruse was unlikely to work but she was unfamiliar to them both most likely a newcomer to the public defenders rotation youll pardon me for interrupting the suspect said calmly but do i detect a presumption of guilt or innocence assumption of innocence daphne told him is a luxury afforded by those across the street her superior air helped mcnee to quickly identify her as the enemy boldt was not yet so clearly defined the man addressed boldt my pals and i were doing a little chemistry experiment whats the big deal a man is dead daphne replied you have plenty of motive to want him that way we can connect him to investigating a person or persons at the address of your lab we will have documentation of that shortly you would be well advised to play ball your attorneys shaking her head telling you not to talk but we can offer you a plea position on the dope charge this is entirely inappropriate muumuu said to her client she explained they cant offer this daphne said no one can make any promises but one thing is for sure you go up for this in the state of washington and youre gone for good the key is tossed out ask her she said indicating the dress and the chewing gum what do you want mcnee asked boldt what is it you want dont do this the attorney advised halfheartedly what we want are a couple very simple answers boldt explained calmly what we have to offer is protection oh this is bullshit the muumuu complained do not listen to them they have no authority to plea you and they cannot will not offer any reliable protection forget it she told boldt ignoring her boldt informed mcnee you take the dive and you end up in our big house everyone whos anyone in drugs has their people there it isnt me thats been pinching tommy chens turf what do you suppose your life expectancy is daphne supplied the important piece of the puzzle a federal conviction would move you out of state safer boldt said they had won mcnees interest dont threaten people muumuu warned them and dont make promises you cant keep but now even she seemed interested the suspect who had acquired a sheen on his brow looked silently between the two police officers daphne said well put in a recommendation that the feds take your case how much do you know about tommy chen boldt asked mcnee did not answer what about your parents daphne inquired thinking mcnee too clean cut and too young a degree in chemistry and nowhere to hide mcnee went scarlet have you called them she drilled the suspect glared the wire services have picked up the story she explained do your parents watch cnn my parents are not part of this they could be if you want them here boldt said naively daphne asked do i start the tape now or do we move this same offer down the hall go the suspect said under protest of counsel the muumuu growled boldt started the cassette recording he recited the particulars date time location and the names of those in attendance daphne went first mcnee had been recruited out of graduate school by asians offering three times the starting salaries of other biochemical firms two months into his work mcnee had faced the reality he was supplying elements to cook street drugs six months later he asked for more money and was threatened mcnee ran to seattle set up a roaming meth lab and sold wholesale to a street gang he refused to name boldt asked run it by me again how you picked your safe houses did you know the owner or what someone next door down the street i forget i didnt say the suspect answered the muumuu fiddled with her watchband it carried big lumps of turquoise fashioned as small turtles i dont see the relevancy she complained impatient now humor me boldt said to her im curious muumuu glanced at her client and nodded boldt appeared casually disinterested in fact the task force needed to know if the exterminator had a system for identifying his surveillance points mcnees face revealed a man wanting to guard a secret boldt pretended to read some notes okay so tell me this did you use a point man was that exterminator yours what are you talking about daphne answered how you ided the vacant house boldt said a man was seen with a tank and a hose an exterminator mcnee looked confused daphne wondered if he was a good actor or ignorant the attorney said this exterminator wouldnt happen to be your vic would he to her client she said dont answer this her face flushed with anger and suspicion junk mail piling up by the door daphne guessed no mcnee said dont answer this the muumuu repeated sitting as tall as possible a difficult task boldt said you know about the exterminator recalling his conversation with the snitch raymond mcnee looked nervously between boldt and his attorney as boldt said tommy chens people would have killed some stranger creeping around his lab instead we get a tip you guys have put the word out to id the guy we knew about him its true mcnee confirmed the gang provided you protection the shooters boldt guessed daphne said you werent going to kill a cop or we didnt kill anyone you shot at us boldt said you wounded officers they did their side was protection boldt repeated mcnee nodded thats enough the muumuu protested i dont see a street gang identifying vacant houses daphne said a guy i know is a realtor mcnee allowed is that what you wanted does that buy me the federal courts boldt glanced hotly at daphne he said to mcnee a realtor hes always looking to skim off the cream he has a notebook filled with vacant unlisted houses daphne said we need a name no way muumuu said youve got too much already we need that name boldt confirmed they must all do it mcnee said you show me the federal court and ill give you a name boldt signaled daphne he was in a hurry all we can do is make the request daphne reminded make it muumuu said boldt stood to leave mcnee said whats going on chewing her gum like a dog eating its dinner the muumuu said looks like you just became an expert witness chapter lamoia looked forward to another meeting with sherry daech but could not escape the pressure of passing time rhonda shotz and hayes weinstein were out there somewhere counting on him hayes had been missing for four days rhonda going on two weeks the chances of finding them alive seemed slim he had eaten only sporadically in the past few days what time he found for sleep was bridled with insomnia boldt had told him about mcnees realtor friend who kept current on abandoned houses the guy probably watches the obits boldt had said and who knows what else find out lamoia intended to do just that sherry daech did not answer any of her numbers but lamoia found her hummer parked outside the agency offices a small white clapboard house in wallingford the building was locked though some lights were on he rang the doorbell and was greeted through the glass by a man in his youthful fifties graying hair and blue eyes lamoia showed his shield through the glass and was admitted the buildings interior felt more corporate than quaint he entered her upstairs office with his usual swagger however practiced and forced in junior high school it had long since become part of his muscles and ligaments and therefore a part of him it telegraphed an overconfidence and conceit that his coworkers accepted and that strangers found outlandish lamoia was a modernday carpetbagger he took what he wanted what he wanted from sherry daech was information he needed a list from her he would not leave until he had it busy with paperwork she did not look up immediately working late he said greeted then by an authentic smile she motioned to the stacks around her if you do this during the day theres no time to sell your partner he asked motioning toward the hallway business partner she clarified one of them she drummed her painted nails on the desktop a couple of questions he said oh darn she flashed a smile and barked an eager laugh i need some help i thought youd never ask the eyelashes were dyed but effective they beat like little wings we needed a realtor i thought of you i love making that kind of impression on people i would imagine its quite often complete with a silver tongue you must need this help pretty badly may i he motioned to the available chair his legs were dog tired i like you better when youre standing she said looking eye level at his rodeo belt buckle but okay he remained standing a realtor must track houses that are likely to come onto the markettry to get a jump on the competition and win the listing listings are the golden ring sales are great but i get a piece of the listing even if someone else sells it ahead of time im talking about of course you stay ahead or you fall behind she adjusted herself in the chair enjoying his company and said its a rule that pertains to so many things in life and how do you do this he asked other than reading the obits youre not thinking of getting your license are you she added i hate competition scouts honor you were never a scout too many rules for a man like you i wasnt a man then i think you had better sit youre distracting me good there all right how do i do it she asked chewing on a wry smile okay obits of course sure divorce filings can be a gold mine i get a lot of play out of the divorce marketthe separation filings are registered downtown early bird gets the worm construction permits are a good source couples often fix up the house before trying to sell or they start work on a future home before committing to listing the existing one tricks others lamoia for all his ability to think through crimes had not come up with the divorce and construction angles oh sure i have lots of other tricks the same smile but a little more forced he appreciated her ability her desire to toy with him to flirt he knew the game and enjoyed playing it he trusted her because of this she demanded anothers confidence in herself that only the best salespeople attorneys and cops possessed she was family such as dont tease detective that is definitely the pot calling the kettle black smaller clues other sources she inquired knowing what he sought lets see property taxes in arrearsthat can point you toward a vacancy and its a matter of public record public records lamoia mumbled writing fast they are the easiest city water being shut off is the biggie private records dont hurt if you have access phone utilities if you know someone in the insurance industry multipolicy car insurance lapsing or a change in property coverage can signal a death its a long list maybe we should discuss it over a drink do you keep a list of these places some way to follow up a database on my machine sure i do my secretary makes the cold calls for me i do the followups its one of those things always running in the background you know low priority boiling away back there a lot of its wasted time but every so often it pays off and i get a listing worth a trip to someplace warm and dry the biltmore in phoenix ever been no friend and i own a twobedroom suite in the hotel a condo deal that works out great we each get two weeks a year it really is amazing weather down there rain is just another fourletter word not like here he asked can i get a copy of the database is this where i get to barter oh goodie how about you consider arizona and i consider giving you the database im a little busy right now lamoia thought about a weekend with this one at the biltmore white terry cloth robes free shampoo where would he rather be the decision came easy for him with sheila hill she said what is all this about anyway still the kidnappings she curled a lock of yellow blonde hair what do vacant houses have to do with it anyway lamoia answered honestly thats what were trying to find out he left with the promise of having the database by morning chapter tuesday morning day fourteen since the shotz kidnapping a fine cold mist sat across the city umbrellas were held against the weather animating the sidewalks with color it was a salt rain and tasted as such tangy and tight in the nostrils tart in the throat a clouddriven drenched darkness hung over the city sherry daechs list of confirmed vacant structures arrived by fax at quarter to ten thirtytwo addresses lamoia checked with sheila hill who agreed that by the start of the four oclock task force meeting the fbi would have to be provided the list and told of any progress for the remainder of the workday however spd possessed this for themselves it was lamoias job to work the evidence dry so that they surrendered nothing useful to the competition with the pressure of time and hills demand for success he rounded up volunteers for the legwork four members of his homicide squad a sex crimes detective by the name of cindy dufur a narcotics cop called runt who needed the overtime boldt and gaynes lamoia assigned each cop several of the addresses to check they were to doortodoor the neighbors for any activity at the houses day or night check the locks and look around the premises if the owners could be contacted and admission legally gained and granted then lamoia wanted a look inside with attention paid to the upper stories operation room with a view he nicknamed it excitement warmed him countered by a chilling fear for the missing children the investigation still lacked key explanations to understanding and anticipating the pied piper explanations required if the case were to be solved by anything other than blind luck chief among these was how the kidnapper identified his victims the possibilities of their being random was infinitesimalthe pied piper was profiled as a careful planner whether the victims were identified through their parents or somehow through the infants themselves no one knew the parents seemed the more likely choice all the children were of the same approximate age all white the kidnapper clearly knew about his victims a variety of sources existed for such information including the internet which posted national bulletin boards of births its network carried full text copies of hundreds of smalltown newspapers all of which published news of new arrivals the kidnapper might have used any of these the fbi with its resources and nearly endless manpower had been after this link between victims for nearly six months and still seemed in the dark how lamoia wondered was spd supposed to make such a discovery in the face of that right behind selection of the victim was the physical and logistical execution of the crimethe modus operandi for this reason the discovery of a possible system of surveillance used by the kidnapper held a place of major importance for lou boldt the fieldwork for which he had volunteered offered him a chance to air out his brain clear his thoughts refocus lizs proclamation of a spiritual awakening and an intention to abandon medical treatment struck him as nothing short of dementia with his wifes survival so much in question the notion of leaving it up to god was for him like deciding the easiest way to use the elevator was to cut the cable and allow gravity to deliver the car to the lobby but there was no way he could think that would allow him to seize control and force her to take the treatments to the contrary he had to accept her decision and his fear all but prevented that this in turn caused him to face up to those fears and he found it easier to run from themto pursue fieldworkthan to look them in the eye so on a rainy tuesday in march boldt found himself with his ear pinched to his cellular phone and his hand gripped on the wheel of the departmentissue chevy cavalier he had driven for six years the phone connected him to the owners or the heirs of the vacant structures boldt presented his need to enter the building making no mention of writs or warrants the more cautious of the group demanded to call back police headquarters and be transferred to boldt a situation made difficult due to his use of the cellular but not an insurmountable hurdle he slowly chipped away at suspicions learning quickly to invoke a reference to the pied piper and approach the owners on an emotional level one by one he opened doors making small checks on the list suffering through congested traffic struggling to put his personal issues behind him and to deliver some good police work he found the doortodoor interviews with neighbors the most satisfying challenging him to carefully nurse from his potential witnesses facts that were often perceived as insignificant for these two hours he left behind the world of chemical therapy and the smell of betadine the insatiate expressions of those marked to die by hour three he was on to his last two addresses lamoia favored him like a teacher with a pet student assigning boldt four addresses closest to his own house one of which bordered his neighborhood a half mile west of green lake by doing so lamoia was offering boldt the chance to head home early ahead of the four oclock duty rotation that would have sent him into rush hour traffic boldt understood this but had no intention of going home early at the second to last house he pulled to a stop and parked checking the street for a white van or minivan he waited watching the houses windows for any movement a shadow a change of light motion after a few minutes of this he left the car in favor of a neighbors house he climbed the neighbors steps knocked and was admitted into a small room with a faux leather recliner and needlepointed pillows depicting british bobbies the london bridge and jesus at the last supper a needlepoint in progress rested on the arm of the recliner along with a sweating glass of coke the chair faced a twentyseveninch color set tuned to the shopping channel a cordless phone perched within reach beyond the television an open curtain revealed the adjacent vacant house the womans figure implied cheeseburgers fries and vanilla shakes she wore blue rubber beach thongs on her pale swollen feet she willfully closed the door behind him like a floridian bracing for an unseen hurricane and maintained her distance crossing to the safety of her bowled chair in hurried little steps police shields bothered people cant stay long police or not she picked up the phone like some cops handled their weapons no need boldt said she clearly had items to purchase some blackandwhite fish occupied an aquarium with pink bermuda sand that bubbled continuously there was a ceramic sunken pirates ship at the bottom that wore a green slimy film i need to ask you some questions about the vacant house next door i wonder if you might turn the television down for a minute according to the uninterrupted narration peach cardigan sweaters had sold for tax shipping and handling only two minutes left to go she worked the remote and silenced the voice midsentence thank you he said she watched the muted television not him eleanor pruitt breathed her last breath there not six months ago pancreas it was he didnt want to be reminded of disease and death no one living there if thats what you wanted he wondered what she found so fascinating about the silent colors flashing at her that she couldnt so much as glance at him visitors his chest tightened people wandering around that sort of thing at first i thought they might be church members people used to bring eleanor meals from time to time but they werent parasites is what they wereinsurance men real estate agents tax assessors never knew all the fuss dying created been more activity over there since eleanor died than when she was living recently i look right out that window dont i you can see that cant you its distracting people walking around like that how do i know who they are anyone been around recently boldt repeated quite recently i bought me a gun its legal she informed him making eye contact for the first time but briefly had it nearly two years now they better not mess with me ill show them next door boldt said these people have been walking around recently maam you got earwigs where you live silverfish i hate those damn things goddamn they bother me he didnt look at the television perhaps it was selling a roach hotel have you seen anyone recently maam over next door i mean they hide in all the dark damp places you know kitchen is the worst under the edges by the trash enough of em to make me sick all i wanted was to know how much to get rid of them you know youd think he could have told me that whos that boldt asked his thoughts finally connecting her words and his heart racing away pointing to the television she said thats jerry he sells all the electronic stuff could care less its dorothy i like the clothes havent you ever watched this where you been who was it you were asking about silverfish boldt asked the man spraying she answered matteroffactly the house next door boldt supplied violating a fundamental precept of interrogation someone spraying the house next door id have to call the office for a quote he said screw him didnt even give me a card ill tell you something if youre too busy for my trade then someone else gets it plain and simple far as im concerned you spoke with him you got a look at this exterminator boldt stated he wanted this badly the pied piper had used his exterminator disguise to scout the home or as an excuse to be seen entering this woman was an eyewitness you kidding wouldnt give me the time a day never even so much as turned around she added incredulously youve never actually watched this channel was he spraying the vacant house boldt asked is that what youre telling me when they had a housedress i really wanted kind of like this one only red mrs he searched for the name couldnt find it a year earlier it would have been on the tip of his tongue the housedress was up at the same time i saw him and i thought about those earwigs in there and i thought thats who i need so i get up and go out back and shout over to him thats a big deal for megoing out like that and could he care less hows someone that rude stay in business anyway the housedress boldt said in earnest returning to the language of her world there were no minutes and hours only items for sale what day was that she looked up at him for only the second time hes been around a couple of times but hell if im going to give him the time of day youve seen him more than once it had been a long time since boldt had conducted this kind of interrogation and he felt out of sorts his timing off it was an art form when done right handled incorrectly even the best witness could become confused and begin to believe he or she had it wrong when how often he was rushing her pushing her supplying her with the answers he wanted to hear if he had seen one of his detectives handling a questioning that same way he would have been livid couple a times at a distance sure i have but to hell with him when he had trapped himself he couldnt seem to break out of what he knew to be poor practice like bogging down in an argument going nowhere yesterday maybe the day before recently i said yesterday didnt i how recent do you want have you seen him today boldt asked no boldt handed her his card my number he said in case you remember anything else about him well want to talk with you some more not this time of day you wont you wait until the gadget part of the show who cares about computers and vcrs anyway eyeing boldts business card she allowed a large grin to superimpose itself upon her features say she said causing boldt to turn from the door to face her you know anyone sprays for earwigs boldt tried lamoia from the cellular his intention to inform him that he was going to enter the residence on a determination of probable cause he couldnt get through but penned a note of his attempt in his notebook he walked around back of the vacant house not wanting to draw any attention his senses on full alert it took him a total of three minutes to find the spare keyunder a potted plant he paused at the back door and unsnapped his service handgun the brief touch of the weapon brought with it dread and anxiety fieldwork was for the younger officershe understood this well he moved cautiously through the building clearing rooms in succession allowing for no surprises the house smelled dusty and shuttered boldt climbed the stairs as silently as possible slowly and carefully his imagination attempted to suggest the pied piper was upstairs at that very moment a confrontation violence he pushed the images aside and measured every footfall listening intently after each anxious cops made mistakes he reminded himself they shot small kids who surprised them allowing adrenaline and imagination to distort reality they shot the legal residents they got addresses wrong they believed witnesses without a second source the upstairs landing came into view the clarity of such moments astounded him he could make out the dust particles like beach sand on the upstairs floor planks they swirled in the air like a curtain of mist in a silent and slow dance the pounding blood in his ears was deafeningbabump babump babump he understood that fear corrupted such moments caused poor decisions and overreactions he stood away from it as he stepped onto the upper landing and faced a hallway with four doorsall closed he threw open the first shielding himself behind the jamb he searched the room and its closet but found no one and nothing of interest the second room was the same no one the smell of old age and medicines in the air he cleared the next two as well one a bedroom the other a guest bath he returned his weapon to its holster he examined the three bedrooms more carefully the streetfacing bedroom had a wooden rocker that faced a window the curtains to which were pulled partially shut unlike the other curtains in the room the placement of this rocker reminded him of that of the chair in the sewing room at the makeshift drug laban unmistakable similarity he could visualize the pied piper sitting in the chair rocking and watching the gap in the curtains framing his target boldt sat down into the rocking chair its frame creaking beneath his weight his fingers held away from its frame he looked out across the geometric landscape of a hundred houses or more leaning back he saw the curtains restricted this to thirty or so houses over six to ten blocks somewhere in this limited field of view was the pied pipers next target boldt combed the landscape and the houses presented him it was said one couldnt see the forest for the trees and no one knew this better than a cop his eyes searched each roof each tree each street suddenly among all the houses driveways porches windows and roofs boldts eye caught something indelibly familiar he strained to see more clearly at such a distance could it be and then all at once yes he was looking directly at his own house boldt left the place at a sprint found himself inside the chevy foot to the floor some cops attracted trouble the way a goodlooking girl incited catcalls paroled cons stalked them threatened them assaulted them attorneys filed lawsuits against them boldt had only once been such a target the thought that his children not him might be the true target hurried him blindly through intersections through traffic and down quiet residential streets he skidded to a stop in his own driveway the left door open the engine running and ran to the back door charging inside and startling his housekeeper so that she dropped an armful of clean laundry onto the kitchen floor and ran screaming from the room marina he called out the kids she returned sheepishly day care she answered in her thick mexican accent her face flushed you took them yourself who else marina had a temper he had to watch himself he settled down the kids were not going to be kidnapped from day care nonetheless he called millie wiggins and confirmed could coincidence explain his seeing his own house from that window he hated the word there was no case history to support his fears cops children had not been targeted in any of the previous cities nonetheless coincidence was not in his detectives vocabulary in police work things happened for reasons the pied piper hunted white children under ten months old sarah was two miles four i take the children i always take the children what you mean coming in here like that you scared me half to death like that look at this laundry on the floor a mess i have to wash it over its fine it is not fine you scared me half to death like that coming in that way like that shouting of course i take them to day care what do you think mother of jesusyou scared me half to death have you seen anyone around the house marina think an extermina a man spraying for the bugs no such man youre sure her nostrils flared trouble he asked am i picking them up or you his heart rate settled back down without liz around boldt deferred to the womans decisions convinced that when it came to raising the children any woman knew better than any man boldt kept his mouth shut if he made marina mad liz would have his head you picking them up she informed him she shook her head in disgust her rich brown eyes trained on him in disapproval after work what are you doing here anyway it is too early i was in the neighborhood he confessed yes well i am not through the cleaning and you know how i am about people being in this house when i am to do the cleaning im leaving yes and you are picking up the children im picking them up mother of jesus the tings i put up with around here boldt returned to the vacant house and relocked the door back at the office he avoided making a report to lamoia ahead of the four oclock so that lamoia would not have to share the information spd would keep the vacant houses under surveillance through the night boldts discovery at the top of their list to this end he chased down gaynes who was noisily eating biscotti in the coffee lounge any luck she asked her mouth full a home west of green lake neighbor saw an exterminator casing the place she stopped chewing and stared at him then through the biscotti she said better than what i got she formed her fingers into a zero you check it out promising chair aimed at a window on the second floor i want to get back over there you mean you want me to get back over there she corrected understanding him you youve got kids and a wife to worry about she said quickly i didnt mean it like that he asked her what about andersons security tape im through about half of it its my latenight viewingfinger on the fast forward button not the best plot i tend to fall asleep pretty quickly and if youre sending me out tonight im not sending anybody anywhere i work upstairs im volunteering then she said the point is i wont be watching much tape ill take the first shift eight to two that okay its lamoias call he reminded you could always barge in on the four oclock and see if flemmings boys would like to help out he grinned what about dixie did anderson today she said interrupting referring to the medical examiner gaynes had a way of anticipating boldts thoughts it endeared her to him all done she nodded and said all but the pen and ink and continued to chew guy did the rubber ducky all right hit his throat on the tub but the tub didnt do him it was a twist to cervical vertebra number three and that came before the rubber ducky by the docs account before doc says the twist and shout came before the fall it wont get any better than theory but he does have lividity and a hematoma to suggest blockage of the carotid arteryalthough the rubber ducky was a little too on target to be absolutely sure the doer knows his anatomy that rubber ducky was either done by someone hoping to intentionally muddle an autopsy or simply in a hurry trying to cover his crime and he got lucky carotid artery boldt repeated strangled from behind cervical vertebra three is what iced him she reminded it was her turn to test him from behind he guessed the contact between the two might have explained the pollen being found on andersons clothing although he doubted it the knees of andersons pants had been covered with the yellow pollen snap crackle pop anderson turned his back on his visitorand good night so its a person tall enough and strong enough to work anderson from behind a man as paranoid as anderson the two must have known each other at the very least anderson trusted him enough to invite him in she asked one of his snitches someone like that you start talking about the guys head and you sound more like matthews than yourself you know that the comment stung him he didnt want anyone connecting them too closely the ghost of their one night together years earlier still lingered he had put it behind him as had she gaynes consumed the rest of the biscotti greedily and wiped ashen crumbs from her pouty lips she carried a tomboy look much of it from her mantailored clothing she said doc has some more tests to run before its welded when its official i want to know andersons important to us to lamoia he corrected she eyed him amusedly but then her expression changed gravely a victim she whispered knowingly yes he conceded if pieced together correctly andy anderson could talk to him from the grave and lead him and the investigation to the pied piper a victim he prayed silently there would be no more chapter lamoia entered the hotel lobby anxious to see her his pager had alerted him an hour earlier the phone number belonged to the inn at the market an upscale sixtyfiveroom hotel overlooking the public market and the churning marble green waters of elliott bay beyond he didnt know where she came up with the money for these rooms the inn was pricey and didnt rent by the hour he supposed that she knew the right peopleveteran captains often peddled their influence years of fighting the fight had its perks or perhaps the rumors that sheila hills east coast heritage came complete with a trust fund were accurate he had never had the nerve to ask she answered the door using it as a screen in case of any stray eyes in the hallway sheila hill was careful she wore a hotel robe and her hair pulled back her cheeks flushed as if coming off a workout the bathroom mirror was fogged from the shower his heart pounded at the sight of her he missed her company while at work bothered that their only contact was official she hung out the privacy tag and locked the door and pulled on the robes belt and it fell open revealing her carefully waxed crotch and a smooth tight stomach all work and no play she said its in the interest of the task force that youve come here she affected him both emotionally and physically something new for him like a thirsty animal to water he needed to fill her to hear her cry out for him but he wanted her laugh as well her ideas her insightshe understood people so completelyher calm guidance her company he unbuttoned his shirt unfastened his rodeo belt and opened his jeans she fell to her knees lets wait a minute he complained stunned by his own words he always pursued the physical women the hungry women since when did he want to talk he hardly knew himself she stood and turned to the wall spreading her legs she said take me now right here she leaned against the louvered mirror that served as the closet door and watched lamoia obeyed driven frantically to please her the smells and sounds overcame them both faster and harder she ordered in a tone that he found demeaning she was not his lover but the captain ordering this we have work to do he said briefly staying with a rhythm she suggested with her hips youre doing yours right now she returned ill handle the investigation he withdrew from her dont talk to me like that you bastard she spun around a playful expression creasing her face as she decided he was simply toying with her lamoia walked slowly backward into the room sheila hill pursuing him in matched steps what now she asked all fours im not your play toy he complained of course you are she approached both hands suddenly busy on her own body she knew him and his pressure points thats exactly what you are you love it we both love it because it comes without baggage but it comes and it comes hard she repeated what now you want to watch he did want to watchshe knew this about himbut he was too far along to stand back and do so he stepped forward turned her and threw her to the bed she laughed as she bounced youre so easy she said it drives you crazy when i do that doesnt it shut up make me in the minutes that passed she gasped between surges of pleasure her back arched her smiles twisted and pained when it was over she lay on the bed a glowing ruby spent and exhausted lamoia showered he returned to find her in the exact same position but her eyes were open deliriously taking in the whiteness of the ceiling and the flashing light of the smoke detector lets take room service she suggested lets talk about the surveillance it can wait you made the assignments everyones in place we have our pagers we do room service and another go i just showered he complained and you will again she laughed and sat up on the bed she looked older and more worn he wasnt sure what he was doing there he wasnt sure how to leave it was going wrong for him ill call it in she said whats your pleasure but it wasnt about his pleasure it was about hers nonetheless he answered a burger they dont do a burger darling this isnt white tower a disapproving condescending voice of a disappointed mother new york strip fillet whatever a salad what youre a waitress now he asked trying to lessen her but it wasnt his game it was hers if you want me to be whatever you want me to be baby have i ever refused you he felt trapped someplace he didnt want to be but didnt want to leave i want to talk he complained whatever you want baby but she didnt mean it and yet he stayed same as always chapter the following morning began simply for boldt the scare of the evening before behind him marinas husband felipe was to accompany his wife and boldts children to millies day care where boldt felt they would be safe his eyes tired from paperwork he freed up time to pursue credit records of earlier pied piper victims only to discover those records locked by order of the fbi an unexpected twist he placed a call to kay kalidja for an explanation but was unable to reach her several times his computer beeped signaling incoming email not every cop was on the system yet but each unit was from accounting to special ops intelligence had been one of the first online boldt did not yet fully appreciate the networkthe intranetalthough he understood how to operate it email was a nuisance it piled up worse than voice mail he recognized its enormous potential but reserved the right to use his email at his own convenience just because his computer beeped did not mean he responded his focus remained on the pied piper investigation and on several crime scene reports that were still being stonewalled by flemming under orders from hill boldt was to get those files no tears he was not to let her down boldt had homicide contacts in most major cities and was on a firstname basis with many of portlands finest so he tried portland first if he could present hill an early victory she might ease up on him the computer beeped at him again more email that made six since he had sat down it irritated him he didnt want to be counting beeps while he worked he knew the beeping could be switched off but had yet to learn howanother bothersome aspect of computers the simplest thing required twenty minutes of figuring out how to do it the overnight surveillance of vacant homes had failed to turn up any suspects or suspicious movements a major disappointment a few minutes past noon lamoia shared daechs list of vacant houses with the bureau along with boldts discovery of the rocking chair facing a window by early afternoon in the first real show of a coordinated effort the bureau and spd combined resources to identify any and all parental couples within visible range of the surveillance house discovered by boldt ironically it was through this effort that major progress was made in pinpointing how the pied piper selected his victims it was also through this effort that boldt finally connected with kay kalidja i received your voice mail sorry about the delay in getting back to you she apologized in her creamy island singsong it has been a little crazy around here this morning here too she said your people are pursuing recently issued birth certificatesa smart angle we have gained access to state tax filings that we can sort by zip code though with april fifteenth less than a month away and the targets under a year old they will not show up as deductions we also have access to applications for new social security numbers we have asked for those as well boldt offered the information he was anxious to share with her believing that the bureau had the authority to make the requests and receive the information days perhaps weeks ahead of spdsomething unmentionable around the hallways of public safety baby catalogs parenting magazines i know from experience that once you have a baby youre on every list there is the offers they send you the profound silence he encountered told him he had hit the mark this is good we should have been on this a long time ago he suggested you mean we should have been point taken this is very good lieutenant you the bureau would have quicker access to those mailing lists the publishers will be outofstate he added you didnt hear that from me are you telling me this is ours the disbelief in her voice unmistakable as far as im concerned you thought of it ms kalidja not me its all yours i do not know what to say this kind of cooperation well it has not been the norm boldt asked quid pro quo ah so thats it you know lieutenant i think you would get along well with my sac perhaps you would like to bring this up with him i didnt ask for flemming i asked for you exactly she replied thats because flemming has locked down all credit information on past victims i cant get access to any of it i figure he put you up to that another prolonged silence boldt didnt want a story from her he hoped she wasnt dreaming one up for him she said a precaution is all keep the media from disseminating information ahead of time or to keep local investigators from looking at it he asked lieutenant i need the financial recordscredit history bank accounts credit card activityof every family the pied piper targeted you can understand that im sure its where an investigation like this starts i put that request in to you personally long before there ever was a shotz or a weinstein when it failed to arrive after numerous subsequent requests i attempted to obtain those records myself and discovered they are stonewalled blocked now since youre flemmings intelligence officer you must have done this ive got to tell you that i didnt even know such a thing could be done it must have been one hell of a herculean effort to pull this off but now that youve done itand so successfullyi respectfully request that all such information be delivered to me by this afternoon but or he added quickly flemmings little end run will find its way to both local and national media and all the efforts in the world wont keep at least some of it from going public its going to come apart on you youre threatening me im an information gatherer ms kalidja i leave the threatening to others but if i were to threaten anyone it would be flemming not you from what i know about him flemming is a man who gets the job done nothing wrong with that hes known to like things his way ive been there myself but i wouldnt threaten a man like flemming id just expose him and let him deal with it no what im offering is a trade im trading you a damn good lead for information i should have had in my hands two weeks ago whos getting the better end of this one i dont have the information you request lieutenant her voice held a note of apology youre the intelligence officer any such information would have gone through your office it may have passed through she conceded but it did not stick she was giving him something revealing something boldt could hear the tentative reluctance in her silky voice at spd such information would have been copied filed and disseminated to those with a need to know the bureau couldnt be much different and yet what she was telling him was that she had either failed to make copies or had been ordered not to do so either explanation was insufficient and yet intriguing what the hell was going on over there local fbi against the nationals perhaps the lockdown had little to do with keeping local police away from it and everything to do with preventing their own fbi field office investigators from running with it he asked what office received that information special agent i cannot say were doing each other favors here and i am afraid mine have run out if you are dissatisfied and would like to take back no he said its yours i dont go back on a trade even when i get the short shrift i will see what i can do that is the best i can offer that is as much as any of us can offer he said gratefully and i thank you for that lieutenant i am certain you did background checks on us coming into this and of course we did the sameor rather i did let me just say that from everything i have read i have great respect for you both as a person and your service record quite frankly as intelligence officer it was my job to speculate on who would head spds task force and i suggested to my superiors it would be you i am aware of your wifes illness and i offer my sympathies and those of this agency i have to think that given other circumstances it would have been you running the show over there and i think they could use you i value greatly the information you have just given me and i hope to earn your respect as well as the investigation continues id be happier boldt confided in her if it didnt continue if it stopped today yes of course boldt thanked her hung up and spun around in his chair with the sounding of the beep that signaled his email on his computer screen a menu appeared with a full list of the waiting mail this most recent arrival was a remindera second messagefrom the mail room that boldt had received a package marked urgent as intelligence officer with snitches and informants spread around the city like traffic lights boldt could ill afford to leave any urgent package gathering dust some informants used the phones otherspoliticians and white collars mostlyabhorred them preferring the written word always anonymous by the time boldt picked up his package it had been xrayed electronically sniffed for explosives and run through a magnetometer for metal densityas safe as modern technology could make it for opening ronnie lyte ran mail room security its a cd maybe boldt realized he had hurried down to the basement mail room for nothing the me doc dixon and he exchanged favorite jazz works all the time along with sids bernie lofgrin they had something of a jazz enthusiasts club boldts love leaned to keyboards and tenor until lizs illness boldt had occasionally held a happy hour piano gig at bear berensons comedy club doc dixon leaned toward trumpet players though he also had a keen ear for tenor sax lofgrin was drummers and bass players he considered the rhythm section of any group the most important boldt immediately mistook this cd as a gift from dixon whose offices were a mile away in the basement of harbor view medical center the padded envelope had been stapled three times at the fold the package bore no stamps no postage meter label no stamp or sticker from one of the citys many messenger services this offered boldt the first twinge of unease his name and the address had been printed by computer on regular paper and the paper taped to the package using two pieces of wide clear packing tape boldt studied all this howd we get it no clue ronnie lyte said the mail room was run by three asian civilians administered by sue lu boldt shouted across to lu someone sign for this dont remember it black kid delivered it one of her assistants answered no signature required except from you that is a messenger not someone im familiar with the young man answered not a regular a cold drop is that what youre telling me a delivery lieutenant the young man replied guy said it was urgent but what guy boldt said exasperated we get a couple dozen couriers in here a day lu explained to boldt defending her assistant and herself was it logged boldt asked every arrival is logged the assistant confirmed checking a computer terminal arrived twenty minutes ago we sent you an email i dont care about the email i care about how it arrived who delivered it he felt a growing sense of anxiety in his chest a part of him did not want to open it another part could not wait but he wanted the details straight first the label and the lack of postage had triggered a series of internal alarms if the envelope contained cash and not a cd boldt wanted witnesses to its being opened intelligence officers regularly faced attempts to compromise them the smarter people behind such attempts left all details off the delivery of the bribe waiting to make later contact the cd might be a ruse the true contents a roll of a couple hundred a couple thousand dollars in cash boldt needed witnesses im opening it here he announced he marked the time aloud this won the attention of sue lu who joined him knowing he was requesting a witness she checked her own watch and confirmed the time boldt opened the padded envelope and disgorged its contents a single goldcolored cd in a clear jewelers box the words optical media were printed on the disk along with some manufacturing information no letter or note no explanation everything about this bothered him he handed the padded envelope to lu who looked it over empty she said just the cd he agreed its a cdr she informed him pointing out the initials on the disk its marked data not music for use with a computer cdrom i need a computer with a cdrom player boldt asked her both testing that he had it right and asking her for advice where he might find one tech services media lab she informed him adding they have everything in there tech services occupied two glorified basement closets that communicated by a doorway cut through a cement block wall an array of electronic gear predominantly audiovideo and computer occupied black rack mounts that in some instances ran floor to ceilinglinoleum to acoustic tile twice the rooms had experienced water damage due to errant plumbing damaging gear and blowing circuit breakers as a precaution against such accidents a clear plastic canopy had been installed as a kind of shortstop the sheets of plastic were taped together with silver duct tape in places partially obscuring the overhead fluorescent tube boldt was shown to a computer terminal in the corner of the back room were working on some audio tapes in the other room the technician explained offering boldt a set of headphones that were in bad condition he plugged them into one of the rackmounted devices i dont think its music boldt said not understanding the offer of headphones ive got a cd player in my office its cdr the tech explained recordable cdrom multimedia probably or why not just send a disk these babies hold six hundred and forty megs of data thats why with compression shit its damn near bottomless what do i do the man set up the disk in the machine double click this baby when youre ready he said pointing to the screen it should do the rest he reminded dont forget the disk when youre done people are always forgetting their disks he tapped his earlobe you go through this a lot do you boldt asked sarcastically headphones the man reminded boldt slipped the headphones on as the tech left him he double clicked the cd icon and sat back watching the screen his anxiety still with him someone had gone to a lot of trouble the average snitch liked things simple money for information this felt more white collar more upmarket and that generally meant power and influenceentities that intelligence ran up against from time to time the computer took a moment to access the cdrom the word wait flashed in the message bar as if he had a choice the screen suddenly changed to a light gray background and a credit cardsized box appeared in the center of the screen ambient room sound hissed in his ear reminding boldt of interrogation tapes but there was something else in the sound a radio or tv the small box in the center of the screen showed a small childa girlin a chair he scrambled for his reading glasses the girl appeared bound to the chair worse she looked alarmingly like his own sarah although the room was unfamiliar to him a pale yellow wall behind her grandmother curtains on a window behind her and to her right to the childs left a television set played cnn the voices of the news anchors distant and vague all at once the image animated the girl looked left in a movement all too familiar to boldt the reading glasses found their way to boldts eyes and he leaned in for a better look not possible a voice inside him warned terror stung him as she spoke as he heard that voice all doubt was removed sarah screamed daddy she rocked violently her arms taped to the chair daddy the video image went black replaced by a typewritten message in the same small box boldt could not read it for the tears in his eyes he saw her all at once as a small fragile creature cradled between his open palm and elbow a tiny little newborn a treasure of expressions and sounds a promise of life the enormous responsibility he felt to nurture and protect her he wiped away his tears returned the glasses and read the message on the screen sarah is safe and unharmed she will remain so as long as the task forces investigation wanders do not allow it to focus do not allow any suspect to be pursued if you are clever your daughter lives and is returned to you happy and safe this i promise if you speak of this to another living soul if the investigation should net a suspect you will never see your sweet sarah again think clearly this is a choice you must make make it wisely boldt reread the warning stood from the chair and then sagged back down he closed the file and took the cd out of the machine think he demanded of himself no thoughts able to land his balance gone the room spinning he drew in a deep breath and exhaled slowly the pied piper might have spies anywhere paranoia overtook him boldt stood up slowly like an invalid testing his unsure legs chills rushed up and down his spine his face burned someone spoke to him in the hall and again on the elevator and in the garagehe saw their mouths move he heard the shapes of sound but not the words he was someplace no one could reach him he ran several red lights on his way to the yellow house where sarah and miles spent their middays with fifteen other children he bounded the stairs two at a time and attempted to turn the doorknob locked he pounded hardtoo hard too loudly too furiously if you speak of this to another living soul hurried footsteps approached noisily the fisheye peephole momentarily darkened as someone inspected him from the other side hurry up he wanted to shout but collected himself as the door came open millie wiggins stood before him surprised mr boldt sarah he asked his voice cracking as he stepped past the woman and into the playroom sight of the children playing choked him and squeezed tears close to the surface sarah he called loudly into the room drawing blank expressions from the children a pair of tiny arms clutched at his leg and he looked down to see his son beaming up at him he reached down and hoisted miles into his arms sarah he pleaded to millie wiggins you called she whispered reminding him the police officers you sent picked her up she glanced at the large mickey mouse clock on the wall that was ninethirty he too glanced up at the clock five hours had passed a lifetime he tried to speak to contradict her but the policeman inside him the father caught his tongue he turned away and cleared his eyes as miles tugged on his tie millie wiggins spoke in a gravel voice an attractive woman in her midforties she wore jeans and a white turtleneck i called you back dont forget to verify i mean her hands wormed in concern he could not afford the truth he measured how far to push two officers right he asked she had used the plural she nodded a woman and a man exactly as you said its okay isnt it she looked him over is everything all right she added reluctantly with mrs boldt mommy miles asked his father fine fine he said avoiding sending the wrong signal sarah he needed to collect himself time to think he needed answers sarahs chance depended on the next few minutes and for how long after that he wondered he wanted desperately to take miles with him but if the kidnappers had wanted miles then the boy wouldnt have been there if the day care center was being watchedif boldt was under surveillance he mired down in uncertainty and paranoia up to his axles in it poisoned with fear faint and weak he placed his son down and said to millie wiggins i didnt want miles feeling left out thought i should stop by hoping this might sound convincing it fell short his mind whirred its one of those mornings where i cant tell up from down i even forget where i was when we spoke this morning which line did you call i called nineoneone just as you told me she reported i spoke to you hung up and dialed nineoneone they put me through the ecc lacked any means to relay a call to headquarters it was technically impossible boldt knew this millie wiggins clearly did not her explanation baffled him you sure it was nineelevennineoneone and not you told me to call you back on nineoneone she reminded him viewing him suspiciously she had it wrong it was the only explanation why should she remember he wondered it was important only to him memory played tricks on people he declined to push her any further he felt aimless and lost she snapped her fingers i almost forgot she hurried into the busy room and returned as quickly she brought her hand up for him to see the lady police officer wanted me to give you this said it was a private joke that youd understand in her outstretched hands she held a dimestore pennywhistle chapter unaccustomed to an invitation for coffee from boldt daphne matthews found herself caught by surprise neither of them drank coffee and they didnt arrange secret meetings not any longer du jour a small lunch cafe on first avenue offered yuppie chow and an expansive view of the bay this choice also surprised her boldt leaned more toward tea and scones at the four seasons olympic he was known as a regular in the garden room he occupied a table pressed up against the huge glass window overlooking the bay and the lush green of the islands beyond she bought herself a tea at the cafeteriastyle counter her eyes on boldt understanding immediately and with great certainty that something was terribly wrong liz she thought as she approached she noticed his slouched shoulders the redness of his eyes and nose and his cup of tea which was not steaming and had gone untouched he hadnt added the milk yet she recognized grief when she saw it hey she said casually pulling out her own chair he didnt stand not the lou boldt she knew ah he said looking up at her woodenly taking no time to express any kind of welcome she felt unimportant she sat down i need a favor daffy and its perfectly fine if you dont want to do it but if youre willing to do it to help me out then all i ask is that you dont ask any questions none not one its important for both of us for everybody that you not ask any questions does that include now he looked up at her and then to the door of the cafe thats a question he informed her he seemed to have aged a dozen years liz she thought again she felt sad he had brokenfrankly she had expected it sooner no questions at all better that way he answered safer a furtive check toward the front of the restaurant grief could cause strange behavior in the strongest of people you cant go back to the office looking like this she warned and that is not a question he never quite got his clothes right tending to carry a part of his last meal on them somewhere the new breeds of permanent press were made with him in mind but he stayed with natural fibers all cottons and wools and as a result looked like an unmade bed most of the time he rarely shaved without missing a spot or two ill pull it together he said and keep it there she asked his eyes betrayed him her question brought threatening tears he understood his own vulnerability this was significant to her lou one of the slogans i use is dare to share it takes some nerve but its worth the risk she waited a moment hoping this might sink in might trigger an effort trust me please he leaned the weight of his head into the crutch of his open palm covering his mouth and stretching his eyes open grotesquely he spoke through his fingers muddying his speech its a favor is all itll take you most of the rest of the day at the hospital at home a drive a drive she repeated you and me me alone all questions he answered his eyes betraying his pain she hated herself let me start all over please please forgive me let me just say yes whatever it is whatever it entails yes the answer is yes the thing is he explained in a lifeless drone im preoccupied with something else and marina is out its you or bear or dixie im asking you first is all it doesnt mean you have to do it and im honored i have already accepted daphne reminded him i could use a drive she added where to what for then she caught herself in another question and apologized softly he needed soft at the moment you remember the luxwash up above green lake the arson case of course be there in an hour he checked his watch one hour she tensed at the request intelligence involved itself in a variety of complex investigations from political corruption conspiracies to eavesdropping on the asian mob was this workrelated or personal had she gotten it wrong one hour at the luxwash she repeated dryly i can make it sooner if you want but no later he cautioned an hour is fine plenty of time an hour then park to the east out on eightieth ill pull past i wont honk or anything youll have to be watching youll come in behind me and we pull into the line that way me directly ahead of you decline the interior cleaning that means you can stay in your car and wont go into the waiting room youll need a full tank maybe a snack animal crackers he blurted out as if picking her snack miles she said suddenly understanding she had been around the boy enough to make that connection his eyes flashed angrily maybe an apple granny smiths got it it was miles sarah too she wondered she wanted to ask about car seats but didnt genuinely concerned he asked her youre sure you dont mind he glanced once again toward the cash register as if expecting someone else one hour at the luxwash she repeated do exactly as ive told you he stated harshly then he stood the chair legs crying against the floor yes she agreed dont follow out for several minutes no thats important several minutes i understand she didnt at all he walked out of the cafe filling the light in the doorway moving into silhouette which removed all identity it was raining again gray begetting gray she wanted springtime she wanted boldt well again she kept track of the time on her watch knowing from experience that minutes took forever to pass when she was rattled a ferry sounded its call haunting and lonely it reminded her of him vacant and distant and casting no reflection she checked her watch again three minutes had passed in fiftyseven more she was due at the car wash she waited for him parked on th street north her attention trained on the outboard rearview mirror he was five minutes late which was not like him she understood the car wash routine they had used similar tricks before life as a cop was part deception of all the cops on the force she was the most devoted to boldt his chevy pulled past no acknowledgment she couldnt see into his car through the light drizzle but she suspected miles was in there she remained attentive as she followed him into the car wash entrance the chevy rounded the back corner and an attendant armed with a long vacuum hose arrived at the drivers door carrying an umbrella boldt waved him off daphne pushed the send button on the cell phone at the same time as she rolled down her drivers window and also declined the interior work two in a row was too much for the attendant he looked at her with a slack jaw and asked no no she answered definitely rolling up the window and hoping boldt would answer his own cellular the chevy pulled into the foaming shower of soap and spray followed a moment later by her honda both cars swallowed by the machinery the rinse water followed and immediately behind that powerful jets of air that drove rivulets of water out across the hood and up the windshield like a silver fan within that blur boldt emerged from his car carrying a large child seat with his son strapped inside in his other hand he carried a duffle bag the exchange happened quickly and in the bending distorted light of the car wash boldt appeared to jump across the front of her car and suddenly was wrenching open her side door and working the car seat into the back and fixing a seat belt across it as he moved to keep pace with the wash conveyor he handed her a crushed and wrinkled sheet of paper saying something about it being their address he told her not to stop at the end of the washhe would pay for her he added youre not to use your cell phone for any reason the car door thumped shut soaking wet boldt hurried and reentered the chevy just before it emerged from the throat of the machinery at a red light she reached down and unfolded the piece of paper he had handed her katherine sawyer boldts sister a street address in wenatchee washington a phone number a long drive ahead of her where was sarah she wondered a moment later another more terrifying thought occurred was this the question boldt did not want asked chapter boldt sequestered himself in his office phones off to decide what to do well aware that whatever his decision it would determine not only his future but his daughters as well the weather did not coincide with his mood the heavy cloud cover having given way to warm sunlight the color of daffodils he pulled down the offices slatted blinds to darken the room but ended up with a striped floor desk walls and chair surrounded appropriately enough in a cage of light jailed just as he felt the kidnapper might have asked for money for all of boldts worldly goods he might have asked that liz use her banking authority in some way a false account a fake loan but instead he asked the impossible that boldt subvert an investigation in the balance hung his daughters life there was not therefore any decision to be madethe choice was obvious and yet boldt found himself engaged in debate understanding how the pied piper had kept from being caught had frustrated flemming and his team had moved city to city with a license to pluck infant children from their parents arms it was no wonder he hadnt been caught that investigators had so few leads the deck had been stacked in each city once committed there was no turning back his powers farreaching the lieutenant of intelligence had only to pick up the phone to initiate interdepartmental wiretapping if he were to compromise the investigation then he needed every piece of it every whisper every consideration information was everything he had to know it all he ran the names off to the civilian who ran tech services hill mulwright lamoia gaynes lofgrin he waited for some kind of acknowledgment when the man on the other end failed to speak boldt said do you have that ive got it record all of them he stated twentyfour hour loops or real time real time he added what happened to live monitoring this is too many lines unless you can provide the personnel no other choices ai the man offered artificial intelligence its a new system prone to bugs but weve used it a couple times to good effect you lost me the software monitors the phone lines listening for key words you put in coke or smack and if the words come up the conversation is flagged when it works it works beautifully but the bugs arent out it crashes from time to time i gotta be honest with you he ordered the phone lines monitored by ai to wiretap lines out of office required warrants and therefore a visit to a judge boldt worked with only one judge the most liberal in the statethis judge had been passed to him by the former lieutenant of the squad like a mentor after hearing boldts arguments viewing the numbers requested and understanding their significance the judge asked only one question of him i take it you see no other way to monitor the situation or you wouldnt ask theres an insider boldt said blankly knowing full well he was describing himself has to be someone compromising the investigation steering it off course we find that person and the investigation just might have a fighting chance the gray head nodded the pen came out of the drawer the signature went down boldt had authority to wiretap the fbi they have ways of protecting themselves from such things dont they the judge asked the warrant gives us access to the landlines themselves im told by our tech people that it makes all the difference we go through the us west switching station i dont care who you go through the shits going to fly if they get onto this you and i are going to be right in the middle of it and that means you he warned he who complains the loudest is the first person we investigate boldt countered its me he wanted to say but who would listen lou boldt compromise a task force investigation not likely he did it for sarah he reminded himself repeatedly for liz for the family but with each step he took toward his darker side he questioned his decision and he knew even then that before long he would wish that he could take it all back chapter boldt reached his wifes hospital room but stopped at the door for these last weeks of her treatment and the complications surrounding it his single greatest responsibility had been their children time and again she had offered him options from marina moving in with him and the kids to parking the kids with various family members until liz was home again but boldt had taken these as a test both from her and from himself could he handle the kids alone with a few hours from marinawhich he could afford on his lieutenants salarycould he make the family work the larger unspoken question had to do with his abilities if he lost liz if the cancer claimed her as the doctors suggested it would he needed to know and so he had repeatedly declined her proposals reassuring her he had everything under control but now at the hospital room door tears were stealing his vision for the umpteenth time because nothing was in control in one moment his life had become a runaway train nurses passing by took him as a grieving husband here on the c ward beds emptied quickly and forever images like the one of boldt weeping at his wifes door were not at all uncommon despite his rehearsal on the way over what did he hope to say to her how would he explain the loss of their child what effect might it have on her health could he live with the responsibility of knocking her out of remission and back into the hell of her disease racked by ill conscience he allowed himself the lie that he might recover sarah in a matter of a day or two he had every key player in the task force under wire surveillance he had kay kalidja working on the victims financials he had millie wiggins statement from the day care center about calling and being put through to boldt an impossibility that required further investigation leads the cop in him convinced the father and husband somewhere something would break and when it did sarah would be home again the incident in past tense an acceptable scenario lou her voice called out from the other side of the door honey had she recognized the sound of her husbands tears or had her uncanny prescience of late detected his presence there he stepped back and away and into the center of the hall afraid honey he heard her voice again he turned and walked as fast as his feet would carry him tempted toward an allout run he might have been paged he might have been called or summoned back to the office it happened all the time what of it a dozen excuses hung there in the offering awaiting him memorized from decades of use but useless because he knew the truth lies his own voice echoed in his head a voice unfamiliar to him a voice he was learning to live with once begun there was no turning back the infection was rampant of the two of them liz was no longer the terminally ill he was chapter daphne approached the regular four oclock agonized over her assignment hill had requested a snapshot evaluation of every member of the task forceall of whom would be in attendance hill had offered no explanation for the unusual request leaving daphne anxious hill had her own grand entrance planned for a few minutes into the meeting she wanted daphnes attention paid to this moment reactions and attitude changes she had explained sheila hill remained a nut daphne found hard to crack more photographs had been added to the situation rooms walls death and abduction childrens faces everywhere in attendance were mulwright lamoia hale flemming kalidja and herself sids lofgrin had delivered a report and was available as necessary boldt was two floors away mulwright kicked things off by complaining to flemming about the fbi labs failure to report back on the automotive glass found at several of the crime scenes the lab had been asked to help id the product number found on one of the pieces spd had heard nothing flemming defended the delay citing recent political and media pressure that had adversely affected the fbi lab daphne studied tone of voice eye movement and body language of each and every participant state of mind was more difficult the group worked well together when dealing with specifics they anxiously awaited the analysis of the pollen the lab work on the glass chips and put great hope in the surveillance of the vacant houses the proposed direction for the investigation segregated down departmental lines spd put faith in andersons killing and a possible connection to the abductions flemming wanted little to do with anderson insisting that kay kalidjas suggestion to pursue catalog and magazine subscriptions offered the greatest chance for a breakthrough mulwright proposed concentrating all manpower on surveillance of families with infant children that lived within sight of the abandoned house boldt had discovered flemming argued against this citing manpower demands he suggested they notify all parents in the area reminding no child has been taken from a parentonly from baby sitters and relatives of the family in the two weeks since the shotz abduction this was the first mention of this and for daphne it went to the psychology of the pied piper she blurted out he doesnt want the confrontation a parent would offer hes afraid of violence all heads turned to face her my point is flemming said that if a parent stays with that child there will be no kidnapping daphne said hes punishing the parent for leaving the child in someone elses care silence overtook the room she said hes giving those children to parents desperate for their own parents who care parents who wont leave that child for anything mumbo jumbo hale quipped flemming reprimanded his agent with a stern look to the others he said the point is if we alert the public now we may save some children sheila hill came through the door without knocking she won the immediate attention of nearly every man in the room drawn like moths to light she wore a plain gray suit white shirt and black flats a simple silver necklace hung over her collarbone her lipstick was fleshtoned her hair brushed smooth and held with a clip nothing showy the spd officers stood for her the fbi followed reluctantly in that instant the mood changed authority walked through that door even flemming seemed to understand this daphne sat up and took notice at a few minutes before four that same afternoon a rainstorm relenting to the east lou boldt crossed an internal threshold and like an exdrunk sitting in front of a bottle of whiskey reached out and took his first sip he simply couldnt sit there staring at it if the two who had abducted his daughter had believed him capable of passivity they had guessed wrong the cop in him won out the only way he would ever see his daughter alive again was to beat his own people to the pied piper locate his daughter and do whatever had to be done to take her back he ruled out nothing the plan was a simple oneeat or be eaten his choice was made tech services was to provide him twice daily with cassettes of conversations that contained the key words hed specified kidnap kidnapping abduction babies infants task force and the names of every player including the victims and andy anderson the tapes were delivered in an interdepartmental envelope that had to be signed for by boldt himself just another day in intelligence but this time boldt was eavesdropping on his own people he listened to most of the conversations with the tape speed doubled voices like chipmunks but the spoken words understandable a twominute phone call became one life in half time as he listened he thought that he had failed as a father husband and cop a dozen shouldhavedones presented themselves but all in hindsight he recalled bottlefeeding sarah in the living room as the morning sun warmed a darkened sky the smell of the top of her head the delicious sounds she made while eating he recalled the softness of her feet and the strong grip of her toes he ached beyond anything he had ever experienced a knot of pain seized his chest unrelenting adding to this anguish was the solitude of his secret he could not face people he shut and locked his office door and turned off his phone but he locked himself in another room as well the father in himthe failurewouldnt let him out of the dark room of his guilt and grief a glimpse of a family photo sarahs crayon art the tiny baby shoes on the bookshelf these were the personal reminders he could not live with and yet could not bear to remove from this point of utter desperation he struggled back reaching the most difficult decision of his life the pied piper was not going to dictate his actions he would turn on his own people if necessary but sarah would not be used to allow other children to be kidnapped as lead lamoia had both the anderson file and the task force book on the pied piper in his possession boldt could have submitted official requests for any such reports and fileshe considered doing thatbut then a more ominous question presented itself did the pied piper have a way of monitoring boldts activities was there a second insider had a second cop been compromised was someone monitoring his every move boldt had to conduct his own investigation while hindering the efforts of the task force to be seen obeying the ransom demands while secretly working to locate sarah and get her back any sudden interest on his part in evidence records and case files might send the wrong signal if he couldnt request them he had to steal them flemming glanced over at his subordinate dunkin hale in what daphne realized was a signal addressing mulwright hale said lieutenant if you agree we would like to suggest spd canvass pawnshops for andersons camera mulwright countered in a sharply sarcastic tone it would help if we knew what kind of camera were looking for special agent hill caught on and said are you suggesting that anderson was a heist gone bad not a murder associated with the kidnappings its possible hale replied he then informed the group the camera is a kodak dc a digital camera that andersons credit card records show he purchased in november of last year hills face went scarlet we want the camera yes but for the record anderson connects via the pollen she protested flemming said calmly andersons computer may contain digitally stored photographs it has been sent to washington for analysis you shipped it east without so much as telling us lamoia complained what he did not divulge was that the sid technicians had discovered a number of backup disks in andersons bookshelf that were currently being analyzed if the disks contained digital photographs spd would have them ahead of flemming im telling you now flemming said we use the four oclocks to share information not all of us lamoia thought he smiled and said thanks for sharing the clock clicked into place pm lamoia would still be at the four oclock his office cubicle unattended boldt did not miss the irony of approaching an office cubicle and desk that had once been his own at pm the duty rotation had occurred and lamoias squad had technically gone off their day shift because of the caseload demands of the pied piper investigation most of his team kept right on working logging coveted overtime combining the two squads could have meant a chaotic fifth floor but it didnt work out that way because of the surveillance duty adding to the floors peace and quiet was that the civilian employeesthe secretaries clerks receptionistshad gone home as boldt entered homicide he glanced first toward the lieutenants office a large room with two desks shared by shoswitz and davidson the lights were on boldt kept his head down and moved quickly it was rare that both lieutenants occupied the room at the same timethey handled separate rotationsbut the chaos of the task force had added hours to both mens watch if either lieutenant spotted him he would need to come up with an excuse for roaming around homicide head down he slipped past and headed directly to lamoias desk where a deerskin jacket hung on the back of the chair the adjacent desk belonged to leon kreuter a detective on davidsons squad another of the middleaged homicide detectives who felt that boldts prolonged years as sergeant had hurt their promotionsan argument boldt didnt buy kreuter was a talker he would make a point of nosing into boldts affairs lamoias desk would not be safe for long his heart pounding heavily boldt hurried to lamoias cubicle and sat down twice the size of any other file the task force book was easy to spot andersons was more elusive he ran through the paperwork in plain sight but struck out he pulled on the desk drawer and found it locked at the same instant two voices boomed from down the hall the louder of which belonged to leon kreuter sitting at his former desk he suddenly realized that in the course of transition he had handed the desk key over to lamoia but not the duplicate key he had always kept in his wallet he didnt remember having ever disposed of the key he dug into his wallets warm sticky leather and came up with it kreuters voice moved toward him all of a sudden the topic not cop talk but the performance of fourwheeldrive utility vehicles versus pickup trucks a detectives desk area was offlimits chain of custody rules for active files required the signatures of both officers searching the contents of another officers deskeven a friendswas simply not done worse an intelligence officer caught snooping around homicide would sound alarms as much as boldt felt a part of this floor his new posting cast him as an outsider even to members of his former squad while considering all this he unlocked the desk kreuters laughing voice drew closer boldt slid the center drawer open no files next drawer andersons file had been placed on top of a kleenex box boldt grabbed it and slid the drawer shut he tried to turn the small key but it slipped out of his fingers and fell to the carpet kreuter said clearly and she handles turns like a dream you cant believe the thing is fourwheel forced to leave the desk unlocked boldt fled toward the copy room both files clutched tightly under his arm his heart painful in his chest his face stinging hot homicides copy room looked like a paper warehouse its walls adorned with dozens of far side cartoons its shelves stacked with reams of paper products the copier itself was the size of a freezer locker it hummed loudly green display lights lit up like a christmas tree the room was always a good fifteen degrees warmer than any other making it a sweatshop it smelled of paper bleach and body odor the door did not lock nor was it ever seen closed so boldt left it open feeling vulnerable his back to the hall he had never worked undercover he didnt know how people did it a greater offense than lifting the files was to be caught copying themcause for immediate internal review knowledge remained the key to sarahs chances he fed the copier groups of pages and it devoured them the anderson file took less than two minutes he started in on the task force book a formidable job a pair of voices approached from down the hallway boldt collected the paperwork in a rush of adrenaline but then the voices faded past him and again he returned to copying he checked his watch as he fed another stack into the machine twenty minutes had lapsed since his entering homicide he bundled the photocopies into a stack and tucked it up under his shirt against his spine held snug by the waist of his pants his sport coat further hid it from view he clamped the original folders under his arm and marched with purpose back down the hall all went well until he glanced over and spotted doris shotz keeping vigil in one of homicides formed fiberglass chairs boldt stopped and stared understanding this womans agony for the first time doris shotz looked over at him and boldt felt her helplessness her frustration and anger they briefly met eyes what is it she asked him from across the room suddenly agitated her hands worming in her lap her eyes dropped to the folders he was carrying searching for answers boldt shifted them to the opposing arm as he did so the strained voice of lt peter davidson said inciting the natives davidson was an exfootball type with the chest and the attitude to prove it his beer gut and spiderweb blood vessels spoke of his favorite pastime dont get her fired up he complained and dont get her hopes up either just leave her alone she is alone boldt said understanding perfectly well thats the problem what are you doing on this floor anyway he looked boldt over looked right at the files in boldts hands spying on us spying on your former squad boldt kept his arm to where it covered the tabs on the files of course i am boldt said sarcastically tapping the files spying on all of you davidson smiled right i thought so boldt headed directly to lamoias desk relieved to see kreuters cubicle empty once againsome cops spent all their time between the coffee lounge and the mens room he returned both files to the drawer finding his key proved more difficult he looked where he expected it to bebeneath the deskbut didnt see it if lamoia found his desk unlocked that was unacceptable boldt intentionally dropped his pen toed it under the desk and then kneeled to retrieve it he didnt see the key he shoved aside the trash can and there it was at the moment he retrieved the key the door to homicide buzzed and boldt looked back to see a pair of ostrich cowboy boots approaching while youre at it fella empty the trash lamoia teased if youre planting a bug forget it im onto you with mention of the bug boldt bumped his head on the underside of the desk boldts only chance to lock the desk was to put his body between lamoia and the mans desk he backed out from under stood and feigned a sudden loss of balance leaning onto the desk for support he blindly attempted to fit the key into the lock but couldnt get it he mumbled stood a little too fast his fingers working furiously the key slipped in the lock he pocketed it you okay a concerned lamoia asked fine boldt answered wondering what kind of person deceived his closest friends wanting lamoias thoughts elsewhere he asked howd the four oclock go he felt so cheap desperate people take desperate measures he recalled daphne once saying hill wants you in her office lamoia advised him me lamoia nodded and teased youre not in trouble are you sarge your boys been putting cameras in the girls locker room again had hill found out about the wiretapping boldt felt the color drain from his face too much deceit to keep the lies straight one day into it and he couldnt keep himself together maybe you oughta sit down lamoia said im fine boldt lied by design task force books did not necessarily duplicate one another the copy of lamoias was packed with evidence reports sid workups daphnes psychology profiles and boldts intelligence summaries it contained the most recent sid forensics sweep of andersons apartment and a short writeup on the backup disks with anderson their only palpable victim boldt read carefully his tired eyes working down each sheet lamoias idea of organization differed from his he found navigating the paperwork difficult finally he reached the photocopies of the crime scene photographs including two series from andersons apartment he scrutinized these on his third pass he grinned he picked up the phone and dialed gaynes a few minutes later they met in the lobby his paranoia forcing him to recognize that if he could so easily eavesdrop on others the reverse was also true he walked her to a nearby restaurant caught up in happy hour dark wood marble and polished brass gleaming mirrorssuits soft wools spike heels cigars the noise level was deafening not a cop to be seen bobbie did not turn heads though if attitude had been looks she would have silenced the place he found a pair of stools in the corner looking out at an avenue crowded with buses her legs were a little too short to reach the stools footrest since when do you buy me a drink sarge gaynes was always out front with him it was part of the reason for his enormous respect for her especially at digs like this buying favors why else why else indeed thing is sarge you dont need to buy them know what i mean depends on what they are no actually it doesnt she said waving the busy waitress over to them she had an extraordinary presence this one two things boldt said keeping his voice to a level where it reached only her ears go she said studying him carefully you look like shit by the way he hadnt changed clothes in fortyeight hours true story he answered is it your wife you can sign off on andersons file he said not wanting any more of that i had better be able to im lead on anderson she reminded proudly thats what im saying go so youll do thatyoull get the file back from lamoia understood a scotch was delivered neat she sampled it and approved youll go through the sid crime scene photos the more recent ones not the march twenty group something is going to occur to you she placed down the scotch studied him and nodded grimly go she said though less enthusiastically you found andersons clothes on the bathroom floor including shoes that were still tied that was good work in an abstract way we can match those clothes with those shoes so what are we missing when it comes to the clothes in the hamper shoes youre a peach bobbie you know that he waited for her im looking for shoes in the sid photos she stated shoes or boots she answered i want the lab report on those boots twentyfour hours before anyone else sees it her eyes revealed her shock boldt did not make end runs sarge he pulled out a fivedollar bill and placed it on the counter that fronted the window outside a homeless man was trolling for rushhour philanthropy he had a threelegged dog with mangy fur gaynes took out her notebook and neatly wrote out several reminders this time she waited for him sarge whatever it isand i dont to want to know thank you very muchyoure not alone okay his eyes stung with encroaching tears if there was one thing he felt it was alone thanks he said she drank the scotch in two swigs and banged the glass down she cleared her throat burned by the drink without looking at him she added you need a shoulder im here what about andersons front door video any progress ill be through it by tonight promise didnt you say that last time he checked his own notes and the earwax he asked andersons earwax i put in the request with the doc he should a sent it over to sid follow it up he instructed can i ask something she asked no he answered bluntly surprising her he tempered it by saying no id rather you didnt he had hurt her fine she said toying with the empty scotch glass she slipped off the stool ill let you know what i find out bobbie he called out wishing hed handled her differently some guy in red suspenders turned his head he looked about twelve years old and was smoking an illegal cigar what he said im bobby what the hell you want boldt walked past him too annoyed to think what to say sheila hills office lacked any feminine touches cluttered with paperwork newspapers and stacks of files it nonetheless had an image of control she motioned boldt into one of the two straightbacked gunmetal gray chairs and clicked a shoe off unseen under her desk you mind she asked lighting up a cigarette it was illegal in a public building first things first she said andersons computer how we let the feds get hold of it is beyond me its obvious we need to know whatever they know the minute they know it i can try boldt said thinking of kalidja but its not as if i have ears over there yeah well get some get a line on themthis is need to know this is no bullshit they sent it to washington boldt reminded bernie knows a couple civilians in the lab whatever it takes which brings me to my more important point he felt it coming she knew about the wiretap and she was about to cut him off at the knees she stood and checked her door she locked it she took the smoke over to the window sat down turned toward boldt and faced him with her stockinged feet up on the desk she spoke unusually softly for her this goes no further than us boldt felt a chill up his spine he was busted he felt certain of it okay are you with me boldt nodded tentatively hill had an imposing femininity about her sitting so close to her boldt felt drawn into her captivated were all thinking adoption ring at this point okay so if were right then theres some serious money in play market price for an illegal is anywhere from twenty to seventy thousand white babies on the high side thats a million bucks and counting boldt wondered why hill had waited to weigh in behind the adoption theory where was she leading plenty of spare change for a few favors she met eyes with boldt you see what im driving at maybe i do he said you look at these reports and you realize that in each and every city the pied piper blows town only days ahead of a major attempt to collar him san francisco portland its fairly obvious isnt it she asked fairly he answered and you she said strongly youre in the perfect position me of course he had never understood the idea of a persons world collapsing in an instantworlds took time to collapsebut all at once that was how he felt as if the walls furniture the ceiling and floor began to suck in toward him crushing air out of the room and him along with it she knew she had found out next came his confession about sarah and then what me he repeated his voice breaking who else she asked confirming she had thought long and hard about this its your world isnt it yes he let slip in a sad quiet voice she understood too much his daughter was his world he and liz had taken a bath with sarah not two months ago her little feet frantic in the watera different world now for everyone youre positioned so perfectly who would think he felt true hatred who would think he repeated are you with me on this do you feel all right youre looking awfully pale lou how should i feel he wanted to say with you who else not mulwright not john theyre too close to the center you see i differ there boldt objected the closer to the center the better if it was me forest for the trees in my opinion i thought about matthews and maybe she becomes part of this shes not involved boldt interrupted strongly but she could be if you wanted her to be she could be in some ways shes perfect for this ive barely spoken to her in the past few days he protested but i tapped her phone and yours and lamoias but if you wanted her to she could help you on something like this a highvoltage spike struck him his fingers tingled he had misconstrued everything she had said captain he began sheila what the hell are we talking about here me matthews im thinking its a reporter you know exclusive rights for a little cooperation book deal tv movie it happens she added with a strong twinge of regret are we talking the same thing a hundred grand two hundred she added quickly im thinking a reporter is buying inside stuff and supplying it back to the pied piper in exchange for exclusive rights one of the tabloids boldt took a long deep swallow just to clarify boldt said dryly youre asking me to flush out an insider she cautioned one of the feds would make the most sense hell of a source a little cash under the table happens all the time you want me to flush the insider he felt giddy he nearly laughed aloud at the irony she was asking him to trap himself she said yes how else has this person gone undetected for so long inside information has to be we sting the feds with disinformation boldt proposed and see who surfaces whatever you can come up with unknowingly sheila hill had just provided him the justification for the wiretaps he had ordered he would need to go through with somethingno matter how poorly conceivedto placate her maybe use daphne maybe not i think youre onto something captain it makes sense youre damn right it does we get this insider out of playwe keep our efforts from being sabotagedand we just might collar the pied piper right boldt agreed it was all he could think of chapter boldt parked outside the shotz house shortly after pm that same thursday the warm evening air carried the scent of a budding earthrich black wet soil pushing up life after months of sponging up the skys discharge boldt recalled an early winter evening when just he and sarah had been home he had put a scott hamilton cd on the stereo a cup of hot tea on the table and little sarah warmly into his lap flipping pages of the lovableshe remembered the book so clearlyhe had been pointing out the pictures to her when suddenly she had wheeled her head around and up and had met eyes with him her father so absolute a connection so strong this little person making contact real contact with him and then the long sustained smile gradually forming and then occupying her entire face and an overwhelming sense of love choking his heart filling his throat and unleashing from his eyes father crying baby smiling the book slipping to the floor its pages slowly shutting daphnes red honda arrived a few minutes later and she joined him in the front seat of the chevy she smelled of lilac and her face carried worry poorly for a moment they sat in silence and he knew she was mad at him for not explaining his moving miles out of the city but there wasnt any explaining to do he wasnt going to start now he had dug himself in too deeply ive had time to go over the files found some interesting coincidences everyone including daphne knew he abhorred the word take a look at these he said handing her a stack of lab prelims from the task force book she would not question his being in possession of these boldt worked evidenceit was his lot the parents statements she observed reading one is shotz he explained the other is taken from a report the bureau provided its portland the portland kidnapping you want me to read these she said impatiently skim is okay portland is in interview form she noted all right here he said pointing swaddled in a receiving blanket at the time of the abduction the mother calls it a custom blanket all mothers think that daphne said no no no she calls it a custom blanket no one asks anything more here he said rearranging the pages doris shotz says her baby was wearing an outfit with her picture on it her words custom daphne said following his logic custom he agreed weinstein no mention i can find no reference but thats why were here he informed her doris shotz is organized shell know what were after and me whats my role in this downplay it i dont want it going to the press i need this to be a conversation not an interrogation shes a wreck you dont look so swift yourself you setting a record on that shirt or what he picks his victims somehow custom blanket why not just asking she informed him the bureau is pursuing magazine subscriptions and catalogs it came up in the four oclock no kidding boldt said hoping to sound surprised she knew him too well i wont ask she said i promised not to ask but i sure as hell hope you know what youre doing me too doris shotz answered the door with her threeyearold son clutched in her arms boldt had seen her only a few hours earlier outside davidsons office and knew of her vigils over the past two weeks in an environment that could and did cast humor onto any subject no matter how grim boldt did not know of a single joke that had been voiced about doris shotz each day she returned unwilling to give up on her daughter she was admired by captain and patrol officer alike a woman in her thirties she had the look of an old lady on her deathbed wan and thin she admitted boldt and daphne but they were not welcome doris shotz had quickly developed a deepseated hatred for the police the kitchen table held two empty place mats from an earlier dinner shotz never let go of her boy while preparing coffee and tea even though she looked as if she might snap under the weight boldt and daphne took tea paul shotz poured himself a cup of coffee laced with rum despite his wifes protests he had the unfocused glass eyes of a taxidermied rat he had shaved carelessly a day or two gone by lending him a worn and beleaguered look his shirt had been slept in on the living room couch if boldt had it right sitting at the table with them paul shotz stared beyond boldtright through himso that the detective had the feeling that someone was standing right behind him what is it you want doris shotz asked impolitely two weeks earlier she would have done anything to help but now she had little room left for hope the pied piper claimed far more lives than just the children he abducted daphne said were making headwayreal headwayin the case mrs shotz police work is about fitting pieces together were here in search of more of those we need to seize chances when they arise thats why were here some of what wed like to discuss has been brought up before perhaps so many times that youre sick of it that you think we already have the answers if we did we wouldnt be here what we need to do all of us she said including the dazed husband is do our best to imagine that none of this has been discussed before erase the slate allow things to rise to the surface through the grief and pain of your loss we all want rhonda back home as much hostility and anger as you feel toward us its important you believe that trust that because it is the truth were in this together she shot boldt a lookthis last statement aimed at him losing her patience doris shotz said we have been over all of it a dozen times you take notes dont you read them what happens boldt informed her is that answers change shock affects memory daphne said you think youve told us something because its so clear in your mind but in fact it never made it into words the mind can play tricks its the same with us we can be so caught up in pursuing one line of evidence that we hear but dont process an important fact when that resurfacesif it ever doesthe entire investigation may change she added in just a little over three weeks mrs shotz weve made significant progress we came here to listen help us please help us find rhonda rhonda the intoxicated husband mumbled you never even met her he looked at all three of them as a silence fell between them the wife took in the husband as if tolerating an unwelcome stranger she looked back at daphne with despair in her eyes well try she said boldt explained the report filed with our department lists a missing receiving blanket her rhonda blanket you called it her rhonda blanket the woman echoed yes daphne glanced to boldt signaling that she wanted to lead boldt gave a slight nod can you describe the item for us daphne asked was it personalized in some way i did this already im sure i told you doris shotz complained its not the point doris the husband admonished drunkenly youre so damn concerned about whos to blame here he tapped the coffee cup against the table rhythmically its not their fault its not mine its not yours it just happened they took her things like this dont just happen if we hadnt taken that dinner train oh bullshit the husband roared what we would have been back here an hour sooner so what she still would have been gone doro they took her they took our baby he sniffled his rheumy eyes spilled tears he stood and poured himself another rum the coffee abandoned as unnecessary we might have misplaced the description daphne allowed hoping to avoid a domestic battle it had her picture on it doris shotz explained gail wasnt it the husband asked returning to the table with his mug full of rum pauls sister gave it to us a gift daphne nudged she needed the woman to stay focused boldt withdrew his notepad trying not to attract attention to it most people were intimidated by their words being written down it was cute the woman explained she scratched absentmindedly at the table we sent out a photo with our announcements the husband explained gail found some place that silkscreened the photo onto the baby blanket it was a really good job doro used it all the time silkscreened boldt repeated digitally enhanced said the computer repairman nice color good resolution he rocked the bottom edge of the mug in circles against the table the mother said mournfully it was adorable she was wrapped in it that night boldt asked cautiously the woman lifted her eyes to meet boldts and he saw in there a building uncertainty it was missing i assumed i had her in it trying to keep the excitement out of her voice daphne asked but now its definitely missing the drunken man replied doris shotz shook her head slowly side to side she glanced back to boldt this is important isnt it its all important to us he didnt want to fuel her hope unfairly but they needed her attention focused on the blanket she said a drawer was found open adding it wasnt us julie maybethe sitter boldt nodded he had read about the drawer in the report it was what had focused him onto the possessions of the victims he wrote into his notebook the sitter boldt said to the husband if you could provide a way for us to reach your sister sure he motioned for boldts pen and paper his handwriting was more of a scrawl boldt thanked him doris shotz said out of her silence it was a cute name on the label mirror image i dont remember something cute does that help boldt took this down daphne reached over and touched doris shotzs nervous hand can you get a picture in your head of that label she squinted no not the label the blanket sure but not the label no boldts sense of time had been destroyed by sarahs abductioneverything took too long his patience frayed he spoke somewhat harshly to the husband tell me about the dinner train again who knew youd be on that train it was supposed to be a surprise he said eyeing his wife weve been over this you booked it yourself boldt stated yeah theres a number you call all there is to it pick up the tickets when you get there you must have guaranteed them what a credit card sure the man repeated all there is to it and you dont remember telling anyone at allat work a neighbor a best friend maybe a friend recommended the train and you mentioned to him that you had booked an evening the man ran his hand through his oily hair no that isnt true i didnt tell nobodyanybody he corrected do you have the credit card statement boldt asked the man looked a little fuzzy think honey doris shotz pleaded he screwed his face into a knot i probably got it yeah i suppose i booked it ahead of time you know he reached out for his wifes hand but she pulled hers away get it for them the wife demanded i cant id appreciate the statements from the last three months for any credit cards you have boldt clarified the husband looked crestfallen the wife remembered something then she said we turned all that over to the other peoplethe fbi all your finances boldt said perfectly calmly inside he boiled the girl her husband said the one with the accent she took our bank statements credit card stuff everything kay kalidja boldt realized before they left daphne and boldt visited the childs nursery he stepped into the room knowing full well what it was like to live with such emptiness he had spent the night in sarahs room rocking in the rocking chair staring into darkness hating himself he absorbed as much of the environment as he could a new eye to the crime scene the carpet was marked in three places where chips of automobile glass had been found the glass connected the crimes to a single assailant reminding boldt of its importance the dresser and the windowsills were clouded with fingerprint dust stuffed animals childrens books on a handpainted bookshelf a musical mobile of pandas with red and yellow feet a changing table he visualized the pied piper entering the room and heading straight to the crib knowing what he was after boldt turned toward the dresser the pied piper had taken time to search the dresser why did he need a change of outfits for the child or was he worried about leaving evidence behind had that silkscreened blanket been wrapped around the child or had it been in the drawer that still remained open blanket in hand or not he turns toward the crib he needs to disguise or conceal the child before abducting her he wraps her in a second blanket he places her in a bag or toolbox the open drawer continued to tug at boldt the missing blanket had to be significant daphne reminded hes an organized personality if he took that particular blanket theres a reason mrs shotz he called out the woman stopped at the door to the room unable to enter her eyes welled with tears and she crossed her arms tightly as if to ward off the cold you do the laundry paul doesnt i can tell you that how many receiving blankets do you own he asked boldt did the laundry in his house he grilled the meat washed dishes and was much better with an iron than liz she paid for the housecleaner and they split marinas check liz did their bookkeeping cooked most of the mealsall of the vegetablesand answered the mail and phone calls he wanted his life back liz had nine bras two that she wore more often than the others he knew the outfits that miles wore by heart they had eleven burp rags and seven receiving blanketsenchiladas boldt called them because that was how they looked as infants swaddled tightly before sleep four she said without the slightest hesitation boldt trusted the number and how many are here he asked she looked at him her face drained of expression fear stole into her eyes i never counted no reason to daphne encouraged count them now please boldt said doris shotz headed for the drawer that had been left partially open exactly what boldt had hoped for that drawer held the blankets she corrected herself immediately four other than the new one the one with the picture i understand boldt said five total then i dont machine wash the one with ronnies picture i hand wash it fine she rummaged through the drawer glanced back sharply at boldt and then started over checking for a second time i dont know why i didnt think to count she said distracted by her own guilty feelings she went through the drawer a third time only three boldt asked the woman hurried from the room a moment later she returned several shades paler not in the wash she mumbled how many boldt asked her again three she answered but how did you know two would be missing ten minutes later daphne and boldt stood by the chevy her eyes sparkled with excitement what about the credit cards what was that about she asked we all buy tickets we book travel we charge our meals our shopping all on credit cards if there are any patterns to our lives the two places they show up are our checkbooks and our credit cards but trish weinstein was at the supermarket at the time of abduction she protested frequent flyer miles people charge groceries to credit cards now liz does it sometimes jesus she muttered the bureau gave it away without meaning to theyve locked us out of the credit histories on the earlier victims weve been asking for them for weeks why hog them all to themselves unless theyve spotted a pattern and the blanket we got lucky he said modestly no one picked up the pattern next we contact portland and see if the custom outfit mentioned in that interview had a silkscreened photo on it we need the name of that companythe silk screens she said boldt nodded might be the link weve been missing he moved toward the drivers door were not done here she stated we have to move on this look over my shoulder she instructed ill bet you a months salary shes watching us from the window boldt did as he was told are you showing off of course i am did you notice the way she kept repositioning her little boy hes a heavy little boy after a dismissive look from her he said okay whatd i miss only an eyewitness she said boldt opened the car door and retrieved the thick task force book he sifted through the contents until reaching the shotz file mumbling baby sitter mother and father neighbor real estate agent neighbor neighbor she interrupted john and i did the parents together spent a long time we never spoke one word to little henry little henry was there little henry is three keep in mind miles is four i know three very well thank you boldt said too young for a witness maybe for a courtroom but not for me i broke a lamp of lizs last yearshed had it since college i swept it up and threw it out and thought i would wait for a good time to tell her you know he explained sheepishly there are good times and bad times for that sort of thing well miles beat me to it he reported the entire incident point by point the minute she got home three years old he not only remembered everything id done but articulated it three years old ill take a threeyearold witness bring him on he asked can you deliver little henry not if mama has anything to say about it id bet anything that doris knows henry saw something ironically no matter how much she wants rhonda back she cant bring herself to involve henry one child lost one child left she wont do anything to jeopardize that the guilt were seeing all over her face has more to do with her withholding henry from us than with her being on that dinner train then why did you let me leave because she needed to see us out here in a discussion she needs to lose some of that protective confidence before we stand a chance with her henry can help rhonda the mother in doris knows that but she waited too long to tell us she vented too much anger on us to come creeping back but now that anger has turned inward she has dug herself a hole i can offer her a way out she continued but it will only take if she accepts responsibility for her past actions oddly the way i get her there is fear her imagination can make this worse than we will we need to let that stew boldt rocked his wrist as if checking his watch yeah well if she wont talk ill hold her in contempt for obstruction of justice and drag her downtown he started walking toward the house the task force book still in hand since when did you become cop judge and juror daphne asked requiring a half run to keep up with him shit happens he said on the fly she stopped abruptly as if slapped and then hurried to catch back up to him since when do you swear same answer he reached the front door and knocked more loudly than necessary lou she said grabbing his upper arm forcibly im serious this isnt you so am i yes it is this is me the new me take it or leave it leave it she said whats going on she still held him i said no questions he whispered dryly remember she released her hold on him let me do the talking she demanded this one has special handling written all over it she needs force but a special kind of force they locked eyes his were sunken and darkly colored please she begged footsteps approached her eyes held him unrelenting she of all people knew this man and yet she didnt know him if that kid if that woman he said angrily has kept something from us he didnt complete the statement he said only lives are at stake here the front door swung open doris shotz answered a mask of concern and caution daphnes attention remained fixed on boldt the woman at the door said ive had about enough for one day we need to talk daphne interrupted her still facing boldt now she said strongly snapping her head toward the woman and pushing her way past and inside we need to talk with henry daphne completed no you cannot yes we can boldt corrected cutting her off and silencing her he and doris shotz met eyes and she cowered under his haunted look where is he daphne asked once the three of them were inside the living room and doris shotz realized they meant business you cant do this boldt responded youd prefer attorneys and the press your son was never interviewed as a witness daphne stated the immediate tension in the mothers eyes confirmed daphne had guessed correctly we understand your reluctance to involve him in he is three years old the mother objected how could he possibly help we also understand how important it is to you that we make every effort to locate rhonda just as soon as we can if there had been any tears left for doris shotz she might have spilled them but her well was dry she shook her head holding on to what little protest remained in her let us talk to henry help us find rhonda please daphne urged he bit the man the mother confessed her chin wobbling i know i should have told you downtown sitting there just sitting there i knew i should tell someone boldt glanced over at daphne he wanted the interview now please daphne repeated in our bedroom the mother replied down a narrow hall she showed them into a cluttered bedroom the boy had a set of blocks out on the floor reminding boldt of miles and in turn making him think of sarah honey the mother said these people are going to help us find ronnie they want to talk to you i told them they could okay the boy averted his eyes shyly down at the toes of his air nikes boldt said i understand henry is quite the hero a brave little boy daphne agreed were just going to ask you some questions okay the boy checked again with his mother who sat down on the floor and took the boy in her arms from behind so the child faced boldt and daphne daphne signaled boldt to lose some altitude he joined her on the floor so he no longer towered over the boy please honey we like these people they want to help ronnie she prompted you bit the man didnt you the boy nodded on the leg daphne asked the boy shook his head no henry had several of his teeth and a small scar on his chin his ss whistled when he spoke the mother said would you tell me again about what happened when the man came for ronnie the child vigorously shook his head no the mother encouraged you heard them in the kitchen me hearded ronnie crying me shout for julie the baby sitter daphne said henry nodded and when she didnt answer did that scare you he nodded again he was a cute boy with a round face and his mothers large blue eyes and then what happened daphne asked me go into kitchen went into the kitchen the mother corrected boldt shot her a hot look no time for home schooling what did you see in the kitchen daphne inquired the boy grew restless in his mothers arms his voice was excited julie asleep on the floor the man with a bag ronnie crying did you see him boldt asked the man carrying the bag julie sleeping on the floor he looked frightened all of a sudden daphne signaled boldt off with her eyes what did you do then daphne asked his voice sped up with his description me pulled on his arm he kicked me me screamed he hung his head you tried to help ronnie didnt you i bit him henry said proudly yes daphne returned quickly on the leg on the his arm henry interrupted boldt restrained himself from interrupting his heart racing painfully without prompting the boy continued me bit him and i fell down and hit my head and it hurt he rubbed the back of his head there was a bump wasnt there mommy there sure was doris shotz grimaced she didnt want to relive any of this it hurt the boy declared still rubbing his head i bet you hurt him more boldt said he bleeded he smiled up at boldt all the innocence of the world was in that smile what powers ultimately corrupted such innocence he wondered how was it so quickly lost because of the pied pipers of this world he realized because detectives asked painful questions i bit him on the birdie the boy blurted doris shotz was as surprised to hear this as boldt and matthews a birdie boldt asked on his arm the boy nodded a drawing another nod a tattoo was as good as a fingerprint with a jury and juries loved child witnesses what kind of birdie do you remember boldt asked daphne let him go boldt had opened up the tattoo information like on tv boldt was on pins and needles he needed a detailed description of the tattoo and the chances of that from a threeyearold were slim big bird boldt asked no the real bird the boy replied confirming he knew the difference is the bird on a show daphne asked he shook his head no a commercial he half nodded half shrugged his shoulders in puzzlement which commercial would that be she asked henry offered daphne a silly expression and said the one with the bird in it he giggled daphne maintained her composure but boldt barked out spontaneous laughter henry said big bird flying over the river an airplane daphne asked a bird the child repeated we deliver we deliver the post office the mother said an eagle boldt announced henry turned toward him and nodded vigorously an eagle he repeated daphne was not pleased with boldt and her eyes told him so he had fed the witness an answer in the process of answering questions a witness reached a heightened state of wanting to please especially children that desire combined with the frustration of a blocked or vacant memory would often jump at the first offering even if it meant answering erroneously boldt had planted a word in the boys head to go along with whatever image lingered no matter what the bird looked like the word eagle would now be used where was this bird on his arm daphne asked avoiding mention of the species henry shotz pointed to the top of his forearm boldt said if a friend of ours sketched the bird drew the bird do you think you might recognize it the boy shrugged the mother said henry loves picture books the boy nodded agreement boldt wanted a sketch artist with the child in a hurry so what happened after you bit him daphne asked adding to her notes the man ran out i gone to julie but she was sleeping they repeated the line of questions a second time and got the same answers a detectives dream boldt took more detailed notes the second pass they left at pm boldt made note of this as well daphne was watching him expecting this of him illusion was everything on their way back to their cars boldt stopped daphne and told her he would take care of arranging a sketch artist if they got a decent sketch hed pass it on to lamoia to present to the task force daphne accepted thisas staff psychologist she had no part in evidence collection but it was her role to assist in artist rendition sessions where the subjects state of mind was critical she mentioned her participation as if pro forma youll let me know time and place she said i have a ten oclock tomorrow so anytime after eleven will work id suggest the sketch be done here by the way a threeyearold doesnt need any additional stimulus environment is everything good boldt said i got all that he thanked her and they said good night and he walked to his car he would arrange the interview for ten the following morning he would use tommy thompson whose studios were on vashon island and if anything came of the session no one would hear about it but him thompson was perfect retired and reclusive no one would ever know boldt approached the weinsteins front door alone painfully aware that the pied piper had walked these same steps posing as a delivery man the eerie sensation he experienced had to do with retracing the kidnappers steps with picturing his two victims phyllis weinstein and her grandson hayes its ninethirty detective sidney weinstein objected dressed in a ratty cardigan a wrinkled white buttondown shirt and a pair of khakis that fit too loosely weinstein smelled of brandy its lieutenant boldt corrected crime waits for no man he said my hearing has been delayed while i undergo psychiatric treatment he said distastefully drawing the quotes careful i might shoot you i suggest you leave i need to talk to you and your wife my attorney might have something to say about that are you part of my sons investigation or mine he smirked wonderful world isnt it the question put boldt in a difficult position that if answered directly required he misrepresent himself his only association with the task force other than as an adviser was a covert assignment to flush out an informer his visit to weinstein was difficult if not impossible to justify if weinstein made a production of it and brought in his attorney trish weinstein appeared behind her husband she looked dazed and exhausted boldt spoke over weinsteins shoulder to the mans wife as if absolutely certain of what he was saying hayes had a blanket a shirt an outfiti dont know whichthat carried a photo silkscreened image of him he spotted the hit of recognition in her eyes you know what im talking about the husband stepped back and regarded his wife and then boldt with suspicion and confusion dont listen to him he said they want to put me away trish no one is even thinking of putting you away and you know it your attorney has certainly told you that much you stole an officers sidearm there is more paperwork involved in that one action more internal reviews than you can imagine it will take us weeks possibly months to sort it all out that is why your hearing has been delayed that and because no one wants to see you face any charges and thats not an easy thing to swing when a person has stolen an officers sidearm and trained it onto half the fifth floor you see a psychiatrist or a psychologist a couple times we do our paperwork a lenient judge gets assigned your case and its all over in your position any of us might have done the same thing smiling oddly he emphasized any of us knowing it was true having silenced weinstein boldt returned to the woman you know the item im talking about she allowed a faint nod is it here is it still here or did it go missing the night of the kidnapping she shook her head she didnt know you cant come barging in here the husband protested no boldt agreed looking at the wife he said without a warrant i have to be invited come in the woman said her voice trancelike what weinstein shouted in protest to her husband she said he knows what clothes hayes owns how could he know such a thing unless its important hes here to help us get our child back sidney are you going to prevent that sidney weinstein stepped clear of the door come in he said to boldt motioning him inside it might have been in the wash at the time trish weinstein explained minutes later rummaging through drawers i cant say for sure but to your knowledge the drawers the closets werent searched your people were all over this place sidney weinstein reminded they went through everything everything was searched he emphasized how can we know who went through what a drawer here a closet there whats to see here the wife said hoisting a small outfit from the third drawer she looked at it drew away and dropped it to the floor her open hands raised to cover her face and hide her tears see weinstein barked see what you do to her boldt picked up the garment it was a babys onesie with three snaps at the crotch on the chest was a square color photograph of the baby slightly faded from washing the mother had chosen this garment often for her child the babys face was adorable reminding boldt once again of an infants profound innocence of sarah boldt checked for the label there was none it clearly had been cut out he questioned trish about this and she nodded i snip all the labels theyre so big these days with all the washing instructions theyre horrible you cut it out yourself boldt said disappointed i do it to everything i hate those labels and the companys name he asked hoisting the garment she shook her head reflecting mirror image double image something like that a gift boldt asked yes trish replied we sent out photosthat phototo our close friends and all our family one of them gave us the outfit weinstein said do you remember who boldt asked no chance weinstein replied boldt focused on trish the wife said no neither do i boldt felt the failure weigh down his fatigue he hadnt slept in two days investigations could drag out forever and never be cleared perhaps in this case it was a good thing he thought it was one case he didnt want solved he just needed to make sure no one else could solve it either but i dont have to trish weinstein continued coming more alive i kept a thank you book a diary of all the gifts its got to be in there moments later she was busy flipping pages in a handbound diary with a florentine cover daniel she said looking up at her husband my cousin danny the husband told boldt wouldnt you know it you get danny on the phone you never get off daniel weinstein lived in cambridge massachusetts where he managed a chain bookstore he spoke to boldt on the phone for over ten minutes the upshot of which was a few bursts of hard information hed placed the order for the custom garment over the internet he remembered this distinctly because he had scanned the babys photo and sent it electronically he did not remember the companys name did not remember how he had found the company on the internet and promised to go back online and try to find it again it was over six months ago he complained i surf every night two or three hours a night i bookmark about one out of every hundred sites i visit i did not bookmark a baby clothes retailer i promise you that but you paid for the garment boldt suggested after a pause the man agreed saying i guess thats why youre the detective he laughed nervously by credit card of course would have to be i buy all sorts of shit off the net all by plastic then it would be on a statement boldt informed him and that statement would be a great deal of help to me and your nephew im all over that boldt gave him his direct fax number and reiterated the importance of the information he added if you find it on the internet id appreciate that address hey give me a good excuse and ill spend all night online you want motivation boldt asked a dozen children like hayes mr weinstein theres your motivation hell the concerned man replied im not really sleeping anyway not since the kidnapping you tell sid and trish im all over this my visa statements in your hands by midnight if that site still exists ill have it by tomorrow morning he added just tell me one thing whats that did i do something wrong here did i set up my own cousin we dont know but youve done nothing wrong cause youll forgive me lieutenant but if some schmo used me to get at that child my cousins child i know therere laws against this shit and it may be your job to enforce them but that guys a dead man that guy is dead boldt stayed on the line trying his best to bite his tongue to keep from saying what a cop could not say but what a father had to he saw sarah swing her face toward the camera in anguish heard her shrill plea for help the only help he could give her went against twentyfour years of experience and violated every friendship he had built over that time yeah i know what you mean boldt said before cradling the phone he added im all over that chapter the session with sketch artist tommy thompson occupied all of boldts friday morning and the early hours of his afternoon he doris and little henry shotz rode the ferry across the undulating olive skin of the sound pursued by the white flights and cries of seagulls as the citys skyline receded until it nearly joined the horizon the sea air was alive with pine and cedar a few pleasure craft split the green marble along the shores etching a gray wake sight of the boats reminded him of hills theory about the pied piper moving between coastal cities by vessel that this might explain the kidnappers ability to avoid roadblocks and dragnets in san francisco and portland within fifteen minutes of their departure boldts mind was too preoccupied to remember he had missed placing a phone call to liz and another to miles had forgotten to leave marina her check had failed to give hill an update and had not shaved but he was not too preoccupied to remember bathing his daughter in the bathtub and the small rubber sailboat that would cause her to giggle and splash he looked out on the water and it was this red rubber boat he saw not the ketch running downwind its spinnaker full he swayed with the rocking of the ferry wind tossing his hair his eyes unfocused and distant he processed information as quickly as he could conceive it working more vigorously than behind his desk the artists rendition of an eagle its wings wrapped like a robe around itself traveled with boldt back to seattle there was no one better than thompson the eagle tattoo looked alive on the page that a threeyearold had guided thompsons hand was something that would go unsaid as long as boldt could manage the tattoo itself would go undiscussed and unpublished boldt was studying it when daphne entered his office uninvited he covered it quickly not wanting her or anyone to see youre avoiding me she complained she looked flushed and awake from another world than his nonsense boldt adjusted himself in his chair prepared for the deceit of a lifetime daphne matthews knew him intimately she was not someone to whom he could easily lie were both very busy he said as a cop he had learned when and how to stretch the truth but outright lying came from a different more central place inside oneself and he found it repugnant he did not offer her a cup of tea as was their custom knowing that would send its own signal he wanted her out of here he was at that moment expecting gaynes who had called to tell him that the sid lab had completed several tests including the analysis of the mud from andersons boots the results were being sent upstairs to the fifth floor for her signature she in turn planned to run the results up to boldt before showing them to anyone else he did not know if daphne would pick up on this or not but gaynes had no business reporting to him and it seemed quite possible to him that daphne might make that connection he needed her gone you took him to tommy thompson without telling me she said irritably tommy only had the morning open boldt explained you were busy the man paints seagull art for curio shops and youre telling me he was too busy i cant dictate the schedule to him boldt complained its a freebie for him which begs the question why didnt you use one of the inhouse artists why go all the way over to vashon hes the best there is tommys the best she had yet to sit down in part because he had not asked her to and so she stood arms crossed indignantly her high breasts cradled tightly she wasnt buying this boldt had a problem she drew in a long deep breath and exhaled slowly in an effort to settle down do you want to talk i want to find rhonda shotz and the weinstein boy i want to stop another kidnapping from happening how did the sketch come out thompsons sketch worthless boldt answered consumed in the lie she was his closest female friend outside of his wife lying to her was the worst and yet it came so easily tommy said a five or sixyearold might have worked out henry lacked both the patience and the vocabulary and we got to him too late she said taken in threeyearolds are not long on visual memory in point of fact henry shotz had done a brilliant job id just as soon the tattoo not be mentioned at the four oclock she tensed but why not doris shotz i promised her i remember the press will crush her they might not be told then mulwright will crush her he said the point is that the tattoo is weak or even useless until and unless we get a second witness but who will look for collaborative evidence if no one hears about it she asked chicken and the egg leave it boldt said sharply stinging her i made her a promise you made me promise not to ask questions when is that quarantine lifted dont he said when do we talk about whatever it is you dont want to talk about his throat constricted and he felt his jaw muscles lock she said did i tell you i called marina and asked about liz and she said shes coming home this weekend because shes better lou or because shes worse talk to me he coughed and turned his head away he searched for a way to change the subject he said i wanted the kids out of the house for the first few days thats all he knew what she was thinking why doesnt that make any sense to me im getting conflicting signals mommys coming home and you send the children away you think shes coming home to see you she stepped closer and repeated talk to me daffy have you told liz did you involve her in this decision is she coming home to live or to die lou thats important she moved around the desk toward him i know you you take matters into your own hands you make decisions no matter how boneheaded im a woman lou liz wants the kids home regardless of the added pressures it puts on you regardless of what the doctors have to say about it the kids will heal her lou emotionally sometimes even physically she reached out and took a firm grip on his shoulder youre reacting as a controller you want to control her environment make it peaceful for her make her better heal her good intentions wrong action get the kids back home it was these last words that pushed boldt to tears and his friendship with this woman that made him look up into her eyes and reveal himself expose his vulnerability she clearly took the tears to mean liz was coming home to die she moved even closer and cradled his head it was this contact that triggered his pulling away he wasnt going to tell her wasnt going to give her the opportunity to coax the truth out of himshe could milk the truth from anyone it was her expertise he judged the situation quickly and said im not much of a father am i who would abandon their kids because his workload makes home life too difficult this isnt about liz i moved the kids before i heard liz was coming home he forced out a small bark of laughter the lies came too easily all of a sudden with truth his only tie to sanity he felt himself slipping away like trying to run on ice worse i havent told liz i know you are right her eyes darted back and forth between his her expression changed from relief to concern i almost believe you youre good youre very good whats not to believe he said knowing not to break eye contact this strength served to confuse her she studied him what the hell is going on lou youre selling me a bill of goods here she waited and said how do i account for these changes in your behavior professional stress home life she added sheila hill is playing politics at yesterdays four oclock i was told to take measure of all those present today shes dropping hints that i may want to pay you a visit and im taking that to mean she wants the book on you as well my guess she asked rhetorically a little task force housecleaning is in order shes not getting results and the axe is about to fall it isnt that boldt said im on orders here lieutenant if im by the book i tell her that youre a physical and emotional wreck that you appear exhausted shorttempered and that you have gone steadily downhill over the past three days i tell her that you dont appear fit for duty boldt said calmly hill thinks theres a conduit inside the task force possibly supplying information to the pied piper as intelligence im to turn him or her she suggested i work in concert with you thinks we should try an insideout sting him with disinformation and watch for the bubbles on the surface its big and its complicated and it comes at a time when i have a few other things on my mind she stepped back as if he had pushed her me boldt asked id like an afternoon tea at the olympic a lamb dinner with roasted potatoes and a video of bogie and bacall the phone off the kids asleep and liz complaining into my ear that there isnt enough time in the day but im stuck with this and now you are too i wasnt going to drag you into it i resisted but she pushed and you fell for it its need to know its you and me and no one else except hill disinformation she said still dazed new territory for her but with nearly as much ambition as hill she would jump at the chance shes thinking a tabloid reporter has compromised someone at the bureau that the reporter is in cahoots with the pied piper or maybe the kidnapper has compromised one of us if its illegal adoption then theres a lot of money at play if spread around correctly one of us she gasped what the hell it could be you or me boldt said never know yeah right lou boldt the pied pipers insider she said sarcastically preposterous isnt it he said but a thought remained the pied piper had identified boldt both as a father and as someone close enough to the investigation to influence it he recalled kay kalidja explaining to him that the fbi had believed he boldt would lead the task force who else might have guessed that her eyes shined so whats really going on a pinprick of light stabbed through the darkness of his existence someone had identified him had passed his name on to the pied piper perhaps sheila hill was closer to the truth than boldt had credited her a knock at the door was followed by bobbie gaynes daphne moved toward the door automatically call me she said well play with some ideas draw something up he suggested will do daphne passed gaynes at the door and offered a friendly exchange but boldt could feel her mind working already sizing up gaynes and wondering what she was doing there how much did she know he wondered daphne could be like an iceberg far more lurking underneath than showed on the surface he appreciated her as an ally and yet feared the clarity of her insight gaynes radiated an energy he envied she stepped up to his desk and placed the lab results in front of him with authorityshe liked whatever was in that file she did not take a seat she appeared slightly uncomfortable as she said you wanted to see this before anyone else yes i did boldt read from the file its important that i get it to lamoia right away she said answering boldts look of disappointment she added if i dont tell him the lab will without reading a line boldt told her the soil on andersons boot contained a pesticide a fertilizer something like that his earwax contained traces of the same pollen found at the shotzes and on andersons khakis astonishment opened her features her eyes wide her teeth showing fertilizer not a pesticide the thing about you sometimes i wonder why we bother with lab tests at all third line she told him the report confirmed much of what he had just guessed as a former student of his she had quoted him quickly i know i know a good detective uses the lab to confirm his suspicions not bring him surprises he said if pollen was discovered in his earwax then it suggests anderson did more than rub up against someone it means he was standing in a garden a greenhouse or a field and that evidence being found at the shotzes connects to the pied piper he told her run it by the universitys agschool see if the pollen and this pesticide suggest a particular flower have them contact you directly and when you hear back tell you first she interrupted she said carefully whats going on sarge a few minutes earlier he had felt despair suddenly he felt awash with hope evidence when interpreted correctly painted a particular unique story the mud on andersons boots when combined with the pollen in his earwax and on his clothing was certain to tell a story its good work he told her i appreciate it still facing him she said let me know if i can help he thanked her she said i liked it better when you were on the fifth floor me too boldt confessed his phone rang and gaynes understood that she should go boldt handed her the report and thanked her she turned and walked out he sat alone a snitch complaining into his ear an undigested bubble of guilt consuming him the truth was nowhere left to be seen gone and boldt along with it the truth which boldt had held as an absolute was suddenly a product of context one could distort it bastardize it destroy it as one saw fit the pied piper had not only stolen his daughter he had stolen his life chapter theresa russo worked freelance out of a sprawling ranch home that overlooked puget sound and the whitecapped olympics boldt had met her through liz whose bank had arranged a ninemilliondollar loan for the woman to expand a multimedia software startup russo had paid back the loan in eleven months took the company public a year later and retired to entrepreneurial work reportedly twenty million dollars richer with russo well outside of law enforcement boldt had sworn her to secrecy making no mention of sarahs name or her relationship she was a missing child russo probed no further an african american with bootpolish black skin and straightened hair she kept pulled back tightly she wore blue jeans a green cotton sweater and green converse allstar hightops she was twentyseven years old and single russo worked from a padded leather throne on a fortyinch monitor mounted in the wall using a wireless keyboard and pointing device for all the stunning views her office shades were drawn to restrict sunlight boldt was anxious to be shown whatever it was this woman deemed worthy he had not told her the child on the cdrom he had received was his and lizs daughter only that the analysis could not be done inhouse for reasons of security russo had a strong handshake and bright green eyes for boldt the challenge was to keep all mention of sarah out of their conversation russo spoke in a matteroffact tone her attention on the huge monitor she worked the keyboard and trackball with a dexterity reserved for those who spent eighteen hours a day behind their machines she said first of all let me answer a couple of questions you raised when you asked me to take a look at this the cdrom is not unique many thousands of home users have cdrs and can burn their own disks the disk itself is encoded with a manufacturers batch number but it wont get you anywhere in terms of tracking down its sale unfortunately the disk is unremarkable but its a clever way to deliver such a message email would have left a far better trail shes done a good job for what its worth she well get to that boldts mind raced the pied piper a woman he was hooked he tried to keep from interrupting we know she has a working knowledge of home computers and can read a computer manual no big deal im sorry it isnt better news boldt put his pen to work the contrast of pen and paper to the media in front of him was inescapable she said i called you because i came across some interesting stuff early on the image of sarah moved on the screen her voice amplified by surroundsound screamed daddy and boldt felt his bowels loosen a couple of details that may be relevant its true that video imaging on pcs has made leaps and bounds in the last few years the home market software is good but not up to the capabilities of the commercial players what we have here is strictly home marketan offtheshelf package the result is a fairly lowresolution image in order to give it a palatable look you need to box the video in a pretty small screen boldt felt a spring of tension in his neck he couldnt lose her earlier reference to a woman millie wiggins who ran sarahs day care had mentioned a pair of uniformed cops a man and a woman this was a possible confirmation he kept his mouth shut russo had her own way of doing things the point being that i can size the screen however i like larger is typically less resolution though as it happens she grinned my equipment is a little better than average she dragged the corner of the viewing box that contained sarahs image so that it enlarged on her screen i use a resenhancement program that we created ourselves the images enlarged russo replayed the video several times do you see it boldt saw only his little girl try as he might to pull his eyes away from her it was impossible tell me here she indicated with the computers small white arrow as the image replayed boldt forced himself to focus away from sarah and onto the rooms window where russo pointed in the smaller format at regular speed all we picked up was a slight change of color but resenhanced and enlarged its actually a blurred image if we slow down the playback she said working her magic we get an altogether different look at it the video advanced slowly like a replay in a sporting event during the first playback boldt once again could not take his eyes off his daughter her head swiveled in tight jerky motions the whites of her eyes showed for the second playback he focused on the window behind and to his daughters right a stream of purple bled from right to left she glanced at him testing him then replayed the image for a third time she advised try squinting your eyes boldt still could not make it out traffic of some sort boldt guessed let me slow it some more the images advanced in a series of a freezeframes tiny moments of time strung together like beads on a necklace orange and blue warmer she said let me isolate it she dramatically enlarged just the window creating an abstract maze of colorful dots this takes some creative vision mind you she warned this is a different kind of detective work boldt watched it several times if i let my imagination go im not sure what that is but logic says its a window and movement behind a window implies a road and color on a road suggests a truck exactly but im not actually seeing the truck not per se i understand youre doing great now watch the blue and the orange you pointed out its coming up she inched the video forward frame by frame the colors froze and then blurred together the blue formed the letter f the orange framed an e boldt saw it fedex its a fedex truck she beamed at him and then fixed her attention on the computer and returned the image to its original contents though still enlarged yes a fedex truck good that is part one watch closely please she enlarged an area behind and to sarahs left that contained the rooms television you were given a date stamp as im sure youre aware of to confirm her condition intentionally or not she gave us a time stamp as well by nature of the program that anchor team goes on at am our time im a cnn junkie she said cnn atlanta will be able to tell you the precise timedown to the fraction of a second boldts tired brain began to assimilate the information he found the excitement in her voice contagious the fedex system is computerized he mumbled knowing where she was headed the routes and the scheduling of every truck are a matter of record he cautioned her and himself as well there are a couple of hundred trucks on the road on any given day granted we may be able to approximate the location of those hundreds of trucks at the time of the videoand its great stuff dont get me wrongbut its too much for us we dont have that kind of manpower he was a department of one thats true if were talking seattle she said baiting him she advanced the image of the television to the last few frames before the video went dark reducing the size the resolution tightened and although tiny the result was clear a small blue band crept across the television screen from right to left did you see it she tested boldt said yes bear with me she enlarged the area around the television set behind and to sarahs left then she enlarged the television itself when the blue weather warning appeared on the bottom of the screen she told him local cable carriers have the authority to superimpose weather warnings news bulletins or natural disasters they shrink the satellite feed and insert their own moving band of text i havent had the time to do the legwork but i guarantee you each and every cable system can tell you if they posted a weather bulletin on this particular date at this particular time given the limited number of cable companies left anymore its a matter of a half dozen phone calls or so sensing his impatience russo said were not finished ive saved the best for last the woman boldt guessed she smiled if you think you needed your imagination for the fedex truck you aint seen nothing yet i havent had any time to work with this image and i do have a few tricks still up my sleevesome really nice highspeed resenhancement engines and pixel predictors some work we did for nasaits graphics software that uses ai to make bestguess image correction on degraded data i need more time to complete that work but i want to show you what ive got so far watch the little girls legs she said directing his attention to the lower section of the small video image she replayed the video sarahs knees appeared then her feet boldt knew those shoes he had helped her into them that day his throat tightened russo explained for whatever reason the person running the camera zooms back on the image presumably to show the girls entire body that she wasnt harmed in any way the zoom continues to the end of segment in the process it gives us a look over here she said pointing with a pink painted fingernail to the very edge of the frame she played the video again and light winked from where she had pointed did you see that yes if i enlarge it she said quickly doing it and i separate it out i get only this from top to bottom it was nothing but a band of light followed by a band of dark it appeared slightly curved now i warned you this requires imagination and i do want to run some enhancement and see if we can clean it up but she drew her short fingernail the length of the fuzzy image you see this tiny square of light right here i think were looking at something hanging on the wall a painting maybe a photograph boldt saw the square of light a mirror he asked you do see she nodded why not yes the edge of a mirror i think and its reflecting back at us okay i know its hard to see but if it is a mirror then what image is likely to be caught in it she asked rhetorically the camera person she answered she indicated a bump a curving shape that ran top to bottom boldt had focused on that same image but couldnt identify it she hinted that shape moves in the mirror winking light at us she waited for him to see it but her impatience won out and she sat up straight heaving out her chest and saying simultaneously its a silhouette of her chest running her hand down her shirt and over her breast she announced proudly this video was shot by a woman chapter there was no view from the hotel room window only the gray concrete of an adjacent building separated by a narrow alley home to a row of dumpsters sheila hill admitted him using the door as a screen so that when she shut it behind him he turned to see her dressed in only a white lace bra and matching highcut underwear smooth and tight against her crotch she maintained an indoor tan throughout winter he carried a plastic shopping bag about which she was immediately curious but he held it high and away from her not letting her have at it and forcing her to press herself against him to reach for it as she did he took her by the back of the head and planted a long hungry kiss across lips that held a little more red lipstick than usual the lipstick smeared on their faces physically hot to the touch she had an appetite that penetrated through his clothes and aroused him she enjoyed rubbing up against himit was for her pleasure not hisand used the excuse of the package to make contact let me see it she whined all in due time my pretty lamoia replied he kissed her again drawing the breath out of her so that she cooed darkly he loved the tease that existed between them she thrilled him her fuse once lit was difficult to extinguish she walked a fine line once free of her clothing lamoia dropped the bag and cupped her between the legs with his strong right hand squeezing and lifting her off the floor to where she squealed with excitement his tongue slipped wetly into her bra her breathing slow and heavy she squinted at him playfully he carried her across the room this way like a puppet held awkwardly his teeth nibbling at her breast he threw her onto the bed hurry she ordered him slapping her knees together touch yourself he told her she viewed him curiously actually blushing what did i tell you that someone got inside my desk he asked her were not talking business not now anyway then touch yourself he paused and informed her i cant say for sure but im pretty sure that whoever it was got a look at my filesmy copy of the task force book she slipped her hand down her underwear and blushed again seeing sheila hill blush was worth the price of admission she giggled nervously and slipped out of her underwear he said show me what you do when youre alone and the shades are pulled a fine sheen of perspiration shined on her skin so that she glowed golden as if dipped in wet paint a moment later she lay naked on the bedspread i like to watch you undress she said how do you feel he asked mmmm she hummed her eyes fluctuating between tightly closed and straining for a glimpse of him pulling down his pants good he asked come over here she said her voice breaking again he tore open the bag and the box that was in it dont stop he said banging around the end table to the side of the bed he found the electrical outlet plugged in the cord and turned the device to high for you he said switching it on she accepted the device and put it to use her face knotted in pleasure she held her breath for a long time and then cried loudly into the room with lamoia inside her she bit his shoulder to bleeding she smoked two cigarettes by the open window stark naked her feet kicked up onto the round table that bore tented cardboard advertisers heralding pizza delivered to the room she hadnt spoken a word either mad at him he thought or out of gas he said have you heard the rumor that liz boldt is coming home coming home to die i hear dont say that you asked she said entwined with a large cloud of cigarette smoke she stared through the gauze curtains at the cement wall across the alley leave boldt to me dont you worry about boldt you worry about the evidence about how long ill put up with a task force that isnt delivering meaning read between the lines she said flipping him her three middle fingers held together like a scouting hand sign youre not exempt john fucking me a couple times a week does not buy you exemption its nice dont get me wrong you are very good but you have to prove youre a good cop as well one capable of running other men i want something useful out of those glass chips and dont tell me about fbi delaysyou sort that out i want financials i want some progress i can take to mr and mrs shotz and the weinsteins having their children back would do just fine thank you very much youve got a wonderful sense of timing but that wont cut it at the four oclock dont think youre the teachers pet just because youve got your hand up her skirt to the contrary now she chose to look back at him if anything that makes you more of a liability we get caught like this and the shit is going to fly theyll say it could compromise the task force thing is they dont know me it compromises nothing thats all this is to you lamoia blurted out some fluids some sweating what im your gigolo lamoia dressed without showering and was out the door but not before sheila hill called out you can go away mad but youll be back you enjoy screwing the teacher nothing wrong with that john teacher likes it too he slammed the door and was still tucking in his shirt by the time he reached the elevators where a mother and small child stood waiting sight of the child stung lamoia they boarded but he declined to join them he couldnt stand that close to a child he took the stairs running hard running fast running away chapter david and carlie kittridge both setters on the micks grill volleyball team that had taken third in the intercity competition a year earlier had their eye on the big prize this year thanks to a boeing recruit who had played for uscs junior varsity the guy could spike and block right up there with the best of them the kittridges were such fanatics that they had timed carlies pregnancy so that she delivered between the summer outdoor and the winter indoor seasons trudy was a week shy of five months old reddish blonde hair green eyesthe cutest most precious baby since evelyn her older sister the wednesday night games took place in the gym of rainier junior high just four blocks from the cheapest gasoline in seattle carlie teased her husband for always managing to leave his tank empty until wednesday night after the game they would stop and he would fill up proud of his savings summer months he brought his lawnmower tank along as well if there was a deal to be had david was first in line the winner of wednesdays game would go on to represent wallingford in the indoor championships carlie kittridge prepared to serve against the brick wall thirty feet away where a line was painted eight feet high hers wasnt the most powerful serve on the team but it was arguably the most difficult to return because of a wicked reverse spin she had perfected as she stood in the backcourt preparing to serve carlie kittridge glanced down at trudys car seat to make sure her daughter was content and saw the little angels eyes closed evelyn was at day care all was well she smacked the ball and watched its beautiful rotation the seams running back toward her wednesday was only a few short days away she looked forward to it with an antsy hunger micks grill was currently ranked numberone intercity david and carlie had every intention of keeping it that way chapter boldt had put off telling liz for two days he had a decision to make regarding the most recent evidencethe fedex truck in sarahs ransomand he needed lizs involvement illness or not he elected the hospital stairs over the elevator to buy him time to compose his thoughts he found her in bed reading a small pamphlet her roommates bed was lived in but empty her face had its natural color back not makeup her eyes had lost their dullness she looked tired and older than the woman he knew but far better than the liz boldt who had been admitted some weeks earlier you look great he said kissing her on the lips wish i could say the same not that it isnt good to see you weve been playing phone tag ive missed you she waited for him to say something when he failed to do so she asked carefully is it her the face behind the question twisted as she sized him up she drew in a sharp breath it is isnt it she gasped drained of color boldt choked on his attempts to speak implying acknowledgment she meant daphne she had it all wrong we can work through anything she said bravely boldt teared up confused and sorry and angry her eyes held a softness seen for the first time in months her pain was gone he realized where is she he asked indicating the roommates empty bed liz pointed to the bathroom door feel like a walk he asked offering his hand she swung her legs out of the raised bed ill need my robe she said home tomorrow i need the practice believing her husband in the midst of an affair she nonetheless held her composure he stood there in awe of her feeling small and pitiful there was a girl involved but he couldnt bring himself to explain it he handed her the robe and fished her slippers out from under the bed her bottom showed as he helped her into the robe it was different than the one he remembered she needed twenty pounds he ached praying for her health he walked alongside of her down a corridor void of character to an empty waiting room called the solarium he turned down the tv and they sat in a far corner its not that liz not even close my love for you its stronger more clear to me than its ever been my admiration for what youve been through for the strength the courage its not me love its much bigger than me but thank you studying him she said we can get through anything you know did she mean money the banker in her had a way of neatly tracing most problems back to money of seeing most solutions in financial management im not so sure he said thinking aloud she smiled warmly whatever it is were in it together he burst out crying so suddenly unexpectedly that he buried his face first in his arm and then on her shoulder she held him and rubbed him were almost out of this love he wasnt going to tell her with his eyes buried he leaned back frozen by her expression there was no good time all his rehearsal failed himparalyzed by her soft eyes its sarah he blurted out her face went blank her words caught in her throat tears spurted from her eyes raining onto him her face collapsed and she struggled to swallow an accident she mumbled he shook his head no they took her kidnapped her out of day care her face pale her chin trembling she offered only a blank stare he had lost her to anger as palpable as the bones in her back alive she whispered yes kidnapped yes you were looking after them you said you said you could handle it her eyes pleaded him to tell her it wasnt so he couldnt think what to say they need her alive he said stupidly she pushed away and crossed her arms she glanced around as if looking for a place to hide you did this you let them take my baby she fired at him quickly miles with kathy you bastard thats why you vanished you coward we had some leads he exaggerated he caught himself worming his hands just like doris shotz he understood suicide then a place for everything get out she ordered through blurred eyes she repeated herself until it became a mantra liz he pleaded she curled up on herself like a crab retreating into its shell speaking wetly into her knees she said you get out and you bring me back my daughter i need you liz i need you to help me with this this is your world not mine she fired back i wanted none of this she had asked him to quit the department too many times to count he had nothing to say it was a point she could hold to and that he could not argue he said she needs us both elizabeth you bastard she pulled in on herself even more tightly you bring me my baby im going to find her he said his decision made but his policemans logic countering everything he said im going to get her back he felt small and cowardly she pointed her bonethin ashen arm aimed stridently toward the door boldt reached out to touch her but she jerked away revolted liz i he could not think what to say her arm trembled still holding point wiping back tears he moved reluctantly toward the door a sense of nothingness overwhelmed him a feeling of being horribly alone he left without another word he knew what had to be done chapter boldt drove into his driveway and then before killing the engine threw it into reverse backed up and sped away the same for the last several days the house was sarah he couldnt go in there he returned to the office too sick to eat and spent all of friday night into the wee hours reviewing the computer printouts from tech services that detailed conversations caught by the electronic trickery of their ai eavesdropping software for one who hated coincidences boldt was forced to live with the fact that had seattle not been a port city used to smuggle everything from chopped autos to crack cocaine to illegals and a reputed hub of organized asian crime his departments tech services unit would never have had such sophisticated software but with the current administrations emphasis on returning law enforcement power to the state level they did have it and by a fluke of good salesmanship combined with sheila hills unquenched ambitions it was boldts to misuse legally nonetheless the software proved mediocre at best boldt spent hours listening to outtakes of conversations of little value and additional hours to sections of tape the printout did not list at all of interest to him was that within spd there was a good deal of dialogue between the fbi and spd nothing several excerpts from the phone of kay kalidja intrigued boldt as she clearly attempted to gather in the victims financial statements as he had asked she had left repeated voice mail for dunkin hale and it was from these tapes not his own phone system that boldt heard a message she left for him the irony of picking up his voice mail by wiretapping did not escape him lieutenant boldt kay kalidja i wanted you to know that i have not forgotten your request and although slower than i would like i am making some progress you will find some of the financial information you requested posted to your email which i thought more confidential than a pool fax and i did not know if the fax number i have for you is direct or not sorry it has taken so long i will try to speed things up call me if i can be of further assistance ironically it was kalidjas apparent willingness to help that insinuated boldts first suspicions of her he had encountered so much resistance from flemming and hale both overt and otherwise that an agents sudden readiness to give him information refused by others left him a little cold in the heart had someone gotten to her he wondered if the information being forwarded was tainted and meant to throw spds investigation if kalidja had been compromised by the pied piper just as he had could that be it had she seen fear in his eyes did she know his child was missing suspicion bred suspicion the same way that lies begot lies he downloaded and printed kalidjas email she had sent him the full financial recordsover thirty pagesfor two of the former victims one from portland the last city targeted the other from rancho santa fe just outside san diego the first city struck by the pied piper the gap in between was profound and impossible to miss the stonewalling continued he reviewed the statements while he continued to listen in on dozens of phone calls many of which overlapped in content and spread before him the complex tapestry of the ongoing investigation by the sound of it lamoia had himself not a runaway train but a rudderless ship meandering in a halfdozen different directions some evidence driven some driven by what could be described only as wild hunches many of the threads made sense to boldt the attempt to id the pollen the desire for lab reports on the automobile glass the pursuit of andersons missing photographs the massive ongoing surveillance of transportation hubs and vacant structures around the city believed to be part of the pied pipers mo but woven together these threads presented more an abstract image than a clear picture the investigation appeared to be stumbling along well enough by itself needing little hindrance from boldt to fail he was going to find sarah and rescue her and he was going to do so without anyones knowing the fedex manifests needed pursuing as did the chemical analysis from andersons boots that gaynes had brought him even more promising was the possibility of the involvementintentional or notof an unidentified photo silkscreening company and it was this lead he pursued arduously with the arrival first of kalidjas email and then at six saturday morning of a fax received from daniel weinstein cousin of sidney and the giver of the silkscreened outfit march seattle washington dear lieutenant boldt i am pleased to include the following internet address for the silkscreen company httpretailfashionchildrensspitimemallcom also enclosed are my credit card statements i drew an arrow by the charge for spitting image which is what i think you wanted it jumped right out at me and helped me find them on the web assuming you are not only busy but somewhat hamstrung by your constitutional requirements i am taking the liberty of pursuing this myself and should have something for you by the time you read this this fax was intentionally delayed you can thank me later sincerely daniel weinstein boldt immediately dialed the mans number reaching only an answering machine that said im unavailable until wednesday the first leave a message after the beep and ill get back to you boldt frantically phoned the weinstein home and reached a groggy voice that belonged to trish initially she said that both sidney and his cousin were in town once boldt explained the fax hed received and convinced her that her outofstate husband was in violation of his bail she confessed that they had left for northern california early friday afternoon he asked if daniel was the kind of man to follow through with such threats threats she returned they think theyre doing you people a favor they think itll take you two weeks to get all the warrants and get down there and do something threats theyre trying to find our baby can you reach them only if sid calls tonight if they get drinking he wont he knows i dont like the drinking and my guess is this is more an excuse for the two to go on a tear than to save our child sid and daniel too theyre people who have to do something you know there are doers and there are people who sit around lieutenant sid and his side of the familythey are definite doers around the cop shop a doer was a criminal boldt did not miss the irony did they give you an address a town anything no just that name spitting image but you already know that dont you i want you to listen to this next question carefully and understand that the only way i can help them is to know everything i have no jurisdiction out of this city much less out of this state mrs weinstein if i help its as a private citizen as a friend do you understand yes okay listen carefully to your knowledge does either of them own a gun she gasped over the phone line settled herself and replied yes a handgun or a rifle or both both she answered daniel does some hunting lets hope not boldt said if your husband calls i tell him to get his butt home she interrupted first you find a way to get the name of the town and the place hes calling from that first a motel a bar it doesnt matter then and only then you try to get him home he read her his cell phone number and made sure she took it down correctly its on twentyfour hours a day you call the minute you hear ill call she promised but he wont with the help of theresa russos computer expertise boldt avoided including anyone in his search for spitting images home page within minutes of reading her the internet address supplied by daniel weinstein she was reading back to him the companys physical address email address and phone and fax numbers russo kept him on the line while she used an internet mapping service to pinpoint the location of the company and faxed him the resulting map within five minutes of phoning her he had an address and map and was headed for the residential community of felton california north of santa cruz a flight from seatac left for san jose less than an hour later chapter boldt had seen sidney weinstein in action with a weapon once before he had no desire to face the two men alone he called lamoia from his car phone awakening him weekend mornings were the detectives only opportunity to sleep in boldt destroyed this chance im about to break your investigation wide open boldt told him assuming the romeo was with a woman and probably sporting a scotchinduced headache southwest flight leaves in fifty minutes he hung up knowing that if he stayed on to argue his point lamoia would worm his way out as it was lamoia arrived at the gate with seven minutes to spare he wore dark glasses wet hair a fresh pair of pressed jeans and his signature black leather jacket and ostrich boots he drank buckets of coffee and ate pretzels for breakfast youre not going to tell me anything the detective complained from the front seat of the rental car of primary importance boldt began to repeat himself yeah i know i heard you its yours over in intelligence for the first fortyeight hours i keep my mouth shut for two days he added two days is an eternity for those babies you dont mind me saying so dont push john youre going to come out smelling like a rose lamoia burped on cue better than i smell now he said boldt stepped him through the evidence reports the interviews with the shotzes and weinsteins daniel weinsteins credit card statements the internet site damn internet lamoia said from homosexual abductions to fraud the world wide web had brought police added caseloads only the whitecollar crime boys sang its praises so this daniel weinstein along with our pal sid are down here boozing it up with heat in the trunk does that about recap it the drive was made longer by a thousand cars all trying to get to different places ahead of anyone else the same in seattle a predictable impatience any lane any highway always the same race lamoia felt it too they dont drive for pleasure not like the italians they drive to get somewhere to beat the clock save gas bring home the bacon i hate california he slouched down in the seat napping behind his dark glasses they ran past cardboard houses cut out and pasted onto hills dotted with live oaks that looked too beautiful to be real the crush of humanity depressed him lamoia who couldnt nap if hed been awake a week reached out and dialed in a talk radio station youre depressing me boldt said what you got no interest in prostate cancer this is good saturday morning stuff he kept searching until he found sports talk there we go he said i love this country i like to travel alone boldt said should have thought of that the housing developments streamed past pieces on a monopoly board boldt said arent the basketball playoffs still a couple months off na not the start of them besides with the talk stations you just gotta go with it know what i mean i dont think so no you probably dont lamoia passed some wind and cracked open the window wider boldt said lamoia turned off the radio as much as boldt disliked talk radio he didnt want to talk and he knew lamoia too well the detective said suddenly the thing about matthews i cant figure out is what she wants you know what shes up to you know first the engagement to adler is on then its off now maybe on again i hear i collar a few bad guys along the way he continued you know but matthewsall she wants is to get inside their heads take the gears out of their clocks wouldnt you think that would get a little old you ask me were talking about a screwedup childhood or something whos trying to get inside whose head boldt asked shes complicated thats what you dont like about her shes more than perfume and lace and you cant get close lamoia clutched his chest oh youre killing me here he glanced over you dont want to talk sports you dont want to talk legs he shook his head you know we dont talk all that much sarge i mean aside from business it wasnt true and both men knew it lamoia was close to boldts family especially the kids a long silence overcame them as boldt negotiated several severe turns lamoia one of the best drivers on the force said i should have been wheel man the road climbed out of the developments and into thick woods winding through sharp turns cabins had been tucked up into the hill many went unseen marked only by numbered mailboxes the air smelled thickly of pine sap the bows of the towering firs hung heavy with age like a ballerinas upturned arms her fingers drooping boldt slowed and negotiated the turns carefully the street numbers indicated they were close we work these people as a team who knows if theyre connected or not lamoia sat up providing the weinsteins havent killed them maybe no ones here maybe they are the pied piper maybe they know nothing about it im hip lamoia said if we need to roleplay boldt said im sweet youre sour how else could we play it boldt passed the mailbox backed up and pulled the car into the driveway the sign out front read tiny totshome schooling hanging from this shingle was another smaller one spitting image designs a cottage industry literally it was a small log house tucked up into and surrounded by tall evergreens no lawn to speak of just forest floor a walkway of chainsawed slices of tree trunks led from the drive to the front door past a sixyearold chevy fourwheeldrive with body rust behind the rear wheels everything in these woodsliving and inanimatewas in a constant state of rot a woman answered the door with a welcoming smile nearly six feet tall and sporting an imposing nose she reminded boldt of a high school phys ed teacher she wore a faded blue sweatshirt and gray sweatpants suede birkenstocks with yellow socks her hair was pulled back into a black fuzzy band hi she said studying them as a pair if youve come about enrollment were all filled up but i can put you on the waiting us lamoia gasped believing she was mistaking them as a married gay couple displaying the badge he said sergeant john lamoia lieutenant lou boldt he put the badge away quickly before she identified them as seattle wed like to talk to you if you dont mind she nodded limply displaying none of the defensiveness boldt would have expected of the pied piper or an associate he said and you are donna stonebeck she answered him the woman showed them in to a small pine table the house smelled vaguely of paint although there was no silkscreen equipment in sight the small living room had been converted into a preschool classroom boldt opened his briefcase and handed her a stack of photos look carefully he said do you know any of these children studying them she looked a little frightened understanding this was no social call she shook her head at each photo looked through them a second time more quickly and passed them back to boldt they werent students here we have never had a single complaint its not that lamoia surprised her by saying its a kidnapping case a serial kidnapper the horror on her face appeared genuine disappointment stung boldt kidnapping she whispered if an act it was a damn good one boldt heard small footsteps racing downstairs followed by three children who appeared around the corner and stopped abruptly one was asian one caucasian and one a beautiful cream skin they all seemed the same age around five or six stonebeck still stunned told them ill be up in a minute the kids ran back upstairs at the same frantic speed stonebeck apparently felt compelled to explain i take up to five boarders i have those three at the moment children of violent divorces orphans whose extended family cant take them in yet but who can afford private carewe offer a better environment than the public institutions a regular florence nightingale lamoia quipped its not entirely benevolent im paid quite well for my boarders without flinching the woman offered tea or coffee for either of you boldt asked for tea with milk and sugar lamoia took coffee donna stonebeck asked from the kitchen are you interested in the preschool or spitting image spitting image is located here lamoia asked ive got a basement full of it she told him setting the water on to boil you do much business lamoia asked i have two people downstairs full time while im up here with the kids the woman said proudly it keeps growing like this and im going to need more space we created a web pageoh about a year ago nowand our orders have doubled in the last three months were shipping all over the world now japan is big for some reason korea germany finland weve got five orders for japan right now the tshirts mostly boldt inquired the woman stood waiting for the pot to boil she didnt appear nervous in the least boldt wanted her nervous he wanted her a part of it we dont do tshirts per se too crowded a field we do infant clothing but its our crib products that are zooming the blankets quilts duvet covers and pillows were doing twenty thirty baby blankets a week at fifty bucks a blanket she added weve got a new velvet product comes out like velvet art you know elvis only its your kids face hundred bucks per unit cant keep up with orders business is booming lamoia said i wont give up the preschool she directed to boldt i mean ones for love ones for money right what kind of records do you keep lamoia asked coldly are you two irs she laughed as if caught oh my god i should have looked closer at that badge police boldt answered attempting to reassure her kidnapping he reminded all of those kids or was i supposed to recognize one of them then a wave of realization crashed over her and she cried you dont think i have something to do with this boldts cell phone rang he rose and took the call in the corner lamoia asked her how do you keep track of each order the artwork the paperwork what she asked distracted by boldt mumbling in the far corner artwork paperwork artwork goes back with the product our paperwork invoices he clarified interrupting customer names addresses that sort of thing i give you a name you pull the order specific customers we file by month stonebeck said if i give you a name a date and name would be better but yeah we could do it were alphabetized by month but can i promise wed have it this is not lands end she said a year ago we were doing five pieces a week now its maybe twentyfive last year we invoiced by quarter this year by month used to pay our bills by hand now we use quicken she said sarcastically were real cutting edge around here could i check out your invoices lamoia asked the last six months do you have a warrant she said thats what im supposed to ask isnt it no warrant boldt answered returning to the conversation we had hoped to keep this as informal as possible but you want to rifle my invoices thats cute lamoia glanced at boldt who nodded his consent he said in your estimation how secure is your web page meaning what precautions have you taken to secure your web page this is a cottage industry fellows i keep telling youits not lands end we post the same warning everyone else doesyou play at your own risk we encourage customers to call us direct and place the order that way you know what it costs me to file with one of these security providers forget it arm and a leg maybe down the road to call you is a toll call or an number do i look like id have an number im out of my basement i do a couple dozen pieces a week so they place the orders through the internet to save the toll charges the orders come to me as email email is pretty secure right were interested in attempting to identify some of your customers lamoia explained no kidding she asked sarcastically the water boiled she poured the beverages and delivered them what i want to know is why we just want to check a couple of names boldt said as respectfully as possible yeah but hows it connect to these kidnappers thats police business lamoia said harshly i kinda figured that the woman fired back or you wouldnt be here if you wouldnt mind boldt asked time is our biggest enemy she put down her tea and stood you can see whatever you like she asked cautiously am i in any kind of trouble here lamoia grinned that lamoia grin that showed his teeth and bent his mustache into a pair of wings not yet he said joining her you single to boldt lamoia said wait here lieutenant as their voices descended the stairs boldt heard her say maybe i like you after all mr smooth which one are you lamoia italian every inch dont go getting personal on me boldt listened in thinking only lamoia got away with such things one of these days his libido would get him in trouble sooner than later after twenty minutes he emerged that same irritating selfconfident smile pasted under his mustache in his right hand he carried a number of invoices bingo he said waving the paperwork so the doer soon to become the pied piper decides he wants to establish a little underthetable adoption business lamoia drove the curves effortlessly and at twice the speed like water running through a pipe he needs product white babies good solid stock you have a real poetry about you boldt sniped he studied the mans use of gas and brake marveling the car could ride so smoothly lamoia was the same with women it came naturally to him boldt studied the spitting image invoices the backseat contained a cardboard filing box going back two years stonebeck had cooperated boldt thumbed his way through december a year earlier starting at the beginning as a cop always did looking for san diego los angeles san francisco portlandlooking for a paper trail shotz and weinstein had both been found he needs clients too maybe word of mouth maybe he simply runs credit checks on names he finds on adoption waiting lists ids the high rollers and makes a phone solicitation you pay you play must be plenty of those types waiting out there some of those lists run five six seven years deep and then your name comes up and you get offered a fivemonthold with learning disabilities fuckin a id buy from this guy you probably would boldt said but it stung his former detective im just talking hypothetically lamoia complained im brainstorming here boldt said he gets the bright idea to hack an internet site devoted to childrens clothing he stumbles onto spitting image its perfect for him some of the orders like daniel weinsteins include digitized photos and suddenly he knows that hes getting a white kid with the right looks what a sicko hes got a shipping name and address almost always the residence if hes a good hacker or if he has access to credit histories he can lift credit card records which is how he knew the shotzes would be on that train that trish weinstein would be at the supermarket the pieces clicked into place for boldt isolating his targets establishing a schedule or routine to time his hits his fatigue lifted like a fog burning off so he has computer skills he said they teach computers in the big house sarge could be one of the family if we had all the invoices id feel a little better boldt said the fact that she remembered a couple of shipments to seattle doesnt leave me with the best feeling lamoia said its her email orders we want well get them boldt reminded shes forwarding them thank god they were backed up boldt checked the map next exit then east youre sure theyre there trish weinstein said he called she got the name of the motel out of him and then told him to get his butt home before he ended up in jail she said he sounded pretty convinced lamoia said so now we help convince the cousins weinstein to turn the show around and maybe some day we thank them boldt replied hows that if weinstein and cousin daniel hadnt headed down here to pay a call on ms stonebeck would we have jumped on that plane point taken we tough them up boldt advised we put the fear of god into them if they get within ten miles of ms stonebeck i love this job lamoia said slouching down behind the wheel and letting out a long sigh but this rental is a piece of shit chapter boldt pored over the spitting images documents the time pressures nearly too much to bear rhonda shotz hayes weinstein his own sarah stonebeck had underestimated her sales volume by a factor of two or three but even so five or ten detectives working in concert could have completed the work in a matter of hours for sarah boldt handled it alone crosschecking names and dates against the pied piper victims slowly he built convincing and finally irrefutable evidence that the custom silkscreener linked at least four of the pied pipers victims such information could set a task force on fire and provide the good solid leads that led to real suspects boldt kept it all to himself the stakes were high enough added to them was the possibility that within these documents or stonebecks emailed orderswhich she had promised to deliver to boldtexisted the name and address of the pied pipers next seattle victim for boldt to hoard such information not only was a crime but went against everything in his nature to share this would be to advance the investigation prohibited in the ransom but his commitment to proceed with his own investigation forbade expansion he didnt know how long he could keep lamoia at bay but he believed he could stall longer than the fortyeighthour grace period using intelligences need to know exclusion as his excuse as a last resort he could share the secret of sarahs abduction and pray that lamoias loyalty would hold boldts trying to balance these two forces sarahs wellbeing versus the abduction of another innocent child failed with each internal argument you picked the wrong man he mumbled nearly incoherently at his desk you picked the wrong cop on some of the spitting image invoices the handwriting barely rose above a scrawl making boldts task even more difficult interestingly the numbers read fine name by name date by date month by month boldt slogged through the paperwork if he could find another seattle customer he might have a way to locate and follow the pied piper back to his daughter twice he fell asleep and had to start farther back in the pile finding an invoice he clearly recognized in between pages he glanced furtively at the wall clock feeling the minute hand like blows to his chest youre risking another child the voice inside him reminded he thumbed faster and fell asleep a third time john lamoia wondered what kind of importance intelligence could assume over the needs of the task force how could boldt care about busting someone or protecting sources when the lives of children were at stake or was intelligence a unit that thrived on secrecy directly involved in the pied piper investigation without the knowledge of the task force the only reason lamoia kept his promise to boldt was that he trusted the man in ways he trusted no other his decision came more easily due to the fact that he was overwhelmed with paperwork of his own on saturday night he worked at his cubicle reviewing property damage reports he had sought for the better part of a week he hoped hill might show up and offer a night together he caught himself glancing toward the door each time it was opened but sheila hill never showed he worked alone even in the greatest of emergencies the incompetence of spds bureaucracy lived up to its stereotype people could move quickly meeting to meeting floor to floor paperwork never did it lumbered under the control of a civilian labor force many of whom worked for minimum wage and to whom the word urgent was seen so often that it blended into any request form the joke around spd was that if you needed a vacation if you wanted to slow an investigation down to a crawl place a request for an archived file ironically lamoia was working off of a suggestion made by boldt the theory being that the chips of automobile glass might be the product of vandalism or theftcar windows shattered for kicks by teens or for profit by petty thieves looking for car stereosthat the pied piper may have repeatedly walked through a field of such glass and by the rule of mutual exchange carried the evidence into his crime scenes it was vintage boldt frustrated by the failure of the fbi to deliver a lab report on the glass lamoia turned to the timehonored process of reading each and every property damage report filed in the prior six weeks trusting that for insurance the owners of the vehicles would report any damage to the policea requirement for insurance reimbursements he read reports on every kind of damage conceivable from the bizarre to the mundanefrom thousanddollar leather jackets torn by bar bouncers to a home stereo thrown across an apartment and out a patio window by a jealous lover random vandalism including spray painting rock throwing and minor arson any such report involving a vehicle lamoia read carefully if a shattered windshield or any vehicular glass was listed anywhere in the report or if it seemed to lamoia that the only way a dashboard might have been torn apart was to break into the vehicle and therefore smash a car window he set aside the report one by one these separated reports stacked up he had been reviewing documents for over three hours when the first hint emerged establishing a patternany patternwas reason for excitement human behavior could be broken down into a series of learned patterns in the shower a person soaped his or her body parts in the same order day after day a man shaved in the same sequence the cops job was to identify as many of these patterns as possible in his suspects behavior or his crimes patterns proved predictable predictability meant arrests at first there was nothing to tie one broken car window to anothera truck a car a minivan the parking lot of a mall a sonics game a supermarket but when the fourth property damage report indicating window damage cited a northbound i park and ride the similarity jumped out at lamoia two of the four dates were the same but two others were not meaning the park and ride had been hit a minimum of three times on different dates which in turn meant that an individual or gang had targeted the park and ride as a good place to pick up car stereos the pied piper might have picked up the broken glass anywherefrom his own garage to an auto shop to any of the locations listed on the reports he was collecting into a stackbut police work meant playing percentages and the area of highest percentage was this park and ride lamoia saw one clear way to narrow the field he picked up the phone and called bernie lofgrin at home despite the late hour lamoia spent five minutes describing his discoveries to lofgrin the head of spds scientific identification division lofgrin a civilian did not work weekends unless on call and attending a crime scene neither of which was the case but he took to lamoias discoveries like a bloodhound on a scent the detective pointed out the increasing importance of determining the make and model of the vehicle or vehicles from which the chips had come whatever pressure lofgrin could apply to the fbis washington dc forensics lab would be appreciated at the same time lamoia elected to place the park and ride under twentyfourhour surveillance hoping to use a combination of detectives under the direction of bobbie gaynes in a political nod to sheila hill and the politics of the task force he took his recommendations to patrick mulwright whose special operations unit was the departments premiere surveillance squad mulwright who had undergone a suspension ten months earlier for boozing on the job was caught drunk as a sailor by lamoias midnight call after a rambling attempt to sound coherent the lieutenant assigned the surveillance back to lamoia mistakenly assuming lamoia was currently on call lamoia awakened gaynes and told her to organize a rotation reminding him that with over a dozen vacant houses under surveillance and hill squawking about overtime pay the manpower was not there she suggested he rethink the assignment so work the unis lamoia told her uniformed patrol officers would on occasion work plainclothes detail gratis for the chance to be noticed and recommended for advancement do it yourself if you have to just get that park and ride covered chapter boldt sensed someone behind him spun in his chair in time to see a woman at his office door emaciated and pale his wife her release had been postponed twentyfour hours because of a scheduling conflict he did not expect her and so for a moment simply stared forgive me she said calmly she stepped inside and closed the door forgive you he thought a bubble of painful guilt overwhelming him no words came out he stood and approached her ive acted foolishly she said unchristian in every way and i boldt hugged her unfamiliar body once soft but now sharp with bone no you have every right nonsense i was horrible to you i apologize please forgive me they spoke simultaneously their apologies blurred well get her back the wife said well get her back the husband echoed the two of us i never thought tell me she said gently breaking the embrace and holding him at a distance tell me everything time is against us isnt it i know it is and yet i also know that god will not allow this god will see her safely returned but not without you love youre the best cop there is words he had lived to hear spoken words she had never said instead voicing resentment anger and frustration at the demands and risks of his job words he would have gladly given back in a heartbeat for sarahs safe return sensing his every emotion she said we arent alone in this his enormous emptiness waned a state of mind he realized not reality for what else could explain it passing so quickly and completely with liz in the picture everything changed together he said his lips gracing her ear her cheek hot against his neck his wife gave in to her tears like a tree uprooted by the wind begrudgingly and with much protest together she agreed bring her home she wept openly for a moment boldt thought she meant him but then she whispered so closely that he felt it clear through to his soul please god bring her home together boldt repeated a single word as healing as any he had known chapter boldt awakened liz at four in the morning from a deep sleep she came awake arms flailing from either the clutches of a nightmare or reaching out for a husband who had not slept by her side for far too long there had been no lovemaking between themliz needed more strengthbut the loving had been intense and more intimate than many other nights shared physically boldt had found a brief piece of the sleep that for days had eluded him something you said he told her love what is it she said using her private name for him you said we arent alone i meant that god yes i know but its more than that you see i think i know now why we have never received the portland file the same for san francisco what if it wasnt the bureau dragging its feet but the police departments themselves someone in our exact situation wouldnt you know that by now would i does anyone know about us about sarah he switched on the room light and she flinched he said i let myself believe that but why should anyone know hills wrong about a reporter working an insider its not one but a string of insiders a string of cops city to city in the same situation as we are and what if it is she questioned confused and even frightened by his excitement then theres evidence that has been withheld victims we dont know about some of whom may have information theyve never disclosed like you with this clothes company she said exactly i dont know anyone on the san francisco force but in portland a cap sergeant named tom bowlera guy i know pretty wellwas lead on the kidnapping and the serious crimes committee their version of a task force bowler has two kids its four in the morning love im going down there to portland he spun his legs out of bed and sat up now be there by morning he asked okay with you its a sunday its the only day i could get away with this without somebody questioning it you need sleep rest you need to be thinking clearly im going down there love has it occurred to you that you cant do this alone if were going to obey the ransom its one thing but we arent are we no so you need help no we cant standing he told her to get some sleep ill be back afternoonish cell phone is on if you need me i need you she assured him she was back asleep before he was into street clothes at am the columbia river was caught in the dusk of sunrise its swirling dark waters reflecting back a rosehued sky with patches of white cotton clouds shorebirds and gulls flew low while a barge and tug cut whitefeathered wakes into its surface the noise of traffic obscured any sounds so that if one stared long enough he might believe it was the river making that noise boldt ate scrambled eggs with his four cups of tea at a truckers diner the waitress was too old for the hairstyle and too friendly for the hour at am connie bowler claimed her husband was running errands at ten when boldt called back he heard the twinges of panic in her voice as she fired off an excuse boldt had met connie only once he reintroduced himself asked after their kids and said he was passing through town and would love to see tom she said the kids were fine but there was relief in her voice boldt pressed her about tom she carefully volunteered the name and address of the shanty lantern the watering hole was six blocks from the portland police department in a basement area beneath a chinese restaurant named wang hongs entering from sunlight it was several minutes before he could see clearly the bar smelled strongly of egg rolls but it had an irish decor it was not a happy bar but a drinkers bar boldt had played piano in both kinds it was not a cop bar either police were a strange breed after spending eighthour shifts together cops tended to spend another two hours together getting pasted before heading home they shared war stories they bragged they exaggerated they talked sports and cars and in the right company women daphne would have all sorts of explanations for cop bars some of which might make sense to scholars but at the heart of such a place was that police work was teamwork after the bruising the team enjoyed a moment or two on the lighter side the shanty lantern was no such haunt on a sunday morning it played host to ten determined souls all of whom struggled to either continue their drunk or find one tom bowler owned a table a pack of cigarettes and a disconnected look he paid no attention to the sports discussion on the overhead sony he had a scotch in front of himhalf empty by the way the man stared into space boldt knew it wasnt his first bowler looked all wrong for a man in his late thirties boldt might not have spotted him had he not been looking for him he wore a wrinkled white shirt that was stained with either ketchup or blood when he saw boldt he shook his head refusing the visit boldt took a chair at the mans table sat down and stared at him the bartender interrupted attempting to rescue her regular customer she was the owner of a great deal of dyed hair a pair of artificially large breasts and a vivid shade of blue eye shadow that could be seen even in the cavelike atmosphere of the shanty lantern boldt ordered an orange juice for himself and a cup of coffee for bowler who put you in charge the man asked correcting the coffee to another scotch weve never received your file tom boldt said deciding to play it straight you were lead boldt reminded queen for a day you mean flemming shows up my brass bends over and greases up the old red eye and says park it here please mr federal officer we form a serious crimes unit but all we end up with is bottle washers for flemmings suits hes a monster you knowflemming im talking about a dictator eyes in the back of his head an ear to every wall knows what youre thinking before you do on edge i had the feeling that at any moment he used us manipulated us worked usand the brass seemed to never catch on we processed the evidence but they analyzed it i gotta admit he played it brilliantly like a quarterback working a cheerleader to get her panties down we get the public exposure the blame if it goes south flemming gets the real control knows which wheels to grease which buttons to push has our chief bragging at cocktail parties that hes taking phone calls and sharing beverages with our us senator its all politics boldt blame management whos to blame if the investigation goes south who takes the front page if the guy walks into the seventh precinct and gives himself up let me tell you this talk radio has done in law enforcement the public is like a child you know you give them too much information too soon and theyre dangerous with it he killed the scotch to hell with it howre the kids boldt asked tom bowlers jaw set and his eyes grew large as they met and held boldts he shouted a little too loudly ginger barroom shorthand she delivered the two drinks what about my kids boldt said let me run a hypothetical situation past you tom and maybe you can help me see clear of it what about the kids the man asked mean in a way only a drunk can get boldt had won the mans attention the room suddenly felt warmer what the sarahs going to be two can you believe it boldt sipped his juice it was from a can he set it aside he locked into bowler saying no more the mans expression slowly hardened he knew why boldt had made the trip so lets just say hypothetically boldt continued that a cop is working a case a big case like a string of kidnappings or something bowler shifted uncomfortably boldt continued and lets say the doer is no dummy he knows he either has to have an enormous string of luck or someone pulling strings for him he knows the feds will be players tens of thousands of kids vanish every year few if any of these disappearances are ever connected fewer prosecuted but this guy is making a statement he leaves a calling card a penny flute exactly boldt hesitated other than liz he had not told a soul he couldnt bring himself to instead he said the doer understands its the local cops who will work the crime scenes for evidence the locals who will most likely process the lab work on that evidence in that way its the locals case to give away not the other way around the bureau may be running things maybe not but the local cops control the evidence and therefore the success or failure of the investigation a bead of sweat ran from bowlers sideburn into his collar he looked jaundiced malarial one other thing the doer is much more frightened of the feds than he is of local law he paused briefly did i ask you about your kids bowler coaxed the shiny surface of the scotch into a swirling disk of light suspended in the glass you wasted a trip he said im just talking hypothetically boldt reminded hows liz cancer boldt fired back harshly mentioning it didnt sting him the way it used to if he expected bowler to talk to him then he had to reciprocate they cut her open they ran her full of drugs and radiation now shes found religion connies joined the god squad me he lifted the scotch is it working boldt asked maybe it was the fear loosening him up maybe it was the look in bowlers eye that confirmed boldt was right his voice faltered as he said im begging you here tom the sonics are murdering us this year once we lost clive the glide it was all over they should have thrown it in back then lets say this guythe doerhas something thats mine boldt said angrily and i dont know whether or not i can trust itll be returned in one piece he stared at the man hoping he might win eye contact but it was a bust lets say that made my interest in the portland file all the stronger i took the filethe master filehome one night stopped for a drink right here car was busted into my car briefcase was stolen the file was gone hey we got triplicates but it takes a while to pull it all together i need it to pull together tom i need any leads i can get no thats wrong you know your best bet play by the rules youll be glad you did he waited for this to sink in and met eyes with boldt he held him in a prolonged stare and said penny is fine did i mention that thanks for asking tom bowler stood sliding his chair back with the effort the legs cried out on the tile floor sending chills down boldts spine bowler was unsteady on his legs and he was dead inside he had apparently played by the rules and had a daughter to show for it but boldts daughter was gone the shotzes the weinsteins bowler had to live with that or try to the man walked past boldt and said something to ginger about his tab he left without looking back chapter daphne hurriedly changed her outfit for the third time studying herself in the fulllength mirror that attached to the back of her houseboats bathroom door and decided she looked too contrived annie hall on a sunday stroll she hadnt been this clothesconscious since her dinner a month earlier with owen adler her former fiance perhaps her future fiance as well she undressed to her bikini underwear shedding the underwire bra in the process and leaving it in a pile with the rest of her failures her body was winter pale but her stomach flat and firm her hips wide and her thighs lean her breasts were high on her chest her nipples angling up and out to the sides men found her breasts attractive because of that why she wasnt sure she worked hard at preservation chased her youth like a dog after a moving carfour miles a day weight trainingthese werent godgiven assets she earned them through a daily regime she ran through the houseboat all but naked hoping to death no one was happening down the dock for one of the front blinds was open she scrambled up the narrow ladder to the tiny loft bedroom where she kept her underwear socks and bras separate from her other clothingfor reasons she had never fully understood the rest of her wardrobe was divided between two closets a trunk and a chest of drawers all located down by the bathroom she stuffed herself into a constricting jog bra feeling much better hide the chest baggy is best bailing out of any attempt to invent herself otherwise she returned to a pair of gardening blue jeans that were a little too big in the back and a pink cotton sweater that revealed nothing of what it contained she brushed her dark hair back and shook her head reconsidered and tried a hair band and settled finally with it pulled back sharply into a squishy as she called the elastic fabric bands she liked the results plain confident but boyish and even a bit severe she drove the honda at warp speeds picking out a route that allowed a lot of turns on red liz boldt had never invited her to anything she approached the front door aware of her stride she had a sexy athletic gait that came naturally and she dismantled it as best she could in the event liz boldt might be watching her she walked stiffly the closer she drew to the house the closer to an internal honesty there had been several years of her life when she would have willingly exchanged places with this woman when her need of lou boldt had built to an obsession that had driven her to prove herself not only professionally but as a woman when her moment with boldt finally occurreda passionate and tumultuous tumble under a dining room tableit only drove her further over the edge for months she had thought of nothing but possessing him consuming him so that he would abandon his wife for her she loved his kids and the way he was with themshe wanted her own with him liz be damned and now liz was damned and daphne lived with the guilt of her former hopes and ambitions she had broken off an engagement because of her inability to settle for less than boldt and now she felt ready to renew that commitment to owen adler with none of her former passion for boldt but strangely with a form of love for him still intact how this transition had occurred would puzzle the psychologist part of her for the rest of her days but she no longer had to own boldt did not want to knowing him working with him was enjoyable but her heart no longer fluttered when he entered the room her greatest fear was that this ability in her to let go might have coincided with the discovery of lizs illnessthat only by facing the possibility of getting what she wanted did she discover she did not want it she didnt know if this were true or not but even the possibility terrified her if liz died if boldt made advances would she reject him she caught herself standing at the door unable to lift her arm to knock she wanted to turn around and run the door came open you look great daphne said nervous and lacking the composure that was her trademark i look awful liz smiled and tugged on the wig making a point of it bald as an eagle under this thing another smile the poor woman was all bones and cosmeticsthere wasnt a hair on her body it takes a generous person to say otherwise thank you showing her into the living room liz offered daphne a cup of tea the pot steaming on the coffee table passing her a cup liz said youre puzzled by the invitation im honored actually your first day home isnt it i didnt think its probably not what the doctors would call for but neither is attending church and i did that this morning so why not break all the rules she placed her own tea back on the table ill tell you something about cancer it changes you it changes everything about you she paused and daphne could see the woman searching for the right words the way an athlete concentrates just before competition you and i share a mutual interest for the last couple of years ive allowed that to threaten me youre quite beautiful extremely smartif lous opinion is to be trustedand you have clearly captivated a part of lous heart he cares for you deeply liz she cut her off with a raised hand he does what of it why shouldnt he youve got a hell of a lot going for you was she intending to tell her that her husband was fair game after she died was she going to get morbid and coach her competition on the raising of the children daphne wondered why shed come she should have seen clear of the trap liz boldt intended to punish daphne for her brief love affair she wanted out of there my point is he trusts you he believes in you her eyes teared up thats extremely important right now he believes in your recovery too daphne said we all do oh no is that what you think that this is about me that i called you becauseoh no im sorry im so sorry a dying womans maudlin attempts to she laughed and looked around the room as if suddenly seeing it for the first time im not dying im healed she said freshly miles is coming home tomorrow im glad you drove him to kathys lou told me drove him without ever asking why you see the kind of person you are you know what that means to us that kind of trust she couldnt stand the tension she blurted out why exactly did you ask me over its lou she said tears flooding her eyes but she would not give in to them this woman who looked so frail had the strength of ten she reached down and took daphnes warm hands in hers as cold as tile im trusting in you as ive never trusted in anyone in part because of lous high opinion of youwe dont really know each other do we in part because your profession requires a great deal of confidentiality and i trust i assume that that is a skill one acquires that that is something once learned can be applied to so many relationships relationships confidentiality was she going to bring up the affair had lou told her she looked down at their hands entwined together guilt and fear rose in her chest to a knot of painshe couldnt breathe the damn bra was too tight would she lie outright to this woman if asked liz boldt squeezed her hands tightly and said something terrible has happened we desperately need your help chapter the treasure revealed itself like the gold of the pharaohs on monday morning march the lab delivered sixtyseven fullcolor computer printouts to lamoiaall photographs made with andersons digital camera all from a backup disk found hidden in andersons bookshelves as an added bonus each was dated and timestamped he leafed through a series of a businessman climbing out of his car in a motel parking lot entering a room and leaving forty minutes later followed shortly thereafter by a wornlooking creature bearing the heavy posture of someone defeated two of the many subjects depicted were shown engaged in partial nudity or unmistakable poses with adolescent members of the same sex how anderson had gone about his work was likely to have puzzled some of his clients but it showed little imagination or creativity to lamoia in some cases anderson had taken the adjacent motel room and bribed a housecleaner into unlocking the communicating door in one daring effort the sleuth appeared to have been hiding inside a closet with shuttered doors implying that he had paid off the prostitute there had been a time early in his career that lamoia would have found one or more of such photos suggestive enough to arouse him but those days were long gone more than anything he felt numb to it all frightened for the missing children guiltridden over his failure to rescue them so many of humankind elected to lead sordid twisted perverted lives that any detective came to expect it rather than be fascinated by it after a time one forgot that these people were only a fraction of society because of their staggering numbers they seemed more the norm there were photos of storefronts school buses city parks topless dancers a bank teller an interior of a starbucks seven shots of a woman shopping various department stores three of a teenage girla daughter a baby sitter giving her boyfriend head in the family hot tub her face partially underwater the smooth flawless skin of her bare back cresting the surface of the bubbling water like a breaching whale thrown into the mix near the end of the stack he finally reached the series that hed been waiting for five images from a computer file anderson had named weinstnpix the first of these one that easily caught his attention depicted the now familiar clapboard house that had contained jeffry mcnees meth lab closer study revealed that one of the vehicles parked in front was a white minivan its back windows made opaque by either paint or butcher paper on the drivers door was an unreadable sign lamoia was guessing it advertised an exterminator service hard evidence was on occasion as good as sex the second of the five photos showed a figure walking along the buildings perimeter carrying a spray tank and hose his head down and hidden by a gray baseball cap and a pair of goggles he wore coveralls and looked to be about six feet tall there was no face to pull from the shot lamoia silently and reluctantly congratulated him on his choice of disguises it was no wonder they had never gotten a decent eyewitness description nothing of him to identify but a pair of blandcolored coveralls and matching cap lamoia placed the third of the images in front of himself like a poker player rolling his cards this was of a boating marina on a gray day the depth of field was bad the image blurred he wasnt sure they would ever identify the marina from such a poor picture the same could be said for the two figures at its centertwo lamoia noticed shot at such a great distance they were little more than stick figures anderson had been careful not to get too close the man wore a colorful sweatshirt baseball cap pulled low and blue jeans the woman wore jeans shades and a hat unidentifiable lamoias initial enthusiasm was tempered by these discoveries anderson knew how to follow peoplea photographer he wasnt he cursed the man for managing a shot with no identifiable landmarks or signage anderson confirmed his standing as a nickel hustler nothing more lamoia dwelled on this photo for a long time first working the magnifying glass then the loupe the resolution was too poor the focus too blurred to give up any secrets the penultimate image related to the final of the five shots and contributed to the story that formed the mystery of andersons homicide the scene was a greenwaya running path it showed a man perhaps six feet tall in running clothes again this man wore a cap on his head and sunglasses again the shot was taken at too great a distance the final photo and the telling one was nearly identicalshot in the same minuteexcept that the joggers head was turned toward the camera but anderson had panicked this shot was the most blurred of all the story of andersons death unfolded for lamoia as clearly as if anderson had still been alive to tell it so lamoia asked boldt standing slightly behind him and looking over his shoulder so boldt fired back he understood perfectly the significance of andersons photographs if handled correctly if traced to the right marina every possibility existed that spd might identify a suspect boldt had to prevent that but at the same time he wanted every scrap of information the photos provided he felt incredibly tempted to share his secret with lamoia to double his manpower but he didnt dare the ransom note haunted him boldt prided himself on his organization and neatness but the clutter of his desk and office told a different story and he wondered how much of this lamoia picked up on the room smelled of his fear two dozen or more white and blue telephone memo slips littered his desktop in various piles they represented unreturned calls or calls in which boldt had no interest he was intentionally allowing his intelligence work to lapse the unit was in shambles these memos were interspersed with handscrawled scraps of notes that if viewed as a complete work revealed a mind in turmoil a man a husband a father an investigator saddled with internal conflict there was an empty bottle of aspirin open by the phone the lid missing a mug containing a moldy scum that had once been tea several stacks of paperwork carried office dandruffthe visible dust of neglect if he had caught one of his detectives with a work area in similar disarray he would have chastised the guilty party so the pictures tell a story lamoia said the pied piper clearly made andersonin that last shot its so obvious the thing is dated march pm which fits with the angle of light two days later anderson does the swan dive in the tub playing devils advocate boldt said the photographs show no crime being committed they are of an unknown subject in an unknown location they are from a computer disk that according to you has never been mentioned at a four oclock never presented to the task force is there proper paperwork on the removal of the disk from andersons residence i wrote it up hill knows all about it boldt warned okay so lets say the evidence holds in court it still shows no crime the file has weinsteins name on it it has a piece of weinsteins name the more veteran cop corrected in computers thats the same thing maybe maybe not he couldnt afford lamoia running to the task force with these photos he needed first crack at them if he were to have any chance of finding sarah he looked for lamoias angle in bringing them to him first it wasnt the good student wanting to show off to his former teacherlamoia wanted something more than praise or evaluation but what and could boldt turn whatever it was to his own advantage so lamoia asked forcing boldt to make a hasty assessment his basic problem was that he couldnt think clearly certainly not quickly he felt drugged not himself fatigue swam in his head as if his ears were filled with water aspirin dulled it briefly but did not remove this pain it was his to live with why he asked himself again he voiced the only thought that entered his weary mind youre reluctant to turn this over to flemming lamoia took this as an accusation their lab has had andersons computer forever if they had come across these same pix when would we have heard about it ill tell you when once they had located that marina and made inquiriesand only then and dont you believe otherwise i dont boldt said rubbing his neck with as strong a grip as he could muster that was the other thing he had lost his strength he walked at half his former pace his arms felt heavy as if someone elses youre right im sure of it he said and if you so much as breathe a word of this theyll run with it theyre pigs in shit with this kind of evidence fly a few more suits in to canvass marinas and once they find the place well read about the pipers arrest on the front page probably right boldt said not believing a word of it he had no great love for the bureauhed been bitten as many times as hed been fed but flemming struck him differently than most the man wanted this over wanted the pied piper in custody as badly as anyone boldt wasnt certain how he had managed to remain on the case as long as he had the bureau had a way of exorcising inefficiency typically flemming would have been off the case by the san francisco kidnappings having failed in the previous two cities he either had friends in the right places or his reputation as their top kidnap cop was well founded youre damn right im right lamoia could get worked up boldt played on that unless you beat them to it this is our city john those are our marinas exactly dont i know it damn right our city god damn it but the shot look at those two pictures theres nothing in them but a bunch of masts nothing to identify them its like anderson worked on screwing it up you know how many boatyards and marinas there are lake union lake washington the shore mercer island kirkland medina jesus vashon the islands for chrissakes its endless and you want me to find it for you boldt said knowing and exploiting lamoias needs intentionally misusing their friendship he wanted to crawl into a hole and die the comment sobered lamoias hysteria he looked his former sergeant in the eye and nodded grimly you mean im using you he asked getting it all wrong yeah thats about right if i have anything to do with this the existence of andersons photos gets out and im butting heads with flemming which means im butting heads with hill which means im screwed anyone i ask to look into this is going to know its task force related but intelligence no one knows what the hell you do up here all day everyones worried youre looking up their skirt and with manpower being what it is i use the snitches to do the legwork lamoia acted slightly embarrassed thats what i was thinking yeah a color xerox pass em around and see if we cant kick a location my snitches dont exactly work the yachting circuit they arent the deckshoe set john he couldnt jump at the offer without raising suspicions no cop glorified himself with extra work he or she spent too much time and effort defending turf and protecting positions boldt had to dismiss the offer you could use a few uniforms it would leak it might both knew damn well it would i gave you fortyeight hours with the spitting image evidence he reminded playing the trump card boldt hoped he might use i was doing the legwork this is a little different boldt countered it took all his strength not to agree too quickly seventytwo hours lamoia requested work the photos for three days after that i take it to the task force fortyeight boldt wanted the evidence for a week or two and there he was suggesting a shorter period than he was being offered itll take you one day just to get the pix out on the street right once theyre out there youre giving me fortyeight same as im giving you and then the word lamoia rarely if ever spoke please sarge youve changed boldt said knowing correctly that lamoia would take it as a backhanded compliment you dont work cases you work deals lamoia quoted the man sitting in front of him a wise old soldier once told me that get out of here boldt said his fingers sweating on the photographs he held as had lamoia before him boldt worked the photocopies with a magnifying glass and a jewelers loupe he pored over the images for the better part of an hour and then just ready to give it up he noticed what he had missed in all the other passes it came under the heading forest for the trees of late he realized a detective mined his crime scene for evidence that he then turned over to sid for lab tests too often that reliance translated into a dependence on the laba belief that the lab had all the answers in the process oldfashioned police work suffered for an hour boldt searched the photos for a readable license plate a landmark any unique piece of evidence that might help he sought out patterns anything unique what he discovered was easily missed it was not a sign nor a number or a name it was much more simple it was right there in the center of the photo right there staring back chapter dr ronald dixons home was an impressive threestory victorian on the west side of th east near volunteer park appointed with marble and antiques heriz rugs and a steinway concert grand the living room had at its center two couches that faced each other across a low walnut coffee table and were perpendicular to the fireplace its mantel painted an eggshell enamel white and holding a glassencased clock whose pendulum issued a steady click click click boldt knew the living room well having spent many hours there exchanging jazz favorites with dixie who opened the front door admitting boldt dixie thanked him for coming over you made it sound so urgent boldt said of the request for a lunchtime meeting their friendship went back decades not years dixie rarely if ever asked favors his host motioned boldt toward the living room the lieutenant rounded the corner and stopped cold glancing back at his trusted friend and then into the room again and the people assembled there a trap boldt realized his first instinct to run run and never trust anyone again daphne matthews stood admiring one of the antiques a hammered brass lamp and mica lamp shade lamoia also stood though with his back pressed firmly against the mantel his bloodshot eyes trained on his mentor sids bernie lofgrin was on the couch working a beer bobbie gaynes occupied the end of the piano bench she straddled it legs spread leaning on her hands planted together in front of her a group that knew each other well a working family boldt did not like the looks nor the silence he had been found out by whom lamoia daphne but one other person appeared to his right stepping out of the sunroom liz said this is an intervention it was not boldts life that passed before his eyes but the image of sarah on the video clip the pleading eyes the frightened voice daddy it wasnt these people to whom she was calling out but to him her father he wanted no part of an intervention whatever the hell that meant he wasnt an alcoholic he was a cop who wanted his daughter back liz said you cant do this alone love no matter how badly you want to and god knows i love you for it she was crying now you cant we cant we made the decision to save her these are our closest friends they can help liz he protested if were careful daphne began immediately interrupted no one asked you boldt shouted his skin numb and tingling liz had killed their child or you or you he said to the others your wife asked me daphne contradicted in the voice of a friend not a psychologist you could have told us an angry lamoia delivered whatd you think id do rat on you daphne said this isnt about you its about sarah dont lecture me on what this is about to his wife he complained bitterly we talked about this no one was to know and no one does dixie pointed out in his resonant baritone only we know lou only those of us in this room it isnt a conspiracy with only one person you need us lamoia jumped in you want to find her well find her you want to screw up the task force brother well fuck it up but good he smiled a patented lamoia smile overconfident to the point of cocky lofgrin said we can misplace some evidence if necessary bobbie gaynes stood from the piano bench sarge i got to get back to the park and ride surveillance what you got to knowwere with you on this we all love little sarah we all love you so stop being so ungrateful and figure out a way to put us all to work john youll catch me up got you covered gaynes walked to boldt leaned forward on her tiptoes and kissed him on the cheek she had never done this before and it brought a frog to his throat you got your own secret little task force now sarge take advantage of it she left the large front door thumping shut behind her lamoia checked his watch we got about two hours to debrief you and get a game plan before we raise suspicion by being away from the office dixie said theres tea water on and sandwiches have a seat sarge lamoia said patting the couch boldt sat down not by his detective but by his wife the meeting began in earnest a few minutes later chapter the intelligence offices were a quiet place to work boldt had learned to appreciate the quiet phones purred softly answered in hushed voices that didnt carry secrets a twoway street of constantly shifting information computers hummed outside the sun appeared for the first time in several days painting brushstrokes of silver in the windows of neighboring buildings surrendering his secret added to boldts exhaustion driven by an overwhelming sense of relief the burden of withholding the truth of his daughters situation released he found himself able to concentrate focus and redirect his energies he spent his time reviewing the spitting image invoices including the email orders he had received from stonebeck earlier that same morning he attempted to contact the various cable television companies that served northwest washington hoping to determine which of them had run a weather alert at pm march the moment of sarahs video ransom and he was in the middle of just such a call when he was interrupted by a patrol officer you have a visitor lieutenant a woman no visitors he said believing it a snitch pass her off to someone else shes from out of town says its urgent its not a squirrel lieutenant this one is talbots and eddie bauer you know what should i tell her the uniform asked out of town she didnt say where an attorney youve got to at least get a name im busy here the uniformed woman stood up artificially erect she wouldnt give me a name but she did say that you spoke to her yesterday yesterday he couldnt remember back twentyfour hours he glanced at the call sheet he kept by the phone sunday nothing it didnt make sense to him it was someone trying to weasel an unscheduled appointment out of him he had spent most of the day before in or en route to portland he dragged himself out of the chair the patrol officer stepped out of his way boldt peered around the jamb in her midthirties she dressed well wore her hair extremely short and wire glasses that added a thoughtful intelligence the face seemed familiar to him but he couldnt come up with a name he stared at her searching for a name she sensed it and turned and met eyes with him connie he called out connie bowler he had in fact spoken to her the day before she had helped him to locate her drunken husband it felt as if a week had gone by boldt showed her to a seat and shut the office door for privacy she clutched her purse tightly sarah had a favorite blanket she held to this same way beneath the purse lay a bulging oversized mailer boldt found it difficult to take his eyes off that envelope connie bowler spoke in a high rushed voice if tom asks ill say i drove up here to do some shopping but he wont ask so it doesnt matter she rattled on its a bit of a stretch because the shopping in portland is just as good but we do have a few friends up here she said thinking aloud you and elizabeth among them but i wouldnt dare use that because he might follow up on it how long has tom been drinking like that boldt asked getting directly to the point how is elizabeth she asked avoiding an answer i was so sorry to hear better i think he didnt want a twentyminute heaping of sympathy he had grown to resent such offers i wanted to work with tom on this kidnapping case the pied piper yes he answered she toyed with the chain to her purse eyes cast down in avoidance she pulled out the manila folder and boldt stepped up to accept it he did not open it despite himself he set it aside thats why im here why i came tom she caught herself and glanced over at his office door as if to make sure it was closed their conversation private we dont know each other very well do we he knew bowler from the constant traffic of information between departments and because bowler had once chaired a conference of northwest law enforcement at which boldt had been one of the speakers well enough he attempted to reassure her tom was lead detective on the pied piper did you know that yes thats why i came down yesterday he added to ask about penny she blushedan involuntary act that spoke volumes boldt felt flooded with anxiety connie bowler glanced quickly at the door again drawn perhaps by a uniform passing close to the office once the uniform was well out of earshot she whispered penny was taken from us in the middle of the second week of the investigation for boldt this meant the pied piper had routinely blackmailed local police officers that in all likelihood the evidence from each city was tainted that flemming and the fbi had been following bad information all along sheila hill had suspected as much connie bowler now confirmed it tom wont talk about it but i know he concealed evidence he said the case file was stolen and he kept it from the fbi that way thats not right i cant let it happen again i mean it already has hasnt it sarah he told me and these other children up here im so sorry i know that if tom but you have to understand we got her back safely penny it was all we dreamed for the womans eyes brimmed with tears her lips quivered and her face collapsed like a balloon losing air she shrank down into herself suddenly half her size her tears spilled onto her blouse leaving constellations on her chest and tom hes convinced that if it came out how he intentionally threw the casefor whatever reasonthat theyd pull his badge and his benefits and kick him out into the street and the way it is were just not prepared to start over like that you know the kids and all as he waited for her to continue he understood that he had already violated the ransom demands and a sinking terror filled him that he had done the wrong thing in giving in to the intervention but in the same thought he realized that bowler could not live with what hed done connie bowlers tearstreaked face confronted boldt who caught movement out of the corner of his eye he lifted his hand to stop daphne from entering his office connie looked in daphnes direction but by the time she did she saw only her back as daphne walked away no questions asked connie said softly pennys fine not a scratch on her no sign of you know nothing hed done nothing bad to her he the question puzzled her the kidnapper a woman couldnt possibly put a child through this playing his cards closely boldt said nothing to contradict her did tom make contact with him she shook her head no he would have told me she teared up again we heard nothing for over three weeks sarah had been missing six days he could not fathom the concept of three weeks she was found in the clackamas town center its a mall her name our address and phone number were found on a card in her pocket left there like a lost package she sprouted more tears and mumbled repeating nothing was wrong with her she was fine just a little scared was all the card handwritten or typed on a computer tom said she forced a smile its funny that that would matter to both of you isnt it i remember he mentioned it was a computer it struck me as so strange that he would care about that boldts speech came out hoarse and dry i will need to talk with tom about his case i told him he had to talk to you that we couldnt allow it to continue but he said that penny came first that he had gone to the devil to save penny and keep her safe and that he wasnt going to throw that all away now boldt wasnt sure he had the courage to do what connie bowler had doneto get sarah back safely and then risk it all over again what we went through what weve gone through well you know dont you she made it a statement you of all people would understand thats what i tried to tell tom if we can tell anyone she teared up again and spoke to boldt the father the parent her voice earnest and strong no one should ever have to go through what we went through it has to stop holding his gaze she silently pleaded with him then she stood wiping away her tears and indicated the thick manila envelope i put our address on top mail it back to me please he still looks at it occasionally boldt offered to copy the file while she waited this appealed to her and boldt left her in his office while he copied it the action reminding him of copying lamoias task force book only days earlier if he did not act if he allowed the pied piper to continue the abductions in all likelihood sarah would be returned unharmed this possibility tugged at him but was quickly replaced by an image of bowler cradling the glass of scotch the child had been saved but the father lostthe family broken chapter the fbis washington state field office located in seattles new federal building smelled of perfumed disinfectant that daphne matthews associated with a doctors waiting room she was repulsed by the smell because it reminded her of a particular car deodorizer that came in the shape of a small green pine tree and hung from the rearview mirror or inside the trunk the smell of which was seared into her memory where it would remain forever just the smell of it made her want to run she was supposed to trick an fbi agent into supplying information the bureau had yet to release to spd no small task the intervention had gone well boldtand sarah with himwas now supported by a team of competent and fiercely loyal individuals bent on the girls rescue as flemmings intelligence officer kay kalidja had unrestricted access to bureau resources making her an invaluable ally by not making an appointment daphne denied kalidja any preparation for her visit she was kept waiting for ten minutes in a small reception area behind the receptionist hung a photo of the president another of the fbi chief and a third of wsfos special agent in charge kalidja appeared at the secured door and greeted daphne apologizing for keeping her waiting daphne followed her inside the digs here arent much for those of us from outoftown im sharing an office with two others she showed daphne into the cramped and cluttered office and closed the door they resent us of coursethe local agents they dont want washington coming in and dictating procedure on the surface its business as usual but the resentment is there have a seat if you can find one the office walls held bookshelves crowded with looseleaf binders bearing the fbi logo they faced each other from opposite sides of the desk daphne lied for the sake of her efforts they assign me all the nobrainers assignments they wouldnt dare ask a male officer to do same thing here i promise kalidja said sympathetically they assume were incapable of using our brains daphne said hoping to strike a common chord and its not our brains theyre thinking about kalidja said she laughed her neck was long and elegant she might have made it as a model had she tried daphne met eyes with the woman and said have you ever noticed how quickly your ideas become someone elses suddenly all the credit is going down the table special agent kay kalidja did not break the eye contact understanding perfectly well that daphne had come for a favor daphne placed thompsons rendition of the tattoo in front of kalidja and let it sit there she said vicap and your other databases keep track of body markings dont they kalidja fingered the photocopy left forearm daphne said his kalidja nearly shouted the pied pipers daphne nodded if it pans out we unveil it at a four oclock the two of us with two of us one spd one fbi they cant take it away from us everyones talking up joint cooperation but doing little if anything to make it happen she paused what do you think you mean keep it from our own people kalidja was clearly afraid of the idea flemming ran a tight ship where did you get this we keep it between us until we know if were going to look like fools or geniuses daphne broke into a sweat a smile slowly crept onto kalidjas face illuminating her features and lending her an attractive innocence younger and less formal i could have something this afternoon tomorrow at the latest kalidja said eyes sparkling with excitement daphne settled back in the chair and relaxed she had her right where she wanted her chapter wednesday morning greeted carlie kittridge with excitement beating in her chest her focus on the volleyball game later that evening she climbed out of bed the moment she heard trudys little coughs over the baby monitor the coughs signaled a gagging sound followed by outright cryinghungerand she attempted to fend off that stage whenever possible the house was small but the master bath oversized and so she kept the cradle in the bathroom alongside the tub and in front of the windows with the beige cafe curtains that faced the wallingford bridge she unwrapped and pulled away the receiving blanket talking silly at little trudy and planting a gentle kiss on the fivemontholds forehead amazed at the softness of the skin and its sweet cream smell just before trudys impatience built to a peal her mother scooped her up gently and pulled her tightly against the warmth of her chest carlie wearing a terry cloth robe immediately planted her daughter onto her left breast who suckled hungrily she held her effortlessly there remembering briefly how unnatural it had all felt in evelyns first week on earth how far mother father and family had come since then with trudy everything seemed second nature for carlie as simple as could be carlie quickly glanced over her shoulder experiencing the disquieting sensation that she was being watched she wrote it off to the exposure of her bare breastshe still felt selfconscious about the nursing with trudy gumming and nibbling at her carlie walked a little faster downstairs through the morning darkness and changed her girls diaper in the nursery she entered the kitchen and brought a bottle of formula from the refrigerator the automatic light spreading white over her and again instilling a sense of vulnerability carlie ran some hot water to warm the bottle and switched trudy to her right breast without a thought weaning was the worst she enjoyed the breastfeeding so much but her milk had not come in as strongly for trudy as it had for evelyn and so she had been supplementing with the bottle she was on a schedule to have trudy completely off the breast by the time the summer sand leagues started no sense in having engorged and painful breasts all summer long she tuned the stereo to a light rock station and burped trudy to cuts from the beatles white album with trudy in the mechanical swing carlie slipped into a pair of fresh underwear shorts socks and a jog bra her sweatshirt was from the university bookstore as the sun broke over the eastern horizon she carried trudy upstairs and awakened david she held the child while david freshened up and then with trudy safely in her fathers arms carlie broke out into the crisp moist morning air alive and vital but harboring that same unsettling feeling that someone was indeed watching the evening game would be upon them before she knew it lou boldt dismissed the first call from sketch artist tommy thompson as a cry for payment thompson a freelancer and former employee of the police department understood he faced a four to sixweek wait for his check boldt believed thompson was merely attempting to hasten the process by applying some pressure he reluctantly heeded the second call however because the word urgent was conveniently tacked onto the message if thompson was misusing their relationship boldt would give him a piece of his mind but as it was he owed him the professional courtesy of a return call youre either getting sloppy lazy or both thompson began their telephone conversation i put in for payment the minute i got back tommy you did great work with that tattoo if i had my way i would have paid you on the spot im not talking about my check im talking about your lack of hindsight that is covering your tail end boldt understood the implication immediatelythat he had been followed to vashon island and the session with thompsonand felt sick to his stomach the pied piper had warned him in the ransom note to derail the investigation not work to improve their evidence he experienced a flutter in his chest and a lightheadedness that bordered on nausea if the pied piper knew about thompson then boldt had just sabotaged his own daughter you were contacted boldt nearly screamed into the receiver furious at himself for having let down his guard he had not thought to look for a tail the day of that ferry ride you might call it more of an interrogation thompson said i got a little doortodoor from a blue suit named hale dunkin hale you know him i know him boldt confirmed was interested in a little birdwatching as in eagles you got it you showed him the sketch boldt complained into the phone thompson snapped sarcastically no i told him to go screw himself i do that with all the fbi agents who come knocking if i had wanted the thing broadcast boldt reminded i would have done it inhouse yeah i trained every one of them kids we both know why you made the ferry trip he added listen he told me not to say a word about his visit told me the irs loves to audit artists working out of their houses a real peach this one meaning you put it back onto him and im a screwed pooch you got that i got it intelligence thompson mused what exactly does that mean anyway boldt wondered how hale had found out about henry shotz would doris shotz reluctant to involve her son in the first place volunteer to the fbi that shed withheld information from them doubtful had hale placed a tail on boldt had he wiretapped boldt the same way boldt had wiretapped him perhaps boldt had just found him chapter the idea of running one investigation inside another appealed to lamoia in the same way as did the secrecy of having an affair at that wednesday morning he was paged to the four seasons olympic arguably the best hotel in the city he drew attention as he passed through the elegantly appointed lobby in part because of his cocky body language he rode up to the fifth floor along with a chinese woman laden with nordstrom shopping bags a few minutes past twelve noon he knocked sharply on the door to room the routine nearly always the same the room door came open for him and lamoia stepped inside sheila hill had pulled the windows gauzy inner curtain so that the noonday light bled across her skin in an induced twilight she wore a black underwire bra that forced her breasts up invitingly and black highcut underwear revealing her tanned flank she stepped toward him with her practiced hungry look in her polished eyes and lamoia suddenly wondered what he was doing there she allowed him a modicum of control by eagerly submitting to various fantasies but her reason for being there was a form of addiction whereas his was a desire for companionship he had dated twentyyearolds for too long he turned away from her taking in the room with its glimpse of the sounds graygreen waters and shipping traffic he wanted a conversation something more than gstrings and the kama sutra he told her boldt was able to get some of the credit records from the bureauyou dont want to ask i dont want to talk she corrected swaying toward him but stopping short of making contact lets see what can make you stop talking she slipped off a shoulder strap and sucked on her fingertip weve got to talk he dared this isnt working for me how bout this she inquired slipping off the other strap it certainly worked last time she placed her hand between her legs cant we just talk for a change damn you she said her act over though her chest and cheeks flushed with anticipation she stormed over to her pack of cigarettes all femininity gone and lit a smoke until that moment he hadnt fully allowed himself to realize how much of her was an act so talk lamoia said not like that i mean talk about something other than work and sex he said and the leading candidates are what if we just had dinner tonight a bottle of wine some pasta i hate pasta i bloat up what has gotten into you we shouldnt be doing this at lunch hour he complained regretting his earlier line of argument born of guilt and concern over sarahs abduction he said those kids need us on this round the clock what the hell have you been smoking she sucked on the cigarette though didnt seem to notice it she appraised him like a tailor paying no mind whatsoever to her own partial nudity reaching for the table she tossed him a key ring and said make me a gin and tonic she indicated the minibar its lunchtime captain yeah okay make it a double and make one for you too i dont think so make one for you too im not drinking alone cowboy lamoia obeyed her observing himself as if watching another he poured the drinks a stranger to himself from where did she extract such power over him he even went down the hall for ice the drinks were poured strong the cigarette smoke annoyed him she circled him as she drank more important question she said why would you give a shit about conversation hmm she dipped her finger into her drink and offered it to his lips and he sucked on it tongue she said and he obeyed are you going soft on me so to speak she plopped herself down onto the bed the drink spilling onto her hand she licked off the excess lasciviously making a great show of her abnormally long tongue i want more than nooners he blurted out not from me you dont she leaned back and poured a stream from her drink so that a silver line of liquid jumped through the delicate white hairs on her belly and vanished into the underwears black elastic ready or not she said again rocking her legs open and closed she giggled girlishly he knew that was part of it as wellshe was someone else in these hotel rooms lamoia upended the drink she liked his long neck and its angular adams apple he did this for her again not understanding why her thighs slapped softly she poured another stream down her belly to where it disappeared come and get it she waved the cigarette at him lamoia slipped it from her fingers and extinguished it suddenly boiling mad with the reactions of a snake he knocked the drink from her hand snagged her wrist and pulled her so hard and so quickly toward the head of the bed that he pulled her out of her underwear it rolled into a lump between her knees whee she squealed possibly appreciating that he had mixed her drink as a triple and his own as a single take a few minutes to think about us he said cuffing her left wrist to the headboard she made an exaggerated expression of concern and said oh youre scaring me the liquor glass rolled to a stop lamoia hurried to the closet and returned with two terry cloth bathrobe belts a moment later the underwear was on the floor and her ankles bound to the bed something new she said excitedly have we done handcuffs youve been rude to me sheila demeaning rank has its privileges she fired back at him waiting for him to undress once youre captain ill make the drinks but youll still come when i call and you know why the twentyyearolds gratify the ego all right but not the loin lamoia tugged the comforter off the bed then the blanket out from under her and the flat sheet hill naked and writhing legs bound one hand in the cuffs didnt know what to make of this she forced a smile beginning to question his actions he reached beneath her and she cooperated arching her back he freed the corner of the fitted sheet and also stripped this from the bed pulling a mattress pad with it nothing left with which to cover herself what the hell she said he showed her the handcuff key as he carefully set it down in plain sight next to the television she looked around searchingly suddenly understanding the game no way she said believing it a joke phones in reach he said pointing you will not do this she shouted i am stark naked he nodded and you know something youll call me again youre dead you do this she squirmed but wasnt getting loose her free arm could not reach her ankle he moved toward the door and you know why because youve never had it like this those fiftyyearolds just dont do it for you lamoia pulled the door shut her insults filling the hall he wondered how long until she made the phone call to room service chapter with the volleyball tossed and hanging in the air awaiting her open palm carlie kittridge suddenly worried over having left trudy with a sitter she knew this stemmed from the pregame discussion about the kidnapper called the pied piper that had focused on news stories warning parents not to leave their children in the care of others until the kidnapper was captured carlie caught the ball rather than serve it her husband shouted back at her lets go serve em up a beauty instead carlie bounced the ball toward jenny their weakest player but the only woman on the bench conference rules required genderbalanced teams her husband chastised what the hell she felt no need to have to explain herself a mothers prerogative she searched for the car keys in the pocket of davids warmups possession of those keys lent her a great sense of freedom and relief have danny drop you off she told him her husbands expression conveyed a sense of treason danny he croaked incredulously jenny stepped up to the service line having little sense of her own inability to play the game a member of the opposing team complained loudly about the substitution taking too long and demanded a serve at least serve out the game david pleaded jenny called out the score and served a lofting floater to the opponents backcourt the resulting bump was a perfect set for the front line the spike came right at david who failed to block it side out carlie hurried out of the gym a stunned and defeated david kittridge shouted after his wife far too late to be heard dont forget its damn near out of gas carlie kittridge had forgotten she ran out of gas eleven blocks from home at the corner of nd and stoneway blinded by her fear for her baby she failed to pull the truck entirely off the roadway leaving it dead angled toward the curb and blocking traffic the lights still on she came out of the trucks cab at a full sprint already warmed up from her volleyball came out running like a thoroughbred from the gate seattle traffic being what it was she left most of it behind as if it were standing still blowing through intersections without looking without slowing her pace in the slightest her hysteria feeding off her charged system the harder she ran the more convinced she was of the trouble that lay ahead ironically it was the disabled pickup truck abandoned midlane that brought the police into it not the abduction of trudy kittridge fearing a carjacking an abduction or simply a vehicle stolen for a joyride the reporting motor patrol officer requested a blackandwhite do a driveby inquiry at the kittridge residencethe name and address lifted from his wireless computer terminal that accessed dmvs mainframe as carlie kittridge rounded the corner of th and stoneway she was in abject horror and running faster than she had ever run in her life she approached the kitchen door already calling out for gena a neighbors fourteenyearold daughter in whom carlie had placed an enormous amount of deserved trust gena was fourteen going on thirty she loved trudy like a member of the family and her own mothera fantastic friendlived just four houses down the block gena its me she called out loudly swinging open the kitchen door gena lay there on the floor her clothes torn her fourteenyearold body exposed carlie kittridges scream was heard for several blocks chapter lamoia awakened from a comatose sleep summoned by the irritating beeping of his pager his first response was anger his second was a feeling of fear and dread pm he had fallen asleep at his kitchen table he could conceive of very few reasons for the summons not one of which he wanted to face he read the phone number from the device and heaved a sigh of relief sheila hills home telephone an unpublished number she had decided to talk he complimented himself for understanding her she was not an easy keeper its me he announced over the phone their name is kittridge her blank tone of voice and the announcement drained all color from his face she read off an address handle it she hung up leaving him with a hollow panicked feeling another kidnapping within an hour photocopies of trudy kittridges face were faxed to airports train stations ferry companies the image being shown to cab drivers limo drivers bus drivers within the next hour every local television station would cut away to the same photo hundreds of thousands of people would see that face and yet if the pied piper lived up to his reputation no one would see the child daphne awaited him as he pulled up her face grim her fists clenched tightly her job to define the pied piper in terms of behavior was taking its toll she looked exhausted lamoia said you take the parents ill take the scene we gotta work fast this placell be jumping in a couple minutes we need the head start we powwow in the kitchen in ten minutes you believe in miracles no she answered me neither lamoia had never smoked he drank beer but only socially he had been blind drunk twice in his life and had hated the lack of control but at that moment he envied the habitual whatever the vice because it gave the person a preoccupation an object of distraction he had only the first officers description of the fourteenyearold unconscious on the kitchen floor to occupy his thoughts he would have given anything to erase it from his mind he could visualize her lying there where now there was some litter from the emts medical work and afids from the air taser sight of the afids reminded him of the stonewalling of evidence sarah and the others deserved better than this daphne joined him in the kitchen as planned she told him the mother is real clear on the spitting image outfit it was a tiny little sweatshirt a gift knew the name and everything did you tell her not to share said same with our distinguished colleagues thats suppressing evidence john well shame on us a pair of lincoln town cars pulled up in front lamoia said to her stall them give me as much time as you can he took two steps turned and asked where are they upstairs to the left lamoia threw open the bedroom door stepped inside and closed it quickly behind himself mr and mrs kittridge the couple was trashed the man worse than the wife who looked as if she had run a marathon he knew about the volleyball game though he wasnt sure how the pied piper had made the connection he displayed his badge and introduced himself he edged over to the window and peered out flemming hale and kalidja the full team they walked as a group with strict determination flemming held an intensity that lamoia did not want to experience firsthandthe guys career was in flames and spd was pouring on the gasoline youve just spoken with ms matthews about a certain garment that your child that trudy received as a gift he glanced out the window nervously for a second time daphne wouldnt be able to hold them for long if the bureau made the spitting image connection then they were likely to close in on a suspect perhaps ahead of boldt and sarahs chances went down the drain he owed this effort to boldt who had made the spitting image connection in the first place the sweatshirt the wife muttered nervous perspiration breaking out all over he spoke quickly to the parents knowing he had one and only one shot at an explanation okay heres the thing what im about to tell you is opinion my opinion but keep in mind im lead detective for seattle police on this case okay just keep that in mind this information this spitting image connection is what we call a good lead you understand its important information to us very important to the investigation im talking about to getting trudy back but there are other people investigating these kidnappings okay the fbi im talking about and they arent exactly our bosom buddies if you know what i mean theyve had this investigation for nearly six months and parents just like you are still waiting for news of their children okay six months gimme a break these guys cant even remember the kids names you know what a leak is good thats great well he lied we think there is a leak inside the fbi we think information like thisthe spitting image informationis better kept close to home he heard footsteps growing closer flemming and his team lamoia felt a bead of sweat run down his chin he wiped it off better kept right here in seattle you want to deal with threepiece suits and black shoes you go right ahead its a free country i cant stop you but me im right down the street you pick up the phone im there okay public safety building right downtown these guys go ahead and try to reach them on the phone i cant even reach them what chance do you have the footsteps were only a few yards away what chance does trudy have thats what youve got to ask yourself six months theyve had this think about that theyre trying to handle a dozen cases whats to show for it why because somebodys not clean thats why a strong hand knocked on the doorflemminglamoia knew this before the door opened lamoia repeated its a free country i cant tell you what to do they cant tell you what to do no one can make you say anything you dont want to he shouted toward the door yeah flemming threw the door open in his strong rich baritone he addressed the parents mr and mrs kittridge im terribly sorry for your loss he glanced over at lamoia venomously for not waiting and then back to the parents he introduced himself and his two special agents im sure detective lamoia sergeant lamoia corrected interrupting he said you still dont know my rank has asked you a few questions wed like to start all over if you dont mind the sooner we get this information the better our chances of getting your daughter back trudy kay kalidja supplied trudy flemming repeated david kittridge glanced over at lamoia and then complained to flemming just like youve gotten all the other children back lamoia felt the warm rush of success as flemming flashed him another angry look david kittridge lifted his right hand holding it out for everyone to see gripped tightly between white bloodless fingers was a tin penny flute chapter do you know the aquarium well the big viewing room that is under all the fish the creamy female voice inquired yes daphne answered can you be there in fifteen minutes see you there the walk to the aquarium felt good in part because it was nearly entirely downhill daphne worked herself up to a good heart rate past cranes and caterpillars and jackhammers all busy making the population deaf the city refused to stop growing unable to spread out it grew up now the new buildings pushing higher and higher into the sky winning views of the bay and blocking the view of others the streets closed in around the pedestrians the town of seattle was gone a city having replaced it elliott bays restless windscuffed green waters caught the sunshine in highlights like italian marble with flecks of mica angled to the sun freighters and ferries their white wakes flowing behind them like wedding veils called out in deepthroated cries a jet rocked its wings on final approach its wheels like tiny talons reaching for the ground on its best day no city was as beautiful no city held her heart as this one she knew she would never leave although she had considered doing sodistance would force a fresh start she also knew that if she stayed she would likely marry owen adler fear had led to her breaking off the engagement the first time fear of being filthy rich of attending fundraising dinners and ribboncutting ceremonies instead of working psych profiles and wouldbe suicides fear of losing her identity not a fear of her love for this man she trusted her love she appreciated his humor the attention he paid her his intelligence confidence and determination the way he put others first especially corky his adopted daughter she loved corky nearly as much as he did she walked right past the aquarium before she realized what she had done owen was like thathe could occupy her in ways no other man ever had the aquarium was crowded with tourists and a busload of students on a field trip most of the display areas were kept dark the visitors attention focused on the fish tanks in the walls she navigated her way through the throng and made her way to the descending ramp that led down into the center of an enormous tank where the humans became the observed surrounded on all sides and overhead by coral water and fish of a dozen varieties special agent kay kalidja occupied one of the two viewing benches her purse and sweater set beside her holding a spot for daphne who sat down the glass arched above them fish swimming directly overhead passing from one side of the tank to the other kalidja did not look at daphne but at the fish she pointed out a sand shark with a suckerfish attached i feel like that sometimes she said in her pleasing island lilt the one attached yes made to follow to stay close kalidjas choosing a neutral site forewarned of the significance of the meeting excitement filled daphne as she nudged you ran the tattoo the contents of many of the bureaus databases are classified as you must know we track everything from violent offenders to suspected double agents in the state department for this reason there are levels of access imposed levels of security pass codes login records it is extremely wellprotected data hackers have fooled with our web site before but no oneto my knowledgehas ever come close to compromising these databases kalidja found it difficult to share the information she struggled to admit yes the tattoos she then said pointing out a pair of blue and yellow fish spectacular the system tracks access kalidja continued it maintains a computerized log not only can internal investigators see who has been working what information but it also allows agents to see who else has worked the information to share that information an agent in chicago can call an agent in dallas who has been requesting the same information perhaps they are pursuing the same suspect and were unaware of the connection the database actually alerts them those alerts are automatic now offering a kind of investigative bibliography impressive daphne said suppressing her anxiety over where kalidja was headed the agent faced daphne for the first time and spoke quickly but extremely softly special agent dunkin hale requested any and all information on eagle tattoosphotographs of those on file tattoo artists known for wrapping the wings around the bird like a cape everything he could think of daphne had expected nothing like this she had a dozen questions to ask but held her tongue kalidja was not finished special agent hale has never mentioned any such tattoo in any of our meetings never not once and you had said nothing to him about it absolutely not perhaps he saw it on your desk never i accepted this information from you in the strictest of confidence ive told no one shown no one daphne tried to make sense of it the schools of fish swimming over above and around her added to her sense of confusion vicim our violent criminal identification and markings database has produced two hits two similar tattoos she said producing photocopies and showing them to daphne one of the tattoos was shown on the biceps the other on a pectoral they were in fact both unmistakably similar to the rendition drawn by tommy thompson a bald eagle looking straight ahead the wings wrapped around like a cape one is dead the other is two years into serving a life sentence mind you we only show federal offenders in the database and only a limited number of them it is by no means complete its not our boy his was on the forearm no but the same artist perhaps special agent hale pursued the name of the artist i can tell that from the database requests daphne sniped imagine calling this artwork studying the photos she asked wait a second are you saying these two cons are from the same region the same city kalidja answered both arrested and convicted in new orleans louisiana the tattoo shop is in new orleans exactly because of boldt daphne knew a great deal about the investigation that kay kalidja and the fbi did not including that the pied piper had used a telephone scam to convince the day care center into handing over sarah to the two uniformed cops con artists were continually arrested and even occasionally convicted using this new information she wondered if she couldnt work the new orleans police or prosecuting attorneys office to id any con artists using telephone scams the location was a huge find it would shift the entire investigation boldt often spoke of an investigation gaining momentum that there came a time when the evidence outweighed the mystery when the huge rock of knowledge assembled by a squad in an uphill manner suddenly crested that hill and began the journey down she believed that combined with kalidjas information the pied piper investigation had just crested it would pick up steam now and eventually that rock would crush the pied piper in its path daphne said what do you intend to do with this kalidja looked a little frightened honestly ms matthews if i had not discovered that special agent hale already has this same information i was intending that weyou and ishould present the information to the task force as we discussed but now i have to wonder why special agent hale would withhold such information yes i am unfortunately not in a position to take this directly to sac flemming we call that an end run yes i deal with the sac all the time but by design any information especially information such as this must go through special agent hale sac flemming is careful to insulate himself in this manner he has managed to keep control of this investigation far longer than others might have in no small part because he is so carefully insulated special agent hale and i were not brought on until portland this assignment has been a graveyard three of the sacs former deputies and two of his former intelligence officers were removed prior to portland he shoots the messenger you see it allows him to preserve his position she looked daphne up and down head to toe and then met eyes with her there is something else something far more disturbing she said softly i overheard special agent hale inform the sac that the task force was his whenever he wanted it meaning those were his words exactly yours whenever you want it sac flemming does not like captain hill having control over the task forcewe all know that but he is an astute politician he will not take control of a sinking ship nonetheless i believe special agent hale has discovered a way to push captain hill out of her chair when and if the time comes if the time comes your captain would do well to watch her back looking at the fish she said i do not care to see men ganging up on a woman just because she holds the position of power daphne recalled hills request that she study and report on each member of the task force captain hill is quite the politician herself i wouldnt count her out do not underestimate sac flemming he is a brilliant man and a brilliant investigator if the pied piper is caught it will not be sheila hills collar this i promise you there will be only one person giving the press conference and that person will be sac flemming and these daphne asked indicating the photocopies of the database information why dont i follow up on this for you kalidja had clearly been hoping for such an offer it is not for me to act upon information your name will now appear as having accessed the same database yes hale may notice that only if he seeks the same information a second time i see no reason he would do that i accept daphne took the envelope to her a treasure watch out for special agent hale kalidja said in a hushed voice she stood and straightened her kneelength skirt message received chapter boldt lamoia and daphne took a walk around pioneer square in order to avoid ears within public safety dodging tourists panhandlers and ticket scalpers they passed a sax player and boldt left a dollar bill in his case much to lamoias disapproval you just encourage them lamoia complained its how he makes his living you cant call that music you of all peopleyou know music so why give up your hardearned money they are con artists daphne said the nineoneone scam tells us that much their world is illusion he could have been arrested and charged by the state not the feds they wouldnt have him in their database hale is ahead of us lamoia complained you know what that means for sarah daphne answered we dont know that for sure we know only that he searched the same information that kalidja supplied us he probably got the names of the two cons with the same eagle tattoo it had to be indiana michigan denver or new orleans boldt informed them new orleans fits he confirmed and just how the hell do you know that lamoia protested andersons photos he answered the ones you gave me i went over those things a dozen times two dozen there was no license plate no markers or identifiers of any kind to indicate the sweatshirt boldt supplied coming down the dock hes facing the camera you cant see his face because of the hat but the sweatshirt has two colors on it purple and gold school colors those same colors are used by colleges in indiana michigan denver and new orleans lamoia completed understanding the logic there was the offchance it might have been high school colors but i was betting university or college so it is new orleans lamoia said our suspect spent time there daphne said picking up on the reasoning maybe went to school there more than likely got a tattoo there could have spent time locked up kalidja stressed that only some of the inmates end up on the database may still have contacts there lamoia added or a sheet boldt warned if we involve the law down there it will have to be done carefully the ransom demand he reminded lamoia asked why would hale stonewall this from his own people flemmings attitude fosters independents daphne said kalidja warned me of that boldt suggested we need that tattoo shop agreed lamoia echoed i have the address daphne announced proudly drawing looks of astonishment from both men you think i wanted fresh air she asked sarcastically boldt asked hale probably has it too she admitted it was in their database boldt warned we cant have him iding a suspect no daphne agreed we going to cajun country lamoia asked we gotta find this tattoo shop ahead of hale ill book the flights boldt said boldts phone was ringing as he reentered his office he caught it before voice mail picked up he answered tersely having no interest in intelligence work the pressure of hales advance work threatening sarah what it is my man the deep voice uttered into the phone he recognized the drawl immediately not now raymond what has one tail but two assholes the snitch asked am i paying for this bit of entertainment what has a nice set of tits a dick and two wings boldt didnt want to be playing games he told the man so i thought you cops were good at solving shit like this boldt answered two people on a plane a man and a woman damn so why do i care because one of the assholes is this visiting heat this fbi brother whos been all over the tv the other is one fine piece of trim boldts chest tightened flemming and kalidja where did you get this raymond a brother just came by the air strip the gman and the gstring jumped a private jet fifteen minutes ago flemming had a government lear at his disposal the information held together boldt informed his informer theres a fifty in it if you can give me their destination and i need it quickly right back to you the phone went dead for flemming and kalidja to leave the city together without letting the task force know meant something big was in the works bigger than big huge boldt suspected their destination was new orleans that flemming had the jump on the tattoo shop that sarahs chances were diminishing with every hour boldt called a travel agent and booked himself and lamoia nonrefundable tickets to new orleans on the earliest flight available if need be he would appeal to flemming in person revealing sarahs abduction in the midst of booking the flights boldts other line rang and he answered it boise idaho raymond announced the gman jet filed for boise idaho as in potatoes its going down in the book boldt acknowledged confirming the payment and the rich get richer raymond hung up boldt steadied his hand as he dialed boises police department he knew several cops there if flemming had a suspect already in custody minutes later boldt connected with detective hank langford boldt reintroduced himself to langford as an intelligence officer investigating the pied piper kidnappings electing a strategy of usagainstthem he made assumptions and took chances that a week earlier he would have been unwilling to take hank as im sure you are aware you have a situation over there that may involve our investigation our friends in the fbi are on their way there as we speak we at spd were hoping you might enlighten us a little so we dont end up with mud on our faces mud or shit lieutenant i see we understand each other i dont have a clue what youre talking bout closest thing weve got to a situation is a fivecar fender bender out on the interstate a diesel jockey fell asleep at the wheel rolled his eighteenwheeler and dumped about a hundred microwave ovens out on the highway like some kind of garage sale right there in front of the airport the trucker was decapitated around here we let the state police boys clean up those messes a lot of blood in a decapitation you ever seen one would you know anybody with state police who might know about extending an invitation to the bureau this is idaho from gods lips to your ears we arent real fond of the federal government they tend to grab our land try for our water and steal our checkbooks could you make a call for me could and will sit tight wont be a minute it was seven minutes boldt counted each one along with his elevated heart rate langford sounded a little more excited on the second call seems youre onto something the fbi was in fact contacted do we know why i told you about the pileup one of those cars was found abandoned no driver no passenger what was found was baby bottles dirty diapers and such the car came back an econodrive rental out of seattle thats when the feds were notified he added whoever was driving abandoned the scene of an accident and took an infant child with them leaving the scene is a crime in and of itself boldt asked desperately any sign of a second child being in that car an older child didnt hear nothing about it if you hear anything more boldt said got you covered flemming was pulling an end run it was information he should have shared any evidence trail would begin in that wrecked car boldt wanted that crime scene but he needed it ahead of the bureau and that wasnt going to happen he couldnt allow any of this to distract him the pull remained new orleans and identifying a suspectpreventing hale from doing so the decision was a simple one let hill aim the task force at boise convincing her that lamoia was best left behind in seattle then jump the plane for new orleans stealing lamoia and staying ahead of the race screaming into the phone sheila hill ordered boldt to keep trying for details and to stay by his phone boldt in turn pleaded with her to assign mulwright to boise dont tell me my job lieutenant she hung up boldt spent the next fifteen minutes finding daphne and lamoia and keeping them current lamoia was asked to pursue econodrive and run the charge history on the credit card used to rent the abandoned car daphne with her people skills was asked to work nopd by phone for any con artists who used a telephone scam she wasnt to mention her association with the task force as he was debating buying daphne a ticket to new orleans as well his wife called him to announce a visitor sergeant tom bowler portland police department was sitting in boldts living room chapter bowler was sober making him a different man than the last time boldt had seen him he had clear eyes that wore concern at their edges though he possessed the soft bloated look of a man lost to the bottle boldt noticed the liver spots on the back of the mans hand and felt its coldness as they shook hands in greeting tom boldt felt jumpy and edgy there was too much going on inside his head to stay focused too many lies to keep straight he had seen suspects this wayfrayed and scattered he worried he was becoming the very person he sought liz her wig perfectly in place her clothes hanging loosely explained patiently tom drove all the way from portland to talk to you ive been boring him with the details of my recovery not at all bowler said generously she called it her recoveryher decision to walk out of treatment to turn to gods healing powers as supportive as boldt had felt about it only days earlier he feared that any setback might rob her of her ability to mentally fight the battle she preached to those who would listen the healing powers of her faith ironically boldt could only pray that she wouldnt lose that same faith if the beast grabbed hold of her again boldt sat down alongside his wife but could hardly stay still bowler had gone to a great deal of trouble to come here pushed by connie or of his own accord therein lay the important difference liz offered to leave the room boldt and bowler immediately after him told her she was welcome to remain it involves us both boldt told his wife his eyes on their visitor yes both of you bowler began i know what youre going through i also accept that in no small way im responsible liz sat up straight and her lips quivered the facade she had offered bowler was crumbling boldt took her hand he said to boldt when you came down to see me i was an asshole i was drinking we were threatenedconnie and me i just could not would not put us into that same position again he sat in the chair leaning forward elbows on his knees hands steepled at his chin he looked as if he might be praying too and then this kittridge girl liz knew only the rough details of the kittridge case what boldt had told her from the bathtub like her husband she was a practiced listener bowler said that changed things i dont know if it was connie or sarah and this kittridge girl but something convinced me it has to stop maybe it was your visit he told boldt seeing that you were willing to take him on that i wish i had i was pissedpissed that you had the strength i lacked i wasnt about to help you he said to liz you got a good man here liz sobbed and squeezed boldts hand boldt corrected him returning her affection he told bowler we made that decision together bowler said we were working the vics possessions anything that might link the kidnappings i informed the bureau that i had a good solid lead boldt interrupted spitting image he nodded you do your homework dont you we stumbled onto it so i ask for a meeting to get this out on the table he blinked furiously his eyes glossy pennys gone the next day needless to say because of the demands i cancel the meeting and keep my trap shut the next day the pied piper knew i had requested that meetinghas to be your contact over there the island girllegs to the ceiling kalidja boldt realized had hill been right about an insider had daphne played right into that bowler said im making lame excuses for skipping the dance shes breathing fire down my throat id been after them to run rental car reservations not the actual agreements using a list of valid cards i had which were boldt asked the spitting image customers if you know about spitting image then you know she has a web page i got to the web page first never did interview her but one of our pocket protectors hacked into her site without any hassle said a sixth grader coulda done it lifts a couple dozen valid credit cards the woman was using email for her orders jesus and im thinking this guys had experience counterfeiting credit cards boldt supplied got to be right credit cards documentation its all available to him he needs fake cards to get things done but first he needs valid numbers and spitting image all but hands them to him not the victims cards no way have to be punch drunk to use those but the other card numbers why not did you ever connect it boldt asked did i ever the afids weve never seen a report yeah well hale has one the cartridges for the air taser were bought all at one time las vegas a year ago one time charge to a valid credit card which later turned out to be much later yeah bowler answered what liz asked irritably the two men answered nearly simultaneously a spitting image customer and thats when you thought to follow the cards boldt said the guy is lifting his vics off the internet why make things harder on himself he does up a valid credit card maybe a drivers license all from the same hack he gets into those files once he never needs to go back again clean and simple is someone going to explain this to me liz asked indignantly how does his using some silkscreen customers credit card connect to rental cars bowler answered shamefully i never followed it up never chased it maybe it does maybe it doesnt boldt told her the pied piper needs valid credit cards and a valid id to rent cars take plane flights whatever if hes using spitting image customersand i agree it makes sense that he mightthen we may be able to track him boldt told bowler the problem with it that i see is that we know he accessed the victims credit card recordsits how he knew their movements how he predicted when to strike this was clearly news to bowler who attempted to digest it boldt continued if he had that kind of access to credit records he doesnt need the spitting image list bowler contradicted sure he does he needs expiration dates those arent available from a trw or some credit service hes got some excon who can pull that kind of information for him bowler speculated it doesnt mean hes got valid cards liz the banker said hes right love he would need the expiration dates for a successful counterfeit what youve got here is someone who knows computers with a color scanner you can forge hundred dollar bills how difficult can a drivers license be boldt thought back to the cdr of sarahvideo embedded on a cdrom he said they teach computer skills in prison bowler looked up and said our tax dollars hard at work chapter boldt returned to the office as fast as the chevy would safely take him a dozen ideas competing inside his head for his attention kalidja hale sarahs situation time running out he couldnt hold all the loose ends together lamoia pushed shut both doors to the fifthfloor corner coffee lounge windows overlooking the secretary pool to one side and the bullpen to the other the situation room which offered far more privacy had become task force headquarters and churned with activity daphne warmed her hands on a tea cup there were no smiles only anxietyridden expressions im toast lamoia said im out of here he had called the others to the impromptu meeting boise boldt asked sheilahill he corrected himself a little late wants me on the six oclock flight wants me running down every stinking piece of evidence there issome of which ive already done incidentally though i didnt tell her econodrive boldt supplied he had asked lamoia to look into the car rental records yeah i had no trouble getting that the abandoned car in the pileup lamoia said was rented to one lena robertson a woman daphne said then it is a team boldt could feel her processing the information she had been among the first to insist that the kidnapped children were intended for illegal adoption and that if true the pied piper more than likely needed an accomplice to help care for and transport the infants boldts revelation of two uniformed cops a man and a woman abducting sarah from day care had supported her theory and led her to investigate previously arrested or convicted con artist couples on a national level con games were often played out in pairs hold that thought right there boldt said hurrying from the coffee lounge once through homicides secure door he started for the elevator but changed his mind and ran the stairs the climb up was arduous and reinforced his utter exhaustion reminding him of how little sleep he had gotten over the past ten days and how poorly he had eaten he reached for some of those dangling strings knowing that the spd task forceand their fbi counterpartwas at the very least close to identifying and arresting the kidnappers accomplice if he could only count on a few pieces of good luck he might yet beat hale or flemming to his daughters abductor but luck rarely ran when one needed it it ran when least expected boldt ran the hallway to his office unlocked his file cabinet and secured the spitting image customer list he was halfway back downstairs when he located the name on the run robertson a baby quilt shipped in care of durrel robertson of oakland california you look like youre about to come out of your skin daphne observed of boldt on his return robertson was a spitting image customer a baby blanket was shipped to that name in care of durrel robertson at what looks like a home address it was charged to a visa in the name of lena robertson daphne and lamoia looked back at him blankly he explained bowlers visit and the possible connectionnever proved and never brought to anyones attention because of pennys kidnappingbetween the pied pipers possible identities and the spitting image customer list youre telling me bowler suddenly got a conscience lamoia said skeptically finding it impossible to conceal his dislike of a cop who would intentionally throw an investigation or did he drive up here to sell you a bill of goods and stay with his original game plan you are the alltime cynic daphne said bowler put together spitting image just as we did but he made a leap in logic that we did not with a bunch of valid credit card numbers at your fingertips why not put them to good use it works for me boldt impressed upon lamoia referring to the customer list robertsons card was used to rent a car here in seattle thats later abandoned on the way to god knows where do we need it any clearer its your call lamoia said irritably youre just pissed that hill can call the shots daphne the psychologist explained to him lamoia was no fan of her psychological evaluations you dont like a woman bossing you around i know you john i know where this is coming from you dont know shit about it hey boldt chided he told lamoia the bureau blocked the financial records of the victims we assume so they could have it all to themselves but we can pull credit card statements for the spitting image customers and look for charges that coincide with the pied pipers calendar you see what theyve done he asked tapping the spitting image records the pied piper uses fresh valid credit cardsrobertson ordered that blanket just last week if he has the access we think he does then he knows her statement dates he knows she wont actually see any of his charges for a month or more hes protected from discovery what we want to do is get to those statements electronically ahead of timewe can do thatthen we focus on car rentals in and around the abduction dates gas charges airfare lodging restaurants they wont use the cards for smallticket items lamoia countered the car rentals sureyou have to show a card daphne said and that card has to match your drivers license fake id lamoia asked so they could use a card and license to board a plane as well id buy that he added for boldts sake but im off to boise to measure skid marks and work a traffic accident thats what this is you know he complained hill is knocking me down to metro i need both of you with me in new orleans if any of this pans out boldt announced hill will have to settle for mulwright lamoia snapped forget it shes talking a minimum of two or three days over there shes going too isnt she daphne speculated its where the press will be lamoia said though he blushed and squirmed in his chair what do you think the press are you sure boldt questioned the ramifications for sarah echoing in his thoughts im sure theyre all over it already already that couldnt have been what flemming wanted boldt pointed out ten to one the captain did it sargehill she wanted flemming slowed down she wanted to punish him for trying the end run what better way than to dump the press in his lap games matthews said disgusted you gotta get me off the boise assignment sarge youve got tattoos to run con artists adoption records a foreign town how badly do you want off whatever it takes lamoia answered ill go daphne confirmed i wont be missed boldt asked lamoia straight answer is there any reason hill would be mad at you moi i need it straight john because from here from what we know about what you face in boise lamoia interrupted you mean failure trying to track down this driver and child after the bureau has a substantial lead on us it looks more like a setup this may be the investigations biggest lead and if it goes nowhere hill needs a scapegoat daphne said following boldts reasoning or else theres a personal agenda at play boldt said challenging lamoia directly and shes either intentionally sending you off to siberia or getting you out of the way so you cant screw things up for her at home he added how bout it lamoia didnt answer he looked searchingly back and forth between boldt and matthews boldt said sarahs out of time if the press picks up on the abandoned car his throat caught to daphne he said better go pack we have seats on the redeye chapter lamoia boiled at the thought of pursuing dead leads in boise idaho while boldt attempted to track the tattoo and criminal records to the actual suspect in a place like the big easy the central question that needed answeringwas sarah better off with him in boiseseemed obvious enough bobbie gaynes or patrick mulwright could easily handle boise how sheila hill could have made such a call without discussion was beyond him once again she was using him this time in a political move that left too many unanswered questions was she afraid of someone within the department was lamoia a threat or did she simply want three days with him in a hotel out of town to mend their fences he feared this latter thought the most playing gigolo in boise for an oversexed overly ambitious woman who had the power to trash his own career exactly what had he gotten himself into perhaps his handcuffing incident had awakened her had made her realize how strong his feelings were for her he had no choice but to obey orders a police department was not a democracy the boise investigation could have been handled over the phone and sheila hill knew it but the camerasalong with the fresh sheets and room servicewere in boise lamoias calls to his credit services contacts produced immediate results crossreferencing the spitting image customer names with the dates that the pied piper was known to have been in specific cities produced billing records that suggested the kidnappers had counterfeited at least six credit cards lamoia was sorting through the information when his pager buzzed interrupting his work tempted to ignore it he obediently angled it to the light and read the overly long string of numbers on the display immediately guessing these numbers would lead him to a hotel room same as always sheila hill wanted to talk she had wisely reconsidered her decision that or she wanted to lay down ground rules for their boise bed jumping he cringed a combination of resentment anger and hope overcame him perhaps she wanted to apologize perhaps she knew in advance he had no intention of sharing showers with her in boise the new orleans redeye was only hours away his own flight to boise was much sooner one phone call and lamoia had the name of the hotel a days inn south on i its close proximity to the airport annoyed himshe still expected him to board that plane to boise he passed the credit card information along to boldt went home and quickly packed a bag his anger continually resurfacing like a fire assumed out he left an extra dish of dry food for his cat granite and slipped a note under his neighbors door that said hed be gone for a few days he stopped at an atm and withdrew two hundred dollars cash which he would then expense over the next few days on the drive south he promised himself that he would not under any conditions have sex with her he found himself passing the days inn registration desk and heading to the elevators he found himself on the second floor walking the long corridor in search of the number he found himself practicing his first few lines so that she could not would not steer him off course no matter what her intentions and appetites he knocked sharply on the door and braced himself for whatever she threw at him the door came open to empty space and he knew immediately she was hiding behind the door and he feared what she had in mind feeling like a trained german shepherd he stepped into the room prepared to counter whatever awaited him he walked straight ahead intentionally not looking back not playing to her game if her clothes were laid out on a chair or on the bed then he knew what to expect reckless abandon he couldnt wait to deny her that the tv was going loudly sheila hill was a screamer lamoia knew at that moment that she intended to try to make up to him knew what she had in mindsomething adventuresome something daring perhaps even dangerous he cautioned himself against succumbing there was a big rat of a man in a padded chair pulled up to a fauxgrain breakfast table and lamoias first thought was that she had fantasies about a trio but for him the gender was all wrong the rat was hairy and in his middle thirties on the table in front of him a cheap briefcase waited lamoia had never seen the man before but sight of him set off a string of mental alarms this was no sex partner of sheila hills not only was someone in the wrong place at the wrong time but the rat was the exact kind of man one saw in a lineup he was a man made for numbers across the chest a squeaky male voice behind lamoia wheezed hands stay visible nothing fast you move slow or you go lamoia turned his head ever so slowly and took in a smaller man dressed in blue jeans and a black leather jacket he had asian blood in him and maybe some speed he hadnt seen the sun in a long time he held a glock in his left hand as casually and comfortably as some people held cigarettes im a cop lamoia announced not a single muscle tensing he found his center he found his calm guys a fucking genius ratman said in an east coast baritone you can count if you want or you can take my word for it the moneys all there the little one said more irritated than only a moment earlier were not about to short a cop the rat opened the briefcase inside were several dozen vials of what looked like crack cocaine and two stacks of cash the top bills of each were hundreds if the rest matched those it amounted to some serious change a neon light lit up in lamoias mind he looked at the little man with the gun curiously we got a small problem here he said at that moment the hotel room door swung open blindingly fast police a voice thundered a pair of black blurs occupied a space by the door and suddenly the little guy and lamoia were both pinned against the wall faces pressed to the cheap wallpaper arms wrenched up behind so painfully that lamoia couldnt get his voice out he hadnt so much as twitched when he saw the ert coming in he knew the drill at first he couldnt believe his good luck that his own people had somehow come to his rescue and so fast but with his face kissing the cheap wallpaper and his shoulder about to dislocate he reassessed he heard a commotion behind him which turned out to be the ratman going down onto the floor im a cop lamoia finally gasped his cheekbone welded with the wall his ribs flattened by the pressure on his back you were a cop the ert man hissed into his ear lamoia knew the voice he searched for a name to go along with it lowering his voice even further the ert man added youre lucky you got witnesses floorshow or id do you myself right here lamoia had never experienced such feelings of disgrace humiliation and frustration as he did over the next few hours his badge and gun were taken from him he was escorted in handcuffs to a police van amid a flurry of activity and jeering from his peers and driven downtown the sting had involved a minimum of eight cops possibly twice thatall of which added up to something big he knew the players narcotics drugs as they were called within the ranks they traveled in a clique within the department the same way homicide did he had been to seahawks games with a couple of them decent guys who took their jobs a little too seriously drugs was rough duty and it made the players that way too he professed his innocence demanded representation and otherwise kept his mouth shut he was booked printed and humiliated by a full body search lamoias internal representative rescued him from an interrogation no one seemed clear on the exact crime for which he was being accused it involved the briefcase and crack cocaine sheila hill had led him by his dick into a heap of trouble for what he wondered revenge why get him arrested and suspended only a half hour before sending him to siberia had she found out about boldts gang of five and the work being done behind her back was this retribution or was it repayment for leaving her handcuffed and naked lamoia left public safety without his badge or gunsuspended without pay pending review it wont be review his representative warned they intend to prosecute boldt showed up as he was being released and offered a ride lamoia didnt know their destination until under way daphnes houseboat was a twentyminute drive in good traffic there was never good traffic lamoia said let me tell you somethingyou never want to be on the receiving end of our business never boldt said what happened lamoias hesitation caused boldt to say the truth will work until you can think of something else ive been snaking the captain boldt released a pentup sigh i know i know okay stupid john very stupid lamoia chewed at his mustache out of nervous habit its usually lunch with us but this timetodayit was afternoon next thing i know im in cuffs what the hell drugs made a good bust last night this morning im told theres an unidentified cop who plans to swap out evidence streetgrade crack for whats currently in the evidence room whats in there lamoia asked bad formula freelance lab just like mcnees six deaths in the last three weeks prosecutor was going for the death penalty and she would have gotten it the switch knocks it down to dealing its a first offense a nonevent lab test will come back clean no aggravated assault no prosecutable deaths i walked into that oh shit the bad cop is kevin mccalister boldt informed him the car bounced through construction we know this lamoia asked some of us do boldt answered itll sort itself out faster if you explain why you were there in the first place it doesnt look so good you know i cant do that not now shell deny it of course besides if i give up the captain flemming will take over the task force you know thats true and where does that leave sarah hale was overheard saying flemming could win control of the task force i guess we now know how whered you get that daphne via kalidja lamoia said something else sarge i think my desk was broken into boldt sidestepped the comment so you ride it out he told him a trip to new orleans will keep your mind off it lamoia glanced over at boldt boldt explained daphne got an emergency call from kalidja who is herself in boise with flemming dunkin hale is awol flemming is furious new orleans has to be boldt agreed the tattoos he reminded he turned off fairmont and pulled to a stop where daphne stood at the end of the dock by a box of mailboxes a moment later they were headed south on i toward the airport lamoia told his story to daphne who offered no sympathy from the backseat daphne suggested to boldt you arent taking three of us to new orleans based on an fbi agents curiosity no boldt confirmed lamoia said to boldt you worked the credit cards he then told daphne six of the spitting image customers have contested charges on their cards in and around the dates of the earlier abductions boldt explained the rental car abandoned in boise was paid for using a credit card belonging to lena robertson a spitting image customer the rental agreement called for a dropoff in san francisco with the car turning up in boise its fairly obvious san francisco was never in the picture she or her accomplice is smart enough to book the car for one destination and then drive it and deliver it to another the rental company accepts the car and simply charges more by using the rental car to get clear of the kidnap cityin this case seattlethey avoid the law enforcement watching the airports this morning boldt continued less than half an hour after the boise pileup another spitting image customers card was used to book an avis rental from boise to reno she knew we would quickly have the lena robertson id the name on this second card is julie dechamps the same carddechampswas then used to book a plane flight from salt lake city to cancun daphne complained cancun doesnt fit the profile they are not taking these kids into mexico they know the fbi is involved immigration officers are alerted theyre not going to risk that boldt nodded agreement and said the flight makes one stop he caught daphnes eyes in the rearview mirror acknowledging her in new orleans lamoia guessed she rented the car in boise with no intention of heading to reno shes headed for salt lake for that flight for new orleans boldt confirmed that flight will be short passengers on the leg to cancun daphne said shes going down there to sell trudy kittridge into adoption she thinks she is boldt corrected driving well above the speed limit in the hov lane his dashboard flasher pulsing blue against the glass he pushed the chevy a little harder lamoia said we cant stop her without putting sarah at risk daphne suggested maybe we dont stop her you cant beat em join em an uncomfortable silencethe silence of frustrationfilled the car the thing about blackened catfish lamoia told them breaking that silence you either love it or you dont but if you dont you got no business being in the big easy chapter boldt failed to see the romance of the french quarter for years he had heard stories about the mix of french and black cultures of voodoo umbrella drinks of creole bar girls with bodies like centerfolds of blues and jazz drifting onto cobblestone streets at three in the morning and fresh oysters the size of golf balls instead he saw only a giant tourist attraction a disneyland for alcoholics and unfaithful husbands masquerading as conventioneering businessmen the locals provided color in street music juggling and costuming but to boldt it felt contrived the quarter had been great onceit reeked of historybut the chamber of commerce and tourist board had cleaned it up for the mcdonalds crowd in a way that left it too slick too polished too kodak too little of the soul that had once fueled its engines the tattoo shop was called samanthas body art its wooden sign hanging out front depicted a largebreasted woman vampire clad in black lingerie and straddling a harley holding a delicate paintbrush trained onto the naked form of a pale female ghost located outside the quarter in an area of hairdressers tarot card readers and personal injury attorneys the shop made the most of neon the smell of pot and incense tainted the air samantha did not exist in a city of pretense the tough behind the needle went by the name maurice he wore a silver stud in his left ear had biceps the color and density of ebony and a shaved head that looked like an eight ball he wore a tshirt that showed two women fornicating in the palm of an outstretched hand no explanation the place was for bikers and sailors its walls bore hundreds of designs it took boldt a minute to locate the eagle wedged as it was between the space shuttle and the butt end of a pig but when he finally did identify it the likeness to tommy thompsons rendition was unmistakable help you maurice asked a voice dipped in roofing tar saturated by nonfilters im interested in this design boldt said pointing out the eagle you heat whos asking and why you aint drunk enough and you aint young enough to be wanting something like that as for what you is you got the look you know i can spot that look apparently you can boldt agreed but you missed with me im private heat not from around here you aint not from around here no boldt pulled a fifty dollar bill from his pocket that he had waiting a client of mine is interested in a man whos wearing one of these birds on his forearm it aint a bird its an eagle do a lot of them do you boldt toyed with the fifty a man who wasnt certain if he would spend it or keep it not many i tell my client i paid fifty for information and i get reimbursed whether i paid it out or not he slipped it into his pocket and then pulled it back out thats a good gig the guy liked the sight of the fifty the public wasnt exactly banging down his doors id be pleased if you remembered a name or a face bet you would a date a time of year anything like that and the fiftys yours the mans fingers reminded boldt of chocolate candy rolls thumbs like cigar butts one of those fingers pointed out a half dozen black vinyl photo albums chained to the wall and sitting atop a small counter the counter was pockmarked with an army of cigarette burns lined up like a regiment the man explained they sell better in person look better than hanging on the wall besides guys get off looking at all the tits and assyou wouldnt believe some of the shit girls want and where they put it and we take pictures of all of it man cause the way it works outyou think nobody never done something like that but shit then you see it there in the book and it dont look half bad and you think maybe you want one too least thats the way it works out anything you can think of it been done and i personally have laid some art down on inner thighs ass pussy tits cocksyou name it i seen it all done it all these are photo albums damn straight boldt opened one of the books for shock value he supposed female genitalia and breasts occupied the first page he blushed at what he saw exposed there and what the owner of the tattoo had chosen to do to her body one womans shaved crotch had been painted into a face with an obvious mouth it stood out from the snake winding up to an enlarged nipple the daisy around the navel the hummingbirds in cleavage and the inner thigh with cupids arrow aiming at labia these are disgusting he said you dont mind me saying so course i mind its art man youre looking all wrong that there is quality work fine pitch good solid color a person wants to xpress hisself thats a good thing its a free fucking country boldt leafed through the plastic pages of polaroids they let you take pictures like this he gasped page upon page of buttocks and breasts penises ankles necks eyelids fingers grays anatomy courtesy of the cartoon network its not like you know who they are no its not boldt thought wondering why he would bother to look on driven by a voyeuristic curiosity he did just that landing on a page of motorcycles and nudes on forearms male chests and biceps the detail and color were in fact extraordinary for flesh art its good stuff he said conversationally a couple my pieces been in a gallery down in the quarter the man bragged a swan i done using a guys dick and another of van goghs irises right up the bikini line you know this girl coulda walked the beach and you wouldnta even known she was bare ass impressive boldt muttered cynically you have repeats in here he said same artwork different body location the images look different depending where you put them we try to show it all you have eagles in here third or fourth book i think one of ems nothing but animals frogs lizards snakes i do a lot of reptiles for whatever reason and you do all of this work i didnt do all of it no course not but i could sure what my eye sees my hands can paint that includes the women some guys get their girls to pose im not shitting you imagination plays into it said the artiste he had a wide boyish smile not at all what boldt might have expected from such a brute boldt worked through the lions pussy cats tigers an aardvark pandas teddy bears and landed on a series of bald eagles a profile of just the beak and head an eagle in flight a number of eagles with various messages or items clutched in the talons an eagle with its wings wrapped around its body like a cape boldt pointed it out my own design maybe half what you see is original design the rest i rip off from magazines film or whatever or i do custom from a photo or something i charge extra for the custom work any others boldt asked flipping the page of polaroids his eye immediately answering his own question as it landed on an eagle drawn onto a knotty biceps you did this i told you its original its mine theres one missing boldt stated i dont think so its missing maurice boldt encouraged making a point of the fifty it showed an eagle on a forearm not a biceps i dont think so someone else was here ahead of me boldt suggested to the man boldt handed him the fifty it had come out of his and lizs joint account using the atm card the account was seventeen hundred dollars in the red thanks to the hospital more now with the airfare guy looks like a surfer but has an attitude he tell you who he was maurice considered the money like i gotta ask a suit like that he took a photo with him boldt stated he paid you how much boldt asked maurice pocketed boldts cash not enough fucking prick fed threatened to bust you the half of it the man said boldt produced another fifty maurice said i gave him the picture and i kept my door open for business he told you how to reach him in case your memory came back boldt knew the routine he pulled a third fifty out of his pocket he might have mentioned the hyatt the fifty disappeared into the jeans anything you left out anything you forgot to tell him boldts time at the intelligence desk had not been for naught the big stump of an index finger pointed out several other photos on the page he flipped forward a page then back two and pointed out another row of photos you see that gray wall the background you know what that cement wall means many of the photos were shot against the same gray background tell me maurice what is the significance of that wall couple times of year they bring one or another of us inside ends up like a fucking arts and crafts fair know what i mean boldt felt his system charge with adrenaline were talking about the penitentiary maurice the guy with the eagle on the forearmhe was doing time you got it when maurice slipped out a photo and flipped it over nineteen ninetyfive the suit does he know this he didnt ask maurice said his face spreading into a smile chapter jesus sugar what da hell dey got going up in seattle we aint got down here you ever consider yourself a transfer how bout looking down our way nopds detectives division was a mismatch of gray metal government furniture paddle fans and noisy windowmounted air conditioners half the building had been remodeled but they were working from the top downfrom the chief to the garageand the detectives division was low in the building and low on the list daphne bristled at the mans sexist attitude but played to him rather than make trouble priorities detective broole was white thirtyfive modestly good looking with acne scars and sleepy brown eyes he wore his hair like a las vegas showman and talked with a dixie drawl that she had to mentally replay to understand he was in your medium lockup in hes white with an eagle tattoo on his left forearm six foot maybe sixone in for fraud or bunco a confidence artist broole said planting his swagger down in front of an outdated computer terminal well hell if that dont describe half the population sugar he hooked another chair with his toe and pulled it close to him on its casters he lit up a nonfilter and blew the smoke away from her shitty habit he said but somebodys got to die young he motioned for her to sit in the chair but she remained standing maybe kiddie pornography stalking she couldnt mention the abduction of children without risking connecting herself to the pied piper he may work with a female accomplice she said wed all like one of those he conceded turning his sweaty face toward her maybe ran a telephone scam using nineoneone she suggested that dialback scam which one is that she asked hanging on his every word that one didnt reach seattle he asked fella puts himself up as a cop was an embezzlement scam involving the elderly to insure he really is a cop he tells the mark to hang up and quickly call him back at the station using the nineoneone line never mind that aint possible the mark hangs up the line stays openit wont go to dial tone on the receiving end did you know that so the confidence man plays a recording of a dial tone into the phone mark picks up the phone hears the dial tone dials nineoneone trickster turns off the recording of the dial tone some of em use another voice some an accomplice but the line is answered something like emergency services he said feigning a womans voice the mark asks to speak to the cop the con man comes on the line and the mark is absolutely convinced from that moment on that shes talking to a cop and thats all it takes a personll do just about anything for a man carrying a badge he looked her body over a little too closely a woman carrying a badge too i imagine do we know who went down for that one sugar we got so many damn scams crawling out of the swamp we dont hardly keep track holding down a job is the most common one we see you know somebodys crooked if they got a ninetofive job including cops he smiled he enjoyed his own company last name first name you got anything more than nineoneone for me he looked at her chest again and then lowered his eyes to her waist anything at all ill take everyone serving time in for fraud and bunco thats a good place to start a better place to start is dinner at commanders palace then maybe a ride up the river on a jazz barge and a nice long lazy look at the stars from around the pool at a little bungalow i know just outside the parish in too close to the city the sky is all lit up and glowing and you dont see no stars at all and let me tell you there aint nothing as pleasing to the eye as the louisiana night sky having properly loaded his own statement he added excepting that is maybe you sugar seattle gotta be damn proud have you carrying their shield alphabetized fraud and bunco if theres a way to isolate it to telephone scams there isnt he fired back the smoke peeling up his face and over his eyes this system is the model t of networks new system going online in another year or two theyre calling it an intranet now aint that clever were calling it late he confirmed that he was also the single greatest fan of his own jokes give me overnight you really ought to think about that dinner i can call you she asked anytime sugar though id prefer to call you he faked a smile for her his teeth belonged to a heavy smoker she wasnt giving this guy any way to find her i have a feeling we work together on this and it might speed things up he said two heads are better than one she suggested what about i drop by later and we see what if any progress youve made i just love incentive programs chapter consumed by an unrelenting twisting knot of worry boldt understood the criminal mindset as never before lies started small and out of sheer necessity they then mushroomed into gross untruths driven by selfishness and greed boldts greed was centered around his daughter the hunger a criminal felt for money or control boldt felt for an intact family he held her in his arms and made up stories for her he sat her on his lap and played jazz to her he missed her in a way he had never missed another daphne made contact with the most wellknown most active home for children believing them experts on every aspect of adoption legal and otherwise for boldt this visit lit the candle at both ends pursuing the pied piper from the evidence surrounding the kidnappings and from the result of the kidnappingsadoption sarah and trudy kittridge and ten other children remained in the candles middle flames licking toward them the louis charlemagne home for boys an imposing stone edifice set back from the road by a semicircular gravel driveway dominated the city block it looked more like a country club than a halfway house the towering door occupied a space between two tall corinthian columns a cheap electronic doorbell had been fitted alongsidea wart on an otherwise pretty face a black man with skin that shone with sweat answered the doorbell he had thick forearms a large head and a jutting brow that partially hid pinprick dark eyes he ushered boldt and daphne into a cavernous stone foyer that carried the sour smell of a dull skil saw burning its way through a twobyfour a cloud of gray smoke hung heavy in the air dr montevette daphne said right down here the man said abandoning his small construction project he expecting ya yes we have an appointment whoa cardinal he shouted to a spotted puppy that appeared out of nowhere and peed onto the floor as the handyman snagged him whatcho doing loose he called out for evelyn but received no answer just down on your left he advised his guests raising his voice i best handle the cardinal and his little mistake a professorial man wearing a checked shirt brown corduroy pants and brown bucks greeted them from a distance drawn by the handymans voice bernard montevette he introduced himself they shook hands all around montevette was a short man with kind eyes half the hair he wanted and a delicious new orleans slur to his words a chandelier fan paddled the air languidly gently cooling the rich woodpaneled walls the fading green carpet and the few antiques the slow lazy propeller strobed soft shadows down onto the rooms walnut table that sat away from montevettes enormous partners desk dont get outoftown police as a rule cant think of the last time and ive been involved with charlemagnewell i am in fact only the homes fourth director in its onehundredandseventeenyear history the first and only director to have been a former resident here one of the boys daphne inquired exactly and the charlemagne has the proud distinction of being the only boys home in the country not to accept public funds we operate privately from an endowment established just after the second world war the way he regarded them daphne had the uneasy feeling he was considering them as a couple intent on adopting a son this was the first time the idea came to her of how to save trudy kittridge it struck her all at oncea whole and complete planas only the best ideas hit her she wanted to steal boldt away immediately and run it by him were involved in an active investigation dr montevette boldt said that requires some discretion yes so ms matthews informed me earlier he met eyes with each of them his were an icy gray blue i am at your service sir illegal adoption daphne reminded yes so you said daphne explained how one might go about it here in new orleans successfully that is the way the law works or doesnt boldt added private adoption montevette supplied nodding i believe i have someone on my staff who might be able to help us if you dont mind not at all daphne answered he summoned a miss lucy over the phone announcing that she would join them shortly he added the fact of the matter is that private adoption is something we all must contend withthat is adoptions not arranged through a state organization private adoption is less regulated than statearranged although it still requires court appearances and proper paperwork it is far more susceptible to human greed and abuse what i think you will find here in new orleansnaarlansand i say this only because ive heard the stories myself is that what you might call the lower end of the economic strata is far more familiar with this kind of practice than others paperwork daphne asked more than just paperwork montevette explained in the surrender of a child the biological mother is required to make a court appearance in front of a sitting judge she is advised by the judge that she is surrendering the child in perpetuity and in a court of law and that she is also surrendering her right to any legal recourse in the future this is a fairly recent law and one that has proved to simplify and qualify the processa great improvement i might add at the time of adoption a birth certificate is required along with the document attesting to this court appearance and the surrender of the child if the mothers medical costs are to be reimbursed a copy of the medical bills are submitted ah miss lucy come in please wont you join us montevette jumped to his feet and pulled back a chair for the young black woman miss lucy penneford wore a soft yellow dress and too much violet eye shadow her skin wrinkled when she smiled widely pleased to meet you she said to them montevette caught her up to date how an illegal adoption might be carried out and i was recalling that shakeup we had down to city hall last year and how you oh yes i think i can explain that she said she had an even thicker accent than montevette her voice played musically in the room the fan worked dark shadows across her face the air smelled faintly of lavender she had brought it with her she said it had evidently been going on for years they worked down to the city office what is that called the bureau of vital statistics montevette supplied daphne had the feeling montevette knew more of the story more of the answers than he was willing to admit she wondered why miss lucy continued and you know all those girls work for minimum wage down there and its just plain tough on minimum wage some man comes along and offers you a hundred dollars to process a birth certificate and theres not a lot of thought that needs to be done on the subject which is just what was happening montevette contributed been going on for years come to find out decades maybe you need a birth certificate for a child you simply come up with the hundred dollars no adoption at all daphne said amazed at the simplicity of the scam no need replied montevette you obtain a fraudulent birth certificate for the child in your name and he or she is legally a member of your family whos to question it it allows the mother to be paid for more than just hospital costs miss lucy explained boldt said it creates a viable black market montevette agreed but it was closed down i knew some of them girls miss lucy told them some of them is still doing time for that and believe you me that was the last of it dont even ask miss matthews because i can see youre about to arent you that was the last of it honestly they cracked down hard on those girls but there are other ways boldt said fishing for a back door through which he might locate the pied piper or his accomplice oh there are miss lucy said cheerily another one ive heard about is this missing father thing she explained to blank looks a single mother has a child and does not list a father on the birth certificate happens all the time either she wants no part of the man that put her in that condition or she dont know who done it to her anyway maybe shes a drug addict or in some other way where she dont exactly want the child no more the way they do it she sells a mana complete strangerthe chance to put his name onto the birth certificate as the lawful father now this is the legal birth certificate were talking about this stranger is now the legal father of that child and has custody rights to that child custody rights that she is willing to surrender for a price its a common means of adoption in the minority communities believe me middleclass cajun or blacks buy a blood right to a child cheap and easy but not only with blacks daphne said no youre right white trash too maybe some suburban teenage kids thing is its legal of course she smiled as long as you aint found out by no dna test do the attorneys need special training licenses anything like that boldt asked montevette answered as far as i know in louisiana there are court fees to be paid paperwork that must be filed its a specialty field but by choice not requirement and if an attorney desired to bypass certain elements in the process boldt asked i see what youre driving at sure do but he couldnt arrange a legal adoption without a judge on his side because of the requirement of a court appearance flat out could not do it but with a judge in his pocket daphne asked montevette and miss lucy exchanged looks miss lucy said miss matthews louisiana aint exactly like other places an expression like thatits offensive montevette explained let me tell you how we operate in new orleans ms matthews i have a little family farm not far from here not even an hours drive i own a farm vehicle an old ford halfton use it on the farm to haul fallen limbs move fence that sort of thing run it into town on the odd day for groceries the law requires i get that truck inspected once a year everything on it must function correctly in order for me to obtain my permit to operate the vehicle it has been a long long time indeed since everything on that truck has functioned properly ms matthews now theres a man named george he continued whose job it is for the price of a twentydollar permit fee to inspect vehicles in our parish i have known george for many many years nearly as many as i have been driving that old ford i see him exactly once a year for an extra twenty dollars george issues me my permit always has always will and thats just the way its done around here guys like george like me were everywhere no one is hurting nobody it is just the way businessbidnessis done which might include business between attorneys and judges boldt suggested which on some level definitely includes attorneys and judges on some level most definitely and police no doubt and doctors and window washers and tree trimmers part of the culture you might say i am not condoning such behavior but it is as inescapable as are so many elements of our fine culture southern culture miss lucy said if you are willing to pay for it if you are willing to wait long enough to find the right person to help you there is little you cannot do which is not to say its a criminal place im not implying that it is not we have crime and we have cops and we have courts same as any other city but as a people we emphasize relationships over the letter of the law montevette said black or white or cajun doesnt matter we make relationships the man who mows your lawn eats his breakfast alongside your children relationships he repeated an attorney could buy off a judge boldt said forge documents of a mother surrendering a child and the rest would all be perfectly legal even the adopting parents might never know the adoption was improper montevette supplied it would not be illegal you see not per se not with the proper paperwork in place only improper improper daphne echoed getting a take on the mans attitude and cringing internally mind you he said appealing to their curiosity there would be a paper trail to follow he glanced at miss lucy if one was ambitious enough to pursue it boldt understood the man was making an offer the names of the attorney and the judge would appear on the paperwork montevette said the paperwork is filed in the parish where the judge sits in a large parish it might seem a little coincidental for the same judge and attorney to process too many adoptions but not in a small parish miss lucy informed the two visitors there may be only one judge in the entire parish certainly possible montevette agreed the shadow of the fan pulsed across his face like a curtain being pulled back a thought had come to him he said no miss lucy i believe we are wrong the originals would remain with the parish but in the case of a private adoption copies would be filed either here in new orleans or in lafayette depending on the parish of record he met eyes with boldt and smiled coyly he glanced at miss lucy and said to daphne and boldt it would be our pleasure to help you in this endeavor i think you may find louisiana a bit of a foreign country miss lucy said perhaps we can translate for you montevette his eyes charged with excitement slapped the table its that paperwork we want to follow chapter smiling johns pleasure and social club a corner establishment in an ethnically mixed neighborhood of cajun caribbean and afroamerican caught between the opulence of the garden district and the commerce of downtown smelled of a rude combination of perfume stale beer and vanilla air freshener the soles of lamoias ostrich boots stuck to the wooden plank flooring obnoxiously loud cajun accordion music roared from distorted ceiling speakers as six womengirls reallyplayed pinball he sidled up to a set of recently waxed legs that disappeared into a tiny piece of red leather the look she offered lamoia was sad and distanta junkie he passed the second machine received its hip bumps from a creole girl still in her teens who filled out the denim overall shorts and white camisole so that any man would want to take up farming hey lamoia said not now sweetie i got two thousand to go for the bonus got all the time in the world he lied alarms sounded announcing she had crossed into bonus territory and sending her into a blinding frenzy of bumps and flipper thrusts she kept the ball alive for three full minutes having cleared the next bonus as well he had never thought of pinball as sexy the ball died on a bad left flipper you could be here all day he said unless i had a better offer her voice gave away her age perhaps still a minor although her equipment suggested otherwise theres a guy works here name of jimmy so am i going to play this next ball or not before he could explain the twenty dollars he proffered onto the machines glass surface she advised him that wont even buy you a hummer sweetie she drew back the springed metal ram preparing to launch another ball but lamoia grabbed her hand stopping her need a little face to face with jimbo sweetie the twentys just to keep the meter running the twenty disappeared into the bib of the overalls there wasnt a lot of room left up there a location where i might find him would be nice she pointed to the ceiling he goes on in an hour his is the first room on this side she said eyeing lamoia actively she added another twenty you go home with a smile on your face he offered her a big toothy smile im smiling just thinking about it you got a car with a backseat pull it around back lemme know well talk he said no we wont she corrected she released the plunger and launched the steel ball into the flashing lights bells and buzzers lamoia found the stairs and climbed them to the second story from the far side of the first door oprah played loudly he thought she had given him the wrong roomone of smiling johns active employees he thought he knocked carefully yeah came a male smokers voice lamoia fished two twenties under the crack in the door probably a nights wage in a dump like this the twenties disappeared lamoia stood there for a full minute expecting an inquiry or the door to open hey lamoia spoke to the door oprah went louder lamoia knocked for a second time he teased a hundred under the door but brought it back to his side he teased it through again the information he sought could not be valuednothing less than the pied pipers identity i think you got the wrong room jimmy heat was once not anymore repo now dont want you my thing is with an individual from your last known address i dont think so the forty came back through the door the guy wears the same eagle as you do only on his forearm yours is on your right biceps that bird is the only connection to you im not carrying any trouble for you the artwork was done at your last address lamoia fished the hundred half through take it it sat there and he suddenly saw it not as currency but as sarah caught in a deadly tug of war the door came open a crack jimmy wore a goatee and glasses in dimestore frames his dark hair was pulled into a ponytail he looked dumb like so many of them did three of you got the same tattoo i checked with the prison of the three they remembered you you stayed a little longer than was on the original invitation you gotta be heat was once he repeated the guythe one with the eagle on the forearmis laying bad plastic from san diego to seattle hes late on payments for a taurus im representing the car dealer never knew him a name would help that tattoo was seen laying down the plastic but we got nothing but aliases medium security you had to run into him the man glanced down at the hundred on the floor plus the forty lamoia said name of a friend anything i can use never knew him not personally not so as i knew a name or nothing listen if youre milking me im light as it is its not that i didnt know him you listening disgusted he said he was smooth thats all i know about him talk his way into anything out of anything was a stunt man con artist right a stunt man in for some kind of something sucked up to the screws and the chief got his way butts weed booze didnt want to know him you know fuck the little kiss ass lamoia ate up every detail but he got the same tattoo as you he reminded hoping to spur some rivalry inmates were little more than boys in this regard got mine first goddamn it everyone admiring it like hisself included he eased the door open wider more relaxed oprah was on a small color set that favored yellow jimmy saw lamoia checking out the tv and he said got hooked on that bitch in the joint cant give her up know what you mean you watch lamoia shrugged youre saying all the sucking up won him special treatment thats why you didnt hang with him he got privileges the man complained jungle visits we called them conjugal visits only the butt suckersthe brownnoserspulled off that kinda shit ill tell you what doing time and getting cheese a couple times a month gimme a fucking break lamoia knew it went against the rules meaning the visits had been arranged by the guards as a form of payment hes married two three times a month hes sucking and banging the bitch who put them both in the joint the first place way i heard it she was also incarcerated a stunt team they were she gets driven over here from the slammer in lamont drops the lace and spreads em they do the dippitydo and shes back in the van for lamont conjugal visits between two inmates was unheard of in washington state lamont its the big house for chicks the wife is doing hard time lamoia sensed his chance to identify the two the conjugal visits were certainly not official which meant they would not carry any kind of paperwork they reeked instead of payoffs orknowing this teams recorda con job a few screws and a transport were involved at a minimum he have money this guy how you think he rubs up against the screws so good course he had money somewhere and it must have been quite a few yards but i heard that about himno one ran a stunt like this guy he was in for ripping off old hags i think something like that he glanced back at the tv where oprah paced in front of the stage i dont know shit about him stayed clear of that shit lamoia handed him the remaining forty to add to the hundred on the floor you sure you dont remember a name no way looks average your height you gonna run stunts on people you gotta look average know what i mean they gotta trust you not me lamoia said i dont trust him an inch chapter boldt and daphnes admission to the bureau of vital statistics did not come from montevette the director of the boys home nor did it come through the front door miss lucy made the contactat the back doorand in a matter of an hour instead of what might have taken days or even weeks through proper channels they had no warrant they were well out of their jurisdictional authority they possessed only boldts compelling urgency in his eyes and daphnes internal calm with both barrels loaded no one could refuse them least of all walter a black man in his early fifties who wore polyester trousers and a starched houndstooth shirt walter whose hair was graying at the temples walked like a man sacrificed at fullback on an overly competitive high school team his nose had been flattened several times and left to wilt on his face like the curled thumb of an old leather glove he wore half glasses that magnified a string of dark moles under his left eye boldt and daphne were led down a long narrow aisle between gunmetal gray shelves that stretched fourteen feet into the air toward barebulb funnel lights and the exposed steel trusses that supported the buildings flat roof the volume of paperwork overwhelmed boldt for this was but one of dozens and dozens of such rows i hope this isnt all adoptions he said this here is birth certificates walter replied his strained voice absorbed like the spoken word in a snowcovered forest to your left death and marriagessame thing far as im concerned that area toward that far wall is divorces we got maybe twelve fifteen stacks filled to the top with em he turned right left and right again a maze of paperwork marked only by tiny white labels on the shelves and typed stickers on the boxes the place seemed artificial to boldt created simply to overwhelm him the prospect of dust and gum and paper cuts loomed his impatience mounted perhaps he could leave daphne here to sort through it but no he answered himself two sets of eyes were critical to such an undertaking another right left and rightthey were working their way to this the top floors far corner where a massive chainlink fence isolated the small reception area with its wood bench wooden counter and black pens on chains a woman named amy glanced once when she heard walters approach and a second time as a double take when she saw him in company i need ole blue a minute amy walter said indicating the computer a computer boldt felt a rush of hope youre computerized im not walter replied but these stacks are all indexed on ole blue and anything filed after nineteen hundred and eightyeight is in his memory instead of on the shelves thank the lord he said although it did cost four jobs up here on the seventh he smiled warmly at daphne seniority do have its privileges amy came to walters rescue several times over the course of the next ninety minutes he had trouble keeping the search targeted to all parishes the system defaulting to citywide searches the result was that adoption records were sorted parish by parish neither of them could seem to convince the machine to do a districtwide search the process was painstakingly slow daphne requested printoutsthe number of parishes stunned boldt realizing he had the search dates wrong daphne explained patiently to walter were particularly interested in adoptions registered from sometime in the last five to six months right up to the present nineteen hundred and eightyeight to nineteen hundred and ninetytwo i wouldnt been able to help you hep you ninetytwo on they gone directly to the screen afore that we still done all the paperwork but they filed it on computer and archived it on fiche now its straight to the computer and they run two of emtwo different locationsone watching the other backing it up you know only paperwork is the signatures and the court documents they cant seem to figure this thing out completely always some kind of paperwork involved boldts patience on the other hand had run out he kept his mouth shut and tried to stay out of things trudy kittridge was going to be sold into adoption within a day or twoboldt felt convinced of this with each search daphne requested another printout and then studied the results while walter again isolated a particular parish and conducted the search boldt had the feeling that amy might have accomplished this all much faster but walter and miss lucy shared an aunt or grandparentsome blood relativeand walter was their man lou daphne whispered gaining his attention he joined her at a metal desk taking a rolling chair that squeaked when he leaned forward she contained her excitement using only her index finger to direct him so as not to be overheard no telling who else walter might know or be related to her nails held a clear finish and were cut short she had filed them recently boldts eye followed the line she indicated the filing was for january the judge of record was judge terence adams the attorney one vincent chevalier whose mailing address placed him in the city the very next adoption recorded three weeks later was again the work of judge adams and vincent chevalier her finger danced down the page she glanced up and looked at him with wet excited eyes boldt withdrew his notebook and flipped pages hurriedly the dates fit into the pied pipers schedule remarkably wellthe adoptions coming four to eight working days after each of the abductions he counted back and realized that if these entries indeed belonged to the pied piper as he now believed then he still had between two and six days in which to find kittridge the adoption process took slightly longer to arrange than he had foreseen it was the first ray of hope he had felt the printout for tanipahoa parish showed eleven adoptions performed over the most recent sixmonth period all with the same pair adams and chevalier all but two of the children had been placed with couples living out of state prior to november there had been no adoptions in the parish for five months weve got them boldt whispered disbelief permeating his words daphne folded the printout carefully aligning the corners and using her nail to make the fold she said now lets hope were not too late chapter central airconditioning provided the new orleans downtown public library with a large population of homeless some of whom were effective at passing themselves off as readers others who abandoned the ruse altogether sitting at tables while fighting off the exhaustion of walking the streets at night technically the library could not ask them to leave unless they fell asleep eyelids fluttered an occasional page of a newspaper turned in keeping with the act the homeless seemed to collect in the periodicals section perhaps because of its abundance of chairs and tables perhaps because of the sports section boldt and daphne split up most of the news they sought they believed too recent to have reached microfiche boldt refused daphnes suggestion to approach nopds detective broole about the attorney chevaliers dealings this based on the assumption that a cops curiosity could put the word out on the street which in turn could jeopardize their efforts lamoia who wanted to work the husband and wife conviction also wanted to consult broole cops know more than newspapers he repeated one too many times bringing boldts wrath down upon him assigned surveillance of the attorney chevalier lamoia was halfway across town he intended not only to sit on the man but to install a callerid box on chevaliers phone lines in order to monitor the attorneys incoming calls legality was no longer an issue they had no way to trace chevaliers outgoing calls without the involvement of broole a warrant would have to be justified lamoia had to justify that warrant as well as keep an eye out for hale boldt denied both suggestions electing instead to gather intelligence the more fact the more hard information they brought broole the better boldt searched newspaper indexes for vincent chevalier daphne took judge adams of tanipahoa parish thankfully the timespicayune ran a good crime beat the timespicayune was indexed monthly available on the fifteenth of every month the most recent index was for articles published in february boldt searched the months of january and february and found no reference on any chevalier including vincent he then waited his turn to access a reference computer terminal that at peak hours allowed each user only three consecutive searches and maintained a line a halfdozen deep boldt was not used to waiting in lines except for the office copier his shield generally moved him to the front of any line boldt restricted the search to the timespicayune database and then typed in the name vincentchevalier the computer considered the request boldt caught himself holding his breath a moment later seven listings scrolled down the screen including publication date partial headlines page and column numbers five of the seven articles had been published in the paper nearly five years earlier the first two listings had been page stories implying a relative importance to them the last two were barely twelve months out of date the partial headline on the opening hit read police disconnect scam the last article listed had a title that began appeals court shoots that first listing swimming in his head boldt signaled daphneand half those in the reference sectionwith a frantic wave of the hand he asked the person in line behind him how to print out a copy of his search results a few minutes later he and daphne took seats in adjacent microfiche viewing stations the appropriately boxed issues in hand a nineoneone scam he reminded urgently clumsily threading the cumbersome roll of film into the antiquated machine he threaded it upside down on his first effort reversed his second try yes i caught that daphne said calmly trying to contain him she threaded her machine correctly the first time and was reading text before boldt as in millie wiggins day care center boldt said still fumbling yes its them boldt emphasized it suggests a strong possibility doesnt it he glanced at her incredulously as he failed with the machine for the third time goddamn it he hollered too loudly his fingers refusing to cooperate here she leaned across him corrected his mistake and restored the machine boldt sped ahead to the article written five years earlier as daphne returned to her station it was page three he said prior to actually locating the article youve got to think that means it was pretty big news at the time shh daphne chided im on to something here but a moment later as boldt went silent she couldnt resist she slid her fiberglass chair up against boldts and looked on two hundred and eighty thousand she read it was run on the elderly boldt heard her but did not acknowledge he read slowly and intently he wanted every last detail committed to memory city beatpolice made two arrests on tuesday in the socalled scam that had been puzzling investigators for weeks and has cost area victims mostly the elderly nearly following a telecommunications sting involving coordinated technologies linking air touch cellular southwestern bell and sprint communications the confidence game which pitted the fictional caller as a law enforcement officer attempting to unravel a bank embezzlement scandal was finally put on hold arrested were roger crowley of new orleans and his wife lisa the pair who have operated under as many as twentytwo aliases are wanted on related charges in five other states including nevada arizona and florida if convicted the couple individually face up to fifteen years jail time and fines exceeding the crowleys attorney vincent chevalier said he would file for dismissal based on entrapment insisting his clients were victims themselvesof a law enforcement witchhuntchevalier insisted on his clients innocence and suggested to reporters that the case would never reach trial three subsequent articles proved chevalier wrong the case did go to trial a jury trial resulting in what to boldts eye was a ninthinning plea bargain down to intent to defraud that cut short the trial and lessened the sentences to seven years each restoration of the victims assets and fines of ten thousand dollars each translated it meant release in two to three years restoration at thirty cents on the dollar and two twentyfivehundreddollar fines it was the crowleys first conviction after eleven years and twentyseven separate arrests in five states there was nothing in the articles to connect the couple to any kidnapping child abduction child abuse or extortion daphne made the connection ten minutes later middle of last year the crowleys sued the state of louisiana for blocking an adoption they had planned boldt shot her a look of astonishment he said convicted felons arent allowed to adopt well aware of the federal law daphne continued the crowleys took possession of an infant girl born in arkansas they might have pulled it off except the biological mother was an unwed fourteenyearold a minor and her parents contested the adoption vincent chevalier both arranged the adoption and represented the crowleys in their lawsuit and their appeal lost both boldt guessed yes motive enough for this spree boldt suggested a couple denied parenthood she said worse than the wrath of a woman scorned confirm with broole that roger crowley has an eagle tattooed on his left forearm then convince him that crowleys at large we need a warrant to trapandtrace telephone calls inside chevaliers office from his cellular and from pay phones in and around the surrounding neighborhood whatever you do dont mention the pied piper investigation keeping up with boldts hurried strides daphne said is there some water you want me to walk on in the meantime just try i will what happens to them after the adoption is blocked he asked denied the adoption they decided to pursue other means of obtaining a child but not for themselves anymore for others forget about it he said the penny flutes they wanted the abductions connected theyre making a statement its the robin hood syndrome they see themselves as saviors in their minds their actions are perfectly justified they know what its like to be denied parenthood stop he said harshly i dont want to hear this you need to she protested these are the people who have your daughter chapter detective broole returned to his desk carrying a swagger reminiscent of lamoia and a thick manila folder that daphne assumed belonged to roger or lisa crowley the detectives division suffered under the noisy strain of wallmounted air conditioners unable to condition and the languid efforts of paddle fans that recycled the same stale air you really know how to pick em sugar broole slapped the file down in front of her and then lit up a cigarette within yards of the sign forbidding the activity his cliched coif was gelled into a ducktail weve had this loser in cuffs more times than his tailor howd you find him library ah yes that font of public knowledge he said sarcastically but it didnt say anything about tattoos she said reminding him of her earlier criteria yeah well this does have a look he said leaning over from behind and opening the folder in front of her using the effort to be physically close to her attached to the folders inside flap was a series of a half dozen mug shots below these were two other photographs both of tattoos an eagle on the mans left forearm a snake running down his leg to the right of his genitals that had been blacked out with marker her heart skipped a beatthey had a physical marking that could be offered as hard evidenceroger crowley was the pied piper crowleys various mug shots revealed a man skilled at cosmetics light hair dark hair short hair long acned skin baby face warts scars and wounds bright eyes dull eyes round eyes almond crowley was all of these people and yet none of them she realized the real man behind the crimes lay buried somewhere back on crowleys personal time line daphne matthews wanted a shot at that personthe one who remained hidden she wanted into his mind inside where others had not been as she sought an invention to convince broole to wiretap chavaliers phone lines broole revealed his own agenda is this the pied piper he asked still leaning over her his sour cigarette breath warm on her neck and before you hand me some discontinued merchandise and try to sell me on the life of its warranty i beg you to consider the truth carefully because maybe just maybe sugar i possess something of even greater value to you he placed his left hand onto her shoulder and his long fingers dangled down her chest as he sucked on the cigarette from his right a cold shiver pulsed through her he quizzed her now i dont want to speak it sugar not aloud that is but thunderstorms produce not only rain and lightning but another meteorological element wind tornadoes not aloud aloud is not allowed he said amusing himself he touched a finger to her lips she was suddenly very much afraid of him but no not wind not tornadoes he took his finger away it is a hybrid of snow and rain sugar this particular meteorological elementkind of rain and ice rolled into one it is also something you might associate with a particular federal agency involved in law enforcement it will benefit us both greatly if you do not speak his name aloud for that will alter my own position greatly and put me in a difficult position where i am forced to take sides and i dont believe it would be revealing any secrets to tell you i would much prefer to be on your side frozen rain she said repeating what he had said precisement hail she thought hale special agent im with you she said which is more than any man could ever ask he said maintaining the intimacy and stroking her collarbone let me repeat he said sparing no contact is this the one you all are calling the pied piper hes a suspect she conceded wondering how much to give how much to keep and the connection to new orleans other than his past his past is what brought us here she told him it was not an outright lie the use of the con had in part led them to crowley the connection sugar dont play with me he sucked on the cigarette some ash brushed her arm as it tumbled to the floor an attorney named chevalier we need a wiretap we need to stay a step ahead of our federal friends is the collar so allimportant you like the feds you work with them she offered we need his office his cell phone and any pay phones for several blocks my job is to win your cooperation his fingers danced lower on her chest and what is it exactly that i get in return hmm from you i mean what would such a favor be worth ill need a warrant sugar ill need a real good lie to convince a judge to give me one what would all that be worth do you think the lives of two little girls she answered bluntly if the feds beat us to the suspect we lose at least one of the girls and im all tears you understand broole said but its that night sky im thinking about some good company we could try for the attorneys phone records without you she said but were a little out of our jurisdiction maybe you arent listening dinner tonight she said weighing sarah in the balance broole picked up the phone and made two calls daphne listening in he found his way to a woman named emily who was either a past girlfriend or a blood relation there was a brief discussion when he hung up from the second call he said phone records for office phone home phone fax line and cellular theyll be through on the fax in a matter of minutes i shouldnt have told you what i did she admitted having had time to reconsider look at it this way sugar if you hadnt our meteorological friend would have been a step aheada you he has already ided crowley she gasped he looked through our photo albums he had a list of the states former guests with him what he made of it all he didnt say but he did not leave here in a jovial mood even so i wouldnt count a man like that out if i was you he seems bound and determined to make the most of his resources were not counting him out no she said the fax of chevaliers phone records arrived only minutes later chapter the phone records provided by broole produced immediate results and instantly clarified vincent chevaliers role they also necessitated daphne requesting a rain check for her dinner with broole she was heading out of town awaiting his flights boarding call boldt told her for the third time ill call your cellular at eight oclock eastern your batteries okay she nodded you know the drill go easy with them lou its doubtful they know the extent of what theyre involved in if they go crying foul to chevalier got it he said brusquely checking the overhead clock it was her plan not his a part of boldt resented that but true to form she had come up with something brilliant there are moments in ones life that are never forgotten she warned weddings deaths traffic accidents the space shuttle blowing up kennedy lady di your visit to the brehmers is one of those moments mine too with the hudsons this evening their lives change forever remember that all our lives have changed forever boldt reminded stoically every momentevery decisionis one of those moments youre talking about theyll never forget our visits we are walking into their living rooms and detonating a bomb go easy on them message received his flight was called he glanced toward the developing line at the gate back to the clock and finally to daphne they shared an awkward moment not knowing how to part they shook hands boldt felt right about that eight oclock he repeated he walked to the gate carrying only a briefcase amelia and morgan hudson owned a sprawling horse farm on the outskirts of lexington kentucky surrounded by a whitewashed board fence acres of manicured bluegrass corrals interconnected like a patchwork quilt with it too dark to see daphne imagined the illtempered stallions kicking and bucking the complacent mare and foal pairs meandering the fence lines she had been raised on a farm not unlike this one her parents lived not two hours away having headed straight to the hudson residence from the airport she turned the rental down the long drive recalling a dozen memories from her childhood the enormous brick house ran off in a variety of directions a whitefaced negro riding a black horse in an english saddle welcomed visitors with an electric lantern held out to the side chevaliers office and cellular phones carried a series of long distance calls to the hudson household leading up to the date of the shotz kidnapping the day of the kidnapping three separate calls had been placed a week later the calls suddenly stopped chevalier never called the couple again daphne knew what she would find insidewho she would find though it did nothing to instill confidence in her her assignment was simple confirmation boldt had the more difficult task she dragged her briefcase heavily toward her she had lied to the hudsons three hours earlier in a call from the new orleans airport now she had to reveal that lie and undo others she doublechecked that her weapon concealed inside her purse was loaded and working properly she had no idea what kind of people she faced chapter boldt toyed with lamoias pick gun from the backseat of the rental the brehmers houston texas home showed no activity as it had not for the last hour boldt had made a single call to it before leaving new orleans a womans southern drawl had answered this is cindy mrs evaston boldt asked this is mrs brehmer speaking she corrected sorry wrong number boldt hung up that was all he had needed to justify the trip but now from the backseat he found himself having second thoughts he was playing a solid hunch based on an attorneys phone records but the impatience of the desperate father in him in constant conflict with the meticulous detective refused to waste more than another fifteen minutes he climbed out of the car and headed around the house to find the back door he had the perfect excuse available to him if someone turned out to be homethe police shield in his coat pocket the house was deceptive it reached back into the lot framing a lap pool and with a substantial cottage pressed up against the back fence a great deal of care had been taken with the landscaping hiding corners and breaking the structures more common lines boldt walked up to the kitchen door and pounded sharply he didnt care if neighbors saw him he had sarah trudy and the others on his mind he knocked again no answer the security system visible through the kitchen door was manufactured by brinks and was currently armed a single red led flashing boldt flipped open his cellular and called the house number again to make certain he had called the right home the phone rang inside a moment later and also went unanswered the next call went to lamoia yo its me nothing here chevalier is a workaholic ordered a sandwich delivered i need every fourdigit number that could possibly belong to the brehmers of magnolia cindy and brad dates of birth cell phones social security car registrations start there add anything else you can think of hang on im writing this down lamoia said cindy and brad brehmer how long boldt asked six oclock in seattle i can do this fifteen or twenty for the easy stuff birthdays cell phones social security i dont know about the car registrations ill try the local law they might help if i press them hurry boldt said you on your cellular right here boldt said he disconnected boldt never questioned lamoias contacts his ability to obtain information some said it was all the women he had been with others claimed he had once held a position in army intelligence something boldt knew to be untrue whatever the case he would have made a better intelligence officer than boldt he had contacts everywhere and at all levels twenty minutes later boldts cellular vibrated at his side lamoia provided him with two social security numbers one cellular phone number and the vanity plates from two cars fndrazn and bradh he also had two other phone numbers for the same address both unpublished boldt took these down as well believing them to be the office phone and data lineboth decent candidates for the home code boldt asked how many retries on a brinks home security system were talking password entry right the system times out is all user programmed tensecond intervals default is thirty seconds on most systems thats true for brinks do you know that for a fact doesnt matter the make only the commercial models limit the number of retries as far as i know home models use timers he asked you going inside sarge the last plane out is at ten i cant wait around if im wrong and if youre right then matthews has a flight to book boldt wrote out the numbers hed been given as a list on a piece of notepaper he timed himself and using his cellular phones numeric pad practiced entering the various combinations of numbers within minutes he determined he could not key in all the numbers provided him he had to make selections he reduced both social security numbers to their last four digits and he did the same to all the phone numbers the birthdays were more troublesome both containing six digits he divided each into two sets of four digits became both and boldts edited list amounted to ten sets of four digits after six practice runs it became clear to boldt he would be physically unable to enter more than eight sets of numbers in the thirtysecond window he removed the home phone numbertoo obviousand the first half of the wifes birthday husbands were not the best at remembering their wifes birthday he started the rentals engine and left it running so that if he failed inputting the code he would be in the car and out of there in a matter of seconds no running lights no stopping for the stop sign at the end of the short street just a dark blur he knew that the alarm signal first passed to the private security firm then if and when the security firm failed to reach the residents by phone it would be handed off to the local police who could not possibly dispatch a cruiser any sooner than five and more likely forty minutes from the time of notice as long as he didnt panic boldt had little to worry about in the way of being caught as an added precaution he donned a pair of disposable crime scene gloves his transformation to criminal complete he stood at the homes back door for several seconds mentally rehearsing his every movement well aware that from the moment he keyed the door with lamoias pick gun the thirtysecond timer would be running he donned his reading glasses placed the pick gun in the lock squeezed the trigger and turned the door unlocked but he did not open it his heart sounded in small explosions radiating jolts of anxiety throughout his system by opening the door he would sever his ties with law enforcement would cross boundaries that separated cop from criminalthe legendary blue line he knew absolutely that such actions inevitably and irrevocably brought one down and yet he turned the doorknob pushed open the door and stepped inside once committed forever committed sarah was coming home the security device immediately sounded a highpitched warning tone alerting the resident to disarm it using his list boldt keyed in the first fourdigit numeral the devices keypad light went dark and the beeping stopped though only briefly then the light came back on and the beeping began anew invalid code flashed across the small display boldt keyed in the next number invalid code ten seconds another attempt thirteen seconds invalid code fifteen seconds another invalid code eighteen seconds the display flashed the beeping stopped and the red led was replaced by one green boldt hesitated there his finger outstretched the device remained silent he was inside he closed and locked the back door briefly studying the security device in order to rearm it quickly if necessary below the number was printed arm all below the arm part he circled the fifth number on his list preparations complete he began what he intended to be a thorough search in order to determine the brehmers relationship to the new orleans attorney it took him all of five minutes to locate the empty nursery down the hall chapter boldt picked up daphne at the door to baggage claim at pm central time she carried a hanging bag a purse and a leather briefcase boldt drove i never want to go through that again she said im not a very good liar it worked he asked they believed me they bought into it they trusted me she glanced over at him the oncoming headlights pulsing across her face has it occurred to you that weve stooped to being exactly like them like the crowleys you and me were con artists we lie to people we cheat them i threw up during the flight it wasnt air sickness cars cried past in a whine of rubber and engine but they bought it he asked repeating himself he wanted every detail i walked into their home flashed my badge too quickly for them to get a look and reintroduced myself as being with health and welfare i visited their child asleep in the nursery it was rhonda shotz boldt glanced over at her and back to the highway i inspected the house including their bedroom the kitchen the garageeven the child seat i played my role paperwork he asked chevalier brokers the adoptions my guess is that the hudsons have no idea what theyre into they think they bought off an attorney to move them up a list i worked the money issue they were well rehearsed i was shown a single check made out to one gloria afferton in the amount of her medical expenses nine thousand and change a second to chevalier for services rendered five thousand the maximum allowed for a private adoption in kentucky i suppose the rest was cash or stocks or bonds who knows their impression of chevalier hes a little slick for their tastes the wife believes their child is an unwanted baby from a prominent family just as chevalier represented it they dont care they would have bought any explanation the rest of the process fit with kentucky law for interstate adoptions a louisiana social worker a woman phoned several times with questions for them lisa crowley boldt supplied probably she spoke quietly clearly rattled from the interview they sent the social worker videos of their home and their neighborhood they notarized documents they mailed their checks they waited were they asked for photos of themselves videos boldt asked the issue was crucial to daphnes plan they claimed not it makes sense an adoption cant be refused based on how an adoptive parent looks if anything such a request could appear discriminatory since it was critical to their success boldt hoped no photos had been sent delivery the baby was brought to chevaliers office by the social worker they were in and out in less than an hour judge adams they never met him no but his name is on the documents she hesitated i saw the documents as far as i could tell theyre in order lou i think the hudsons have what would pass as a legitimate adoption chevalier kept it all in order he said he let them be the ones to transfer the child across interstate borders someone delivers the child to the city the adoptive parents take the child away hes careful and rhonda shotz he asked peaceful asleep in her nursery i gave them a clean bill of health and went my way and youll love this they asked me to pass along their best wishes to miss chambers the social worker lisa crowley evidently makes a good impression its a living boldt said sarcastically and the brehmers she asked they have a nursery all set up nothings been used diaper genie is empty most of the outfits still have their tags on themhavent been washed yet its a nursery in waiting thats it thats all we have calendar by the phone in the kitchen has a line through the weekend the word no underneath caps new orleans its them couldnt find the march phone bill might not be there yet but february they were calling chevaliers office about once a week its them he repeated trudy kittridge he muttered damn she said turning away and rolling down the window to allow the air inside awful business her shoulders tightened and he thought she was crying his cell phone vibrated and he answered it met by a womans distinctive voice that spoke the words skagit county theresa russo the computer expert he had consulted on sarahs ransom video come again the cable company that boxed in the severe weather notice around cnn it provides service to skagit the notice concerned a flood warning youre working late message was buried on my email thirtyfive new messages its been there two days im afraid sorry about that thought youd like to know skagit he asked were certain about that positive she said its good for your investigation isnt it i mean how many fedex trucks can be assigned to skagit a hell of a lot fewer than in downtown seattle ill tell you that any contacts at fedex i may know someone who knows someone in data processing she said its a pretty small community we may even supply themid have to check check he said data processing should have all the logs and manifests thats what were after you want me to try or do you want to do it she asked you mind no problem routes and times for all skagit deliveries march twentyfifth ive got that already he could feel her hesitation before she asked how is liz i heard shes out isnt she the way she said it it sounded to him more like a jail sentence maybe that was right shes home he confirmed doing fine he glanced at the cars clock he had promised to call but couldnt remember when they had arranged he had no idea if she was doing fine or not he said at the risk of sounding like a jerk the sooner understood what do i do if i get something email it to you how about dropping it off with liz done id love to see her anyway he thanked her and disconnected anything important daphne asked working a tissue at her nose she knew his voice too well knew him too well she had discerned his excitement his anticipation he had not told his team about the fedex truck he had kept that one to himself though he wasnt certain why more lies they didnt bother him anymore he knew he was in trouble he was saved from any discussion the brehmers house appeared on their left chapter boldt parked the rental on the street certain that the next twenty to thirty minutes were crucial to the rescue of trudy kittridge and thereby sarah together he and daphne climbed the slate steps toward the front door in silence each reflecting on the importance of their performances you understand yes she interrupted i do perfectly well boldt pushed the doorbell which to him felt more like pulling a trigger brad brehmer peered through the crack in the doorbabyfaced but handsome honest looking boldt thought a churchgoer thought daphne he had dark hair a sharp jaw a sardonic smile he wore khakis and a buttondown blue oxford shirt it was past eleven the news played in the background help you he asked with only a hint of a southern accent this is lt lou boldt she introduced im daphne matthews were police mr brehmer they produced their identification but quickly hoping the man might miss their jurisdiction spd brehmer inquired his throat dry like the air he hadnt missed a thing wheres that seattle she answered youre a long way from home boldt said its late sorry about that brehmer hesitated the moment was awkward you mind if i see those again you mind passing them through they did as he asked brehmer shut and locked the front door a long sixty seconds later he reopened it and invited them inside is your wife at home mr brehmer daphne asked wed like to speak to both of you if we might we were out tonight he clarified as if asked appropriately nervous and anxious daphne approved a celebration dinner the room looked bigger to boldt with the lights on celebrating the adoption daphne said stinging the man above all things she needed to maintain the upper hand cindy the husband called out somewhat desperately put something on and get out here nice house boldt said you want to show us the nursery cindy cindy brehmer a woman who would look twentyfive for the next ten years entered the living room wearing a terry cloth robe that hung to midthigh the moment she saw boldt and matthews she reversed course abruptly my god brad she complained stay theyre police i dont care who they are you will please excuse me she apologized and beat a hasty retreat five minutes later she returned with her face on wearing jeans and a pajama top introductions followed small with a petite waist and frail hands her large expressive eyes and her dark coloring conveyed a demanding presence with a thicker accent than her husband she practiced her southern hospitality enjoying the sound of her own voice as she prattled on about a visit she and a sorority sister had made to seattle a decade earlier she said im sure ive never had better crab cakes in my life boldt missed the crab cakes the smell of the water the vivid sunsets over the olympics more than anything he missed little sarah the resulting silence hung heavily in the room the husband said they mentioned the adoption hon daphne offered boldt a side glance drew in a deep breath and began cautiously its a delicate matter confidential we ask you to respect that well respect it a lot better when you tell us what it is you want brad brehmer said impatiently he knew how much they had paid chevalier for the child he sensed the trouble well ahead of his wife who couldnt sit still boldt explained were investigating a series of kidnappings clearly confusing them both daphne added our purpose here is to inform you to warn you to attempt to keep you out of criminal proceedings which are almost certain to happen if you adopt this child oh god cindy brehmer understood then what her husband already knew you cannot do this to us do you know what weve been through this is our babyour first baby addressing the husband boldt said you have business relations with an attorney named chevalier in new orleans their faces drained of color and the wifes theatrical smile faltered before you go forward with this adoption you need to be aware of the facts there is still time to avoid criminal charges daphne reminded this is our baby the woman complained no boldt countered if she is who we believe she is she was kidnapped transported across state lines and delivered in new orleans within the last twentyfour hours youre to take possession of the child in new orleans daphne informed them with a threatening certainty this is not happening the husband said weve prayed about this chevalier was the answer to those prayers boldt said there are parents in seattle who are praying as well its all legal the husband insisted jumping ahead we havent done anything illegal not yet boldt corrected but the moment you take possession of that child you will have knowingly or not you are accessories to kidnapping oh dear god no cindy brehmers eyes clouded and she sprang up to save her face daphne told brehmer youll be asked by the court to explain what you thought you were paying all that money for why so much money boldt contributed its a felony to overpay for an adoption there are federal statutes as well as state how carefully did you hide the money trail sir were you creative enough to fool forensic accountants he might as well have slapped the man across the face dazed brehmer sputtered unable to complete a thought a siren wailed in the distance perfect timing boldt thought daphne explained if you cooperate we may be able to keep you from being charged boldt cautioned there are no guarantees when are you scheduled to pick up the child daphne asked you are not taking this baby from me the wife said leaning against the hallway wall cindy the husband admonished theyre offering us a choice a chance we need to listen to this the womans face collapsed into tears she staggered to her husband embraced him and sobbed daphne asked how much did you pay expenses plus fifty the husband answered matteroffactly three separate payments about seventy in all he checked with both his visitors he told us it was a prominent family that it would be done very quietly we were paying extra to get a white baby that was never spoken but it was understood have you ever met chevalier boldt asked never did you videotape yourselves or send photographs the house the wife answered the neighborhood not us spoken with him he has called a few times spoken with cindy mostly about the timing the schedule the money that was with me he answered early on how long ago two three months he wouldnt necessarily know your voice then boldt inquired what is it youre getting at brehmer asked curiously beginning to understand boldt told them chevalier called your home yesterday tearyeyed the wife answered were booked on a flight in the morning she began to cry again were booked into a hotel we honeymooned there were to wait for his call boldt met eyes with brad brehmer and waited for the man to feel his intensity then he shifted the same attention to the woman and told them both if we bust chevalier ahead of time we might never recover the child the child is our priority right for all of us he said including even daphne the child comes first the woman nodded good boldt said its important we understand one another daphne added if this is to work we need to communicate we need to know you down to your core unfortunately we need it now tonight before tomorrow morning youre going to take our place the husband said correctly guessing daphnes plan is that whats going on here boldt answered you might want to make some coffee its going to be a long night chapter the following morning at boldt and daphne checked into the soniat house under the name brehmer deep in the french quarter on a quiet side street away from the tshirts and the smell of stale beer away from the movie crews and tourists swollen with crawfish and hot sauce the hotels office and courtyard were accessed through a single door painted kelly green they stepped into another older world a new orleans boldt had not yet experienced but one he quickly realized lingered beneath the surface glitz and souvenirs its cobblestone courtyard resplendent in a lush jungle of deep greens and sharp vivid colors the soniat house delivered the new orleans of the nineteenth century the male receptionist wore a dark suit looked boldt in the eye and bowed his head slightly to daphne we have a lovely room for you mr and mrs brehmer charles will show you the way i note that your stay is openended we will need notice day after tomorrow if youre intending to spend the weekend with us that shouldnt be a problem boldt paused a beat too long as he signed the guest slip in part because he had to remember to sign brehmers nameit was brehmers credit card he was usingin part because the daily room rate was twice his rental cars weekly rate as a couple they were shown through the courtyard and up a centuryold set of winding wooden stairs past a sevenfoottall oil portrait of a southern general and a smaller oil of a harlequin in full regalia boldt had no way of knowing how far chevaliers influence reached or what kind of underground existed in this city but it didnt take an intelligence officer to understand it was a place of influence peddling of favors for this reason they had changed nothing about the brehmers hotel reservation or the couples itinerary charles keyed open the extremely narrow ninefoot wooden door and motioned for daphne to lead the way he heard her gasp as he followed into the long hardwood hallway its walls covered with oil paintings light sparkling from a cut glass chandelier the hallway ended at a large bathroom all marble and brass through another pair of towering doors to the left was a sitting room with a crushed velvet love seat two french chairs and three sevenfoot windows that started at floor height and led out onto a balcony with flowering baskets issuing green waterfalls of tendrils and runners and overlooking the narrow street and a nunnery beyond charles the bellman explained in his warm affected voice that a century earlier city property taxes had been assessed according to the number of a buildings exterior doors and so huge doublehung windows had taken their place he lifted one admitting the sounds of the quarter as a horsedrawn buggy passed and the drivers voice was heard lecturing his passengers on the soniat houses place in the citys history breakfastbiscuits juice and coffeewould be served on the balcony the bedroom held a fourposter with a red satin duvet flanked by antique end tables hosting leaded glass lamps a telephone was the only fixture that brought the suite into the current century boldt tipped the man whose footsteps faded down the impossibly long hallway the door to room bumped shut any of the hotel staff could be on chevaliers payrollbellhops chambermaidstheir every move might be monitored they would maintain the impression of being a married couple the brehmers had a dinner reservation arranged in advance by chevalier that boldt and daphne would honor there was no saying to what extent chevalier screened his prospective buyers certainly he conducted credit reports perhaps he placed the adoptive parents under surveillance for a day or two preceding the adoption this would help explain his having made various arrangements for both the hudsons and the brehmers any such possibility required boldt and daphne to play along at least on a superficial levela married couple excited by the prospect of an adoption we had better practice our signatures she said in a businesslike manner she ordered a mint julep from room service boldt a ginger ale when the waiter had come and gone they sat out on the balcony in green wicker chairs with chintz padded cushions the sonorous clipclop of horse and buggy carrying up the cobblestone street they worked on their forged signatures intricate shadows from the wroughtiron artistry played onto the decking black and white and gray like chinese shadow puppets after attempting a page of signatures boldt glanced over at her his face flushed from the heat he said want some irony the laundry service provides the irony she said clearly feeling the bourbon boldt smirked finished the ginger ale and said the irony is that the tables have turned now who are the con artists trying to steal a baby chapter commanders palace roared with the music of gracious diningcocktail patter the chime of fine tableware corks drawn from the necks of wine bottles boldt and daphne as the brehmers were shown to a table in the restaurants lavishly painted secondstory lunchroom an army of waiters descended upon them the men clearly taken in by daphnes beauty she owned the place from the moment they arrived the maitre d charmed by her fluent french and the plunging neckline of her afternoon purchase boldt lowered his head and toyed with the butter on his bread plate dont sulk she said im not im thinking about johns call lamoia had tailed chevalier the night before following him north to the small town of mechant he had not been alone a second car had also been following chevalier lamoia had kept his distance but he was guessing dunkin hale so wheres the russian army boldt asked daphne the bureau he clarified they have an active field office here in the city probably a fairly large one an outoftown agent working a case of national importance wheres the backup i see what you mean she lightly buttered a piece of bread and recommended he try it boldt said the only explanation i can come up with is that hes running this advance work solely for flemming which means flemming does not want the rest of the agency to know about new orleans why theres a cornbread and a rosemary if you go with the pork tenderloin the cornbreads the ticket is flemming so political that he would bury this kind of connection until he has hard evidence she said kay kalidja painted him exactly that way have you decided its a tossup between the pork and the catfish he must have traced the rental car to salt lake by now which means he has the dechamps identitythe credit card how much more does he need im going with the catfish she replied she sampled a celery stick in an exceptionally private voice she said do you know the real story of the pied piper the flute and the children he said she waved the celery stick like a conductors baton no no in the thirteenth century the pied piper was hired by the german city of hamelin to rid the town of its rat infestation he did just thatgot rid of the ratsand legend had it that he charmed them away with his flute in fact he probably poisoned them once the rats were gone the city refused him payment he responded by killing over a hundred of the citys children this is folklore right no some version of the man existed one of our earliest documented serial killers the folklore came from goethe and robert browning who retold the story with a little sugar on it she placed down the celery the crowleys served their time and then were denied an adoption they are denying others children you think his decision to play an exterminator is random it fits his role as the pied piper they could have kidnapped one of these children and kept it for themselves but they did not they elected to take from the fertile and give to the barren combining robin hood with the pied piper they hold a grudge this is not about profit this is about payback id like to think theyre predictable but they are not they feel justified in what theyre doing they understand the joy of adoption its been denied them theyre angry were all angry boldt replied two hours later a hazy moon rising in the sky its light spilling into the soniat house courtyard despite the illumination of the city daphne and boldt slowly climbed the wooden staircase toward their suite in silence she stopped at the top of the stairs and gazing down into the courtyard said no matter what this is a beautiful hotel as daphne prepared for bed in the bathroom boldt sat on the crushed velvet couch feeling both fatigue and anticipation chevalier was going to contact them about the adoption his best opportunity for rescuing sarah lay ahead he placed his gun and id wallet in the beds end table emptied his pockets hung up his sport coat and tie removed his shoesall the little rituals he had come to accept as preparation for bedtime daphne appeared wrapped snugly inside a hotel robe which side she asked he pointed as uncomfortable as she a few minutes later he entered the bedroom in boxer shorts and a tshirt thinner than he had been since his twenties the terror and tension of the last few months starved off him propped up against a number of pillows her face caught in the bedside light like a halfmoon in a summer sky daphne shone equally as brightly she looked up from a tourist magazine her brown eyes tracking him as he crossed the room and climbed into his side of the bed this is weird she said yes he agreed i think i snore she said that makes two of us he ate the chocolate that had been left and read the tomorrows forecast card stormy when she switched off the bedside lamp a knife blade of light sliced through a crack in the drapes bathing the bedroom in an artificial dusk he rolled onto his stomach thinking that liz occupied a bed far from here alone frightened concerned about their baby girl it was for her sake he said his prayer good night daphne sighed exhausted good night boldt replied knowing sleep would elude him once again at am exactly the telephone rang in room of the soniat house daphne matthews wrapped in her hotel robe and drinking a cup of hot chocolate secure beneath the porch overhang in one of the green wicker chairs sat with her legs tucked up under her as a light rain stained the stone facade of the convent across the street she placed down the hot chocolate cradled in her hands and hurried into the suites antebellum sitting room hoping to give boldt the needed rest but he snagged the telephone hello speaking yes mr chevalier ten oclock no no thats why were here we cant wait ten oclock then he hung up i guess we passed the test ill order up some tea she felt as hungry as shed ever been room service offered biscuits and only biscuits she ordered for two lamoia heard from boldt five separate times between and that friday morning they discussed photography the importance of field notes surveillance position retrieving numbers from the callerid box lamoia had fixed to chevaliers line in the basement of his office boldt sounded as nervous as an actor on opening night lamoia felt more like a ball player before the gamefilled with the excitement of anticipation his muscles restless in a welcome ache of need his mind singular and focused he had slept in only fits and starts since his return from mechant late wednesday night early thursday morning despite this he felt refreshed ready he felt bound and determined to avenge himself and his professional dignity his suspension would be removed from his record if the charges proved false which they would but to apprehend the pied piperto receive a commendation in the middle of a suspensionwould be the ultimate rats tail up the ass of internal investigations he licked his chops with expectation he had long since established his surveillance position when boldt phoned him the first time chevaliers apartment communicated with his secondfloor law office his cadillac had remained parked behind the building all night room lights had come on at am chevalier had not left his rooms since that time for boldt and lamoia this presented one of three possibilities in terms of the kittridge girl chevalier had phoned the girls kidnapper the kidnapper had called chevalier or arrangements had been made well in advance of the exchange and would go off as scheduled unless otherwise notified this last option made the most sense given the pied pipers penchant for preparedness for it limited the number of phone calls between the two players and thus limited any chance of identifying the guardians whereabouts furthermore it helped explain chevaliers tight control of the actions of the adoptive parentsthe kidnapped child was already scheduled for delivery the purchasing parents had better show up but if either of the other two options proved truea lastminute exchange of phone calls between the playersit presented investigators with the opportunity to locate the guardians safe house ahead of the adoption meeting meaning lamoia might be able to establish surveillance on the safe house while boldt or matthews followed whoever dropped the child increasing their chances of identifying an individual to follow back to sarah matthews was at that very moment attempting to contact broole in hopes of obtaining chevaliers outgoing calls for his part lamoia needed access to the callerid well ahead of the am meeting to monitor what calls had been received by chevalier he left the surveillance post he had established on the third floor of an arsoned building a half block down and across the street from chevaliers office and clawed his way into a pair of faded green coveralls purchased at the local salvation army outlet pulled on an illfitting baseball cap and negotiated the back fire escape leery of the buildings central stairs which were about as trustworthy as crisp toast the ostrich cowboy boots stuck out from this ensemble certainly capable of giving away his disguise but some things a guy just couldnt compromise lamoia believed a disguise any disguise was built primarily on ones presence it was not the workers coveralls nor the bankers threepiece suit nor the telephone linemans rigging that convinced the unsuspecting it was the way in which those clothes that gear was filled out if a man dressed down as a street person but walked with the posture of a marine forget about it if that same man exuded a primal menace then the sidewalks would part to accommodate him a buildings maintenance man understood himself believed others could not live without him felt the control given him in the master key he carried the wrench in his toolbox lamoia approached the buildings service entrance with his cocky attitude intact as he had five times before the pick gun admitted him effortlessly he switched on the interior light in no hurry to be seen ducking insidehe had every right to be in that place he belonged fuck em all he reached the back room where he uncovered the callerid box he had placed on the attorneys two voice linesso accommodating of the phone company to mark each line for him in advance sometimes the juju went with you to his regret chevalier had received not a single call since lamoias inspection of the system the night before popular guy maybe broole had something for them chevaliers outgoing calls were equally important or maybe they werent going to be handed any bones maybe sarahs chances came down to this one meeting in a sleazeball attorneys office in the middle of the hottest city on earth maybe it was all up to his own abilities to follow whoever delivered the kittridge kid follow him or her for as long as it took follow this person right back to the elusive pied piper and little sarah boldt he liked the sound of that maybe destiny was on his side chapter posing as cindy brehmer daphne dressed in ferragamo flats a cream linen sleeveless shift and a simple string of pearls with matching stud earrings she wore a light blush pale red lipstick mascara a hint of eye shadow and a bead of penciled eyeliner boldts wrinkled khakis and blue oxford buttondown did not live up to his wifes appearance his pale gaunt face with its prominent cheekbones and sunken eyes lent him the look of a man struggling with disease little more than his wifes escort a man to carry the empty child seat he took to opening doors for her arranging transportation for her and carrying on a onesided conversation playing the doting husband perfectly caught in his wifes wake like a piece of flotsam rising and falling beneath her mood swings he took the wheel of the volvo rental chauffeuring her out of the quarter through downtown and into a mixed neighborhood that bordered the garden district he drove several blocks out of their way to arrive heading south so that the volvo could pause briefly immediately below the burnedout shell of a structure that lamoia had described to him lou daphne began i know he answered you wait for chances like this you work toward them and then suddenly theyre upon you and i know this is going to be a mess to untangle lou chevaliers phone records and the paperwork filed at vital statistics will give us all these kids back it may take awhile to sort it all out but itll happen these kids are going home trudy kittridge first how do we live with ourselves if something goes wrong trudys going home he repeated defiantly there was no mention made of sarah lamoia had to stay with lisa crowley at all costs providing lisa crowley showed boldt pulled the volvo into the back lot he shut off the engine but neither passenger nor driver moved frozen in concentration and second thought boldts hands remained on the wheel daphnes sat folded in her lap kiss me said the psychologist the brehmers would kiss before going inside and remember were excited lou weve never felt so in love this is a moment weve been awaiting a long time tell me about it kiss me for them okay he kissed her quickly for the benefit of any surveillance lamoia included good luck she said brad brehmer boldt introduced himself vincent chevalier my wife cindy daphne smiled at the man studying his cheap suit his eye movement his posture his stubby fingers with their manicured nails his tongue teased his bottom lip before each word spoken come in he said staring at daphnes chest and smiling through wet lips the office suited him mobilehome wood paneling a ragged couch facing a low table that offered a halffull ashtray and dogeared magazines a giveaway girlie calendar from pennzoil chevaliers earlygeneration computer did not belong to a man surfing the internet for victims credit cards classical hits played from a thinsounding radio what would the brehmers have thought she wondered how would they have reacted it did not strike daphne as a place to start a family fridaynight poker perhaps a place to annul a las vegas chapel marriage oh my daphne remarked with just a hint of the carolinas how authentic looking she said to her husband chevalier said the paperwork will go pretty fast youll see he checked his watch have a seat chevalier snatched the ashtray dumped its contents into a wastebasket and then lit a cigarette without asking and without offering one been busy around here he offered chevalier was smaller and more pitiful than daphne had pictured him in her minds eye a sluggish little creature who overate and gambled with peoples lives she didnt doubt his resolvehe was in bed with a pair of con artists that had pulled in nearly a million dollars as baby brokers she pasted a smile onto her face and asked when do we get to meet our little darling city services lady should be here soon he acknowledged lets take pen to paper roll up the sleeves and get down to brass tacks whataya say theres more paperwork boldt complained hell you pick up a package you sign for it the troll winked at her she felt numb capable of anything chevalier transferred documents from his desk to the coffee table and placed pens down in front of them full signature here and here and again he said flipping pages manically well initials there again here and then signature there that last one you wait on so that it can be witnessed by two partiesthats me and the social worker the two parties whataya say boldt had brehmers scrawl down pat an indistinguishable mass of loops with a few vertical lines thrown in for the sake of the bs and the h give a firstgrader an hour with a pencil and he or she could be forging brehmers checks daphne faced the greater challenge cindy brehmers signature was controlled and pretty not that chevalier would think to check the paperwork was a masquerade for the buyers benefit chevalier was not the brains of the operation he was at best a facilitator the attorney nervously checked his watch offered them both coffee and then edged over to the window parted the blinds and looked down at the street should be here any minute he said i just cant wait daphne cried out how about a cup of that coffee asked a woman who like boldt drank nothing but tea she reached over and took her husbands hand lovingly in hers chevalier complied with her request and turned to address mr coffee daphne squeezed boldts hand hard signaling him and directing his attention away from the attorney and onto boldts open sport coat where his handgun and holster showed he buttoned up how many of these adoptions do you arrange in a year boldt asked conversationally chevalier spun around and glared fixing onto him like an attack dog on an intruder we agreed previously never to discuss anything to do with my business mr brehmer the man behind the invective did not share much of anything with the gawking attorney of a few moments earlier this new man at once dangerous and unpredictable intrigued the psychologist chevalier wound up like a venomous snake ready to strike threatened i suggest we stick to our agreement bradley daphne barked at her husband dont you dare mess this up to the attorney she said he didnt mean a thing by it mr chevalier not a thing bradley just likes to talk thats all she added teasingly whataya say bradley chevalier questioned suspiciously throwing the name into the air with great disdain bradley he repeated boldt blanched the moment daphne barked at him he had practiced the signature enough times to recognize her mistake printed in capital letters on the documents in process of being signeddocuments that shouted up at him from the low table where they lay open to the last pagewas the name she should have called him bradford not bradley as his makebelieve wife had misspoken attorneys caught such details chevalier had drawn up the documents likely without the word processing abilities of an assistant why involve anyone else he had typed them printed them and proofed them he certainly knew brehmers first name he had to be wondering why the mans wife did not tension hung in the air as thick as the smell of smoke and burned coffee chevaliers head snapped toward the street he had heard something only a resident of the building could discern he eyed boldt cautiously crossed to the window and peered down into the street when he looked back into the room his eyes flashed angrily between his two guests and though boldt scrambled for an alternate plan his mind wouldnt function clouded by thoughts of his daughter smoke caught in the mans throat burning it dry as chevalier said she has arrived chapter people were creatures of habit lamoia thought as he watched a ford taurus pull into the postagestamp parking lot behind chevaliers office such habits were a detectives bread and butter they offered behavioral links to the past and future alike people chose to dress the same eat the same food at the same places travel in the same circle of friends frequent the same barsdrive the same cars lisa crowley had a thing for the ford taurus she parked in the first open spot in the lot the one immediately adjacent to the street providing lamoia a good look and the driver a quick exit as the drivers door came open lamoia prepared himself for the ready putting away the boldt had loaned him and the stun stick he routinely carried tucked into his right boot a handheld less powerful version of the pied pipers air taser he confirmed the pick guns location in the pocket of his windbreaker no cuffs no id wallet his life had changed no doubt about it he did not recognize lisa crowley from the mug shot provided daphne by nopds detective broole dressed in a professional style in keeping with a job of such responsibility and yet a state employee this woman wore a starched white cotton top and a pair of crisp pleated khaki pants he assumed the hair was not hers but one of many wigs and yet it seemed perfectly in keeping fitting her face and complementing her looks remarkably she wore a colorful scarf on her head and a pair of shades she might have been anybody lamoia wondered if the scarf and glasses concealed head injuries sustained in the boise pileup if so there was little she could do to fully hide herself body markings regardless of how small were an investigators godgiven gift confidence artists were fully versed in identity changes lamoia was prepared for lisa crowley to enter a building with one look and moments later leave as an entirely different person the woman who climbed back in the taurus and drove it away might not be the same woman who had arrived and now climbed out opening the cars rear door crowley leaned inside and retrieved the baby seat lamoia headed for the burnedout tenements fire escape and the blistering heat of another hazy morning his assignment was simple in word difficult in practice and yet critical to sarahs rescue to place lisa crowley under surveillance and never lose track of her boldt had entrusted him with nothing less than his daughters life he had no intention of letting anyone down chapter bradley a suspicious chevalier repeated curiously stepping away from the window cindys way of putting me in my place boldt told the man vamping one of those husband and wife things that goes back to a childhood story i wish id never told looking at daphne boldt said for the benefit of the attorney no one but the teachers ever got my name right in school it was always bradley this and bradley that it really got on my nerves after a while i came to hate the name still do no one ever seems to get bradford bradley gets your attention sweetheart she said without hesitation picking up the ruse beautifully and you know how i just love to have your full attention she tugged on the hem of her shift lifting it a little more open than necessary well aware of how to win chevaliers attention as well chevalier sucked on the cigarette his small eyes flitting between his two clients boldt felt a tear of sweat charge down his ribs he knew that trudy kittridges keeper had arrived when footfalls in the hall drew chevalier to his office door daphne jumped up ran an open hand down her shift and headed straight for the car seatthe baby catching herself at the very last moment and thinking to introduce herself to the woman the woman responded susan chambers the woman who called herself chambers passed the baby seat to daphne set down a baby bag slung over her shoulder and gingerly removed her sunglasses her left eye was badly blackened and considerably swollen she preempted any questions slipped standing up out of the tub she touched the scarf pretty stupid you ask me youve seen a doctor i hope boldt said stepping closer studying every line in her features every bump blemish and bone he would never forget that face he made sure of it im fine boldt couldnt help himself a blow to the head like that can give you real trouble boldt said headaches with an eye like that she would be living on pain killersaspirin at the very least chevalier agreed with boldt nodding he said pointedly you should have it looked at he added strongly hear the woman clearly didnt like the conversation aimed onto her maintaining her composure looking down at the child she asked them all shes beautiful isnt she daphne repeated her introduction she spoke in a breathy slightly hysterical voice slipping at once into baby talk as she dropped to one knee to greet the baby girl daphnes performance the use of the altered voices was essential because the social workerin all likelihood lisa crowleyhad spent the most amount of time in phone conversations with cindy brehmer with only the few calls made over a protracted period it was doubtful lisa crowley would identify the voice as that of another woman but daphne was taking no chances she focused her attention on the child and left the documentation paperwork and chitchat to boldt may i daphne said in a girlish voice indicating the baby seat please lisa crowley answered and im here to answer any questions you or mr brehmer may have about parenting the child boldt felt a sudden fit of rage unlike anything he had ever experienced triggered initially by simply the womans presencehis daughters kidnapper in the same room with him for there was no mistaking lisa crowleyit struck to his core as she spoke so evenly so controlled so generously she was a social worker not a woman playing a role her professional calm and authority were an affront to his own professionalism and authority he could picture her in a police uniform at the door to millie wiggins day care this woman had physically touched sarah had trained a video camera onto her while she screamed for her daddy boldt wanted desperately to hurt this woman sir she asked yes boldt returned i asked if you have any questions on the caring and feeding of the child no i dont think so weve been through the parenting classes as you know he said pointing to the documents the brehmers had briefed them on the requirements they had fulfilled in order to take possession of the child the nationally sanctioned parenting classes offered by a houston hospital included a certification diploma that accompanied the brehmer paperwork after two kids of his own boldt could have given the parenting classes himself something in him stirred and boldt couldnt avoid confronting her he looked directly into her eyes and said do you have children of your own ms chambers all color drained from lisa crowleys face daphne looked up sharply from the baby bradley she chastised what possible business is that of ours please excuse my husband ms chambers he can be impertinent and obnoxious in the most unexpected situations and i assure you our little angel will learn nothing of the kind from her daddy i nearly have him trained for the dinner table after all dont i bradley none crowley whispered regaining herself quickly she added which is one reason this work is so rewarding so fulfilling for me she met eyes with boldt for a moment he believed she might have seen through their ruse her subsequent smile patronizing though it was relieved him of this fear of course it is daphne said supporting him ill bet you want to go home with every one of the children you and mr chevalier place mr chevalier places them mrs brehmer she corrected i merely oversee the transfer for the benefit of the children and the state though yes every child is precious and a wonder under god boldt felt a knot in his throat he fought against it but broke into tears they spilled down his cheeks well looky there daphne said sarcastically i dont think ive seen my husband cry since the rockets lost the finals chevalier smirked as he busily sorted through the remaining paperwork a cigarette pinched tightly between his moist lips daphne approached boldt kissed him gently and said were a family now sweetheart boldt nodded recovering quickly daphne said were so eager to get her home yes crowley replied youre very lucky she glanced at chevalier a few signatures is all chevalier piped up anxiously now that miss susan is here she can witness for us a thunderous rain crashed down on the roof of the building without warning sounding more like a small explosion the baby cried out daphne reached down unfastened the seats restraints and scooped trudy kittridge into the safety of her arms the first of the children had been recovered chapter lamoia cursed the rain from behind the steering wheel of his rental it wasnt simply rain rain he could handle rain he was used to anyone who had lived in seattle for fifteen years knew rain on a firstname basis but this the sky blackened like someone had thrown a switch and water fell in sheets like a fire hose aimed at the ground fell so hard that when it struck the hot pavement droplets bounced up a foot or more before falling again and converting to a layer of steam water pounded the roof of the car so loudly that lamoia could not hear the radio the downpour cleared the sidewalks umbrellas made vain attempts to withhold the deluge the roadway flooded as gutters roared like rivers lamoia saw only a blurred silver film to turn on the wipers of a parked car was to give his position away through the blur he saw boldt running toward his volvo he pulled the wagon up close to the building and the woman he assumed to be crowley braved the downpour to help boldt and daphne get the child seat into the car crowley then sprinted to the taurus opened the trunk and withdrew a dark overnight bag before scrambling into the front seat the only movement on the street came from the windshield wipers of a pair of cars that had doubleparked to allow the rain to let up these doubleparked cars in turn blocked others parked legally boldts rental edged forward out onto the flooded street one of the only cars moving lamoia caught another set of wipers movingthis from one of the blocked cars crowleys taurus backed up but then paused as the rain fell even harder lamoia snagged the cell phone as he saw a man wearing a trench coat hurry from the blocked car and pound on the window of the car that was blocking him this man motioned frantically for the doubleparked car to move so he could pull out from his own parking space the driver took the hint the doubleparked car rolled so did the taurus lamoia fired up his engine as crowleys taurus backed up and pulled out into the street the phone rang through and boldts voice answered brehmer can you talk lamoia followed out into the street cars that had pulled over were moving again the cell phone reception was awful shes smacked up pretty badly boldt told him attempting to supply identifying features her left eye static sparked loudly in lamoias ear a scarf lamoia interrupted we got ourselves a problem a visitor you copy that weve got ourselves a stick in the spokes you there im here its hale an enormous flash of lightning occurred simultaneously with a crack of thunder that shook the car the cell phone went dead lamoia turned the wipers to high couldnt see a damn thing chapter lamoia and hale followed the taurus in tandem hale in the lead in a dark green jeep cherokee the rainstorm remained so strong that lamoia wouldnt have recognized his own mother crossing the street forcing bumpertobumper traffic for lamoia the slower the betterboth the jeep and the taurus stayed close based on nothing concrete he decided hale had not noticed him assuming he would be consumed with following the taurus and paying little attention to other traffic he tried the cell phone again its red no service light pulsing in warning his attention fixed on the taurus through a series of turns and one red light he was forced to run lamoia tried to figure hale there seemed to him at least two explanations for hales behavior either broole had alerted hale to spds presence or hale had made the same connection to vincent chevalier unaware of the pied pipers identity hale had attached himself to chevalier like a tic in turn he had stumbled onto crowley lamoia tried the cellular again the network remained down the highway signs suggested lisa crowleys destination was the airport if hale so much as attempted an arrest he would blow sarahs chances he considered his options and made a difficult decision crowley would be alert for anyone entering the airport terminal behind her but if he arrived ahead of her he might stay with her he asked himself when the hell have i ever been wrong he pulled out of his lane and passed both hale and crowley the international airport was the next exit chapter boldt drove to the airport wife and child in the car exactly as the brehmers had planned his eyes remained divided between the rearview mirror and the traffic in front of them believing it a good possibility they were being followed they would make the flight to houston together for the sake of appearance from houston it was on to seattle for daphne and trudy kittridge boldt intended to return to new orleans to assist lamoia in the surveillance of lisa crowley the only link to his daughter the recovery of trudy kittridge filled him with hope daphne said from the backseat where she held a bottle of formula for the child those injuries are severe lou i know you hear chevalier trying to get her to see a doctor he saw it too that eye i know we need her healthy if shes going to lead you back to sarah shell survive its hale im worried about a couple phone calls from hale and were either talking a federal invasion led by flemming or the crowleys blowing to singapore daphne considered this are you saying hales working for them she called out loudly from the backseat sending the baby into a volley of cries she settled her down it would explain him playing this solo it doesnt fit with bureau policy daffy he has carried this too far it has to be explained if hes not down here to investigate these people hes down here to protect them he came onto flemmings team late in the game the two have known each other for a long time have worked together before hale could have easily monitored flemmings progress in each city and told the crowleys when to bail out it would explain their perfect timing daphne played along she gets involved in an injury car accident that changes things flemming is warming to her i see what youre saying at that point either the crowleys or chevalier could demand protection hale would respond which explains his being down here alone he tells flemming hes chasing leads flemming buys into it its how he runs things flemmings not sending in the troops before hes absolutely sure they have the collar the tattoo shop she asked him hale removes that evidence ahead of us they go ahead with the kittridge adoption thinking theyre okay thats the best sign of all as far as sarahs concerned they havent pulled the plug but hale she sounded incredulous he knows better than anyone flemmings determination and his resources he knows whats coming lisa crowley is injured their credit card identities have been made for all they know spitting image as well its coming apart on them so they blow off seattle so they blow boldt agreed and poor sarah is suddenly a liability chapter lamoia pulled into shortterm parking and snagged an automated ticket he stowed the handgun and cuffs under the front seat but kept the stun stick wedged between his calf and his right boot it would have to be removed before he passed through security but the idea of going naked was beyond himhed spent fifteen years with some form of selfdefense pressed against his skin the loading areas outside the terminal were crowded with travelers avoiding the storm lamoia shoved his way through the crowd and rode an escalator to obtain a view of the entrance ramps crowded with cabs vehicles and buses he could just make out the entrances to the short and longterm parking lots the combination of rain and traffic limited his chance of identifying crowleys taurus he waited there for less than a minute abandoned the effort and headed inside lamoia snagged an abandoned usa todaymcpaperand took a seat with a view of the ticket counters a set of escalators and the terminals central security station he expected boldt and daphne who had left ahead of him to be checking in for their flight to houston but he didnt see them which meant they were probably already at their gate according to the video monitors the next flight to houston didnt leave for an hour and a halfgate flights to dallas fort worth a hub for several major carriers left regularly he suspected crowley would ticket one of those flights knowing firsthand that american flew several nonstops between dallas and seattle five minutes lapsed lamoia nervously checked his watch and then tried the cell phone no service hovering on the edge of panic he took up position the paper held as a prop as he scanned the terminal two bus groups crowded the delta ticket line filling the area with chatter and too much luggage a moment later a woman arrived in the terminal via the baggage claim escalator outwardly this was not the same woman he had watched climb into the taurus but he took a mental snapshot of her just the same she wore a blue skirt not khakis as crowley had a white cotton tshirt small black boots that laced up over her ankles and a french beret pulled down on her head she carried herself in a fluid feminine walk that shared nothing with the woman outside chevaliers office but the dark wraparound sunglasses were the same as was the general shape and size of the overnight bag slung from her shoulder that bag caught lamoias eye he lowered his head back into the sports pages the presence of that bag suggesting she was there not to observe the brehmers but indeed for a flight of her own the change in disguise accomplished in the rentals front seat or in a baggage claim washroom contributed to her confidence she walked with her back straight her chin held high and yet she failed to disguise the pain that each step cost her he could sense her measuring the remaining distance to the security check like an exhausted boxer heading to his corner the sunglasses not only obscured her injuries but prevented others from knowing where she was looking for this reason lamoia remained slouched in his seat his long legs crossed straight in front of him his casual attention alternately divided between the terminal and the newspaper he sized up every skirt that passed by in character he told himself some things came easily hale appeared in the center of the ticket terminal wet and bedraggled lamoia distracted by crowley had missed his entrance though he had expected him looking like a businessman in a hurry hale checked the departure monitors his wristwatch and then the monitors a second time lamoia looked left to crowley right to hale encouraging crowley to get through the security check when hale made for a bank of pay phones across the terminal lamoia knew instinctively the man had to be stopped knew what had to be done boldt daphne and trudy kittridge waited amid a clutter of people and carryon luggage their flight more than an hour away the public address announced a white courtesy phone call for scott hamilton thats for me boldt informed her you know how many scott hamiltons there are she asked the cell phones are out how else is lamoia going to reach me he cant page me by my name and what if its hale she asked stunning him what if hale recognized us not in that rain what if he did he probably knows everything about you including your love of jazz even scott hamilton what if all he wants is to flush us boldt stood eyes searching for the nearest white phone then i guess i let the caller speak first he said dont do this its what he wants hes a federal agent he can arrest us for kidnapping dont forgetwe havent reported this to anyone if hes part of this if hes trying to buy time thats exactly what hell do dont play into that she added for sarahs sake please dont play into that boldt hesitated daphne was right more often than not he met eyes with herthe public address repeated the pageand he hurried toward the white phone on the far wall lamoias talk with boldt lasted all of twenty seconds at which time he hung up and hurried toward hale whose back was to him as he approached the pay phones panic stole through him as he realized he had spent too much time trying to contact boldt hale could not be allowed to reach flemming lamoia midstride stopped abruptly as if to adjust his pant leg and slipped the stun stick out of his boot and up into his shirt sleeve one didnt step lightly into assaulting an fbi agent it wasnt the best career move lamoia reached up his right sleeve and twisted the round cap on the butt end of the stun stick two clicks to lo hale reached the phones picked up the receiver and dialed he might have been calling roger crowley chevalier judge adams flemming or kalidjait didnt matter he had to be stopped lamoia rarely submitted to panic he had been given the gift of cool as situations became more frantic john lamoia became more relaxed there was no wasted effort no wasted time in his movements no regrets or indecision hale was talking into the phonehe could not turn back the clock he could only take action over a few beers cops talked about time standing still of an eerie slow motion that overcame their situation lamoia experienced no such distortions time neither slowed nor sped up as he crossed the terminal he glanced back to see boldt approaching at a jog hale was apparently focused on his conversation the receiver held to his ear lamoia took in his surroundings aware of two couples and a family walking through the terminal to his left a teenager at the next kiosk of phones with her back to him a newsstand agent a woman twenty yards ahead manning a cash register with a view of the pay phones lamoia slipped the stun stick from his sleeve and reversed it aiming it at hales spine at that same moment hale sensed someone approaching and glanced back in time to identify lamoias face his startled eyes went white with surprise lamoia needed a clean shot with the stun stick he bought himself a diversion with a lefthanded palm slap to the phone receiver crushing the agents ear and focusing the mans attention on that pain with his right hand he jabbed forward strongly to insure the stun sticks probes made contact it fired off its jolt of voltage but hale remained unfazed and standinglamoia had hit the leather strap of the mans shoulder holster the stun stick required fifteen seconds to reset its charge lamoia thumped the outside of the mans knee with his own staggering him rabbitpunched him low under the rib cage with his left bending him and threw his right elbow into the base of the agents skull numbing him lamoia caught the man as he slumped wrenched hales arm behind his back as the phones receiver dangled and swung like the pendulum twelve thirteen fourteen he counted silently in his head he released the agent at the count of fifteen and hale grabbed for support latching onto the phone box without looking behind him lamoia warned boldt clear swinging his left arm out like a gate and stopping boldt he delivered the stun stick again this time finding the mans skin through his clothes the pulse of high voltage caused the phone to ring despite the receiver being offhookone long peal of bells echoing into the terminal hale stiffened with the initial jolt tight as steel lamoia pulled back the stick and he and boldt caught the man as he sagged you certainly have a knack for timing lamoia told boldt who looking around replied calmly his wallet lamoia slipped the billfold out of hales rear pocket and into his own boldt found the mans fbi id wallet opened it and then kept it in his left hand lamoia asked what now security boldt said you fucking nuts by now theyre already on their way boldt advised him cameras lamoia realized aloud exactly but for once let me do the talking and stay with the game damn it all me here they come he said indicating two men in gray pants and blue blazers boldt held hales id wallet open from a distance his thumb conveniently curled around the wallet and covering hales photo he knew the psychology of rentacops overly selfimportant but with an urge to play with the big boys daphne would have played to that urge and so boldt did fbi he snapped the wallet shut with a flip of his wrist and stuffed it into his inside breast pocket alongside his spd id this bozos involved in a kidnapping been posing as one of us he said in a low voice because the sagging hale was already drawing the attention of the curious like moths to a light no id on him but hes carrying boldt slipped the mans sport coat open just enough to reveal the holstered semiautomatic take that for me would you daphne would have fed their egos by giving them responsibility immediately making certain they felt included son of a bitch the one who looked like a surfer gasped he stepped forward and slipped the weapon out of the shoulder holster you mind cuffing him and giving him a hand boldt said were gonna need a little privacy here lamoia asked you got four walls and a door the two glanced at each other conference room surfer asked it isnt very big he apologized its upstairs boldt said where this guys going the rooms are a hell of a lot smaller i guarantee you that the two security guards cuffed hale and took him under both arms the man was not unconscious but severely dazed and incapable of walking or speaking he tried to get words out but gibberish and a trickle of drool took their place his feet dragged heavily boldt and lamoia followed the two security guards to an elevator and up one floor hale was assisted down the long hallway to an unmarked door that surfers assistant keyed open this okay sir he asked boldt do just fine hale was deposited into a chair boldt eyed both men now listen he said news like this travels fast and thats exactly what we dont need a little girls life is at stake here you understand that a human life he said choking on the expression its imperative that we do this quick and dirty after that we turn him over to you your story is this you saw the piece you asked for id he didnt have any you took him in lamoia said hell blow smoke up your skirt about being a fed thats his cover boldt added this girl has a chance if you lose him for a day or so until he gets his phone call someplace no one can find him you know that way no news leaks no inside information and this little girl has a fighting chance if this guy surfaces within the system surfer said we got a drunk and disorderly tank right here on airport its run by nopd but we know all those boys thanks lamoia said the two men insisted on shaking hands all around as if the four of them had just won a touch football game they left the room and pulled the door shut securely lamoia locked it looking at hale boldt said time to have a little chat chapter hales level of awareness and responsiveness reminded boldt of a man with a bad hangover jesus the man choked out coughing his eyes floated in his head like an ice cube in a glass of milk discovering his hands cuffed he struggled briefly to get free then peered out like a man half blinded its boldt and lamoia boldt informed him shit lamoia patted him on the shoulder from behind leaned in close to his ear and said welcome to new orleans what the hell he struggled again and protested do you realize what youre getting yourself into here you want to think about this a minute we have thought about it boldt said frankly weve wondered what a federal agent would be doing down here solo the field office doesnt even know youre here lamoia said are you aware of that is that standard operating procedure hale youre outta your minds lamoia told him youve been watching chevalier you ought to think about what youre doing he struggled with the cuffs you were on the phone just now with whom flemming or the pied piper is that what you think lamoia leaned in from behind and whispered hotly dont jack us around you are interfering with a federal investigation hale warned undo the cuffs im outta here all is forgotten i dont think so lamoia said boldt asked why would a federal agent not check in with his local field office you are interfering with a federal investigation hale repeated this time more calmly tommy thompson tells you about the tattoo boldt told him winning a look of surprise you do a little quick footwork if weve got the tattoo then maybe we can run down your boy the tattoo leads to new orleansof course you already know that so you get your ass down here lamoia filled in to see if anyone can follow the tattoo anywhere damage assessment you decide it doesnt look so bad but its bad enough that someone youve got this way wrong hale bleated dont screw this up goddamn it enlighten us boldt repeated hale wrestled with the handcuffs again working himself into a frenzy lamoia and boldt simply stood back and waited times a wasting lamoia said when the man calmed he and boldt moved toward the door boldt said enjoy new orleans lamoia added what little youll see of it okay okay the man shouted in disgust i came aboard in portland we know that boldt told him yeah well did you know that i was working the vegas field office the afids at the crime scenes identified taser cartridges that were purchased by a valid credit card the purchase was made in vegas so indirectly i had an active involvement with the investigation from the very start flemming and i were in nearly constant contact the credit card led nowhere we tore the residence of the cardholder to pieceslived in kansas nothing but there were no other fraudulent charges on the card none so whys somebody bother to steal a credit card and only charge one item right so we work this cardholder into the ground known associates business relationships family we had an army looking into him and its my lead on account of the vegas connection to start with and because flemming asks me to take it for him then the pied piper moves his act to la out of the blue and i get a call from the hoover building telling meordering meto maintain contact with flemming his girlfriend has vanished there are some inappropriate deposits in his account flemming boldt barked thats what im saying same reaction i had gary flemming you gotta be kidding me but an orders an order flemming boldt repeated by san francisco things are going really bad with the case and when they suddenly look a little better flemming fires the whole team claiming incompetence maybe he asks for me maybe the hoover building helped the decision but suddenly im on the team i get to see things firsthand evidence that goes east to the lab and seems never to come back little stuff but important hes not returning some calls hes not paying attention to certain witnesses certain evidence the local cops in portland do some good police work i pass it along suddenly the pied pipers on the run again then you guys even better police work i might add the holes are a little more apparent and then andy anderson flemming is fixated on anderson cant let it go has the place under surveillance has us pulling evidence without warrantsmessing up everythingand im getting nervous youre reporting back to washington this whole time im supposed to be but gary flemming am i going to sink a career like that based on a bunch of nothing its all little stuff a lot of it doesnt add up mostly because i get this feelingits a feeling right that flemming wants this asshole more than me more than anybody ive felt that too lamoia confessed right and then this tattoo you guys surfacedand come to find out the task force knows squat about some tattoo and now im really scratching my head i gotta get down here and see for myself the phone boldt asked just now you got through he nodded to hill you know captain hill he told lamoia better than the rest of us lamoia bristled flemming knew you were dicking her had me follow you more than once nice hotels boldt called out sharply to lamoia preventing him from delivering the blow he intended hes been saving it as his ace push comes to shove the task force is his all his and he woulda played that ace believe me was all set to only now youve gone and gotten yourself suspended and that messed up everything he doesnt have the leverage he might have had lamoias face flamed red hill boldt asked gave her the flight number described the suspect he said theres a nonstop from dfw to seattle arrives early tonight hill boldt asked better than giving the suspect over to flemming hale complained hed screw up the surveillance hed do it intentionally hell find out boldt said once hill deploys special opsmulwright and that mouth of hiseveryone in law enforcement in that town will know boldt said if it checks out well call down and free you as it is weve got to know before we risk the kittridge girl maybe you understand that maybe you dont get back here dunkin hale demanded loudly lamoia pulled the door shut with a thud the two security guards stood sentry nothing rough boldt demanded just give us overnight we got you covered surfer added pleased to help out lisa crowley was about to get caught in a squeeze play between spd and fbi surveillance sarah required that boldt prevent that from happening even to the point that he come to lisa crowleys rescue crowley remained his only chance of locating his daughter big amp easy charter wanted seven thousand dollars to charter a private jet to seattle boldt split it between three credit cards maxing out two of them daphne and trudy kittridge headed to houston and on to seattle as planned scheduled for a latenight arrival within the hour boldt and lamoia were airborne with crab and avocado salads and every drink on the face of the earth available to them an airphone a choice of fifteen videos lamoia watched jurassic park boldt made calls chapter listen up people sheila hill shouted over the heads of the crew assembled in the public safety buildings secondfloor squad room boldt stood leaning against the back wall the suspect traveling under an assumed alias of julie dechamps is scheduled to arrive at seatac airport in less than an hour from nowat pm she stood balanced precariously on a chair in front of a large white board that carried team names in a variety of colors of the twenty people collected in the room only a few were qualified for surveillance the rest were patrol personnel dressed in civvies to her benefit the group included patrick mulwright and a sixman special ops unithighly trained in both surveillance and hostage situationsalready on their way to seatac along with one of the departments three mobile command vehicles hill noted that bobbie gaynes was not in attendance she shouted to be heard the excitement had infected the group rumor running rampant listen up she repeated remember we dont have much of a description shes traveling alone as julie dechamps dark hair five feet six we know the bureau has established surveillance at the airport but thats about all we know flemming wants this collar for the bureau and federal prosecution obviously that does not perfectly match our picture of things a few derisive boos rose from the gathering we suspect the fbi will move to arrest the suspect once she has made contacteither physically or through communicationswith her male accomplice weve established that the feds have trapandtraced all pay phones at seatac we assume they will apprehend and arrest the suspect somewhere outside of baggage claim once she is either picked up by her accomplice or makes for public transportationsooner if she makes a phone call teams bravo charlie and zulu you have your respective assignments the bureau is without a doubt able to monitor our open communications possibly even our secure frequencies we will not have their radio traffic but they may have ours that means we use our radios as little as possible remember this they may have the gear but we know the city we are following a plan conceived by lieutenant boldt she said pointing boldt was working not one plan but two he had no intention of either the fbi or spd arresting crowley although his role at the moment was to convince otherwise he said weve worked closely with matthews as to the psychology of both the suspect and the fbi we aim to give the bureau a decoy while we stay with the real suspect its going to get confusing so stay alert team leaders will brief you on your assignments he looked them over and reminded at the troop level the bureaus people are just doing their jobs we dont begrudge them that if any of you are put into a position to put your life on the line you can trust that their agents will be there to back us up likewise for us copy that this woman is the only bad guy out there questions no good his voice cracked as he said there are children counting on us it took him a moment to collect himself he looked over at sheila hill who cleared her throat and said loudly lets go gary flemming used his considerable clout to delay american airlines flight buying his surveillance team twentyseven minutes by that hour flemming had over two dozen fbi field operatives stationed at key locations inside seatac airports concourse b eleven of these agentsan elite fbi hostage rescue unithad been flown up from sacramento that same evening accounting for flemmings delay of the aircraft eleven minutes before the delayed flight was scheduled to touch down boldt and a woman named teibold from special ops met with peter kramer a former spd sergeant who had retired and taken an executive security post with field security corporation which held the contract for seatac kramer had survived a triple bypass ten months earlier and had the fresh look of a man in full appreciation of life he had lost nearly forty pounds since the operation with another twenty to go the cigarettes that had forever been a fixture in his jovial face were nowhere to be seen by agreement the three met in the recovered baggage office of concourse c boldt introduced teibold she wore blue jeans and a creamcolored tshirt and carried a large handbag she had brown hair down to her shoulders inside the handbag was a multicolored scarf and a pair of large sunglasses we need teibold in the jetway for american oneninenine as the plane lands boldt stated oneninenine gate b concourse i know the concourse but theres the small problem of an fbi team working this same flight boldt explained task force is crumbling krames were here to protect spds interests special agent in charge is the name of flemming thats the guy kramer winced howd i end up on the wrong side of this hes in our control room hooked up to a mobile command unit parked outside you know what youre up against boldt checked his watch nine minutes we need to get teibold in that jetway no problemo kramer replied door code on b concourse is threefiveonethree ill see to it that none of my people stop her cant use the concourse boldt explained flemmings people will be all over it he asked have they put any of their people field side he checked his watch again one on each field gate nothing near the jetways i got one of my people at the bottom of the jetway stairs and youre right about the concourse its sewn up like a gnats ass how many people in your show avoiding an answer avoiding any chance that flemming might get the information boldt told the man we need to hurry krames lets get teibold into the jetway from the field side all shes going to do is exit the jetway with the other passengers unarmed unarmed you bet boldt answered what the hell are you up to boldt the man asked eyeing teibold in the process what kind of angle you working weve only got seven minutes krames seven til they land at least another five on the ramp okay he said glaring at boldt for not answering his question addressing teibold he instructed her you come with me well cross over to b field side beneath the restaurant anticipating boldts objection he added there are no field side cameras in that location flemming is monitoring the cameras its the best way handing a business card to boldt he said my pager and cellular are on there you guys on radios or cellulars boldt gave him his cellular number and kramer wrote it down onto his greasy palm what ill do kramer told him is monitor what the hell theyre up to and try to keep you posted you know theyre working with some serious radios yes we do theyre scanning cellular frequencies as well we are expecting that theyve got the pay phones covered we know you using any kind of radio code kramer asked the suspect is the truck tiebold here is the toyota direction is by compass with east as baggage claim inside one mile is a hundred feet outside a mile is a mile theyll think theyre picking up some vehicular surveillance that special ops is running pretty damn clever boldt tapped his watch krames kramer grinned opening the door he confided in teibold he hasnt changed one bit has he for boldt sarahs safety demanded he sabotage both attempts at surveillance at the same time he had to maintain continual surveillance of lisa crowley if he hoped to follow her to sarah the bird is down boldt heard through his earpiece a fleshcolored wire ran into his coat to the walkietalkie strapped to his side spds special ops communication center a black panel truck crowded with video surveillance and radio equipmentsocceyewas parked downstream from baggage claim outside concourse d boldt wore a mariners baseball cap pulled down tightly to shield him from airport surveillance cameras no tie his blue blazer and badly wrinkled khakis the concourse teemed with travelers family and friends boldt reached for a paperback book in the newsstand rack he spoke into a tiny microphone clipped inside his coat sleeve report his full duplex radio was the property of special ops and did not require him to trip a transmission button although a transmission button did exist when depressed it sent an id slug to command a flurry of clicks filled his earother spd operatives checking in sequentially thats a great read a womans voice said she stood alongside boldt dressed in a dark blue business suit and carrying a leather briefcase ive read everything by her boldt grimaced and returned the novel he didnt need a chattycathy i didnt mean to scare you the woman fired off quickly as boldt returned the novel to the rack no no boldt glanced around looking for a way out the newsstands layout floor plan trapped him a suit by the newsstand caught his eye one of flemmings this is a good read as well she said indicating a legal thriller is it boldt said trying to sound as uninterested as possible the suit at the front of the store spent a little too much time studying the pedestrians flemming had his people checking for spd operatives a chess game in his ear he heard two minutes again a series of clicks filled his head as operatives acknowledged two minutes until the plane reached the gate and the jetway beyond where teibold waited at the bottom of the steps like boldts each handheld radio transmitted a digital identification slug logged by computer in the command vehicle the incident command officermulwrightcould immediately identify who was transmitting and speaking without any name or code ever being uttered the computer also kept a running count for the ico who on that night expected twenty hits for each acknowledgment la the woman next to boldt said unprovoked just for the night business how about you actually im meeting someone boldt said lucky her she added is it a her he didnt want any small talk and yet perhaps it made him less conspicuous he glanced over her head into a convex mirror that produced a distorted fisheye view of the newsstand keeping his eye on the man out front and willing him to go away his woman friend chose that moment to tussle her hair in the process she exposed a tiny clear wire leading up her neck and into her hair boldts chest knotted tightly flemmings people had ided him he took a step forward to pass by her but she was too quick she seized his forearm with considerable strength and in an allbusiness voice said the sac would like to have a few words with you lieutenant controlled professional now she added boldt needed a clear view of the concourse to run both spds team and his own team he didnt have time for a visit in his ear one minute boldt did not acknowledge hoping mulwright would interpret his lack of a signal as indicating that he had problems again boldt eyed both the woman and the agent out front would they risk a scene one minute before the suspects arrival ill take a rain check he said i dont think so you two are going to manhandle me out of here you want to check with the sac about that she asked youre going to put this surveillance at risk oh very good boldt said youre very good thirty seconds the voice in his ear announced after a series of clicks the dispatcher called bravo one report please boldts call sign he did not report boldt stepped back from the woman and called out loudly hey you cant put that book in your purse you have to pay for it she stiffened and offered him a confused look in the convex mirror boldt saw the clerk turn the register key pocket it and step out from behind the countersmoothly and quickly he had done this before the clerks actions blocked the outside agent from boldts aisle boldt knocked loose the womans grip spun her around and gently shoved her toward the approaching clerk thats shoplifting he said boldt cut around a rack took two steps toward the front agent seized a hardback off the shelf and said loudly have you read this one he delivered the book into the side of the agents face driving the mans fleshcolored earpiece in deeply and bending him over in pain boldt hurried down the concourse knowing that flemming could not afford a scene defiant and charged with adrenaline boldt spotted a mirrored panel in the suspended ceiling and knew that it hid a security camera he offered the panel his middle finger immediately thinking about lamoia he felt better than he had in ages chapter as passengers disembarked from gate boldt stood at a bank of pay phones reminded of dunkin hale holding the phones receiver his eyes trained not on the gate but on the person in front of him boldt listened to the commentary through his earpiece bravo five a plainclothes narco cop sat facing gate a hot dog in one hand the sports page open on his lap like a giant napkin atop the sports page was a camcorder aimed directly toward gate a wellhidden wire ran from the camcorder into a small duffel bag in the adjacent chair the duffel bag contained a transmitter in the control van mulwright had a view of the gate a husbandandwife team cheered as camera flashes strobed blindingly into the mix of arriving passengersflemmings people without a doubt behind him the two agents from the newsstand stood waiting for phones by the bathrooms their attention divided between boldt and the arriving passengers flemmings presence was formidable boldt had expected nothing less bravo the toyota is just leaving teibold was the toyota command command copies bravo toyota is heading toward bravo one boldt reported in with a single click bravo ive got a vehicle approaching the toyota bravo five believed an undercover fbi agent had taken the bait and was focusing his or her attention onto teibold instead of crowley another of spds team reported two more vehicles bravo okay im looking right into the headlights of the truck the truck was crowley bravo i copy that ive got the taillights bravo seven a woman police officer in plainclothes was in the throng directly behind crowley command toyota and the truck have hit the street all report the frequency sparked with two dozen quick clicks all of the spd team knew that teibold and crowley had left the jetway and that at least a few of flemmings people had picked up the wrong scent anger filled boldthow dare he be put into a position to protect this woman who had kidnapped his child his stomach twisted bravo toyota is rolling teibold wearing a brown scarf and sunglasses passed within a few feet of boldt command bravo five rotate left please pause your other left from within the special ops command van mulwright and the others watched the video shot from bravo fives lap the cameras images were spds only look at the situation unlike flemming who had all the airports security cameras at his disposal bravo ive got the trucks taillights boldt spotted crowley then she wore a wig of short blonde hair a bandanna around her forehead covering her wound a brightly colored african skullcap on top she had used eye shadow to blacken both eyes giving her a haunting brooding lookurban sheik mixed with biker girl the blue bag doubled as a backpack and she wore it as such a different woman boldt feigned annoyance with the caller in front of himall an act for flemmings cameras he turned and glanced down the hall following crowley who kept pace with other passengers teibold dropped her purse bent to retrieve it and stepped out of the surging pedestrian traffic she dealt with a shoelace as she appraised her surroundings doing a convincing job of playing a paranoid person looking for tails the male agent from the newsstand halfway down the concourse took notice of teibold and entered the mens room out of sight boldt marveled at the professionalism of the fbi undercover unit he had spotted the couple with the flash camera now headed toward baggage claim but other than those two and the two agents from the newsstand he couldnt identify any others flemming was probably relying on the security cameras for gate area surveillance and saving his manpower for the street pros in every regard boldt worried flemmings people would not sucker onto teibold for long his cell phone vibrated in his pocket kramer whispered in his smokers voice our friends are following the toyota you copy that got it they were following teibold just as boldt had hoped how many on foot boldt asked at least seven near you boldt had missed three or more of flemmings agents that trucks working a flat tire kramer said referring to teibolds toying with her shoes affirmative back at you in a minute the line went dead warm sweat drizzled down his ribs above all in case he was being watched he had to avoid looking at crowleyhis full attention on teibold only the radio kept him in touch with crowleys movements and his one human link to his little girl daphne on her way to houston with the child and eventually to seattle had spoken to boldt twice since their separation and had correctly predicted crowleys change of disguise on the plane she had also suggested that crowley would head directly to the womens room upon arrival for another change she will take a stall close herself in sit down and settle herself she wont take her pants down even if she might have to pee because you cant run with your pants down and she is in a defensive mode shes been here before every con artist has been in a bad situation they survive by staying cool and this is one cool woman she will change her looks again itll be a fast change something simple but effective we wont know until we see it something unexpected who knows if shes really good she crawls between stalls leaving hers closed all i know for certain is that shell enter one woman and leave another for this reason the housecleaner polishing the mirror in the womens washroom concourse b was a sex crimes detective by the name of morgan blakely her call sign was bravo three crowley was reported entering the womens room as officer blakely removed her earpiece so that it would not show in doing so she isolated herself command no vehicles seen entering the car wash only the truck the resulting radio silence filled boldt with anticipation if no fbi agent followed crowley into the washroom then using teibold as bait had worked on the other hand flemming might have thought to cover the lavatories with someone inside just as boldt had time crawled women came and went from the lavatorys open entrance with no signal from blakely boldt assumed crowley remained inside within a few seconds of this thought chaos broke out at the bathrooms entrance women poured out into the terminalseveral in the midst of zipping and buttoning themselves a waft of gray smoke appeared officer morgan blakely appeared in the cluster looked frantically in all directions caught sight of boldt and vehemently shook her head no they had lost the suspect chapter lou boldts hopes for finding sarah disappeared with lisa crowley rather than storm into the womens bathroom which was his temptation he casually lifted his right hand as if to scratch his head and spoke into the mic clipped there all units in the vicinity of the car wash adopt oneonone surveillance boldt knowing that he had been made by the fbi could not participate in the oneonone surveillance for fear of giving crowley away fulfilling his ruse he charged off after teibold who was just reaching the far end of the concourse every available spd operative including blakely was to follow one of the women leaving the bathroom command assigned four agents from charliethe baggage claim and car rental teamto head toward the concourse and join the oneonone boldt stayed with teibold radio traffic blurring in his ear the next few minutes crucial he knew that flemming could not overlook the commotion at the bathroom a fire there was certain to raise the mans suspicions forced to divide his efforts he would reconsider teibold as a suspect she had gone nowhere near that bathroom flemming would out of necessity move to arrest their prime suspect teibold before that happened boldt and his team needed to find crowley because once flemming discovered he had arrested an spd operative all hell would break loose teibold passed the security checkpoint on her way to baggage claim both agents from the newsstand not far behind boldt twenty yards back teibold slowed as she approached the escalators leading down to baggage claim making a point of taking note of an empty bank of pay phones to her right boldt stepped up to a marie callenders cookie counter keeping her in sight as flemming would expect of him his earpiece sang with radio traffic as a young asian girl with bangs requested his order chocolate chip boldt told the girl he pulled out two dollars and set them on the counter teibold picked up the pay phones receiver searched her purse for a quarter and dropped it into the slot as she did this she glanced over her shoulder cautiously and spotted the agent from the newsstand her face twitched as she hung up the phone and quickly made for the escalator at the last possible second she joined a family moving toward the elevator boldt left the cookie and the money on the counter the fbi agent took the stairs between the escalators boldt increased his stride as a series of radio transmissions confirmed that crowley had once again been spotted bravo we have the truck in sight moving east bravo five and i are in pursuit command state location seven bravo approaching traffic light the security checkpoint command charlie three do you have the truck in sight charlie the purple truck bravo affirmative charlie roger that charlie we have a potential pileup at the freight dock advise the message was that the fbi agents were rushing teibolds elevator behind everyone crowley made her way slowly toward baggage claim it was the worst of all possible scenarios for boldt by busting teibold the fbi would make crowley aware of their presence at the bottom of the escalator boldt turned around to see a woman who wore a long purple dress the purple truck crowley her hair now a curly brunette she carried a gray tote bag not the blue boldt expected she looked nothing like the shorthaired blonde woman of a few minutes earlier boldt could not afford to be seen to crowley he was brad brehmer only a stubborn refusal to allow his daughters fate being put in the hands of others had put him on the concourse in the first place he hurried to a white courtesy phone and turned to face the wall his right hand coming up toward his lips boldt toyota hold your position do not move do you copy a beige cinder block wall separated the elevator from the automatic doors at baggage claim boldt stood only feet from the group of fbi agents intent on busting teibold a purple blur passed by boldt kept his face turned crowley stopped no more than ten feet from him the phone went damp in his hand as he willed her to move on in his ear spd tracked her movements command passing her from one agent to another a commotion erupted on the far side of the cinder block wall boldt could notwould notlook back at crowley as it turned out he didnt have to the purple dress entered the ascending escalator heading back up to ticketing again boldt adjusted himself turning right the commotion grew louder though the agents did an impressive job of keeping teibolds detention from becoming an allout scene seatac used a sky bridge to reach rentals and parking crowley had first headed down to baggage claim in error before reversing herself boldt waited for her to clear the top of the escalator and then jumped on for the ride only seconds behind her crowley followed signs to the sky bridge boldt followed her sarahs life relying on his every footstep one story below outside the elevator fbi agents were discovering that for the last ten minutes they had been following an spd undercover cop flemming would panic his attention certain to fall onto boldt boldt walked quickly despite the fact that it drew him closer to crowley he needed to clear the terminals security cameras they crossed the sky bridge he and his daughters kidnapper fleeing the fbi she in disguise he with his head down mixing in with dozens of other impatient travelers he glanced out of the sky bridge windows down to the taxi stand where fbi agents in blue suits hurried about checking taxis jumping onto various busesbees in a disturbed hive their blatant disregard for covert techniques informed boldt that flemming had indeed panicked two dozen fbi operatives were scrambling to salvage their operation boldt realized that he was his own worst enemy he had to break away from crowley to avoid alerting flemming and yet he had to stay with her at the end of the sky bridge he stopped and fished the cell phone from his pocket using it as a prop crowley continued straight ahead into the parking area not downstairs to rentals just as boldt had expected it was gaynes who had put him onto this over the phone she had followed the taurus from the park and ride to seatac where the driver a male had parked it on the sky bridge level and then lost her boldt took the male to be roger crowley the car having been left for his wife boldt had ordered gaynes to drill the tauruss taillight drilling taillights was something boldt had learned from an atf agent named reisnick twelve years earlier vehicular surveillance even with a team of three or four tails had less than a thirty percent success rate contrary to its representation in film and on television improved technology namely global positioning had permanently changed things but that required the surveillance team to place a transmitter on the suspect vehiclespds planned course of action in the right hands a drilled taillight was nearly as good as gps the tiny hole in the taillight emitted an unexpectedly brilliant spike of white light laserlike in its quality that could be seen clearly at a distance of several blocks or from a helicopter it singled out a vehicle from all others though less effective the technique even worked in daylight hours as the brakes were applied at nighttime it was foolproof boldts challenge was to doublecross spds attempts to follow lisa crowley and to get the suspect safely out of the airport while still keeping her under surveillance himself to accomplish this gaynes had drilled the taillight he and lamoia had assembled a motley crew that included a variety of snitches hungry for a hundreddollar hit and waiting for orders the question remained would it work chapter the taurus backed out of its parking space just as boldt reached gus griswold on his cellular griswold had been an spd informer for seven years he worked parttime as a butcher for one of the supermarket chains he lived out of the back of a ford country squire which he referred to as his mobile home you on top of this boldt asked the man you want me on top of her i thought you just wanted me to follow all snitches were wiseasses the headlights from the taurus threw long shadows across the concrete boldt spotted the drilled taillight without any problem gus griswolds rusted ford pulled out of a parking space right behind that tiny white light you see that taillight boldt asked later griswold said the line went dead the two cars disappeared into the guts of the parking garage their engine noise fading while special ops identification of crowley played out in his right ear boldt cut through a tangle of parked vehicles in the darkened garage he caught a last glimpse of griswolds taillights as the snitch followed crowley down the spiral exit ramp boldt broke into a run heading for the fire stairs aware that special ops had closed two of the three exit lanes and had placed an spd undercover cop behind the garages only open cash register window the spd plan was to fix a gps transmitter to whatever vehicle the suspect drove out of the garage rental or not the cashier was to intentionally drop the rental contract or the parking receipt as it was being passed to the driver the cashier would then quickly leave the booth as if to retrieve it and in the process slip the magnetized gps transmitter onto the undercarriage of the car from then on special ops would be able to track the vehicles movement and location electronically either from the command van or the public safety building as long as the transmitter remained within the cellular telephone network special opszulualso had four surveillance vehicles in place these vehicles called trailers were to rotate lineofsight surveillance keeping the suspect in view at all times a dozen spd patrol cars were established along the more commonly used routes awaiting instructions it was the reliance on the gps technology that boldt intended to exploit a few years earlier a similar surveillance operation might have used six or more trailers but trailers were cops being paid overtime in cityowned vehicles burning fuel and requiring maintenance a gps once installed required one technician sitting at a computer terminal studying a moving map and directing dispatch boldt raced down the cement stairs to ground level and cracked open the steel door gaining a view of the exit booths their redandwhite striped barrier arms blocking lanes with several flights having arrived within minutes of one another and only one booth open seven cars were lined up awaiting the cashier the third car back was a brown taurus followed immediately by griswolds country squire the first car paid and left then the second the taurus pulled up to the booth an exchange of radio traffic confirmed this boldt understood the level of tension inside that command van spds success relied entirely on their ability to place the gps he understood this well because the success of his operation relied on preventing it boldt looked on anxiously as the cashier reached out for the parking stub intentionally lost hold of it and then shoved his head out the booth announcing to crowley ill get it but gus griswold beat him to it having left his vehicle ostensibly to fix a wiper he lunged for the fallen parking stub like a good samaritan blocking the cashier from exiting the booth back in your car the undercover cashier ordered somewhat desperately ive got it no sweat the snitch answered passing the stub to the cashier and making eyes at crowley the gps transmitter remained inside the booth the redandwhite arm lifted and the taurus motored ahead boldt hurried past the booths the cashiers back to him and out into the dark and the drizzle the country squire passed a moment later and boldt climbed inside howd you like that shit griswold asked youre a natural boldt said strapping in the tauruss drilled taillight shining as brightly as an evening star calling him tugging at his heart leading him toward his child and her abductor the bird is not in place boldt heard in his right ear repeat the bird is not in place the dispatchers professional calm never ceased to amaze him command ordered zulus mobile surveillance units to be on the lookout for the brown taurus boldt winced at mention of the taurus without realizing the mistake command had more than likely just handed flemming everything he needed to know chapter lisa crowleys taurus followed signs to seattle via north griswold and boldt were fifty yards back and following her one stunt had been to drive around the block in an effort to spot any surveillance but boldt picked up the ruse before her second turn instructing griswold to drive past take two lefts and wait at the intersection moments later the taurus sped past silencing griswold who was at the time exercising his right of free speech they reentered traffic and followed allowing several cars to come between boldt monitoring the steady flow of radio traffic as spd attempted to keep watch on lisa crowley theyre two cars back boldt informed the griz cops yes so were fucked were challenged boldt corrected its that taillight can see the fucking thing for miles im telling ya i never knew how bright thats the idea boldt said and as he did so another idea took its place you just earned yourself a bonus griz no shit griswold sat up a little higher in the seat squared his shoulders this cop shits okay he said regarding his filthy dash littered with candy wrappers he added wish like hell this thing had a siren bernie lofgrin had used his considerable clout as director of the scientific identification division to trick the motor pool into giving him another of spds surveillance vans a steamcleaning van confiscated in a drug bust and presently outfitted with surveillance hardware acting as the gang of five dispatcher lofgrin monitored spds progress at seatac from an i park and ride five miles north of the airport the step van had full radio capabilities a cellular phone switchboard that allowed realtime conferencing between up to six separate cellular numbers digitized video surveillance and four separate computer terminals two of which were specialized for law enforcement lofgrin was like a bear in a honey jar enjoying his chance to work the hightech gadgets to where he had nearly every major component of the vans electronic arsenal working in some regard he even had the video camera trained out the back at the onramps approaching traffic a color sony playing to his left boldt called lofgrin a few minutes before eight oclock and requested he reposition the van at the intersection of and south lander in a parking lot on the southeast corner facing the traffic light boldt paged raymond his snitch who spent a majority of his time at the air strip but was on that night driving a lime green corvair with whitewalls the page went through he would be hearing back from the man within minutes in however long it took raymond to leave the corvair and walk to the pay phone lamoia was given specific instructions and told to rendezvous in the same parking lot on south lander as soon as he had switched cars with gaynes who was parked on south jackson a block from the kingdome with quick access to either i or gaynes remained on standby boldts wildcard placed well north of seatac bobbie gaynes was his last line of defense what the hell are you planning on doing griz asked having overheard the series of calls boldt didnt feel like explaining himself nor was he sure he could he finally mumbled im pulling an end run on my own people voicing his own realization of what he was doing it didnt sound right to him he wished he hadnt said it griswold knew to let well enough alone he said you ever want a quarter of beef real cheap im your man freezers full boldt said pointing he said change lanes griswold pulled out from behind the truck and accelerated past it boldt pointed back into the right lane griswold obliged him pork bellies are cheap right now my locker freezer needs defrosting if i get around to it yeah okay he reached for the cars radio you mind i listen to the sonics its the fourth quarter i mind boldt answered griswold debated turning on the radio anyway but he caught boldts eye and withdrew his hand and placed it firmly on the wheel hang back a little boldt instructed that same trucks gonna come right up my butt hang back boldt repeated firmly sweet mood youre in the driver muttered and put a sock in it boldt added he didnt know the whereabouts of flemmings surveillance crews but he doubted they were far off in the panic of briefly losing crowley both the taurus and the drilled taillight had been mentioned over the airwaves minutes later spds mobile surveillance had reacquainted themselves with crowley two cars unmarked were currently trading the tail back and forth boldt could only hope that what was good for the goose was good for the gander and that if spd took the bait he offered flemming might too he had little doubt of the fbis participation in the tail although unlike spd he had yet to identify the offenders as in so many onthefly realtime operations it all came down to a matter of timing and coordination and of luck good or bad another truck passed themsysco food servicesblocking boldts view of the pinprick taillight followed by another surge of adrenaline that swarmed his system in a flood of heat and anxiety a kind of mock flu with which he lived for weeks on end he chastised griswold not to lose the taillight not to allow himself to be passed and so the country squire pulled out and struggled to regain its position seattle drivers suck griswold said swerving and confirming his statement the sysco truck sped up preventing them from passing it boldt wondered if it was fbi and if they had made the country squire faster he said as if this might help the country squire grumbled and complained and then sounded as if a rocket had been ignited beneath it it lurched forward throwing their heads back in unison and roared ahead griswold smiled warmly and said the old girl has got it when you want it they traveled another ten minutes this way blocked by a vehicle passing it blocked again passing again car tag boldt used the cell phone to check on his troops he felt grateful for the seattle drool the light drizzle that leaked from the sky for it delivered extreme darkness and low visibility and yet was hardly the kind of weather to keep seattles homeless off the streets the closer they drew to the city the more abundant and apparent the citys nomads one or two clung to handscrawled signs proclaiming ill take any job one man sold flowers at a stoplight boldt bought a bouquet of daffodils for three bucks if anyone had been considering the country squire as a possible surveillance vehicle boldt had just shattered that image he rolled up his window confident he and griz were now off any such list for consideration what the hell you do that for big spender boldt set the flowers down gently onto the trashstrewn dashboard try to get the stink out of this thing boldt answered the car crashed through a set of potholes it felt like an amusement ride were what two three miles from the light at lander you want i do anything special when we get there boldt heard the man but only as a distant hum his words indistinguishable his attention riveted instead on the dash where with each bounce of the poorly sprung car the bouquet of flowers shook additional yellow dustpollenonto the candy wrappers he wetted the tip of his thick finger and touched it into the pile and returned it to arms length where his tired eyes could focus upon it daffodils he said softly hey you gotta give it a rest man the driver suggested arrest boldt replied mishearing they grow daffodils in skagit dont they every damn flower there is far as i know bulb flowers boldt said whatever flowers is flowers no boldt said grabbing up the bouquet and shaking it violently his hand open beneath it catching the fine mist of yellow dust that fell its tulips mostly in skagit and tulips produce all kinds of pollen but none of its yellow not this kind of vibrant yellow you see there cant be that many daffodil farms it made the fedex vehicle manifests all the more important one mile maybe stay with it boldt called liz and asked if theresa russo had dropped any papers by and before he finished with the womans name liz confirmed that she held an envelope for him a long thoughtful pause hovered between husband and wife all the unspeakable questions lingering between them unintentionally driving boldts sense of guilt to higher places were making some progress he said it was all he could think to say im praying he wasnt sure if he should thank her or not he was going to have to learn more about his wifes faith and how to respond to it the idea of a strong faith nibbled at his conscience tempting him with all he had seen all he saw in the line of duty he wondered if he could bring himself to such a place others had it worked for some as the country squire closed that last mile to south lander boldt caught himself in a state of silent vengeance not the pure faith required of him but an attempt to make a connection with something someone greater than himself and to seek partnership and to gain confidence in what he had planned not exactly prayer but he was trying is that lander boldt asked his driver indicating a traffic light in the distance thats the one he dialed lofgrin in the surveillance van as he did so he instructed griz to negotiate the country squire immediately behind the taurus griz was beyond questioning him he accelerated past several cars and then pulled in behind the drilled taillight okay were all set boldt said he looked ahead to the right and the mostly empty parking lot that included a lime green corvair and spds steamcleaning van the command van the destination of his phone call yeah lofgrin answered from inside that van do it boldt said in the next minute or two he hoped to throw both spd and flemming off crowleys scent he sat back and watched reduced to spectator frustrated tired and angry mounted to the dashboard of the steamcleaning van was a small gray box that might have been mistaken for a radar detector all fire trucks ambulances and certain police vehiclesincluding all command vanscarried such boxes the function of which was to transmit radio signals to upcoming traffic lights switching and holding the lights to green aimed as boldt had directed lofgrin engaged the box and stopped traffic on including crowley and boldt directly behind her a half mile and closing the moment the traffic stopped a goodlooking black man stepped into the street and approached the stopped traffic carrying a spray bottle in hand and several more hooked in his waist the light rain continued to fall raymond sprayed a part of the windshield of the first car and wiped it quickly he hurried around the front of the car and clearly delivered a sales pitch into the drivers window holding up the bottle for the driver to see the driver motioned him away ten seconds had passed since the light had turned red no crosstraffic in the intersection boldt willed raymond on seattle drivers were notorious for running red lights before raymond raised his rag the second driver waved him off the street person worked the windshield to the third car and the driver passed him some money boldt had been approached this same way also during a light rainthe fluid raymond was selling repelled water off the glass windshield making it far easier to see the stuff actually worked thirty seconds hurry up boldt mumbled crowley waved refusing the service but raymond went at her windshield anyway her window came open and he gave up shouting no charge no charge he crossed in front of her walked along the curb and patted her car on the rear fender to let her know he was there in a sleight of hand worthy of a magic show raymond stuck a piece of chewing gum over the drilled hole in the taillight at this same moment across the intersection the hood of a car stuck its nose out onto lofgrin allowed the light to go green and the first cars surged forward go ahead boldt told griswold but allow this car up hereyou see it to cut in ahead of us i got it a car horn sounded impatiently from behind the country squire rolled but allowed crowley to gain a cars length that was quickly filled by the car pulling out it was a dark car a nissan its shape similar to a taurus they nearly rearended the car griswold honked before boldt could stop him turn your fucking lights on griswold roared as if hearing him the car in front did just that and as the taillights flashed red a white pinprick hole appeared griswold understood the switch then and said to boldt you sneaky bastard he added he got us close like that so wed block him screen him boldt supplied so like the others dont see the lights come on the driver grinned they just see the hole in the same taillight he added whats all this about anyway its about a little girl boldt said he held his breath awaiting radio traffic to confirm the ruse anything he heard over the radio nothing yet check that affirmative ive got the target up ahead boldt heaved a sigh of relief surveillance had bought the switch as instructed lamoia waited a mile before turning off making a right onto royal brougham and immediately speeding up at th he would make a left and then would join the long onramp to with each turn going faster making sure to keep enough distance to use the darkness to hide the make of the car crowley and boldt with her climbed the viaduct the traffic thickening behind them three vehicles turned right in pursuit of the drilled taillight griz checking the rearview mirror said i dont get it arent those your guys in a matter of speaking boldt replied i suppose thats the part i dont get he said boldt gloated at his success through the rain the skyscrapers shimmered to his right viaduct traffic was clocking sixty it was fast for wet highway fast for boldt but there were no more drilled taillights to follow they had to stay close to the taurus she sure is checking her mirror a lot griz reported back off boldt ordered we could lose her back off boldt saw the nervous head movement in silhouette shes changing lanes get over griswold dropped back further and slipped in behind a limousine cant see her shut up boldt barked nervously his stomach a knot tunnel griswold said as the limousine slowed for the short tunnel further separating them this is not good boldt said not good the country squire flowed with traffic into the tunnel boldt caught a faint glimpse of taillights exit boldt shouted at the driver griswold jerked the wheel and negotiated a sharp right immediately at the tunnels end he slammed on the brakes every street every intersection was jammed with bumpertobumper traffic griswold said i told you we shoulda listened to the sonics game at least we woulda known when it was getting out who needs this shit she does boldt answered she knows exactly what shes doing chapter boldt took off on foot through the drizzle slamming the car door while telling griswold to park somewhere within a few blocks and pointing to a corner where he wanted griswold to wait for him boldt now believed that the crowleys had timed lisas flight for an arrival to coincide with the end of the basketball game and the guaranteed mass confusion that always resulted around the seattle center slip a car into any one of dozens of emptying parking garages and it would not be spotted for hours perhaps days grab a bus or go on foot with the thousands of people crowding the sidewalks it was a place and time of night to get lost crowley had been less than a hundred yards in front of the country squire when it had entered the tunnel boldt knew that if he had any chance of locating her it was nowimmediatelywhile she like them was still crushed and hemmed in by the traffic with traffic barely moving she couldnt have made it faron one of three or four streets or inside one of the two parking garages that were in plain sight the rain fell as a cold mist a gray swirling curtain that seemed to go unnoticed by all but a few of the hundreds of pedestrians boldt cut across the moving traffic horns firing off at him in volleys of protest he wished like hell that they had never plugged up that drilled taillight it would have stuck out like a searchlight he looked left right endless lines of cars every possible direction but with eastbound traffic the worstthe traffic moving toward iand with westbound traffic aimed directly at the seattle center into the lions mouth boldt chose straight ahead the sidewalks were more packed with pedestrians than the streets with cars he threaded his way through and around groups couples families all gabbing about the game and a great shot at the buzzer that had won it for the sonics the mood of the crowd was festive even carnivallike although he was polite at first boldts patience wore thin quickly and he began to bump and claw his way through the melee his efforts unappreciated he craned over shoulders stole his way to the curb hoping for sight of the taurus whereas the teeming horde walked boldt ran faster and faster driven at first by curiosity and finally out of desperation he would not see sarahs chances swallowed by a crowd would not write her off he charged through the elbows the bumps and the complaints a man driven by love and a fear of the future he had spent over twenty years in the company of victimshe knew their fate he would not become one at the intersection he looked right straight left and then started the process again right straight ahead left searching shapes and colors the cars all looked the same he realized in shape and styling so little difference existed lamoia a gearhead might have spotted the taurus might have singled it out from the lexus the toyota the nissan but to boldt they blended homogeneously into a moving parking lot of identical vehicles the light changed and driven at the front of the pack boldt found himself caught in the current of pedestrians carried across the street like a pile of snow in front of a plow he would later think that prayers are often answered in strange ways there is no voice from heaven no finger pointing the way only unexplained coincidences that coincidentally happen to follow moments of prayer pushed across the street by the throng boldt stepped up onto the curb and saw the taurus in traffic five cars away he could even make out a small black blob raymonds patch of chewing gum on the taillight crowley behind him and to his left he heard a car door open and shut a group of teenagers formed a knot in the sidewalk in front of him he took avoidance maneuvers and ran smack into another man like hitting a brick wall he apologized but the brick wall remained firmly in his way he stepped back to untangle himself and looked up into the eyesthey were dead eyesof special agent in charge gary flemming they wrestled briefly locking forearms with matched grips flemming the larger more powerful man the crowds flowed around them barely paying them any mind fight a kid shouted forget about it boldt said struggling glancing around furiously through the mist for flemmings backup its my investigation now flemming announced shaking him like an angry parent its my task force not hills i took over in boise its irrelevant boldt conceded he wondered about what hale had told him if true he was looking into the eyes of the pied pipers insider his accomplice a traitor hundreds of people streamed past most oblivious to the weather the taurus inched forward in gridlocked traffic the rain in the headlights swirling like oil in water youre within my jurisdiction boldt reminded this is my city it seemed possible that flemming might have gained control of the task force and if so the investigation was indeed his its outcome his to bend break or detour but boldt remained proud of seattle and his own place within it youll follow orders lieutenant youve run investigations you know the importance of boldt managed to yank his right arm free reached in for his id wallet and pressed it into flemmings huge open hand wrong flemming glanced down at the id wallet nice try he attempted to pass it back boldt threw his arms in the air and said no harm no foul the investigation is all yours he inched his way to flemmings left and into an area of clear sidewalk that had formed around them like an eddy behind a rock in a stream he turned his back on the man and took a tentative step forward flemming roared over the noise of the passing crowd she celebrated her birthday in captivity the words froze boldt he turned and said not yet she hasnt stephanie flemming told him eyes shifting nervously among the passersby im talking about my daughter you arent married boldt said have never been married he corrected drawn to the taurus he couldnt keep his eyes off it flemming was not one to look away from following sarahs abduction boldt had looked into the private lives of the various members of the fbi team only hale was married and a father only hale had made sense as a candidate for the pied pipers insider everything was turned around he backed off taking another step toward the taurus which had crept even further down the street he wasnt going to lose that car again he threw his hands in the air and said youve got to shoot me flemming you want to stop me that comment won him some extra room from the pedestrians gun a shrill voice called out the pace of the crowd picked up but it did not scatter as boldt expected flemmings hand was indeed stuck inside his sport coat flemming explained loudly shes white boldtmy woman we never married no we thought it a bad idea for both of us our daughter was twoandahalf when this monster took her he said clearly i know about sarah that is i suspected i didnt exactly know until right now boldts knees felt weak he sagged sarah flemming knew not possible he mumbled to himself the taurus slipping away the ransom demands were violated he felt comfortable with flemming as a traitor flemming the victim was all too unreal for him six months of abduction impossible to survive such a thing flemming he wondered had hale lied to protect his own interests or was this a smoke screen to allow crowley to escape kiss and make up some punk kid with green hair shouted at them flemming said they sent you a video clip on cdrom hell i didnt even know how to work with one of those things saw it for the first time in a computer store he insisted how would i know that think about it an insider would know this as well as a victim by posing as a victim flemming had frozen boldtexactly what he would want to do the taurus eased ahead in traffic boldts hand found the butt of his sidearm his index finger pried loose the velcro tab that secured the weapon he glanced over his shoulder do you know her name flemming asked the driver who is she nice try boldt thought convincing as all hell the powerful man with a small federal army assigned to him playing the naive victim flemming stepped closer boldt looked around for the mans agents then late in doing so expecting they might be closing in on him too many people to tell flemming said you want to follow her im with you but you know the rules no suspects in custody or i never see my daughter again i know the rules boldt answered out of energy out of time he could still reach the taurus if he ran i even played by them for a few days it seemed like a month ago we follow and we see if our kids are there flemming proposed follow only for the first time boldt heard the mans calm penetrating baritone break riddled with grief and uncertainty for a moment he actually allowed himself to believe the man which was no doubt exactly what flemming wanted flemming said my team is chasing the car you substituted same as your people but you i followed you and that piece of shit ford boldt searched the area again still no sign of agents could flemming possibly be telling the truth boldt said confidently i have one stop to make and ill know where shes going some paperwork was left with my wife i can find the place bullshit the man was unnerved no bullshit anderson could have told you if you hadnt killed him flemmings jaw quivered his eyes hardened and went cold he looked into the stream of pedestrians as if debating to shoot boldt right there and then his eyes flashed darkly toward boldt who explained the choke hold you put on weinstein lefthanded same thing killed anderson i should have made the connection right then i it boldt wished the mans hand out from inside the coat but it remained he said you want to shoot a cop in the back in front of a couple hundred witnesses thats your choice he turned and ran for the taurusfor lisa crowley stuck in trafficthe rain beginning in earnest flemming caught up to boldt a few yards from the taurus both men at a run ill take the drivers door you take the passenger flemming said we need her alive i know that as the traffic surged forward again the two split up boldt cut behind the taurus and hurried to the passenger door locked he called out to flemming just prior to the agent presenting his gun and shield to the drivers window fbi open the door the car lurched forward but only a matter of feet before slamming bumpers with a mazda flemming shot the rear tire screams errupted from the sidewalk boldt stayed with the passenger door he pounded on the side window with the butt of his gun the safety glass cracked but held an enraged flemming reached across the front windshield and aimed his weapon directly at the drivers head no boldt shouted understanding the temptation we need her out flemming shouted to the driver lisa crowley popped open the door hands where i can see em flemming hollered he said to boldt ill cover you cuff well take my car boldt came around the vehicle he tugged the womans arms behind her with more force than was necessary he squeezed the metal around her wrists an incredible anger burning through him it felt incredibly good to feel the metal click into metal lisa crowley you are under arrest for the kidnapping of trudy kittridge stephanie flemming and sarah boldt you have the right the words caught in his throat tears stung his eyes to remain silent you have the right to an attorney if you cannot afford an attorney flemming ran through the miranda effortlessly together the two men led the handcuffed woman down the sidewalk against the flow of pedestrians horns sounded behind them frustrated at the parked taurus flemming finished the rehearsed piece and then said now let me tell you something crowley where youre going those rights wont do you a damn bit of good because youre going with us he met eyes with boldt and the two men understood each other perfectly boldt said its over but his words fell flat for he and flemming it was only just beginning chapter lamoia drove east on i well over the speed limit maintaining a decent lead on the surveillance cars that trailed behind him he cringed as the rain lessened to sheets of gray mist for he feared the nissan would be seen to have taken the place of the taurus at which point the surveillance net was certain to collapse upon him en force dividing his attention between the road ahead of him and the cars behind he thought for a moment about the road of life he traveled and how little time he spent thinking about the future his affair with sheila hill had awakened him to wanting more than raw physical relations and he considered putting some distance between that relationship and his next to solidify his notion of john lamoia in the past it had been one bed to the next one pretty face to the next in a long chain of women that rarely went broken by more than a week or two the damn kidnapping case was getting to him he decided at last he wanted children a family a future outside of himself he was for the first time in his adult life tired of john lamoia he didnt like himself the red flashing lights appeared in his rearview mirror simultaneously one vehicle directly behind him the other partially blocking the highways center lane it felt as if they had gained on him in a matter of seconds pedal to the floor he stretched it out for half a mile letting them sweat whether or not they faced a highspeed chase then he signaled and pulled over he thought the signal a nice touch just wait he thought until they find out who theyve pulled over he wanted to see their faces he could hardly wait chapter the contents of the envelope left for him by theresa russo lay scattered across the front seat of flemmings town car along with a map of skagit county liz had passed them through the passengers window with a simple kiss to boldts cheek a suspicious glance at the driver and a look of hatred aimed at lisa crowley handcuffed in the backseat they drove with the windows partially down delivering a wet heavy air little more remained to be said they had decided on a course of action they intended to see it through regardless of the outcome millie wiggins address in haller near bitter lake proved difficult to find after several incorrect guesses on boldts part the town car drove into the paved driveway in the pinnacle point subdivision flemming locked the parking brake and kept the car running a moment later the front curtains parted an expectant face peered out into the dark and the front door opened the detour while not costly in time offered the unlikely partners substantial longterm risks that if taken to their limit included imprisonment but the cop in boldt had overruled the father for the first time in weeks and he accepted that as progress in blue jeans and a green flannel shirt millie wiggins looked nothing like she did while running her day care preschool she hurried down the brick walkway carrying an umbrella open over her head and called hello from a distance boldt signaled her around to his side of the car as she stepped up to boldts window she bent over and studied flemming boldt said calmly just a yes or no is all we need you must be definite there must be no doubt whatsoever even a hint of doubt and id rather you say no he hesitated they needed probable cause to ever hope for criminal charges without the chance of criminal charges boldt feared it would quite possibly come down to killing this woman strangely he felt no remorse at the idea he told wiggins you know you dont need to do this no one is forcing you to do this i understand im sorry but we cant open the back door youll have to look from here thats fine flemming switched on the cars interior light illuminating the woman in the backseat boldt rocked his head to the side affording her a better view and millie wiggins stared long and hard unknowingly in the act of determining boldts future she blinked repeatedly nervous and under the strain of his requirement to be definite he appreciated the difficulty of her task having been through countless lineups himself youve taped her mouth shut she was a little noisy boldt said it isnt easy without the mouth do your best the hairs a different color wiggins said close enough to boldt that he could smell wine on her breath he said nothing waiting patiently for her to remember the rules flemming had yet to speak yes she said strongly delivering boldt a jolt to his system he hadnt realized how good it could feel how different for the father than the cop youre positive she was in her uniform of course wiggins said assuming boldts passenger to be a cop but thats her she looked directly into boldts eyes thats the woman who picked up sarah thats her she asked what has she done crowley protested from behind the duct tape she squirmed and writhed and then settled down do you always tape their mouths you wont see that on tv flemming said he popped off the brake and put the car in reverse he had not wanted this stop had agreed to it only in negotiation for boldts sharing the contents of the fedex delivery manifests boldt leaned his head out as the car backed up and addressed a stunned millie wiggins standing in her driveway beneath an umbrella with rain cascading from its rim only our most difficult suspects he informed her he thanked her and got the window up the headlights spilled over her throwing an enormous shadow against the garage door you see we didnt need her flemming protested repeating an argument he had beaten to death you knew you had the right woman flemmings silent rage terrified boldt he was glad to have the man talking by his own admission for six months flemming had attempted to piece together any evidence that might lead him to the pied piper while at the same time continually compromising the public investigation now that boldt had done his job for him the man seemed hellbent on handling the crowleys in the same manner he had handled anderson the end justified the means boldt who understood such reactions who empathized with them found himself defending the suspects rights and wondering how far flemming might goif he too might end up a victim if he crossed the man in the name of probable cause boldt had just tricked flemming into buying himself a second witness and both men knew it perhaps flemming even understood it though he was difficult to judge millie wiggins and liz along with her could place crowley and boldt in that car both women had taken good long looks at flemming cross over to i on th boldt said theres an onramp off fifth avenue it doesnt change anything flemming warned letting boldt know that he understood everything if you fuck this up if you cant find this place ill pull her eyelids off and drip battery acid in them until she talks until she tells me where i can find my daughter and if you even think about trying to stop me he didnt bother finishing the threat flemming was played out any ability to reason in him long since exhausted he had waited for this day for six months and boldt or no boldt he knew what had to be done boldt had tried to use anderson as a bargaining chip reminding flemming that no evidence linked him to the mans murderimplying boldt would not make a case of it if flemming played this right but flemming was numb from the neck up lacking any concept of prison terms or punishment he simply didnt care he wanted his daughter back nothingno onewould come between him and that end pressured into an alliance of which he wanted no part boldt found himself an unwilling passenger he might as well have been handcuffed and in the backseat himself the interminable drive north on i left boldt referencing the fedex manifests and plotting delivery routes for march on or about twelve noon creating small boxes on the map with arrows to the appropriate location darkness outside darkness inside the rain obscuring the windshield his own fears obscuring his efforts boldt decided to speak directly to the issue there were questions to answer and he had no way of knowing if he might be around to hear them later without backup anything could happen he said to the driver according to hale the hoover building thinks you may be working for the pied piper hale knows hes been spying on you ever since your girlfriend disappeared and your bank account grew the big man nodded a man defeated the moneycashwas deposited in fivethousanddollar amounts into my account she he said pointing toward the backseat and their prisoner knew it would appear that i had misplaced loyalties that i wouldnt be able to explain the deposits and of course i wouldnt have been able to so they had my child and my career i sent gwen away the minute they got our child told her not to surface believe me he added shes under so deep no one will ever find her unless im involved she could support your story you just might get yourself out of this its stephanie i care about not me stephanie first the rest comes later the rest hardly matters yes i know boldt replied you no money just my child flemming confessed they had me use email to supply the information they requested i tried to trace it back to a source but they knew their stuff bogus accounts bogus credit cards paying for those accounts so they knew when to pick up and leave flemming nodded again though reluctantly and with a heavy heart i misled and delayed the investigations as best i could when it got away from me i sent off a warning and they packed it up me boldt asked did you give them me was it you who ided the local cop to go after it was the road whined the wipers lapped at the water id like to apologize for that but i cant flemming said i did what i thought i had to do he admitted softly i worked constantly to id them if i had managed it would have stopped right there i would have seen to that as we will see to that tonight he said stealing a glimpse at the prisoner in the rearview mirror youre a better cop than me boldt is that what you want to hear i want to hear how you could volunteer another persons child boldt whispered hoarsely flemming said nothing you gave them my daughter and id do it again in a heartbeat he admitted he switched the wipers to high the rain was too loud to think boldt knew intuitively that following andersons murder flemming had settled on killing the crowleys as the only form of justice perhaps it was only by seeing such a thing in another that boldt could exorcise it from his own thoughts but he wanted no part in it death was too easy for the crowleys and chevalier a life sentence in a maximum facility where the inmates would not tolerate any crime to do with children seemed a far more appropriate sentence boldt wanted this done legally correctly he wanted millie wiggins on the stand and chevalier in manacles he wanted daphne called as an eyewitness to lisa crowleys babyselling he could see the logical steps toward conviction he continued to plot delivery times onto the map so flemming asked a while later shattering the monotonous grind of the wipers and interrupting a bass solo on the radio four delivery trucks servicing skagit the twentyfifth at noon two were on lunch break two still delivering i have one truck delivering at and again at the second truck made drops at and two stretches of road to search for a house that sits up a slight knoll a tree directly outside how many miles of road flemming asked boldt took rough measurements twenty to thirty all together its too much flemming told their hostage you could simplify this studying her in the rearview mirror but as did boldt lisa crowley assumed the driver intended to kill her no matter what she did flemming had played his cards far too early not thinking anything of it she had only her husband to sacrifice by cooperating she would not talk unless flemming resorted to torture perhaps not even then in a way difficult for boldt to grasp he felt sympathy for this woman his daughters abductor after weeks of wanting her dead himself he had agonized for the better part of the last hour over his strange association with her an usagainstthem mentality directed at flemming and including lisa crowley nothing surprised him any longer there was no room left for such luxury chapter the small brick town of mount vernon washington spread out almost entirely on the eastern banks of the skagit river had served as a timber course for the better part of half a century until every stand of oldgrowth forest had been cut to the ground stripped of its branches and skidded and floated to the mills throughout the winter the river pushed against its banks swelled by weeks of rain or unseasonable snowmelt from the east sometimes jumping and driving the residents to band together in a pitched and fevered battle lacing together lives in a way only shared disaster can for millennia those same seasonal floods had driven silt and topsoil out across the surrounding plains fertilizing and enriching the soil combined with the mild season offered up by the pineapple express ocean currents it made for thousands and thousands of acres ideally suited for the cultivation of bulb flowers little holland the area was called more tulips were produced here than in any spot on earth boldt tracked the second hand of his wristwatch flemming drove boldts selection for the most likely route between the two deliveries drove five miles an hour over the mph speed limit knowing fedexs tough policy for its drivers drove from a point marked on boldts map as am following a southerly arrow and a line finally joining a box indicating pm flemming drove the entire route although boldt was guessing the delivery van had driven a minimum of five miles before the noon hour and therefore restricted their area of intensive search to a fourmile stretch roughly threequarters of the way along the route believing that in order to have been captured on video the delivery truck had passed the crowley safe house somewhere along that same fourmile stretch given the direction of the delivery route and the direction of the fedex truck in the video the safe house had to be on their left boldt impatiently studied the homes they passed annoyed and frustrated that the farmhouses were few and far between along the fourmile stretch that boldt had highlighted they passed only six homes not one of which was close enough to the road to explain the fedex trucks presence in the video nor did any of the six houses sit up on a slight rise also apparent in the ransom its a strikeout boldt said checking his watch flemming drove the same route back toward mount vernon his eyes divided between the road the houses and crowley in the backseat the tension in the car built as boldt sensed flemmings desire to beat the truth out of crowley he doublechecked the route of the second delivery truck measuring and approximating the timing its about a threemile stretch he said we drive the whole route the rain let up and the swiftly moving clouds raced east as if a curtain had been drawn moonlight streamed down onto the surrounding tulip fields bleeding lush colors into the black of night every available strip of asphalt gravel patch and turnout was occupied to overflowing with rvs and westfalias the annual tulip festival under way mount vernon swelled with thousands upon thousands of tourists with only a few hundred beds available between bed and breakfasts and motels most of the visitors slept in and lived out of their vehicles during daylight hours travel by car bordered on impossible given the location the bumpertobumper traffic often moved less than five miles an hour the fields of color spread out like quilt patches a quarter mile square even in moonlight the sight was breathtaking yellow reds deep violet noticing all the traffic pulled off for the night along the roads shoulders flemming said to the woman in his rearview mirror planned it this way didnt you mount vernon the festival the crowds and all who would notice a couple of renters this time of year with her lips taped shut the hostage said nothing caught in the faint glow of ambient light her eyes seemed heavy and sad fatigue caught up to her and dragged her down depression set in boldt realized it was all but over for her he wondered silently if the safe house was better off left undiscovered he was debating intentionally misleading flemming when the man tugged the map off boldts lap and struggled with the wheel and the map light a moment later he said okay a left up here then another left at the tracks then across the bridge and were basically at the first delivery twelve minutes later your daughter is on the video as this truck passes behind her have i got this right he asked aloud were approximately twelve minutes from finding this safe house he drove faster lets shave a little off of that shall we he said to the mirror you better say your prayers that we find it if my friend here is wrong about all this then its my turn and believe me ive been waiting for this he said ive got a cattle prod in the trunk a couple other little toys phosphorus stun grenades all courtesy of the us government you ever had a stun stick light up your private parts while youre half blind and completely deaf id be thinking about that if i were you you can save yourself a lot of grief boldt here gives me thirty minutes with you in one of these barns you wont know what hit you sweetheart and youll be talking a blue streak believe me mention of the weapons brought boldt a step closer to realizing the task before them of primary importance was to keep flemming screwed into his socket but of equal concern was that their daughters were in that house under the watch and care of roger crowley besides his sidearm and the stun stick flemming had pressure and phosphorus grenades but the latter were useless with kids in the picture stun grenades could rupture a victims sinuses and eardrums if detonated too close phosphorus grenades occasionally did permanent eye damage in the process of momentarily blinding a suspect they were also on record as having set a great many structural fires flemming sounded eager to use his toys boldt would not allow that the man was a greater liability than their passenger there flemming said pointing out a white house to their right thats the delivery that house right there by hes made shes made twelve miles boldt answered correcting the drivers gender so she was going at a decent clip highway boldt reminded naming the state highway its probably posted at fiftyfive flemming picked up the speed and boldts heart rate right along with it sarah was somewhere within a few miles he felt certain of it his palms sweating he took back the map measured distances and checked street names flemming glanced at his watch somewhere past here isnt it yes within the next five miles on our left again the driver said correct boldt checked the hostage hoping to see some faint recognition in the womans eyes but she was either in shock or in complete control of herself he saw nothing at all a smug vacancy that made him fear they were nowhere near the safe house the miles ticked on not one of the houses had a decent size tree planted close enough to a central window to qualify again the property lining the roadway was dead flat not elevated as had clearly been the case in sarahs video im not liking this flemming said no boldt agreed i got a hunch your little theory stinks the driver said he glanced into the rearview mirror i think were wasting our time he added weve got all the answers we need right there you may be too weak to stomach it but im not ive waited six months for this drive it again boldt said what for those houses werent even close maybe another route boldt said vamping for time maybe i got the route wrong turn around flemming hung a uturn but drove fast and make that kind of time no you picked the right route that delivery truck had to be doing forty or fifty to make it to that next drop by twenty after twelve its your theory thats wrong fuck the fedex truckshes a witness goddamn it an accomplice weve got an accomplice in the backseat and there is no way under heaven i wont get her to talk shell be telling me her life story if i want her to and any chance of conviction oh bullshit does sarah care about conviction do you are you honestly going to go boy scout on me here you gonna explain that to your wife to sarah forget about it nice try no sell you want this as badly as i do admit it you dont give a shit about this scumbag in the backseat about conviction you want justice same as me believe me justice will be served he stopped the car in the distance in the moonlight a barn shimmered in a dark field of cutflower stems that without their blossoms reminded boldt of long rows of thin soldiers looks good to me flemming said he rocked his head to look at crowley he looked half mad how bout to you chapter flemming took the car keys as he climbed out and boldt lost any hope of stealing the car and the hostage while flemming walked back to the trunk the fedex truck was not theory he reminded himself but evidence it had appeared on that video clip and was as such irrefutable evidence the video included a piece of a noontime cnn program and the cable carrier had been identified as serving this community with only four trucks delivering on the twentyfifth two of which were down for lunch break boldt had set his sights on locating the safe house and recovering sarah by dawn seattle time hale would be releasedif he hadnt been alreadyand the chevaliercrowley connection exposed and sarahs ransom demands failed he glanced at his watch then at the trunk coming open and finally back to the fedex manifest at which point it hit him he came out of the car in a hurry i knew youd come around flemming said collecting pieces of his traveling arsenal from the trunk including a shotgun the driver took his lunch hour boldt said offering the map flemming slapped the open map away eliminating two of the four trucks no boldt contradicted thats where i had it wrong look at this manifest the first drop after the lunch break is south of la conner he paused flemming wasnt interested he explained the driver took his lunch in la conner not mount vernon flemming looked up from the trunk now it was indeed all theory but boldt was loathe to admit it he drove from mount vernon to la conner right at lunchtime we ruled him out when we shouldnt have that fourth truck was on the road at the same time more theories enough theories were running out of time here you know that you pissed off dunkin and hes going to fuck this up for all of us without knowing it theres no more time he jabbed the map his index finger nearly poking a hole through it its within this sixmile stretch has to be how long for you to walk her out to that barn and get down to it why bother he slammed the trunk handed boldt the car keys and said you dont get it do you its no bother he wore an armored vest neck to groin he looked like a killer there in the moonlight pockets bulging the shotgun in his right hand happy hunting he said first man to find crowley and the kids wins boldt toyed with the keys between his fingers think this through i have the low sonorous voice carried so much authority it was difficult for boldt to argue when i find it boldt asked if you find it you know where to find me he looked out across the expanse of harvested flowers toward the distant barn im not a monster boldt he said reading his thoughts im not after her he indicated the backseat im after my kid but unlike you im not afraid of how to get there he pushed past boldt and opened the door to the backseat took lisa crowley by the hair and dragged her from the car standing her up her injuries lent her a defeated look her empty eyes found boldt and he warned flemming you push her too hard in that condition and youll kill her mores the pity flemming said he took lisa crowley by the arm and led her into the field she offered no resistance willing to sacrifice herself for her husband boldt stood there frozen by the sight of the two ghostly figures shrinking into the enormous field of black that gladly swallowed them a moment later the town car sped away his imagination impossible to contain boldt spent the drive envisioning the activity in the barn knowing full well that flemming had every intention of following through with his threats and that the man would enjoy it far more than he had been willing to admit perhaps even to himself flemming would kill her without meaning to he would be left with a second murderthis one with a witness and too much evidence to overcome how he would then choose to deal with boldt remained uncertain to all concerned the enormous number of cars parked along the roads gave the night an eerie feeling as if scores of people had deserted the area in a mass exodus boldt took a dirt road shortcut saving himself five minutes and coming up to his suspect stretch of road from the backside as he approached the paved intersection another dark field of headless flowers enveloped the landscape to his left several feet of which had not been harvested he slowed and rolled down his window drooping dead daffodils their heads slumped toward the pungent earth in silent prayer kept vigil by the side of the road it told boldt that the entire fortyacre parcel had quite recently been a sea of daffodils in bloom yellow daffodils he thought yellow with yellow pollen knee height in the distance a cluster of small sheds and the western slant of a metal farmhouse roof glowed a wet pale gray in the moonlight the dead field rose slowly toward the outbuildings and boldt recognized immediately that the rise would elevate the farmhouse above the paved road boldt steered the town car through a left turn and drove at a decent speed to avoid arousing suspicion a large sycamore standing surprisingly close to the upcoming farmhouse spread its branches luxuriously over and down the small knoll toward the paved roadbed still a hundred yards off boldt knew intuitively that a large window would exist immediately behind that tree that the living room walls inside would be painted a cream yellow he knew the positioning of the furniture inside and the name of the man who had locked and now guarded its door and that this same man ached to see a brown taurus pull into the driveway and a woman climb from behind the wheel he was to be disappointed that night this man who stood sentry the taurus was never to come boldt drove past the dash lights dimmed his eyes fixed on the road not allowed to wander or stray toward the farmhouse to his left he had seen all there was to see from the outside he needed inside now and he needed lisa crowley in one piece boldt ran through the moonswept field toward the distant barn the cut stems of the headless flowers slapping at his pants legs his shoes engorged with wet sticky mud so that his legs weighed ten times their normal the faster he tried to run the heavier the mud the slower he moved he stopped and scraped the richsmelling earth from his shoes soiling his hands in the process as he came upon the barn he listened into the stillness for her voice hoping for any such sound at all greeted only by the silence he sank into a pit of despair confident that the only card they held was the life of lisa crowley that her husband would cut any bargain to save his accomplice from torture and death flemming had jumped the gun boldt checked the three doors he could find and finally knocked on the huge barns wood door gray from decades of weather flemming must have had a peephole for he removed the wooden bar and opened the door without a word spoken boldt stepped inside and stopped cold a pale flashlight beam stretched from a tractors tire across the barns aisle to a large square post that helped support the hayloft above lisa crowleys bare back and naked buttocks caught the light looking like a side of beef hung in a freezer her clothes were strewn in the dust and dirt of the aisle flemming had looped the cuffs over a rusty spike pounded into the cedar post well above head height stretching her so that her toes just barely touched the dirt floor her head sideways boldt could see the left side of her face smashed and swollen from the car accident he walked toward her slowly flemming had removed the tape from her mouth and had stuffed her underwear there so she could make noise if she so chose and he could evaluate her information by simply removing the underwear restuffing her if he went unsatisfied the bright red blotches from the stun stick glowed violently red near her breasts and across her buttocks and the backs of her thighs a dozen or more dress her boldt said disgusted with the man were just getting warmed up ill do it then boldt said approaching her i found the house it was exactly as i said the driver took his lunch hour in la conner he drove past the farmhouse shortly after noon on no particular route unlisted on the manifest removing the womans underwear from her mouth he told her im going to help you get dressed im going to lift you now he stepped behind her and reached his hands up under her sweating armpits leave her flemming had hold of the shotgun in his right hand its barrel hanging toward the dirt floor but its presence very much felt by all his eyes revealed a man void of thought or reason revenge had sunk its teeth into him and he had tasted its blood he wanted more i found the farmhouse boldt repeated then we dont need her flemming said step away her damp back pressed to his face boldt still supported her im taking her down he said flemming engaged the shotgun in a sound all too familiar to the cop he faced boldt gave another heave and crowleys bound hands came free of the spike she crossed her arms in front of her bare chest in modesty her breasts riddled with stun gun burns and sagged to the dirt cowering under the threat of the shotgun boldt pushed the underwear into her hands crouched close to her placing himself between her and flemming and said gently dress yourself hurry she struggled with the underwear boldt snagged the purple dress flemming had torn the arms out to get it off her boldt helped her into it the black hole at the end of the shotgun barrel boring down on him and tied a ripped length of fabric behind her neck to cover her chest he turned to flemming and said were going the three of us were going to get our daughters no shes our bargaining chip if youre going to kill her at least wait until weve used her to get our girls back dont throw them away for the sake of some score that can never be settled boldt wondered how daphne would have handled the situation she understood the flemmings of this world he thought and then boldt realized that with flemming being a cop he understood him as well knowing the answer boldt asked how many years do you have flemming looked confused with the bureau how long the mans expression sobered how many agents black or white look up to you model themselves after you save it and the violins let her go and step away you discharge that weapon and well never make it to that farmhouse a community like this forget it sheriffll be all over us before we make it to the car this appeared to register on the mans face boldt held crowley ever closer indicating the variety of weaponry that flemming had laid out on a hay bale boldt said collect that stuff we may need it crowley leaned her weight into him weak her stretched and cramping legs unable to support her boldt turned his back to flemming and walked her out of the barn chapter boldt cut through the field of headless daffodils bent at the waist staying as low as possible hoping to avoid the glare of the moonlight the investigator in him knew that he was in some form or another retracing footsteps taken by andy anderson some weeks before mindful of andersons fate boldt paused randomly and sank down into a crouch like a swimmer ducking into a wave his decision to leave crowley alone in the car with flemming had come with great difficulty but better that he had decided than leave it to flemming to approach the farmhouse gun happy and crazed with the thirst of revenge flemming felt more like a time bomb than an ally boldt hurriedthe fuse to that time bomb was lit and burning the warm night air carried the promise of summer and the faint scent of the millions of tulips that ran for mile after mile on a different night the twostory farmhouse would have looked picturesque to him glazed in moonlight clustered in a nest of outbuildings as boldt drew near he used those sheds as a screen abandoning his crouch and running fully erect he and flemming held many advantages not the least of which was roger crowleys expectation and anticipation of his wifes arrival although not a taurus the town car would work to that end with proper timing it was for this reason that boldts cell phone was already dialed to call flemming awaiting the simple touch of the send button his chest pounding from a combination of nerves and the run up the slope boldt ducked around one shed and then another he carried two stun grenades and a phosphorus bomb in his sport coat flemming had retained the stun stick and the shotgun the downstairs of the farmhouse was lit up like the fourth of july every window ablaze boldt stood in the lee of a shed carefully studying what lay behind each window toward the back a kitchen empty toward the front a living room empty the upstairs remained dark and boldt knew from his own exploration of the pied pipers surveillance points that the man preferred the higher ground the darkness and seclusion of a pair of curtains partially drawn in the end it came down to a string of decisions for boldt and flemming none of which held any guarantees all of which carried tremendous risk for their two daughters they lacked a taurus they lacked manpower time their one hostage was weakened to the point of near unconsciousness their adversary held a farmhouse elevated for good security no doubt fortified and containing two of the most precious people on earth boldt considered special ops and spds emergency response team wondering if he would have dared put sarahs life into their hands if he attempted to sneak inside but gave himself away sarah would go from kidnap victim to hostage of primary importance was knowing crowleys exact location all else was secondary as the mans location represented the degree of threat to their daughters boldt moved around the shed in shadow reemerging on the structures other side with a different and improved view of both the kitchens interior and that of the living room both still appeared empty roger crowley the pied piper was somewhere upstairs in the dark boldt pulled out his cell phone and pressed the send button initiating the signal he waited to hear it ring through and hung up seconds later a pair of headlights rounded the far corner of the fortyacre field and motored slowly toward the farmhouse boldt pressed himself flat against the damp wood and waited chapter flemming pulled the town car into the gravel driveway and quickly shut off the engine and headlights boldt realized an unexpected advantage they held the sycamores grandeur obscured any view of the driveway from the farmhouses second story for all crowley knew the taurus and his injured wife had finally arrived boldt heard the mans descending footfalls through the wall of the house as crowley hurried down a set of back stairshe had taken the bait he appeared fleetingly in the kitchen then passed into the living room boldt stepped farther into the light straining for a better view and winning sight of him by a far window then gone crowley reappeared at the front door as he opened it a crack and craned his neck to get a view of a taurus that wasnt there the kids were being kept on the second story away from a random sighting by a curious tourist within reach of crowley as he played sentry in the dark by exploding toward a reunion with his wife he had left his flank open boldt hurried to close it he cut to his left crouched and ran across the damp recently mowed lawn the smell of which wafted up and overwhelmed his senses he delicately climbed three steps at the rear of the house and slid an eye to the window he was watching crowley who in turn was focused on the driveway and the car parked there his heart beat frantically sarahs face floated in his vision he could feel liz there with him like a warm coat he wanted to kick the door and run upstairs his weapon in hand he stayed frozen in place one eye glued to the windows dirty glass thump he heard the car door shut he switched the gun to his left hand and dried his right palm on his pants leg returning the weapon to the proper hand he heard another car door shut followed by flemmings deep voice and crowley let the front door swing open as flemming demanded there just beyond the front door and slightly to the left bathed in the spread of lamplight from inside the house boldt saw flemming leading lisa crowley up the lawn under the tree holding her by the hair his sidearm aimed into her right ear boldt kicked the back door dove to the kitchen floor and aimed his weapon onto roger crowley hands in plain sight boldt shouted crowley froze boldt repeated the command even louder hoping the sound of his voice might call his daughter to him crowleys arms jumped and his fingers laced on top of his head you got him boldt shouted got him flemming answered face down motherfucker arms out straight ahead roger crowley the pied piper collapsed to the floor boldt came to his feet and charged the man flemming held the sidearm aimed into the front door the handcuffed lisa crowley on her knees gripped by her hair no cars coming from either direction boldt checked the man and found no weapon on him not even a penknife daphne had been right about that con artists by trade the crowleys abhorred violence clear boldt shouted go boldt hurried through the ground floor of the house checking every room every closet every hiding place large enough to hold a twoyearold girl downstairs is clear he reported out the door basement and upstairs to go theres no one here roger crowley complained his face pressed into the plank flooring who are you what do you want a convincing performance ever the con man shut up flemming bellowed upstairs he shouted to boldt ever the commanding officer boldt ran back into a kitchen he had already searched located the narrow stairway and took it two treads at a time the dormered roof held two cramped bedrooms and a shared bath three closets a chest of drawers a green metal steamer trunk he checked the closets first no longer breathing despite a heart attempting to rip from his chest he held to the doorknob unable to turn it to open it for fear of what he would see inside anything he heard flemming shout he twisted the doorknob and pulled empty the next room the same he stood then over the steamer trunk he had worked crime scenes before with bodies in steamer trunks women usually folded up molested dead he couldnt see his daughter that way he couldnt find her like that it was not something a father could live through he kneeled and sniffed the seams of the trunk cedarlike a breath of fresh air he threw the trunk open blankets clear he shouted heading directly into the basement the small cellar lit by a single bare bulb held a washer and dryer that had seen better days tools a workbench and a clutter of broken bicycles lawn chairs and a doll collection boldt stopped held in a trance by the shelves of dusty dolls if the girls had spent much time there the dolls would have been put to good use his heart fluttered and he became conscious of his breathing againslow like a man dying he struggled up the stairs one heavy foot after another his gun hanging lifelessly at his side walked into the living room to the front door and trained the gun at crowleys head wheres my daughter he asked his voice breaking his eyes stinging crowley cowered under the threat of the gun boldt he said dryly im boldt sarahs my daughter he glanced up into the room the gun still aimed at the mans head she sat in that chair he said while your wife shot the video we can make a deal crowley offered a trade he proposed a trade flemming shouted in a bloodcurdling tirade my wife our freedom for the girls your wife flemming bellowed ill give you a fucking trade he let go of her hair stepped in close to his hostage trained the gun at her head and pulled the trigger lisa crowley slumped back and fell into the grass nooo crowley shouted raising up onto his arms and met there by flemmings weapon his body shook as he wept bawling on the floor it wasnt enough for boldt to see this man grovel he squeezed the trigger putting a round into the floor inches from the mans head where is my daughter flemming occupied the entire door a gargantuan his weapon aimed directly at crowleys head you want a trade your life for our daughters but times up fella he hesitated you got a god you better say goodbyeor hellowhichever it is a home crowley shouted jesus christ you killed her home boldt and flemming said nearly in unison flemming added say good night motherfucker he stepped closer to the downed man yours he said to flemming is in san diego he sniveled a home for abandoned children he met eyes with boldt yours is in seattle capitol hill homeless children we put them into the systemyour system we knew youd never look boldt raised the gun to where the bead settled on the mans right ear his weak arm began trembling the bead dancing across the mans headtemple ear cranium sarah had been available to him all along a few blocks from public safety the crowleys had used the very system that had refused them an adoption you had better kill me too crowley said to flemming suddenly much calmer because so help me god ill testify you did that in cold blood boldt laughed aloud and flemming followed the two men with their guns still aimed at the pied pipers head they laughed and suddenly sobered nearly at the same moment you stupid shit flemming said to the man im a cop he looked up at boldt im not allowed to go around killing people much as id like to sometimes crowleys face contorted i stunned herlefthanded i might add aimed the piece clear of her head shell be awake in twenty minutes crowley muttered finally making sense of it you conned me takes one to know one lou boldt said chapter daphne circled the interrogation table in room athe boxlike a hawk after a snake boldt had brokered a deal with hale who won chevaliers arrest in new orleans as an fbi collar in return for his silence concerning his overnight in an airport drunk tank with chevalier under federal lockup crowley had been appointed a little pencil of an attorney a man who looked about eighteen years old a man who did not know how to handle a woman like daphne intimidated by both her looks and her powerful sense of control crowley dismissed him electing to take daphne on alone he chose to do this in front of her to make a statement about control she continued to circle changing strategies attempting to find a jumpingoff point she lived for such moments her concentration ever intense she nonetheless found herself required to push away thought of owen adlers invitation to dinner in the georgian room at the four seasons olympic he had said it was a celebration dinner but she intuitively expected more the presidential suite perhaps a ring on her left handthe same ring she had returned to him a year earlier her life moved in arcs and she felt certain that arc was to rejoin her with owen but not now she willed finding her way back to the dismal room and the sad excuse of a man handcuffed at the table if you are pacing out of nerves crowley said calmly pray continue when you feel up to it well have ourselves a talk if you are trying to make a statementyoure free to move around i have my ankles shackledsave it been there done that i know where im going do you youre goodlooking but youre single you have a body and a face that men fall for but something keeps you out of serious relationships and i bet that something is you you are your own worst enemy arent you they are never good enough for you are they never quite live up to dear old dad do they afraid to take them home are we she should have expected this from a con artist of his accomplishmentshe could see into his marks and knew which nerve to strike without second thought it was an instinct with him she had prepared herself for a kidnapper not the man crowley turned out to be she chastised herself for this she wanted a confession she didnt want the trial left only to evidence some of which had been compromised through the behavior of the gang of five she said the pied piper of hamelin was caught you knew in advance that you and your wife would be caught if you continued you could have stopped but you didnt that fascinates me of course i fascinate you youre what the staff shrink not a detective are we you dont have the attitude you see youre curious the detectives think they know it all of course im fascinating to you we both make our living by looking inside people hmm the only difference is that i see whats really there you youre a phony she grinned at him though it didnt come naturally she guessed at peoples secrets this man seemed to know them in advance he made no reference to the kidnappings or his crimes steering the topic back to daphne she wanted that confession you put lieutenant boldts child into a home what made you think that would work i see you more as a mistress someones mistress it leaves the door open doesnt it always open easy to walk out get your jolliesyoure a hell of a ride arent you but sleep in your own bed thank you very much the attack struck home and daphnes only defense was an immediate rebuttalfocus his attention away from her she had played the role of mistress with owen adler she owed him more than that she countered i think i would pose as a social worker your wife too a team is more effective more believable i deliver little sarah to the institution saying that her parents are dead a cop and his wifewhat a car accident that the child hasnt been told yet that im looking for closest living relatives i need her taken care of for a week or two maybe a month or more something like that if the child is capable of communicating her surname or that her father is a cop or an fbi agent her comments will not draw reactions from her keepers because they know she hasnt been told about her parentsthats the key to the deception i would think the child is still in the dark about all this they will placate her patronize her but ultimately shes a victim of the system which was just what you wanted shell be looked after treated well and in the case of bowler in portland and who knows how many others like him when all is said and done once youve packed your bags you can return as the same pair of social workers pick up the child and deliver him or her back to the parents nice and clean how am i doing she saw perfectly well that she had guessed accurately crowleys complexion went the milky white of the acoustical tiles overhead or maybe not a social worker a cop a pair of cops you used that at the day care center i dont know that it matters you didnt answer me about your being a mistress i was right about that wasnt i youre the teflon woman you never stick to anyone you get close to she fired back you want to discuss relationships good glad you brought it up your inability to have children its your problem isnt it not your wifes lisa is fertile isnt she and yet no kids i bet a man like you made her go through a dozen tests while all the time knowing that your seed was at cause your seed is dead isnt it like you you cant admit that can you dead seed dead man shut up knowing she had scored a direct hit she withheld any selfcongratulations she wanted him on record as confessing the crimes she hurried you dont want kids anyway its lisa who wanted them not you they would only get in the way of your brilliant career tie you down take your wife off the team leave you working alone what fun is that the fun is showing off for her isnt that right for lisa showing her how good you are what a liar you can be no audience whats the fun its not the money you spend any money you win because you want her to need you again you want to keep up the game its all about the game the confidence game it owns youthat thrill of deception or maybe shes the one with the brains i bet thats hard for a man like you a man with dead seed to accept that your wife is more clever than you she came to you with the plan didnt she she wanted to kidnap a baby and keep it absurd he protested it was her plan she fired off thats bullshit she wanted a child badly enough to steal one and you saw your life in flames if she pulled it off we both wanted that child but you people took him away from us why because wed served some time so what so you got back at the system damn right she knew that to beat him she had to con him exactly as boldt and flemming had done she saw only the one area of vulnerability and decided to exploit it making assumptions that were only that she wanted the baby but you couldnt live with that it was you who suggested to give other women what the two of you had been denied i dont see you as the compassionate type but i have a hunch it was your idea nonetheless why because it was another game you didnt want a baby underfoot you didnt want your precious team broken up give your wife children to take care of but keep the game alive she leaned her hands onto the table and said confidently as if every word was knowledge not guesswork what if i go next door and tell your wife that all those tests she did were for nothing all that equipment up inside her all those doctors the drugs the grief that very early on you lied to her about the results of your own fertility test because you couldnt live with the dead seed inside of you that youre shooting blanks now and that you always were and that everything she did was for nothing maybe we should test you how about that how do you think shes going to feel about that level of betrayal you think she wont give you up thats lies maybe it is maybe it isnt she added it makes a hell of a story doesnt it one im sure shed pay particular attention to you you cant do that i can do anything i want she corrected she waved her hands in the airhis were manacled why else would you talk her out of keeping the first baby you made her think it was her idea didnt youselling them to women like her you conned your own wife you never stop do you how often did she ask you to end the kidnappings and keep one of the babies to make a life with her and you always had a reason for her didnt you always a reason waiting on the end of your lying tongue she wanted the money just as much as i did crowley objected confessing for the first time their involvement in the kidnappings daphne felt a triumphant surge of adrenaline he shouted angrily she wanted the kid to have all the chances all the opportunities the schools the clothes the whole nine yards bank a million bucks for ourselves and then keep a kid of our own and youre wrong about me not wanting our own he caught himself if he could have rewound the tape and erased the last few sentences he would have but instead he stared at daphne and a grin slowly stole over his thin lips and his sweaty face rose into a smile that gave way to laughter he tried to communicate something to her through eye contact but the message was lost on the volume of his laughter and the keen concentration in his eyes he stopped laughing maintained the eye contact and said i think ill take that attorney now so noted she said the comments were as good as a confession as she placed her hand on the doorknob roger crowley conceded well done daphne hesitated there a moment knowing that boldt and flemming had had the chance to kill this man to bury him in a tulip field never to be found she looked back at the man in the orange coveralls and steel handcuffs they should have killed you she said opportunity is the name of the game roger crowley said back to her chapter hows my hair what hair boldt answered the wig stupid its fine miles held tightly to his fathers neck clutching to him like a drowning man to a lifeboat after only a few yards of controlled walking liz and boldt broke into a run at the same time their speed having little or nothing to do with the rain as it began falling and everything to do with a parents excitement liz laughed into that rain part primal scream part cry chin up mouth catching the drops it was not the voice of a dying woman her husband noted this woman alongside of him was very much alive i cant stand it she shouted in glee boldt endeavored to speak to say something to answer his wife to acknowledge her but his tears mixed with the rain and his eyes blurred and he reached out for her arm like a blind person wanting guidance this woman had guided him through so much reluctantly he left her disease to her and her god willingly he turned over his soul and heart abandoning the isolation he had felt since her hospitalization if she died he would come to terms with that in the meantime he would hold no part of himself in reserve would seek no shelter in moods or in his work he gave himself back to her freely and of his own will miles shouted his sisters name for the small girl stood in the gothic doorway of the institutions entrance jumping up and down on both feet a black social worker at her side they hurried up the stone steps splashing puddles of rainwater like small explosions at their feet miles calling her name liz reaching straining forward to touch her daughter they came together then a family a rich embrace that for boldt defied time or description the momenta single moment in time he had been living for not a bit like anything he had dreamed or imagined something else entirely better little sarah cried for days off and onmonths if measured in fearand boldt would listen painfully as his wife attempted to soothe the child with that calming voice of hers each sob stabbed his heart viciously and unforgivably up and down the west coast a dozen other children sobbed this same way clutched tightly in their parents embrace most too young to know the source of their tears too young to ever remember clearly the days weeks or months of separation they had endured but lou boldt remembered in the darkness of a room without lights a haunting tenor wailing from the stereo he sat in the corner blinded by a consuming guilt that would not pass he picked up the phone and called lamoia to his house thirty minutes later the reinstated sergeant stood in boldts music room not a wrinkle in his jeans not a dull spot on his steel gray ostrich boots you rang lamoia said he had regained some of the weight the suspension had cost him he looked good nothing new there you hear the engagement is back on i heard surprised happy for her will we lose her lamoia asked genuinely concernedhe the man who often battled with her its possible but not forever she cant leave this forever its in her same as you and me the anderson case is still not cleared lamoia reminded we cant get a confession out of him crowley didnt do anderson boldt informed him flemming did lamoia stood perfectly still jesus crowley spotted anderson while out on that run he got a message to flemming telling him anderson was taking pictures that something had to be done flemming knew that for his daughters sake anderson had to be shut up flemming used his fbi id to get him through the front doorive got to admit that fooled me threw me off i thought it had to be someone who knew anderson or had a relationship with him he claims he went there to convince anderson that he had it all wrong arrest him if necessary but that anderson knew he was onto the pied piper and that he got arrogant about it things went bad andersons neck ended up snapped flemming covered himself and he just walks its your investigation yours and gayness you have any evidence linking flemming to that kill you want to prosecute it youve changed sarge yes im a lieutenant now boldt said but he was a father most of all and he knew what flemming had endured for those six months the man had announced his retirement he would go into security work somewhere ride out the next fifteen years being bored behind a desk how much more did society require of him boldt rose out of the chair and switched some buttons on the stereo he pushed play on his cassette deck a series of familiar tones filled the room not quite music know what that is boldt asked his former detective telephone tones move to the front of the class so what lamoia asked umm boldt muttered guilt was a difficult cross to bear but more difficult to break i needed you he explained or he thought he did i trusted you i needed you you need a valium is what you need word is youre coming back to the shop next week tech services wiretapped every member of the task forcetheir phonesfor me i ordered it when after sarah he hesitated but before your suspension boldt rewound and replayed the telephone tonesa long string of tones with a few equally long pauses it took me forever to figure out the code i broke it when i realized the first numbers were your pager tech services actually theyre the ones that filled in that blank you tapped hills line lamoia barked in astonishment not listening clearly you tapped a fucking captains phone line a touch of reverence he glanced around embarrassed by the loose tongue youre outta your gourd he whispered then the realization boldt had awaited finally cascaded over lamoias face as he added the information together his brow tightened and his mustache and mouth sagged into concern you the sergeant asked incredulous she told me that she was going to assign you the accident in boise you outright astonishment i couldnt allow that i needed to shortcircuit flemmings plan to steal the task force and preserve you for my team for new orleans for sarah you bastard yeah i know silence hung between them and with it boldt feared their friendship as well lamoias record would forever be blemished it was an unspoken rule that a suspension even though cleared by review affected an officers rate of advancement forever miles cried out lamoias name from the other rooma childs shrill peal of pure pleasure a moment later sarahs tiny voice echoed the same delight john lamoia grinned lifted his head shut his eyes and drank in the sounds like sweet perfume you bastard he said offering boldt his back and hurrying into the room to play with the kids
