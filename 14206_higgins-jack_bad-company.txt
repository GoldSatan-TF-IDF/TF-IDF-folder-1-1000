jack higgins bad company book in the sean dillon series for amber on the morning of april two junker s loaded with tank ammunition managed to land in the center of beleaguered berlin on a makeshift runway constructed from a city road russian artillery was pounding the city hard and within a few days it would be the end of the third reich and hitler would be dead by his own hand the junkers were not the only planes to land that way that same day luftwaffe general ritter von greim flew in to berlin in a fieseler storch accompanied by air ace hannah reitsch von greim became badly wounded however and reitsch took over and managed to land the plane on east west avenue near the brandenburger tor von greim promoted to field marshal left again the following day in an arado piloted by reitsch there are reports of many other light aircraft at that time leaving berlin using streets as runways legend has it that martin bormann himself the most powerful man in germany next to hitler escaped to norway that way to join a uboat bound for south america and there is another legend one even more extraordinary the story of ss sturmbahnführer baron max von berger who escaped in a fieseler storch taking off from east west avenue shortly after the führers marriage to eva braun and carrying with him hitlers most enduring legacy daunceyvillage west sussex london it was raining when they buried kate rashid countess of loch dhu a rain that swept in across dauncey village like a solid curtain sending people hurrying for the shelter of the church they were all there the great and the good to say farewell their cars blocking the high street general charles fergusons daimler had just arrived he sat in the rear with sean dillon who took a silver flask from his inside pocket swallowed a little bushmills whiskey and lit a cigarette are we going in no ferguson said then why are we here its the civilized thing to do dillon its a great story after all the worlds richest woman crashing into the sea off the english coast at the controls of her own plane her cousin rupert mysteriously disappeared he leaned back you couldnt improve on it if it was a madefortelevision movie dillon took another swig from his flask ive said it before but its the coldblooded bastard you are general really i thought that was you dillon all right but i repeat if were not going in what are we doing here patience dillon im waiting for someone and who might that be well for starters a good friend of yours a mercedes rolled in and braked behind them and here he is blake johnson emerged ran through the rain and scrambled into the back of the daimler great to see you general he took dillons hand and you my fine irish friend and where in the hell have you come from dillon demanded the white house of course blake was in his early fifties his hair still black and an exmarine he was also director of the white houses general affairs department though everyone who knew it which wasnt many just called it the basement in actuality it was the presidents private hit squad totally separate from the cia the fbi the secret service or any other governmental organization dillon was intrigued but what are you here for ferguson ignored him is it true about the baron yep just announced the president ordered me straight to you general and here i am and whos this baron creature when hes at home said dillon youre about to find out ferguson said a rollsroyce pulled in at the church gate a uniformed chauffeur emerged got an umbrella up and opened the rear door a young man in his early thirties emerged a trench coat over his shoulders and hurried to the other door and waited the man who stepped out was very old wore a black leather overcoat and slouch hat and carried a silvertopped walking stick the young man held the umbrella over him offered his arm and they went up the path to the church there he goes blake said dillon frowned who is he baron max von berger ferguson said an exceedingly rich man and as blake has just confirmed none other than kate rashids silent partner rashid dillon said just a minute are you saying berger as in berger international thats right but theyre worth billions exactly and they now have control of rashid investments unfortunately so well dillon said and paused that could be a problem the rain hammered on the roof organ music swelled from the church blake said why does it always rain at funerals its the way hollywood does it dillon said its life imitating art who was the hard man the one escorting him blake nodded interesting you should call him that its the broken nose blake id hate to see what was left of the man who did that to him ferguson joined in the name is marco rossi he studied economics and business at yale then joined the italian air force and flew a tornado in bosnia youd have a lot in common with him dillon he was shot down and had a very energetic time behind serb lines very unreasonable people the serbs but then you know that his mother once worked for the baron she was born in palermo and yes her uncle one tino rossi was mafia in a very big way dillon said so whats young marco up to now it was blake who answered amongst other things hes taking over all security operations for rashid investments worldwide dont kid yourself sean this guy is good hes not to be screwed with even on the pavement he shrugged ive even met him on the social circuit in washington hes charming and civilized and the women love him only dont push him the wrong way ferguson said when he was on the run behind the serb lines in bosnia he killed at least four men that we know of he keeps an ivory madonna in his pocket when you press the button the blade jumps out and shears right up under the chin ferguson smiled thinly your kind of man dillon so if hes taken over all the security operations at rashid investments that means that he can access everything the rashids ever had on us in their computers exactly ferguson said including how you shot kate rashids three brothers and interfered rather harshly in their oil operations in hazar and i do think hes going to find it more than a remarkable coincidence that kate rashid subsequently went into the drink at the controls of her black eagle and her dear cousin rupert vanished off the face of the earth so theyre going to be coming for us oh yes dillon i should very much think so he reached into his briefcase and extracted a large envelope youll want to read all of that especially the bit about what von berger did in world war two thats especially enlightening he leaned back yes dillon i think were in for a very very interesting time of it berlin the führer bunker april if there was a hell on earth it was berlin it seemed to be on fire a charnel house black smoke drifting everywhere the city was doomed everyone knew that and the russians were already in control of the eastern half the people were on the move refugees from their own city carrying what they could a few pitiful belongings with the desperate hope that they might somehow get to the west and reach the advancing american army groups of ss were stopping anyone in uniform those without a pass or some sort of order were shot on the spot shells were dropping in fired at random by russian artillery people cried out in alarm and scattered sturmbahnführer baron max von berger sat in the front passenger seat of a kübelwagen the german equivalent of a jeep he had an ss corporal driving a sergeant in the rear seat clutching an mp schmeisser machine pistol as they moved along the wilhelmstrasse close to the reich chancellery they saw three ss soldiers with two men in civilian clothes on their knees about to be shot von berger told his driver to halt stop he said what is your authority for this the men paused their leader a sergeant had a brutal unshaven face he took in von bergers black leather coat and the young face and failed to notice the knights cross with oak leaves and swords under the collar of the coat and who the hell are you sonny sturmbahnführer von berger the smell of brandy was powerful at your age you look about nineteen i bet you stole the uniforms you and your mates here he cocked his schmeisser lets see your authority oh i can show you that max von berger took a luger from his righthand coat pocket and shot him between the eyes the sergeant in the rear of the kübelwagen sprayed the other two as they turned to run the two men who had been faced with death got up in a daze and von berger waved them away clear off he turned to his driver carry on the kübelwagen turned out of the wilhelmplatz and into vorsstrasse and approached the reich chancellery which was like everything else a victim of the bombardment defaced and crumbling it had long since passed functioning as any kind of headquarters but under thirty meters of concrete was adolf hitlers last command post the führer bunker it was a selfsupporting subterranean world complete with electricity fresh water and extensive kitchens still in touch with the outside world by radio and telephone and crowded with people like bormann and ribbentrop and numerous generals all trying to avoid the harsh reality that thirty meters over their heads the third reich was coming to a disastrous end the vehicle ramp was ruined but there was room to park the kübelwagen to one side the ss sergeant got out and opened the door for von berger quick thinking herr baron a reflex karl its been a long war you didnt do too badly yourself he got out reached for a briefcase turned and walked to the two ss sentries at the bunker entrance they sprang to attention sturmbahnführer one of you deliver this to major general mohnkes aide its the report the general wanted on the state of number two brigades readiness for the final assault one of the men took it and went downstairs von berger turned to the other and clapped him on the shoulder find me a drink i got shot in the left hip last year and some mornings it hurts like the devil ill be in the garden the boy went off on the double and von berger said come on karl and went round to the oncelovely garden now a wreck with some trees uprooted the occasional shell hole there was a sadness to the place for what once had been and for a moment the artillery seemed like only the sound of distant thunder on the horizon he took out a cigarette case selected one and karl hoffer gave him a light a tough hard young man of twentyfive hoffer was a forester from the barons great estate in the forest of holstein heath the schwarze platz the dark place theyd served together for four years so my friend were in a fine fix arent we we were in stalingrad too but we made it out baron not this time karl im afraid we might have to take up permanent residence i wonder what its like at home he was thinking of schloss adler above the village of neustadt it had been his family home for seven hundred years a huge expanse of forest dark and mysterious dotted with villages every inhabitant a member of the extended family of which he was the head have you heard from the baroness hoffer asked i had that letter four months ago but nothing since and you just that one from my lotte in february she mentioned the baroness of course lotte worked as her maid at the schloss von bergers father a major general had been killed during the polish campaign in thirtynine elevating max suddenly to the title of baron his mother had died at his birth the only woman in his life was his beloved elsa and they had married early because of the war like von berger she was twentythree and the boy little otto was three years of age the young ss guard appeared clutching a bottle and two glasses im sorry herr baron its vodka im afraid max von berger laughed id say thats rather appropriate but youve only brought two glasses the boy flushed well i did put one in my pocket sturmbahnführer the baron turned to hoffer see how well we train them he took the bottle jerked off the cork then poured liberally into one of the glasses and tossed it down he gasped god that hit the spot the russians made this one in the backyard he poured another which went the same way great take that for a moment karl baron von berger removed his leather greatcoat and handed it to hoffer suddenly my hip feels fine he poured a third vodka and gave the boy the bottle back now you too he got a cigarette out of his case onehanded the glass of vodka in the other hoffer gave him a light and the baron walked away enjoying his smoke and sipping the vodka hoffer and the boy had a quick one and poured another the boy was fascinated by von berger my god his uniform ive never seen anything like it hoffer was wearing combat camouflage gear he shrugged ive got the same thing under this lot except for the medals he grinned the medals are all his in spite of his youth baron max von berger had seen action in poland france and holland with the waffen ss afterward hed transferred to the st ss paratroop battalion and been wounded at malame in crete then had come rommels afrika korps and the winter war in russia he wore a gold badge which meant he had been wounded five times in spite of the silver deaths head badge on his service cap and the ss runes and rank badges on his collar he was all fallschirmjäger in flying blouse and jump trousers tucked into paratroop boots luftwaffestyle though in field gray the goldandsilver eagle of the paratroopers qualification was pinned to his left breast above the iron cross the knights cross with oak leaves and swords hung from his throat karl hoffer said hes special people the baron weve been through four years of hell together and were still here maybe not for much longer the boy said who knows in stalingrad we thought wed had it and then right at the end we both got wounded and they put us on one of the last planes out three hundred and fifty thousand men went down the drain and we made it out at that moment general mohnke appeared from the garden entrance of the bunker he ignored them and moved toward von berger baron the führer wants to see you max von berger turned puzzlement on his face the führer yes at once von berger paused beside karl and held out his glass karl filled it and von berger toasted him to us my friend and the three hundred and sixtyfive men of the battalion who died for whatever he tossed the drink back and threw the glass away so general he said to mohnke lets not keep the führer waiting he followed the general down a flight of steps the concrete walls damp with moisture soldiers mainly ss were crammed in every nook and cranny of the apparently endless corridors and passageways there was a general air of despair more than that resignation when people talked it was in subdued tones against the background of the whirring electric fans that controlled the ventilation system the soldiers only stopped talking at the surprising sight of max von berger in his immaculately tailored uniform medals aglow they passed through the lower levels that housed most of the führers personal staff goebbels and his family martin bormann and many generals mohnke still led the way but von berger knew exactly where he was going for he had been there before in the garden bunker was the führers study as well as a bedroom two sitting rooms bathroom facilities and a map room close by and convenient for the constant conferences mohnke knocked on the door and went in von berger waited there was a murmur of voices then mohnke returned the führer will see you now he grabbed the young mans hand your comrades of the ss are proud of you your victory is ours a slogan initiated by goebbels in one of his inspired moments and the subject of much ribaldry in the ranks of the ss in any case von berger couldnt imagine what he had done to cause such adulation youre too kind general not at all mohnke was sweating and looked slightly dazed he stood back and von berger passed into the study the führer sat at his desk leaning over a map he seemed shrunken the uniform jacket too large for him the face seemed wasted the eyes dark holes no life there at all his cheeks hollow a man at the end of things the young woman beside him was an ss auxiliary in uniform she held a sheaf of documents which she passed one by one for hitler to sign with a shaking hand her name was sara hesser she was twentytwo years of age and had been pulled in by the führer himself to act as a relief secretary he glanced up at her deliver these ill see the baron in the sitting room you can then bring the special file to me is it up to date as of last night my führer good he stood up follow me baron he shuffled ahead opened the door and led the way into the first sitting room he sat in an armchair by a coffee table baron max von berger sturmbahnführer of the ss you took a holy oath to protect your führer repeat it now von berger clicked his heels together i will render unconditional obedience to the führer of the german reich and people adolf hitler supreme commander of the armed forces and will be ready as a brave soldier to stake my life at any time on this oath hitler nodded in satisfaction you have a magnificent record for one so young and yet you never joined the nazi party why not it didnt seem appropriate my führer a typical response from the head of a great family the aristocrat to the end and yet you served me well why was that its a matter of honor my führer i took the oath just what i thought youd say youre a remarkable young man i sensed that when i decorated you with the swords thats why i made you an aide i was saving you youd be no use to me dead and thats what would have happened if youd returned to the front max von berger took a deep breath what would you have me do my führer the most important task left to anyone in this bunker the russians are coming they want to cage me and i cant have that my wife and i will commit suicide no no dont look like that von berger the important thing is my work must continue and you will play a part in that the most important part by his wife he was of course referring to his mistress eva braun whom he had married around midnight on the th we must see that national socialism survives that is essential we have vast sums of money not only in switzerland but in south american countries sympathetic to our cause many of my emissaries are already in the argentine and brazil we must maintain the kameradenwerk the action for comrades there was a knock at the door and sara hesser came in a briefcase in one hand hitler waved her to one side i have no secrets from sara as you will see so where do i fit in my führer hitler raised a hand the führer directive sara hesser opened the briefcase extracted a sheet of paper and passed it to von berger who read it with some astonishment it was explicit the führer bunker april the bearer of this pass an aide on my staff is sturmbahnführer baron max von berger on a personal assignment from me all personnel civil and military will render him every assistance adolf hitler this may help you hitler said for max von berger the implications were breathtaking but in what way my führer to get through whatever happens to you in the next few days to help you get home to survive and prepare yourself for your inevitable capture by the americans or british von berger was bewildered but there are no americans here my führer only russians you dont understand listen during the last few days many planes have flown in from gatow and rechlin using streets such as the east west avenue near the brandenburger tor as runways field marshal von greim came in the other day in a fieseler storch max von berger struggled to control himself the only reason for von greim to come to berlin was to be promoted to head of the luftwaffe the führer of course could have told him on the telephone instead von greim had flown in from munich escorted by fifty fighters and forty of them had been shot down he said patiently and how does this affect me i spoke to the commandant of the luftwaffe base at rechlin a pilot has volunteered to fly you out in a storch it has already arrived and is waiting in that huge garage at goebbelss house the heavy rain and steam from the fires will make it an ideal time to go but to do what my führer hitler put out a shaking hand and sara hesser put the briefcase on the desk when the war is over industry will collapse and so will your familys company berger steel eventually though things will start to improve and especially for you in here you will find details of deposits in switzerland code words passwords which will give you access to millions youll build berger back into a power von berger was speechless that is not all hitler opened the briefcase and produced a book bound in dark blue i have kept a diary for the past six months a time in which everyone has betrayed me goering himmler he shook his head and no one tried more than me to be reasonable i even sent walter schellenberg to sweden to meet roosevelt s representative did you know that no of course you didnt i offered a negotiated peace to combat the red menace am i the enemy no it is that dog stalin together the us and germany we could have smashed him but no my offer was rejected the americans will reap the whirlwind believe me the russians will not recognize what they have taken the damage they will do to berlin is beyond anyones comprehension yet roosevelt and eisenhower have decided to hold back after the elbe crossing patton and his tanks could be here in twentyfour hours but theyve been told to stay where they are in obedience to stalins wishes and allow the reds to take berlin my god von berger said believe me in the years to come america and britain will rue this as their greatest folly and it is all in my diary every day i have dictated it to fraülein hesser you may notice the trembling in my hand an unfortunate ailment that has plagued me for some time but i have signed each entry so what do i do with the diary my führer there will come a time when it will be of use to advance our cause i do not know when but you will baron you will be its keeper it is a holy book baron i want no copies your oath on that protected at all times you may read it if you wish you will find the account of my dealings with roosevelt particularly interesting he shook his head i have every belief that you will achieve this for me and baron max von berger a great soldier and a brave man but who had always despised the nazi party for some reason felt incredibly moved the young woman put the diary and documents back into the briefcase and handed it to him hitler said so you will leave within the next hour because of the bad weather may i take my sergeant with me von berger asked of course you can also take fraülein hesser he glanced up at her she said no my führer my place my duty is with you so be it hitler stood and held a shaking hand to von berger strange not even a party member and yet i chose you von berger shook his hand strongly i accept the task it is a matter of honor on your way we shall not meet again sara hesser went and opened the door max von berger the briefcase in his hand paused and turned and the sight of hitler hunched at his desk was to haunt him for his entire life my führer he gave a military salute hitler gave a thin smile even now you cannot bring yourself to give me a party salute you touch your cap like a british guards officer im sorry my führer oh go on just go hitler waved his hand and sara hesser closed the door on the baron he found his way back up the crowded passageways and through the garden bunker where he found hoffer and the young ss soldier sitting under a concrete awning in the entrance drinking the rest of the vodka while it rained relentlessly hoffer stood up baron were getting out karl believe it or not but were going to get out but how sir von berger took him to one side ive been given a special mission by the führer theres a light plane waiting im not saying more but were going home were going to holstein i cant believe it well its true give me my coat and get some weapons he turned and the boy said youre going sturmbahnführer von berger smiled and clapped him on the shoulder whats your name boy paul schneider then ill tell you what paul schneider instead of waiting to face death at the hands of the russians you can come with us fly to the west and surrender to the americans i cant believe it the boy gasped sergeant hoffer just said that he turned to hoffer get moving within forty minutes von berger hoffer and young schneider left the bunker exiting into hermann goering strasse they were well armed with military packs containing extra ammunition and grenades each one had a schmeisser machine pistol slung across his chest there were people pouring along the tiergarten in hordes now a terrible panic having taken over and the fog made worse by the smoke swirled across the city not even the heavy rain managing to clear it the rumble of artillery was constant women with children screamed terrified the three men moved along the tiergarten on the edge of the crowd cut across by the brandenburg gate to goebbelss house it showed evidence of damage obviously from shell splinters but the very large garage was intact there was a judas gate in the main door and hoffer opened it gently hold it a voice called and a light was switched on a small fieseler storch spotter plane appeared a young luftwaffe captain standing beside it in uniform and flying jacket he held a schmeisser at the ready von berger moved past hoffer im sturmbahnführer von berger who are you my name is ritter hans ritter and thank god youre here this is the fourth time ive done this run and it wasnt fun could i ask where were going to the west to holstein heath in schwarze platz theres a castle schloss adler above neustadt can we make it yes its a threehundredmile flight and well have to refuel somewhere but ill tell you what sturmbahnführer id rather be there than here so lets get the hell out of this place get your lads to open the doors a sound idea hoffer and schneider opened the sliding door and ritter climbed into the storch and started the engine the three men clambered in and hoffer closed the door outside the fleeing refugees turned in astonishment then fled to either side as the storch bumped over rubble and glass and turned toward the victory column the rain was torrential ritter boosted power and roared down the avenue toward the victory column people scattered the storch lifted and at that moment russian artillery opened up shells exploding on each side the plane banked to starboard narrowly missing the victory column and rose up through the fog at two thousand feet ritter leveled off well stay low until were well away when one looked down there was only fire and artillery bursts and drifting smoke and fog hoffer said it looks like hell on earth i cant believe were out of it von berger got two cigarettes from his silver case lit them and passed one back to hoffer so you were right after all karl its stalingrad all over again speaking above the roaring of the engine ritter cried as i said its three hundred miles to holstein heath and im very low on fuel im going to make for the luftwaffe base at rechlin thats fine by me von berger told him if you think it wise it is we have no idea whats going to be available to us along the way mind you it all depends on the weather at rechlin well see some time later he descended through the torrential rain and fog and called in rechlin tower this is captain ritter out of berlin must land to refuel there was a crackle of static and a voice said i suggest you try elsewhere captain the fogs bad here were down to four hundred meters im dangerously short of fuel the visibilitys getting worse all the time believe me ritter turned to von berger inquiringly the baron selected another cigarette and hoffer lit it for him von berger blew out smoke and said to ritter we got out of stalingrad and weve got out of berlin everything else is a bonus lets do it at your orders sturmbahnführer the storch descended very quickly nothing but the fog surrounding them and the driving rain a gray impenetrable world von berger had no fear too much had happened already some strange destiny was surely at work even at four hundred meters there was nothing he cried out to ritter above the noise of the engine go for it whatve we got to lose ritter nodded a strange fixed smile on his face took the storch down and suddenly at a suicidal level of three hundred meters the luftwaffe base of rechlin came into view the buildings the hangars two runways there was evidence of bombing and two aircraft burned at the side of the runway an old dornier and a ju night fighter a fire crew was in the middle of dousing the flames ritter made a perfect landing and taxied past the astonished fire crew to the hangars and switched off well that was close youre a genius ritter no sir its just that now and then one gets better usually when its needed as they got out a field car drove up a luftwaffe colonel at the wheel he got out good god its you ritter straight from berlin i cant believe you got out how are things you wouldnt want to know this is sturmbahnführer baron max von berger and his boys he turned to von berger colonel strasser is an old friend may i inquire about your purpose baron strasser asked von berger opened the briefcase and took out the führer directive which he passed across strasser read it and noted the signature your credentials are impeccable baron how may i assist we need refueling for an onward flight to holstein heath i can handle that all right weve still got plenty of fuel and you are welcome to our hospitality but theres no way youre going anywhere for some time just look he waved toward the runway the fog rolling in at ground level ill see that youre refueled and checked out but theres no guarantee of departure you can use the officers mess and in the unusual circumstances your men may join you ill drive you all there ill stay with the plane for the moment ritter said make sure everything is okay strasser got behind the wheel of the field car von berger and his two men got in and they drove away the mess was strangely desolate an orderly at the bar another acting as a waiter he brought hoffer and schneider stew and bread and beer and they sat by the window and ate schneider said i cant believe im out of berlin its like a mad dream where are you from hoffer asked hamburg which isnt looking too good these days youre better off with us behind them in a corner by the bar the waiter served von berger with ham sandwiches and crusty bread and salad strasser came back from his office to join him champagne he told the waiter and turned to von berger with a smile were lucky weve still got good booze and decent food i dont think that will last well at least its the yanks and the brits who are coming not the russians you can say that again they sampled the champagne when it came and started on the sandwiches and ritter joined them everythings being taken care of but i cant see us getting off for a few hours whats going to happen to you strasser the colonel poured him a glass of champagne gentlemen i dont know what your mission for the führer is and i dont want to know personally i await the arrival of the americans with every fiber of my being he toasted them to you my friends its been a hard war there were plenty of staff rooms at headquarters and they all helped themselves to beds von berger dozing was awakened by strasser at twothirty in the morning time to go von berger sat up how is the weather the fog has cleared to a certain extent but the rain is still bad the word is that the russians have totally encircled berlin that could pose a serious threat here lets hope the yanks make it first off we go then the storch waited beside runway one ritter with it hoffer and schneider inside strasser got out of the field car and handed von berger a bag sandwiches sausages a couple of bottles of booze good luck my friend he shook von bergers hand vigorously and suddenly embraced him what in the hell were we all playing at how did we get in such a mess von berger was incredibly moved keep the faith things will change our time will come ill seek you out strasser was astonished you mean that baron of course ill find you believe me i shall repay your help this night he clambered into the plane after ritter closed everything and outside strasser put his heels together and gave him a military salute von berger returned it the plane roared down the runway and lifted into the murk ritter had given von berger earphones and a throat mike he spoke to him now ill take it very carefully with our low speed and the weather it could be three and a half hours maybe even four to holstein heath most of the time ill fly at two or three thousand maybe higher if the weather continues bad thats fine the flight was difficult with the rain and the patchy fog sometimes clear and at others swirling relentlessly one hour two the whole trip became monotonous von berger had passed the food bag to hoffer who opened it and handed the sandwiches and sausages around the wine was cheap stuff with a screw cap and he poured it into paper cups even ritter had some and held out the cup for a second helping come on it wont do me any harm i need whatever help i can get in this weather von berger finished his food knocked back his wine and lit a cigarette rain beat on the windows it was the strangest of sensations hammering through the bad early morning weather what am i doing here he thought is it a dream i should be in berlin he shook his head i should still be in berlin and then he thought but im not im on the way home to see elsa and little otto and karl will see his lotte and the two girls its a miracle and its because of the führer there must be a meaning to it ritter said its still a bit thick down here i think well be okay im going up to four thousand fine they came out through intermittent fog it was clear up there and clear to the horizon a full moon touching the edge of the early morning clouds suddenly there was a roaring and the storch was thrown to one side in the turbulence as a plane banked away to starboard and returned to take up station on the starboard side they could see the pilot in the cockpit the red star on the fuselage what have we got ritter asked looks like a yak fighter the new model with cannon that could damage us so what do we do well im really too slow for him but that could also be an advantage planes that are too fast sometimes overshoot ill go down and hope hell do something stupid he banked went down fast to three thousand meters then banked again to port went to two the yak started to fire its cannon but too soon because of his excessive speed and he overshot and banked away he came in again and this time punched a couple of holes in the starboard wing and splintered the window ritter cried out and reared back and there was blood on his face ritter said im okay its just a splinter itll give me an interesting scar im getting tired of this im going down further ill show this bastard how to fly he went hard all the way and leveled at five hundred feet the yak came in again on his tail and ritter dropped his flaps the storch seemed to stand still and the yak had to bank steeply to avoid hitting them and went down into the farmland there was a mushroom of flame below and they flew on i said you were a genius von berger told him only some of the time von berger turned to hoffer get the battle pack open find a dressing for his face give him a morphine ampoule too ritter said better not ill tell you what however open that other bottle whatever it is i thought it was wine but its vodka hoffer told him good im always better flying on booze it was perhaps five or fivethirty in the morning that they came in toward holstein heath approaching at two thousand feet the dark mysterious forest below the schwarze platz villages dotted here and there and then neustadt and schloss adler above it on the hill von berger felt incredibly emotional as the plane banked very low ritter searching for a suitable landing there von berger growled the meadow by the castle i see it ritter turned in slowed and made a perfect landing rolling to a halt in the quiet it was schneider who said i still cant believe it we were in berlin and now were here behind them a few people were coming up hesitantly from the village as von berger and the others got out of the plane von berger stood holding hitlers briefcase as a dozen men and a few women approached the leader an aging whiteheaded man almost recoiled my god its you baron a surprise hartmann von berger said how are you baron what can i say hartmann removed his cap took von bergers hand and kissed it such terrible times he turned to hoffer and you karl von berger said here we are safe by a miracle from berlin ill explain later but first i must see the baroness and karl his lotte and the girls hartmann actually broke into weeping god help me baron the news is bad they are in the chapel at the schloss von berger froze what do you mean your wife and son baron lotte and her daughters and fifteen villagers are in the church awaiting burial he turned to hoffer i am so sorry hoffer was stunned horror on his face von berger said who did this thing ss i cant believe it einsatzgruppen einsatzgruppen were not waffen ss but extermination squads recruited from the jails of germany many of the men ukrainians von berger had heard stories that in the last few weeks they had thrown off all restraints started looting and killing on their own but he had hardly believed it to be true he was moving in slow motion now the dream was so bad it was unbelievable he said to hoffer you go and see to your family and ill see to mine he turned to ritter youd better be off my deepest thanks no ritter said ill stand by you ill come with you if i may thats kind my friend they went up the steep path to the schloss von berger and ritter followed by old hartmann and came to the ancient chapel von berger pushed the door it creaked open and he smelled the church smell saw the memorials to his ancestors and the main family mausoleum its doors standing wide a coffin stood there the lid half back his wife inside with his young son cradled in her left arm he gazed down at her calm face noticed the bruises what happened to her baron what can i say hartmann asked tell me von berger said was she violated every woman in the village was baron then the ukrainians got drunk and started shooting and the deaths happened how many of these bastards were there twenty twentyone they moved on to plosen ten miles up the road through the forest so we know where they are von berger turned to ritter you can still go i appreciate more than you know what youve done as i told strasser things will change for all of us and ill search you out ritters face with the dressing on the cheek was haggard ive no intention of going then go down to the village with hartmann and make sure his truck is ready to leave i have private business here ritter and hartmann left von berger stood by the mausoleum for a while then went to the rear where there were two statues of saints his hand passed inside one it groaned and creaked open he slipped the führers briefcase inside then closed the secret door he leaned over kissed his wife and son and left in the village the tenants waited and he passed amongst them holding his hand out to be kissed though not in arrogance it was a tradition that had reigned in holstein heath for hundreds of years these were his people and the women who cried in despair did it because they looked to him for guidance hoffer came to him his face bleak your orders baron were going to get these swine are you ready to leave hoffer before he could reply young schneider said and me too baron excellent and you can include me ritter said i can shoot a schmeisser with the best of them as chance would have it it was at that moment that the americans arrived not that they were much of a force it was a single jeep and the young captain in the passenger seat wore a steel helmet and combat gear his shoulder patch indicated an airborne ranger a sergeant was at the wheel they rolled to a halt and sat there watchful does anyone here speak english the captain asked of course the baron said good ill take your surrender my unit is about ten miles back im captain james kelly on forward reconnaissance this is sergeant hanson and what might you be doing here hey buddy the driver picked up a submachine gun watch your mouth ritter and hoffer and young schneider raised their schmeissers threateningly and kelly said to hanson can it he spoke to von berger we have information that the castle would make a possible headquarters who are you anyway sturmbahnführer baron max von berger owner of schloss adler and holstein heath kelly shook his head wait a minute ive got a report that says von bergers in the bunker with hitler one of his aides or something true as of yesterday von berger said if you will look behind you at the meadows you will notice the storch in which captain hans ritter here flew me and my two men out of berlin kelly nodded okay well argue about it later you can all surrender your weapons now this is a great coup for you captain but if you dont mind not just yet weve urgent business to take care of first and what would that be max von berger told him kelly shook his head thats a terrible thing but you four guys are going to take on twentyone of these bastards you could get killed and i cant allow that to happen i see im too valuable to lose von berger shook his head its been a long war captain from el alamein to stalingrad ive seen hell on earth and for me the war is over i dont want to kill you but i must kill these men i could not live with myself otherwise so we will leave in the old woodcutters truck drive ten miles down to plosen and there well find the ukrainians and get the business done he turned to hoffer you drive kelly started to say something and then he stopped ah hell baron i guess id do the same thing but afterward youre an optimist i see all right lets go the road wound through dark somber forest all the way to plosen when they were close they came across a crowd of women and older men moving along either side of the road hoffer pulled up and recognized the village mayor hey frankel whats happening my god its you karl these ukrainians we know what they did in neustadt young meyer escaped on his motorcycle came and gave us warning we all left in a hurry faded into the forest i hear they did terrible things von berger got out and held out his hand frankel the old mans eyes widened baron this is unbelievable he kissed the hand meyer told me about the baroness and your son he turned to hoffer and your lotte kelly and hanson came round from the jeep and ritter and schneider joined them kelly said whats happening the mayor of plosen is just about to tell us von berger said in english then in german where are they frankel i stayed close to observe they came in two trucks and a kübelwagen they rampaged round the village and discovered two young women then they went to the inn the white stag i could hear shouting breaking glass theyre all drunk any guards hoffer asked not that i could see von berger patted his shoulder take care of your people and ill take care of these animals but baron there are twentyfour of them really i thought it was twentyone he turned to ritter schneider and hoffer so thats six for each of us can we manage that havent we always baron hoffer opened a battle pack took out double ammunition clips taped together and handed them to ritter and schneider von berger opened his black leather coat took the luger from his holster checked it and put it in his righthand pocket have you a spare karl hoffer produced a mauser from the battle pack and handed it over von berger put it in the lefthand pocket of his coat twentyfour of these bastards and four of you thats odds of six to one kelly said von berger smiled grimly were waffen ss were used to it he clapped schneider on the shoulder hes only a boy but he knows how to do the job six to one so what take your camouflage blouse off karl hoffer did so and kelly saw the medals the paratroopers badge a single knights cross at the throat you will also have observed that captain ritter has the knights cross its been a long war and its had a bad ending but you must understand one thing we intend to kill these ukrainians all twentyfour kill them he turned to his men is this not so even ritter got his heels together as they gave the answer jawohl sturmbahnführer he ignored kelly completely now lets go and they scrambled into the truck and drove away as the jeep followed hanson said that guy is crazy they all are kelly nodded absolutely he took the colt from his holster and started to reload it as they followed the truck they paused in the trees and looked down at the white stag it was quite large and very ancient with the village church and a graveyard behind kelly glanced through field glasses at the two trucks and the kübelwagen there was no sign of guards but the noise of drunken laughter drifted up he passed the field glasses to von berger who had a look he handed them back ill go in the front door which will put them off balance they are after all supposed to be under ss authority i suggest the rest of you go by the graveyard he said to ritter karl knows it well the bar is very large there are two rear entrances via the kitchen and side windows he turned to kelly one favor ill borrow your jeep to drive up to the door you two can stay here and my friends will approach on foot kelly shook his head no i wont lend you the jeep but i will drive it he turned to hanson give me that thompson ill see you later maybe go to hell hanson said with all due respect sir ive been fighting since dday a walk through a graveyard with the ss sounds just about right kelly and von berger waited to give them a chance to slip down through the edge of the forest and move behind the church into the graveyard von berger watched for movement through the glasses now he said and kelly drove them down the hill and parked beside the other vehicles von berger led the way up the steps pulling on his leather gloves and kelly followed holding the thompson across his chest von berger eased open the door and stepped in followed by kelly the ukrainians were scattered around the room some sitting at tables a number standing at the bar a couple behind the bar serving drinks the leader was a hauptsturmführer a brute of a man in a soiled uniform his face dirty and unshaven he had a young woman on each knee their clothes torn faces bruised eyes swollen from weeping one by one the men noticed von berger and stopped talking there was total silence von berger stood there his legs apart his hands in the pockets of the black leather coat holding it apart displaying that magnificent uniform the medals your name gorsky the hauptsturmführer said as a kind of reflex ah ukrainian it was the way von berger said it that the ukrainian didnt like and who the hell are you your superior officer sturmbahnführer baron max von berger it was my wife baroness von berger and my son along with fifteen others that you butchered at schloss adler and neustadt men were already reaching for weapons kelly lifted his thompson and suddenly gorsky pulled the two girls across his knees in front of him so that only half his face showed so what are you going to do about it take them boys he shouted von bergers hand came out of his right pocket with the luger and he shot gorsky twice in the left side of the skull narrowly missing the girls who dropped to the floor as gorsky went backward in the chair the carnage began kelly spraying the bar area a side window crashed open and ritter and hanson fired through some of the ukrainians turned to run and flung open the doors to the kitchen only to find hoffer and schneider there was an exchange of fire but not for long there were dead men everywhere just a few still moving hanson had stopped a bullet in the shoulder and schneider in his left arm von berger took the mauser from his other pocket and tossed it to hoffer karl finish them for gods sake kelly said it is his right hoffer found five men still alive and shot each one in the head the girls had run for it screaming ritter had opened a battle pack and was putting a field dressing on hanson while schneider waited so thats it kelly surveyed the bodies no now we go home and bury our dead after that we are yours to dispose of von berger put a hand on kellys shoulder i am in your debt eternally i will repay you repay me kelly was mystified a matter of honor he was of course handled personally by top officers in both british and american intelligence since he had been one of hitlers aides in those last few months in the bunker his account of events was fascinating and recorded in the smallest detail but for allied intelligence there was a problem with max von berger on the one hand he was unquestionably ss and a commander on the other he was a brave and gallant soldier who seemed never to have involved himself in the more unsavory aspects of the nazi regime never involved himself in anything remotely connected with the jewish pogroms in fact it was soon established that he had had a dangerous secret all along one of von bergers greatgrandmothers on the maternal side had been jewish he had also never been a member of the nazi party though it was true that most of the german population had also not been members of the party which left only the question of the flight out of berlin obviously von berger mentioned nothing to them of his interview with the führer indeed he had put together a reasonable story with ritter while they were still together the story was this ritter had been ordered to berlin in the storch as a backup plane in case there were problems with the arado assigned to fly out the new luftwaffe commander von greim there had been no problems however von berger as one of hitlers aides knowing that the plane was languishing in goebbelss garage and that the end was only hours away had seized the opportunity to get out and had taken two of his men with him it was a perfectly simple explanation there was no reason not to accept it and ritter backed it to the hilt and so in the end that was that as prisoners of war they were disposed of in various ways many were sent to england for farm work amongst them was max von berger who was posted to a camp in west sussex the regulations were minimal and each day he was allocated to a local manor house and its home farm along with several other prisoners there was nothing unusual in this officers up to the level of general found themselves working in such a way the truth was that the other prisoners deferred to him called him herr baron with respect and the owner of the estate an aging lord soon realized he had someone special on board and not only that a countryman by nature before long he was running things the war was over the villagers in hawkley were decent people and gradually the germans were accepted even for a pint in the pub and then at the end of german prisoners began to be returned home and amongst them was max von berger it was snowing when he arrived in neustadt off the local bus it drove away and a bag in his hand he went up the steps and entered the inn the eagle local men were in there drinking beer some eating and he saw old hartmann by the bar and karl hoffer and young schneider at a table nearby eating stew someone turned and saw him my god baron everyone turned the entire room went still hoffer moved first jumping up running to meet him in an excess of emotion embracing him baron we wondered where you were ive been back six months and brought schneider with me his entire family was killed in the bombing in hamburg von berger put an arm around schneider who was actually sobbing come on boy we got out of berlin didnt we theres nothing to cry about he called to the landlord the bills on me my friend let the beer flow he turned to hoffer im so pleased to see you lets sit down in a corner booth they talked young schneider listening were getting by hoffer said its mainly subsistence farming but were all in it together everyone is taken care of and you well i act as bailiff it gives me something to do you havent found someone no baron what about the schloss we had the americans for two years so its in good condition the thing you dont know about is the situation with holstein heath and what would that be when the border between the east and west was agreed on by the allies we should have been inside the eastern zone and communist i thought we were in the western zone well no thats it we arent there either the whole of the estate isnt in either of the zones someone made a mistake drafting the map max von berger was astonished you mean were a kind of independent state he laughed out loud like monaco hoffer an intelligent man said well not exactly the police are technically west german however theyre all local boys mostly exarmy or ss so they see things our way excellent von berger drained his beer and stood up show me the schloss hoffer did and hed been right it was rundown but the americans hadnt kicked it to pieces finally they approached the chapel it was dark in the early winter evening but candles flickered close to the mausoleum von berger stood and looked and noticed some winter roses who are those from village women they like to keep things right its the same at the church for the others my wife the girls von berger said that day karl those final killings it wasnt that i was leaving it to you i felt you had a greater right i know that baron do you ever regret what we did never good now pay attention we were comrades then and comrades now and i am going to share my greatest secret with you he went behind the mausoleum and pressed the hidden catch the statue groaned and moved von berger reached in and took out the briefcase this is the true reason we left berlin he opened it and extracted the blue book this is hitlers diary karl my god in heaven hoffer gasped can this be true yes ill tell you later whats in it but right now well put it back he pressed the catch and the statue reversed into place he fastened the briefcase and held it up and in here is the solution to all our financial problems ill explain it to you as we go the first thing we must do is visit berger steel well need decent suits and some sort of vehicle ive still got a kübelwagen from the war baron excellent stuttgart then but geneva first thats where the money is geneva was amazingly easy at the bank the passwords and codes from the material given him by the führer inspired immediate compliance the rather ordinarylooking banker indicated how immense the resources were at his disposal and he transferred ten million into a liquid personal account thus establishing his name and status the bank in effect jumped to attention his next move was to contact berger steels lawyers in munich leading to a meeting onsite at the stuttgart factory they toured it with the general manager heinz it was working of course but in a lowkey manner a certain amount of steelmaking but not much more than that as you can still see we had bomb damage but on the whole we were lucky and weve an excellent workforce heinz told him the lawyer henry abel said cash flow and investment thats the trouble we dont have enough of either not anymore von berger turned to heinz im transfering five million into the company accounts tomorrow dear god baron heinz said ill guarantee you results with that kind of money and so it proved over the years the company contributed more than most to the miracle that became west germany as they developed into one of the most important steelworks von berger diversified into construction hotels the developing postwar leisure industry soon his tentacles moved westward to the united states his hotel interests burgeoning and an exairborne ranger officer turned new york attorney named james kelly proved more than useful eventually becoming head of legal affairs for the american branch of berger international at an early stage he sought out colonel strasser as he had promised and strasser became an adept troubleshooter eventually overseeing all personnel matters for berger ritter had been a different case as usual with many wartime pilots ritter had been unable to go without the adrenaline rush so though berger had kept him as a personal pilot it was never enough and one day in ritter performing at an airshow in an me stalled for the last time and plunged into the ground at the funeral they stood together the baron schneider hoffer strasser and kelly who had flown over from the states thirtyeight years old and after all that he did strasser said id say thats young it frankly makes me uneasy schneider always young schneider to them said that berlin flight was amazing we shouldnt even be here now well we are and the work continues the baron said as the cold war extended the position of the great estate of holstein heath became more ambivalent but von bergers position as one of west germanys leading industrialists gave him the right international contacts needed to block anything the east german regime could do the estate had developed a prosperity beyond belief with karl hoffer as general manager and young schneider as his assistant von berger poured in money and totally refurbished the castle using the apparently inexhaustible funds from geneva he even had a runway constructed in the meadow big enough for small planes to land any overt support of nazi ideals was not part of his agenda it would have been counterproductive anyway but gradually over the years there was a quiet coming together of others whose names were on the lists in hitlers briefcase not the kameradenwerk the action for comrades that hitler had mentioned but a sort of secret brotherhood almost like a masonic order with max von berger as a kind of godfather anyone with the right background the right ideas could turn to him and get a hearing a handout help always discreet always reasonable a legend to the former soldiers of the german army there was nothing the authorities could complain of the truth was that the brutal death of his wife and son had killed something inside him in a single devastating moment he had taken his revenge which had proved no revenge it had as hed read in a poem made of his heart a stone left him curiously lacking in emotion the years rolled on and in that emotionally cold heart found release when at fortyeight years of age he formed an attachment for a young italian woman named maria rossi attractive and clever with a degree in accounting she became a personal assistant traveling the world with him and the inevitable happened von berger fought against his feelings for her for it seemed a betrayal of his wife but before he had to make any final decision the situation resolved itself she left him quite suddenly leaving behind a brief apologetic letter telling him that family business had called her away to palermo he never heard from her again time went by and people started to die on him first schneider was killed in a stupid accident on the estate when a tractor he was driving turned over crushing him to death strasser went next with lung cancer ten years later von berger went to the funeral with hoffer it was and he was sixty the grim reaper is spacing things out karl have you noticed it had occurred to me baron hoffer had remarried in middle life a cousin a widow from the village she had died of a heart attack only a year before he was two years older than von berger so what do we do gird our loins ive been thinking of going into the arms business and theres always oil especially with russia opening up may i ask why you need to do that baron hoffer said patiently you already have enormous wealth my dear karl more than even you could imagine but my life lacks purpose karl there is an emptiness i cannot fill maria rossi made me warm for a while and then went this void in me i must fill it and work and enterprise are the only way he clapped hoffer on the shoulder dont worry about me karl ill sort it out the following day back at the schloss he visited the chapel opened the secret place and leafed through the hitler diary he had read it so many times that he almost knew it by heart there had never been any occasion to use it and as he replaced it now he wondered if there ever would be he sat there for a while by the mausoleum thinking of his wife and son then took a deep breath and stood up so russian oil fields and armaments so be it and he went out by he was seventy his holdings in russian oil extensive because of the temporary loss of the kuwaiti oil fields in the gulf war and the embargos placed on iraqi oil the money simply poured in and the continuing threat in the middle east and india and pakistan made for more and more lucrative deals in the arms business in both britain and the united states there was unease at the highest level about his various dealings but he didnt care he was now head of a consortium so staggeringly wealthy that his power was immense in james kelly died in new york but later in the same year the baron suffered his greatest blow of all when karl hoffer passed away with a heart attack the open coffin was on display in the chapel sitting beside it alone his hands on the silver handle of the cane he needed to get around these days he thought of their years together in the war and that last final flight from berlin so it would appear i am the last old friend my hip bothers me a great deal these days you remember our old wartime motto to the men of the ss nothing is impossible he sighed then gathered himself together so back to work he limped out and the chapel door slammed behind him it was quiet lit only by the guttering candles little did he know that just around the corner a series of events were waiting that would change his life forever london the empty quarter iraq the following year was the first time he met paul rashid the earl of loch dhu the legendary figure behind rashid investments the earl had had an english mother and an omani general for a father and had served in the sas during the gulf war the rashid wealth was well known as was their grip on the oil fields of hazar and also in the dhofar for paul rashid was bedu and controlled the vast deserts of the empty quarter berger international had sought oil concessions in the dhofar but even the americans hadnt been able to break the iron control of the rashids the baron tried a different approach he arranged an arms deal with yemen then asked rashid investments to broker it for him reporting directly to him in this way he hoped of course to get to meet paul rashid and one day he received a message that the chairman would meet him in the piano bar at the dorchester hotel he arrived in the early evening as stipulated and ordered a whiskey an irish hed always favored that he sat hands on the handle of his cane and noticed a supremely beautiful woman pause at the entrance she wore a black jumpsuit her black hair hanging to her shoulders and framing a face that could have belonged to the queen of sheba and then she came down the steps and approached him baron von berger why yes he started to rise no dont get up she pulled a chair forward im lady kate rashid he was totally thrown my dear young lady i was expecting lord loch dhu but you asked for a meeting with the chairman of rashid investments and thats me my brother prefers to stay in the shadows so to speak she laughed dont look so surprised i did manage to get an ma in business at oxford now lets have a glass of champagne and you can tell me how we can possibly help the great baron max von berger to do something he cant do for himself she called to guiliano the bar manager and ordered house champagne dont worry its the best in the place but then everything here is the best so baron well as you may know berger international dabbles in the arms business i wouldnt call it dabbling baron its not quite on a par with your oil interests he smiled i have an order from the yemeni government for assorted weaponry ten million pounds worth its no big deal but the shipment is russian in origin so i was hoping to bring it down from the black sea in a greekowned freighter to aden let me guess suddenly there are difficulties with the port authorities in aden greedy hands held out you are a very perceptive young lady a realist baron who understands the arab mentality i do not regard myself as arab baron and not just because i am halfenglish i am well aware of that your family is as great in england as my own is in germany i meant no slight of course you didnt but as i said thats not what i meant my other half is bedu and that is different from being arab we bow our heads to no one the bedu are the real power in hazar and the dhofar but especially in the empty quarter the bedu control the empty quarter and the rashid control the bedu my brother is the undisputed leader a remarkable man the earl and the rise in rashid investments has been equally remarkable and yet he is not so often on the scene as it were as i told you he prefers to stay in the shadows i have two brothers george and michael who are managing directors and as you know i am chairman and paul he prefers to spend time in hazar with the bedu to them he is a great warrior he roams the desert by camel lives in the old bedu way guarded by men who would die for him burned by the sun he eats dates and dried meats would you eat dates and dried meats baron guiliano had materialized with a waiter and thumbed the cork off a bottle of dorchester champagne max von berger laughed out loud to be frank id rather enjoy the delights of the piano bar then taste the champagne for me only if you allow me one privilege and what would that be to call you kate its a delightful name and suits you beyond measure she smiled my pleasure max he laughed again and nodded to guiliano who smiled and poured so where are we kate regarding your arms shipment its no problem but we can do better than the greek freighter ill provide a rashid ship with an arab crew ill sort out the aden end of things and provide security for the cargo including its deployment upcountry and what will i have to pay for such munificence twentyfive percent there was a moments pause then von berger smiled what a remarkable young woman you are kate i accept of course no contract no handshake my word he raised his glass to you my dear and to the future they clinked glasses and drank she nodded to guiliano who came forward to refill and then she sat back watching the baron calmly she knew everything about him or at least thought she did he intrigued her everything about him and she enchanted him not in some silly superficial way a seventysixyearold man falling for a beautiful young woman it was just that everything about her was so remarkable to the future you say she smiled so now we come to it your interests in the russian oil fields are not enough you seek oil concessions in the dhofar it was a statement he said alas to no purpose the russians have tried the americans even a british consortium so now by coincidence we have max von berger of berger international coming to rashid hoping to meet my brother to broker a piffling little tenmillionpound arms deal von berger hadnt enjoyed himself so much in years he laughed again i surrender completely i thought if i met your brother it might make a difference then why didnt you say so youre interested in the dhofar and development so are we you want to discuss this with paul ill arrange it well fly in a company gulfstream to hazar say ten tomorrow morning well go upcountry by helicopter to shabwa oasis in the empty quarter and my brother will see you there does any of this seem acceptable only that if i was forty years younger id have been at your feet oh very nice especially coming from the pick of the ss so its a date now as our business here is concluded what about taking me somewhere nice for dinner the ivy would be acceptable all those awful celebrities makes it so interesting and max von berger filled with excitement pushed himself up and clicked his heels lady kate rashid the pleasure is all mine the following day the rashid gulfstream landed in hazar at the military base a relic of british imperialism a hawk helicopter was waiting and kate led the way to it von berger following he hadnt felt so alive in years so much of the time on the flight from northolt had been spent in conversation and on about every subject under the sun he was totally fascinated by her the flight in the helicopter was noisy and uncomfortable as it carved a way through the great heat bouncing in the thermals over the vastness the desolation of the empty quarter evening was falling the huge sand dunes stretched to infinity or so it seemed and von berger loved it all of it age seemed to have slipped away from him and then in the distance in the gloom there were fires and finally the hawk swept in over the vast shabwa oasis and hovered it was a great pool surrounded by palm trees herds of camels and goats and an enormous encampment women children and men all bedu milling around the helicopter landed the engine stopped the pilot opened the door and stood to one side here we are then baron kate smiled if you would follow me she was wearing a khaki bush shirt and slacks now she pulled on a headcloth and stepped out the crowd had stepped back and rashid warriors ran forward with rifles making a line the silence was almost total except for the snort of a camel and the plaintive bleating of the goats then down the lane came paul rashid a dramatic figure in headcloth and black robes he held out his arms little sister kate ran to him for his embrace the crowd erupted the noise deafening paul rashid turned to von berger and held out his hand you must excuse their enthusiasm baron my sister has a special place in their hearts i find that perfectly understandable rashids grip tightened then he leaned forward and kissed von berger on each cheek excuse the familiarity but witnessed by my people this makes you special too inviolate you might say word spreads easily in the empty quarter better than on a computer you will always be safe here to von berger it was so familiar it was like holstein heath the darker place the special relationship with his people he was very moved you make me proud my lord rashid turned to the crowd this is baron von berger my friends the crowd raised their voices the camels wheezed everything was in motion kate turned to von berger just go with the flow and remember from now on you are the guest of every bedu in the empty quarter so a little hospitality would be in order paul rashid said first you must refresh yourself after the journey then we eat and then comes business kate said enough for now paul rashid turned and led the way through the crowd the baron was taken to a richly furnished tent with carpets and hangings a canvas bath was provided two young men on hand who spoke english and attended his every need later he was taken to a larger tent filled with people eating and sitting on cushions in the traditional way women bringing in food of many kinds from the cooking tent stews roasted lambs an absolute feast von berger sat between rashid and kate rashid said i trust you understand my people expect this they have their traditions baron max von berger told him please call me max he reached for a dish of some sort of lamb chops a woman offered took one with his bare hand and tried it delicious he turned to paul rashid one old soldier to another i was in the winter war in russia and this is infinitely better paul rashid smiled then enjoy my friend much later they sat the three of them by a blazing fire guards sitting close by drinking coffee aks across their knees rashid said so this yemeni arms affair of course well broker it for you no big deal but lets be frank what my sister said to you was true this yemeni thing is nothing to you we know that what you are interested in are oil concessions in the empty quarter perhaps and certainly in the dhofar absolutely i know that the russians are after it the brits the americans but your influence with the bedu confounds them all thats true there was silence the baron said would you happen to have a cigarette of course ill have one with you he called in arabic a youth ran forward and cigarettes were provided and a lighter they got me through the winter war these things the baron said and me the gulf war rashid replied we have much in common von berger turned to kate listen to what i say i would value your opinion of course right if i try to obtain concessions in the dhofar the great powers would put in place as many roadblocks as they could even now the russian government isnt happy with my holdings in their country any extension of my power would displease them that would seem obvious she said and the americans have always distrusted me the hitler business never goes away he turned to rashid you on the other hand they are stuck with that intrigues me why havent you used those concessions in the dhofar rashid drank his coffee tell him he said to kate cash flow she said rashid investments is worth billions but its all tied up capital investment mainly i dont need to tell you that oil exploration is an expensive business but if you had the resources you could go ahead in the dhofar america and russia could do nothing she looked at him calmly wed need a lot of money and i wouldnt want it tied up by the banks what she means is wed need something like one billion in cash nice and fluid in our own account to get started paul rashid said von berger nodded two billion would be better they both stared at him two billion kate said yes lets see today is tuesday ill set the wheels in motion you could have it by friday he smiled and then you would be developing oil in the dhofar not me the white house the kremlin downing street they wouldnt know a thing it was kate who answered oh god that would be beautiful her brother held up his hand this is not a joke youre not that kind of man no im not renowned for my sense of humor where money is concerned but the manipulations necessary to raise such a sum on the international finance scene would be very obvious there is no way the americans the russians and the brits would not be aware of it no there youre wrong there would be no need for anything unusual to happen i have access to unlimited cash funds kate was astonished in that amount but from where oh swiss banks im what is known as cashrich therell be no wheelerdealing on the stock exchanges no haggling for loans or investments in the financial markets just healthy injections of cash into rashid investments as you choose they looked at each other kate was excited and clutched at her brothers arm paul well never have such a chance again we can confound them all i know little sister rashid turned to von berger and in return in return i would expect to be made a silent partner in rashid investments on what terms nothing onerous nothing unreasonable we can work it out together here and ill step back in fact we shouldnt even meet socially not ever again he turned to kate which will be a great deprivation paul rashid sat brooding after a while he said those international oil cartels theyd love to drill anywhere they damn well pleased in the dhofar and walk all over the bedu in the process rape the desert and you would do it differently it can be done differently max no one knows that better than you you are right by the way we cant be seen together in the future so we have a deal subject to our agreement on the partnership yes ill arrange all the necessary documentation and you will arrange the funding by friday we have an ancient bedu custom more binding than any contract rashid took a small razorsharp knife from his belt your thumb baron the left hand von berger held out the hand rashid touched the end of the thumb and drew a spot of blood he did the same to his own then touched it to von bergers their blood mingling kate held out her left hand me too it is my right i brought him he smiled and you did well little sister he pricked her thumb also and she touched his and then von bergers paul rashid leaned forward and put an arm around both of them this bond that will last for life itself i swear it on my honor von berger said kate smiled and something glowed in her eyes what a pity max that we cant meet again but paul is right no more piano bar he spread his hands im desolate little did he know but some two years later he was to meet her again and under the most dramatic of circumstances january to be precise von berger was approached through his berlin offices by iraqi government sources they wanted exploratory talks regarding arms supplies von berger wasnt surprised arms dealers all over the world had been approached there wasnt much chance of keeping quiet about it with the israeli mossad so closely allied to american and british intelligence he wasnt certain why he went to iraq at all he didnt approve of saddam hussein or his regime the lift that kate rashid had given to his life had been only temporary since the meeting in hazar he had not had any overt contact with the rashids the business dealings in the dhofar in which he had invested so much had prospered hugely the truth was that he was seventyeight years old and the only people he had cared about were dead and gone he had accomplished so much and there was nothing left that was worth doing he was also bored so he went to baghdad the city seemed immense ancient and yet modern hot and dusty crowded with humanity he flew into the airport in a gulfstream and was received with extreme courtesy by a young intelligence major called aroun immaculate in a khaki uniform that looked as if it had been tailored in londons savile row sporting medals and the wings of a paratrooper he was handsome intelligent and spoke good english he eased von berger through the usual formalities and escorted him out to a limousine a lincoln he joined him in the rear seat do you smoke baron he offered his cigarette case why thank you von berger accepted a light and leaned back peering out at the crowded streets fascinating yes well i think it will rain later is that good in this city yes the smell can be overpowering and baghdad was not created to fit in with the invention of the motor car im taking you to the al bustan baron a fivestar modern hotel and my meeting he cant see you today ill let you know of course already von berger was wondering whether he should have come in the first place later that evening he stood on the terrace of his suite smoking a cigarette and drinking irish whiskey it was a strange thing to find in his suite and he wondered who had known enough about him to supply it there was a flash of lightning and a rumble of thunder and rain started to pour down he looked to the crowded streets the slowmoving traffic but already the air smelled fresher it was as if a weight had been lifted he finished his whiskey and the mobile phone in his breast pocket an international model rang who is this he inquired how about a drink in the piano bar said a womans voice oh sorry thats not possible youre at the al bustan in downtown baghdad he was astonished kate its you where are you never mind and how on earth did you know i was here oh i know most things that youre brokering some sort of arms deal with saddam for instance when are you seeing him or are you it was supposed to be today but its been delayed who said so the young man who received me at the airport a major aroun a major they should be doing better than that for you it all smells a little like old fish to me well dictators can be like that i was raised on hitler remember all right but listen take care ill check back to see how you are youll be pleased to know were making a fortune partner the line went dead and he switched off he languished for three days and had definitely decided to go back home when the hotel phone finally rang it was aroun hell see you tonight at ninethirty ill pick you up at nine and deliver you to the presidential palace how kind von berger said i was about to leave please baron his sense of humor is limited in any case you wouldnt have made the airport i would suggest you be ready on time max von berger laughed my dear boy i wouldnt miss it for anything when von berger went down to the hotel foyer in response to arouns phone call he found the major standing by a mercedes sedan he wasnt in uniform and wore a black leather bomber jacket and jeans as did the driver von berger wore a black suit white shirt and dark tie i feel overdressed i was ordered to make this as lowkey as possible get in the baron did sitting in the rear aroun in front beside the driver as they drove away the thunder rumbled again and rain erupted deluging the slowmoving traffic a scene of chaos horns honking the sidewalks crowded with people most of them seemingly oblivious to the rain this is the main throughfare through the old town al rashid street its not too far to the palace al rashid street it made von berger think of kate she hadnt rung back the car braked behind a truck close to the curb where several young men were sheltered under the awning of a cafe smoking cigarettes and talking as the mercedes paused they noticed it and stared very much aware of von bergers western clothes they began talking excitedly in arabic youths of a kind to be found in any great city in the world and intent on mischief suddenly they approached the car and someone wrenched open the rear door of the mercedes american eh we dont like americans no im german you lie american hands reached in for him aroun got out on the other side and pulled a pistol but three men jumped on him from behind wrestled him to the ground and started kicking him his driver was pulled out and received the same treatment von berger thought his last hour had come as many hands grabbed at him pulling him into the middle of the crowd a tall young bearded man incongruously in a baseball cap and tshirt seemed to be the leader he brandished arouns pistol and shouted to the crowd then advanced on von berger as they held him americans we kill the man said but just then came a squeal of brakes as two land rovers came to a halt the sound of a shot fired into the air and a woman calling in arabic the men turned pulling von berger with them and he saw kate rashid standing by one of the land rovers in headcloth khaki bush shirt and slacks she was holding a browning hipower and the six bedu guards with her had aks at the ready let him go she said in english to the man in the baseball cap he is american and americans we kill he shouted and who are you woman to tell us what do he grabbed von berger by the hair and rammed the muzzle of his pistol against the barons skull i say he dies her hand swung up and she fired shooting him through the mouth the back of his skull fragmenting blood and bone spraying over the crowd he dropped the pistol and fell and the crowd scattered and ran the baron had fallen to the ground and two of the bedu picked him up kate he said dumbfounded she smiled and turned to aroun who had picked himself up and leaned on the mercedes major aroun i think you know who i am yes lady kate i dont know whats been going on here no uniforms no military escort he said it had to be lowprofile really well youd better see to the scum on the pavement then clean yourself up and ill take the baron to the presidential palace she turned to von berger come on get in and tidy yourself up your hair is all over the place sitting in the back of one of the land rovers as they drove away he said where in the hell did you spring from oh i was in the region and heard a whisper relating to your meeting with the great man for various reasons i wasnt happy saddam can do strange things hes a man of uncertainties he sends a junior officer to greet you leaves you kicking your heels for three days a man as important as you that means hes in another manic phase how do you know this because i know him well hes a good friend of mine no thats not quite right he thinks hes a good friend of mine and you oh i think hes a madman whod be better off dead achieving that would be difficult however they paused at the gates of the presidential palace were checked through instantly when the guards saw kate and drove inside stopping at the bottom of the huge steps leading up to the entrance kate turned and said calmly well here we go max this should be interesting an army colonel who had presumably been waiting to greet the baron rushed forward to kiss kates hand and spoke to her in english lady kate ive heard what happened it shames us all are you all right it was so strange how english the iraqi military sounded the baron thought this was another one whod probably gone to sandhurst military academy the only problem is the man i had to leave on the pavement colonel he was a dog who deserved to die for his insult to you pavements lady kate are easily cleaned is he aware of what happened his rage was terrible he has ordered instant police reprisals in al rashid street please follow me there was a sudden wailing of sirens outside and the lights dimmed at once the colonel waved a hand and a soldier ran forward with a large hand lamp its an airraid practice only the colonel said our american friends are not giving us much trouble at the moment this way they followed him along corridors of marbled splendor it was an eerie feeling the darkness closing in statues on each side seemingly floating out of the gloom the pool of light from the lamp the echo of their feet on the marble are you all right kate whispered von berger said i think you might say its one of the more remarkable experiences ive ever had and considering im the only man you know who was in the führer bunker thats quite a statement she laughed oh i like you max if only i was fifty years younger he cut in but im not so behave yourself they halted at an ornate door sentries on either side the colonel opened it and went in they waited and a voice rumbled the colonel was back in a moment he will see you now saddam hussein was seated alone in uniform at a large desk the only light a shaded lamp he was signing documents but looked up and put down his pen got up and came round the desk to embrace kate kissed her on each cheek she said in english baron von berger doesnt speak arabic saddam never advertised the fact that he spoke english well but he turned now baron im outraged that you should be treated in such a fashion it was an unfortunate misunderstanding they thought me an american i think i was wearing the wrong clothes saddam roared with laughter i like that i can understand that it was strange how volatile he was for just as suddenly he frowned and looked down at kate but the insult to you that is unforgivable ive ordered reprisals the military police will teach the scum on al rashid street a lesson but i did teach them a lesson kate said i shot the leader of the mob excellent that was your lesson and now i teach them mine come sit which she did and nodded to von berger who took the next chair saddam passed across to a window and opened the shutters to a terrace an all clear sounded and he looked across the city lights started to come on we had the americans and the brits in the gulf war interfering sticking their nose in arab business they fly over the socalled exclusion zones bomb our installations war perhaps will come again he turned which is why you are here baron max von berger turned to kate and the look on her face said it all he took a deep breath in what way can i help kate cut in baron von berger has access to most armaments what are you looking for stinger missiles he paced back into the room that kind of thing i can get from many resources what i really need is plutonium he turned to von berger my nuclear program is well advanced but we do need plutonium can you supply me kate turned and nodded slightly von berger said i am aware of sources excellent saddam sat behind his desk again if the americans come at the end i must have a weapon a special weapon to stop them dead in their tracks people talk of biological weapons but this is not enough only a nuclear device will suffice max von berger could have pointed out the catastrophic results of american retaliation cited the fate of japan at the end of the second world war but didnt there was no point he now realized at first hand that saddam hussein was a madman so what do you want from me he asked i told you plutonium baron plutonium saddam stood up and his head was shaking dont waste my time go away and get me plutonium von berger was aware of kates hand on his arm and stood up ill see what i can do saddam picked up his pen and started to sign more documents kate pulled von berger away and he had the good sense to go with her in the land rover he said hes a raving lunatic of course but thats not whats important now i had my other land rover retrieve your belongings from the al bustan ive also arranged a departure slot for your plane you should get out while you can his manic moods are terrible you never know what hell do ill take your advice will you try to find him plutonium and max von berger a major in the ss once hitlers aide said not in a thousand years good she said youre a lovely man max so lets get you to the airport and out of this place germany it was the following year and von berger was in brazil on business when he heard of the appalling tragedy that had befallen the rashid family the deaths of the brothers george and michael and paul the news came too late for him to fly back for the funeral and what would have been the point because of the particular nature of the peerage kate rashid inherited and was now countess of loch dhu but the rule still held there was no public connection between the baron and the rashid empire at that stage von berger knew nothing of the reasons for the deaths or of the rashid feud with western interests or the cause for it it was only later that he would hear of the failed assassination attempt on the life of president jake cazalet at his weekend retreat on nantucket by irish mercenaries instigated by paul rashid then there was the successful assassination of the sultan of hazar himself followed by the failed attempt on the lives of the entire council of elders in hazar again by irish mercenaries it was only later that von berger realized how important in all this had been blake johnson who ran the basement at the white house and then there was general charles ferguson who did the same thing for the british prime minister seconded by his righthand man sean dillon dillon who had personally killed paul rashid and his two brothers but all this knowledge was in the future for the present max von berger had to be content to follow kate rashids activities from afar he was aware of the arrival in her life of rupert dauncey an american cousin of some kind once a major in the marine corps and was also aware of a certain jealousy but life went on and he busied himself in business as usual until that evening staying for a few days at the schloss when on a whim he decided to have supper at the inn the eagle it was crowded a friday night snow falling winter beginning when he went in he received his usual welcome and the innkeeper meyer hurried to meet him baron are you dining with us tonight i think so ill take your special hotpot with potatoes and dumplings how could i do better you honor us he led the way to a booth in the far corner and nodded to the two men sitting there who jumped up and ducked their heads thank you my friends the baron took off his hat and meyer helped with the heavy coat and seated him its a bad night so ill have champagne itll liven things up a little meyer departed and the baron took out his case selected a cigarette and lit it aware of the man standing at the bar drinking beer and scowling at him this was one hans klein a huge brute a local farmer and drunkard he was seriously in arrears with his rent had failed to pay again and again at the town appeals court the previous month the baron had given him three months until eviction as meyer brought the champagne in a bucket and a glass klein said loudly thats all right for the high and bloody mighty he turned to the barmaid and slammed his hand on the bar schnapps and be quick about it or do we all have to stand in line for him conversation faltered and meyer thumbing off the cork looked agitated baron im so sorry just pour it was at that moment the door opened snow whirled in and the stranger appeared he was wearing a hunting jacket with a fur collar and a tweed cap covered with snow which he took off and beat against his thigh strangers were not usual in neustadt and he attracted immediate attention he had black hair not quite to his shoulders but long enough and a handsome wedgeshaped face with a broken nose with the look of some medieval brave about him he unbuttoned his coat good evening he said a bad night for it his german was almost flawless but as von berger recognized there was a hint of italian there meyer said welcome mein herr youve come far you could say that all the way from sicily klein turned to those nearest him italian and there was contempt in his voice the stranger ignored him and said to meyer i need something to warm me up you look as if youve got every drink in the world back there would you have grappa as a matter of fact i do meyer took a bottle down from the shelf and held it up the stranger read the label aloud grappa di brunello di montalcino jesus that stuff is firewater pour me one now he took it straight down and coughed wonderful ill hang on to it he turned saw a small table vacant and in the same glance the baron in his booth amused the stranger stopped smiling and almost stepped back as if recoiling physically he paused then went to the vacant table sat down opened the bottle and poured another one he glanced at the baron again then lowered his eyes the baron frowned strangely uncomfortable there was something familiar there it was as if he knew him but how could that be not that it mattered for it was at that moment that klein drunker than ever erupted he reached over the bar grabbed the bottle of schnapps pulled the cork with his teeth and drank deeply then he slammed the bottle down and turned you think youre god almighty baron but ill tell you what you are youre a bastard he was so drunk he didnt know what he was saying and i know how to treat bastards like you try to come onto my farm ill take my shotgun to you there was total silence from everyone there the baron stayed quite calm sat there his hands folded over his cane go home klein you are not yourself klein lurched forward and swept the champagne from the barons table you old swine ill show you youll show no one the stranger said and poured another glass of grappa and i suggest you apologize to a great man for insulting him so the baron glanced up at him a slight frown on his face and klein turned lurched across and leaned on the table italian pretty boy eh im going to break both your arms really the stranger reversed his grip on the bottle and smacked it across the side of kleins skull the big man fell to one knee and the stranger stood picked up his chair and smashed it across kleins shoulders he backed away and klein reached for the table and hauled himself up slowly he turned blood on his face and the stranger said you are an animal my friend someone should have taught you this a long time ago klein roared with anger and staggered forward the great hands reaching to destroy the stranger swayed to one side tripped him expertly then kicked him in the side of the head klein rolled over groaned and passed out there was an excited murmur and meyer rushed from behind the bar baron all this is terrible what can i say very little just get him to the police station they can hold him in a cell overnight half a dozen men carried klein out while the crowd discussed the events excitedly turning to look at the stranger who watched as the barmaid brought a broom and cleaned up he poured another glass of grappa and drank it down in another single swallow the girl went away the baron said you handle yourself well brutal and effective i was raised in palermo you speak excellent german my mother raised me to i see you looked at me as if you knew me your photo yes i would have searched you out at the schloss tomorrow this meeting is by chance and to what purpose we could start with your name rossi marco rossi my mother was maria rossi she was once in your employ max von berger was aware of a slight trembling a faintness sit down and give me some of that firewater rossi filled the glass again and gave it to him and sat why are you here she died after a losing fight with cancer i was a captain in the italian air force until six months ago a tornado pilot i resigned so that i could be close to her we lived with my uncle in palermo but he died a year ago so she was alone but i dont understand how can you be called rossi because my mother never married she made me swear to bring her ashes to you so here i am he took out a packet of cigarettes and the baron said ill have one his hand shook as he accepted the light thats better he pulled himself together why did she leave me do you know oh yes she loved you deeply but realized how much the memory of your wife remained with you and i know that terrible story when she found herself pregnant she didnt want you to feel beholden or trapped in any way so she went home to palermo to the protection of my uncle tino rossi he was an important figure in the mafia there was something about you when you came in something familiar it was as if i knew you the baron said now i know why but i can hardly take it all in its not every day a man finds he has a son the same for you i think not exactly ive known you were my father for the last twenty years rossi stood up ill fix up a room here for tonight and bring the ashes in the morning then im going home to see if the air force will take me back no theres only one place you stay tonight schloss adler we must talk the baron said and he led the way out in the chapel at the schloss it was wintercold and as always the candles guttered and there was the smell of incense the baron had personally carried the casket with maria rossis ashes and now he placed it in front of the family mausoleum i will have her interred with my first wife and he broke then and sobbed deeply your brother and marco rossi the hard man harder than even max von berger imagined at that time was immensely moved put an arm around him held him close its all right father its all right dont worry im here for this moment im here we mourn together she loved you very much believe me she made a huge sacrifice for that love von berger said because of me my attitudes my pride the stupid von berger sevenhundredyearold pride hey marco said that applies to me too doesnt it von berger wiped a tear from his eye and smiled quite true now lets go and perhaps have some supper a drink but most of all a chat later in the great hall in front of a blazing log fire the butler served coffee brandy thats fine otto von berger told him well manage youve made arrangements for herr rossi yes baron the imperial suite fine good night the butler disappeared into the gloom of the hall footsteps echoing rossi said before anything else is said i must tell you one thing and what is that as i told you my uncle tino rossi was mafia but theres more to it than that he was an important capo you know what that means of course when he died he left my mother hugely wealthy and with her death that all comes to me i need nothing from you thats not why im here im here for my mother and out of respect for my father i know all about you you were a great soldier and a great man von berger waved it off tell me about yourself i spent my early years in palermo of course neither my mother nor my uncle wanted me in the mafia which was difficult because all my extended family my cousins were judging by the way you demolished a brute like klein they failed in their wishes i spent too much time as a boy on the palermo streets you learn fast there i had a fine education the best but i suppose the mafia was somehow in my blood a kind of arrogance his hand came out of his pocket holding an ivory madonna he pressed a button and a blade flashed and this i keep it always my uncle gave it to me for my tenth birthday he folded it von berger said so what came with maturity i was sent to yale university at seventeen studied economics business i did well enough had a flair for computers then i went home and joined the italian air force and ended up getting shot down and on the run behind serb lines in bosnia that must have been difficult you could say that and you want to go back to it why not within three months of qualifying i was in the gulf war attacking basra bosnia a few years later kosovo it has a special feel life on the edge i dont have a girlfriend at the moment a little action and passion wouldnt come amiss i can understand that pour me another brandy marco did so lit a cigarette and said calmly as ive said i didnt come to seek any advantage from you in your position however id be wanting a dna test and that might be a good idea the baron said but only for one reason to secure the line to legitimize you youre quite obviously my son i have no dispute with it in fact i welcome it i only dispute this nonsense of you returning to the air force youve taken the pitcher to the well far too often enough is enough so what do i do youve got a firstclass business background youre a war hero and it appears youre a rather ruthless young man if someone crosses you a street fighter what did my father do to the ukrainians who butchered his wife and my halfbrother i come from a long line of warriors exactly which is why i wish you to choose to stay with me to be my right hand the baron shook his head dammit ill be eighty next year and to have my son beside me would be such a benison i realize you are wealthy and marco rossi filled with an emotion he had only experienced with his mother said no please he dropped to one knee took the barons hand and kissed it you have no idea what this means to be the son of a man like you but i do von berger put a hand to marcos head because i am the father of a man like you and marco took to his new position in life like a duck to water from then on wherever the baron went so did he it became common knowledge that he was in fact von bergers son and in intimate moments the baron told him everything about the führer bunker and the last interview with hitler and the source of his enormous wealth he even told him of the hitler diary and showed him where he kept it the secret compartment at the back of the mausoleum with the eternal flame burning in an open bowl yet he never let him read it the secret of hitlers overtures to roosevelt to end the second world war was von bergers alone he explained the special and secret relationship with rashid investments how kate rashid had saved his life his blood bond with her all this marco took on board and understood and then came that dreadful morning in his suite at the grand hotel in berlin sitting down to breakfast when marco joined him and handed him the early copy of the london times i think youd better read this it was a frontpage account of kate rashids final tragic flight from dauncey place max von berger had seldom felt such anguish he slammed a hand on the table but what went wrong for gods sake she was a fine pilot no one knows engine failure probably i did some nato training there with the raf i know that coast sussex the marshes the mudflats then that damned english weather from the report it was a dawn flight with mist and rain and according to air traffic control her plane was on the screen for a short while then vanished as you can see theyve begun searching off the coast marco went to the bar poured a brandy and brought it to him drink it down the baron did as he was told i owed her so much my very life marco felt strangely detached in a way almost jealous he lit two cigarettes and passed one to his father she must have gone down close in that means reasonably shallow water theyll find her and this cousin you told me about rupert dauncey yes i suppose so he held out his glass id better have another marco went and got it and brought it back what happens now von berger had not even thought of it until now the legal agreements with paul rashid passed to kate and now on her death they will come into force for me i will assume control of the rashid empire he took a deep breath stunned he had never actually considered it not with four rashids so vital and healthy we must alert our people in geneva here in berlin london everything must be put into motion theyve still got to find her body that will take time then there needs to be a pathologists report a coroners inquest the old man strangely tranquil said yes of course but we must begin now there will be no need for secrecy any longer ill speak to the chief executives of rashid in new york and london so they know what to expect theyll come to heel they will have no option and me what do you want me to do ah for you i have a special task you will take over all of the security operations for rashid worldwide there was a lot going on there particularly in arabia and hazar and i want to know what it was how did the three rashid brothers come to die and why and now kate its a remarkable coincidence whatever you say youre a genius with a computer marco and youll be able to access everything they have youll have the authority london first i suppose so ill speak to the rashid people there then new york by that time theyll have either found her or declared her dead can i do anything for you arrange for the gulfstream to london northolt ill get on it he went out and max von berger sat there thinking life he thought was always so unexpected one different journey after another and this one he told himself with a heavy heart was to end in only one place in the churchyard of the village of dauncey london the present the church door opened and the cortege appeared the baron and marco close behind the procession started through the graveyard to the family mausoleum come on ferguson said i want to see this the coffin was on a central dais and people walked around it slowly paying their respects the lid was halfopen the embalmed body of kate rashid revealed the baron reached it and paused then he took something from his pocket leaned forward and placed it on her breast he moved forward paused to glance at ferguson then continued dillon whispered what in the hell was that about they took their turn by the coffin gazing down at kate rashids calm dead face remarkably lifelike thanks to the embalmers art dillon felt no emotion or told himself he didnt what the baron had left was a medal scarlet and black the german cross they moved on how interesting ferguson observed hes awarded her his knights cross with oak leaves and swords theres far more here than even we know about everyone started to turn away through the rain dillon said where is this leading charles to the dauncey arms dillon i understand there will be a champagne buffet there and baron max von berger blake asked well lets go and see ferguson told him and led the way the dauncey arms was already filling up as people filtered into the saloon bar like everything else in the village it was ancient black beams on the ceiling a log fire burning in the old granite fireplace there were tables in oak booths blake managed to grab one and eased in with ferguson dillon moved to the bar where betty mooney the publican presided she frowned i didnt know youd be coming mr dillon youre not welcome here im not welcome anywhere betty dillon took a glass of champagne from the row on the bar swallowed it down took three more and went back to the booth there you go he gave ferguson and blake a glass each and toasted them blake said even you dont know this general but not more than twentyfour hours ago the baron sought and received a meeting in the oval office with the president i was there he told him that he was now in control of rashid investments and most importantly rashid oil a third of all middle east oil production he wanted concessions and the president pointed out that he wasnt comfortable with that why dillon said because berger has been dealing with iraq on arms deals we cant stop the oil production the world market needs it but the president made it clear that he was not welcome how sad ferguson said hes seeing the prime minister tomorrow morning and what will happen there dillon asked the same answer i expect has the pm spoken to you briefly on the phone hes asked me to attend the meeting he shrugged its a foregone conclusion it was at that moment that the baron and marco rossi entered the bar the baron glanced around saw them and came across his voice was deep quite pleasant with only a hint of a german accent ah mr johnson nice to see you again blake didnt stand baron general ferguson von berger nodded we havent met we will tomorrow at downing street really von berger smiled i look forward to it your reputation precedes you it usually does the baron turned to dillon and you must be the great sean dillon a remarkable man jesus baron dillon said and what would you be after your head of course kate rashid was my dear friend she even saved my life once so ill settle for your head dillon replied in german you can always try there was a frozen moment and ferguson said i really wouldnt bother with downing street tomorrow if i were you baron i always travel hopefully general good day to you gentlemen rossi eyed dillon his face hard watchful go on son our day will come rossi smiled as if in satisfaction turned and followed the baron out ferguson said so what do you think kate rashid was a dear friend even saved his life and all he wants is my head dillon shrugged weve got trouble here charles big trouble im afraid youre right he turned to blake what about you the president has asked the prime minister to allow me to attend your meeting too after that ill return to washington excellent we might as well get back to london ferguson turned to dillon youve got your final debriefing this evening debriefing my arse dillon said and smiled at blake hes got me into psychoanalysis now after my last little runin with friend rashid obviously has me down as some kind of psychotic there was an edge to him which blake sensed routine sean routine you went through a lot had to kill more than once really dillon said i thought i killed everybody still back to london and the mother superior he started for the door blake said mother superior one of dillons bad jokes the person hes seeing is a friend of mine a lady called hadentaylor shes not only a psychiatrist but a professor and an ordained priest of the church of england she operates out of harley street or st pauls church around the corner if you cant afford to pay i see shes like that is she very much so ah well blake said as he followed him out it takes all sorts i suppose in the rear of the rollsroyce the baron said to rossi its nice to put a face to ferguson and dillon computer printouts lack charm a hard one the irishman rossi said what ive already seen on the rashid computer is bad theres no doubt he killed all three rashid brothers yes well my impression is they asked for it the baron shook his head that attempt on cazalets life on nantucket was illadvised you only do a thing like that if youre certain you can succeed failure only brings disaster the irish mercenaries were well recommended rossi said and well taken care of by dillon and company max von berger shook his head but we still dont know for absolute certainty if they were responsible for kates death i want you to keep on scouring those security files at rashid investments for any kind of clue there must be something there dont worry i will i have come across something actually the names of two guys who worked directly for rashid security under rupert daunceys orders they were exsas named newton and cook they were definitely involved in watching dillon do you know where they are now working for a thirdrate security firm im meeting them later this afternoon the baron frowned be careful marco maybe you should take some muscle not for these two rossi smiled coldly im muscle enough the old man paused you mean a great deal to me i know that and this dillon is bad news did you notice his eyes like water over a stone no expression not surprising given his background all those years with the ira all the killings and the brits never managed to lay a hand on him marco smiled until ferguson shopped him to the serbs then in a manner of speaking bought him back blackmailed him into working for him the old man said this rumor that he tried to blow up the prime minister and the war cabinet in ninetyone you think its true oh yes and it made him rich he was paid a fortune by the iraqis money means nothing to him a warrior a soldier just like you marco and you baron a long time ago the old man smiled now give me a cigarette and dont tell me i shouldnt the grenadier was a firstclass pub much frequented by guards officers an opulent victorian sort of place with an impressive mahogany bar and booths where one could eat well on traditional english food at that time in the afternoon it was quiet when marco walked in he stood there looking around his trench coat damp a briefcase in one hand then recognized newton and cook from their computer photos and approached im rossi they were what hed expected big men in their midforties once solid now fleshing out in bad suits they looked at him carefully showing nothing what can we do for you want a drink cook asked rossi took off his coat and waved to the bar a large vodka martini and two large scotches he sat down and didnt smile when he said trust me youre going to need them newton said what is this shut up you used to work for rupert dauncey at rashid and now you work for a shit company i cant even remember the name so i ask the questions cook looked sullen but said nothing dauncey gave you orders to follow a guy named sean dillon id like to know what those orders were is dillon in this newton asked would that matter cook said he kills people that bastard and it bothers you it would bother anyone with sense marco nodded all right hows this for sense he pushed the briefcase over theres five grand in there you were dogging dillon just after he returned to london from hazar if you want whats in there start talking newton said we heard the whispers they were going to blow up a railway bridge in hazar the rashids dillon fucked them up along with a pal of his and who would that be billy salter a wellknown gangster his uncle harry has been one of the most important guvnors in the east end for years gone legit now supposedly hes big in property development by the thames theyre very thick with dillon so it would seem the thing is the rashids got their hands on billy at the end of that business in hazar kate rashid went crazy shot salter a few times in the back if you follow me and dillon wasnt pleased no and neither was the countess dauncey told us she wanted us to jump him in london sling him in the back of the van and drive him down to dauncey place to take care of him proper and this was when the night before she flew off in that plane marco nodded let me guess dillon got the drop on you thats right cook said taunted us really newton said told us to tell dauncey hed be seeing him soon and did you yes i did and not because id much time for dauncey it was just that i liked to think he might be able to sort dillon out if he appeared so dillon probably turned up in the early hours of the morning when she flew out id say so it didnt occur to you to notify the police of any of this after you read about the crash youve got to be joking newton said whatever went on here wasnt the kind of thing we wanted to get involved with all right anything else thats it marco pushed the briefcase a little closer then this is yours he stood and pulled on his trench coat nine oclock monday morning report to the rashid security division ask for taylor ill tell him to expect you newton looked at cook uncertain im not so sure i mean dillon leave dillon to me on the other hand if youd rather stay working as bouncers at some thirdrate nightclub feel free newton stood up and said hurriedly no were with you mr rossi which bound them to him and suited him perfectly in fact you could take the rest of the day off and do me a favor dillon has a cottage in a place called stable mews newton glanced at cook yes we know it hang around outside see where he goes follow him he took out a card my mobile number is on that if theres anything interesting give me a call within fifteen minutes of arriving at stable mews newton and cook saw dillon drive out of the garage in a mini cooper and followed him twenty minutes later they reached harley street and saw dillon park and walk up steps to a door a brass plate beside it and go in ill go newton said he checked the plate frowned and came back to the car then called rossi on his mobile it says professor the reverend susan hadentaylor clinical psychiatrist and hes still in there yes ill come straight around a moment later dillon emerged but didnt return to his car instead he went down the street turned the corner and crossed the road to a church newton saw him go inside paused then crossed the road himself he phoned rossi who was in his car hes gone round the corner to a church called st pauls and get this the priests name on the notice board is the same as the psychiatrists ill be with you in a few minutes rossi told him and switched off now what in the hell was dillon up to the church was victorian and smelled of damp also of burning candles and incense it was a dark and secret place only the altar glowing in candlelight a statue of the virgin and child to one side it was oldfashioned church of england but it always took dillon back to his roman catholic childhood and the jesuits whod had a hand in his education remember wee sean he said one corruption is all corruption by the small things shalt thou know them and how many times had that helped him over the years of course in the end it meant you didnt trust anybody the vestry door was closed he listened to the murmur of voices sighed and sat in one of the pews thinking of kate rashid two churches in one day old son this could get to be a habit behind him marco rossi slipped in cautiously through the open door saw him faded into the darkness at the rear and sank onto a rushbottomed chair behind a pillar in the corner after a while the vestry door opened and a young girl emerged crying a little professor susan hadentaylor was with her a calm pleasant woman in a clerical collar and a cassock she put an arm round the girl who was carrying a bag off you go mary theyre expecting you st pauls hospice sloan street stay as long as you like well sort it out together god bless and god bless you reverend the girl moved out professor hadentaylor didnt notice dillon in the gloom of the other side of the aisle picked up a broom from somewhere went to the altar and started to sweep the floor if its not one thing its another with you dillon said comforting the weak and then brushing the bloody floor she paused turned and saw him seventeen sean thats all and with no one to help her and shes not weak shes just been diagnosed with breast cancer god dammit he exploded me and my big mouth its your nature she said calmly god i feel rotten can i help could i give you a check easily done sean after all youre a rich man all that money for a wicked deed trying to see off the prime minister she smiled like an angel but ill take the check the hospice needs to have the central heating refurbished and some plumbing work in the kitchen its the hard woman you are but its a deal excellent she sat in a pew two rows away facing him not that it will do your immortal soul much good mark you you can have a cigarette if you want god wont mind the decent ould stick he is dillon lit up so now what a final debriefing ferguson said i thought id covered everything i just want you to cover it again why its called catharsis sean a kind of mental outpouring which could be good for you thats an unlocking of things youve been turning away from like thirty years with the ira all the killing youve got to be joking all right your conflict with the rashids you killed all three brothers who were trying to kill me you ruined kate rashids plans and she tried to kill billy salter you came back to london angry and she tried to have you kidnapped youve heard all this and i want to hear it again tell me everything all right i told the guys i jumped to tell rupert dauncey id be calling in at dauncey place in the early hours of the morning how did you feel well i armed myself to the teeth and drove down from london ferguson hadnt ordered it this was me he lit another cigarette and drifted into the past i liked kate rashid always did but she was barking mad responsible for too much blood and billy was the last straw in a way he ignored her thinking back i always told myself the ira all the killing was because my father was killed in the crossfire of a firefight between provos and brit paratroopers in belfast but driving down that morning in the darkness and rain i remembered one of my favorite philosophers heidegger for authentic living he said what is necessary is the resolute confrontation of death so what if for me its been a mad game constantly seeking death any psychiatrist worth their salt could have come up with that one did you believe that he smiled not really only as a motivation so what happened at the house i already told you i let rupert get the drop on me why because i think i was a little mad too that morning a death wish i was on the edge and shed gone way over the edge she had the black eagle on her private landing strip so rupert tied my hands we got on board and took off she made it clear he was going to throw me out at three thousand feet i had a knife in my boot and cut myself free and rupert dropped the airstairs door i had a small colt in an ankle holster full of surprises me i shot him in the head and pushed him out and she went right over said wed go to hell together the black eagle has an ignition key she switched off and threw the key out i took over the control and made an engineless water landing unfortunately she had a gun in her purse and tried to shoot me i managed to jump out with the dinghy and she went down with the plane he shrugged but you know all this do you feel any different now absolutely not what would you say was the worst moment he frowned two i suppose being swept in on the sussex bore at such speed in the dinghy and then finding rupert daunceys body alongside all the way into the estuary marsh we grounded at the old abandoned pier at marsham which was when you called ferguson i had my mobile with me i filled him in and what did he do came down with the disposal team from london i sat under the pier for three hours in the rain and waited the disposal team from the crematorium we use in north london rupert dauncey became eight pounds of gray ash very quickly did that bother you not really he was responsible for many things but the death of the young daughter of a friend particularly damned him and kate rashid id seen the gps as we went down in the sea so i knew where she was ferguson gave the job to the royal marine special boat squadron we went in an old fishing boat you chose to go thats right found her in the cabin at ninety feet you saw her i pulled her out went up with her on the line you have to do that slowly from ninety feet it must have been quite an experience you could say that he lit another cigarette going through it all again has it helped i dont feel particularly cathartic whats that make me psychotic she said calmly theres a quotation there are men of a rough persuasion who are willing to take care of the kinds of situations that ordinary people cant theyre called soldiers i know that one and you couldnt have paid me a greater compliment if thats all ill be on my way thanks love take care dillon he turned away paused and turned back look sometimes i get this dream im going down to the plane and i reach it and hang on and look inside and she isnt there does that make any kind of sense perfectly she shook her head my poor dillon such a good man in spite of everything and yet you are what you are youre a great comfort watch your back my friend isnt that what they say in belfast he went and she turned went up to the altar and knelt in prayer behind her marco rossi tiptoed out the baron was using the rashid house in south audley street not far from park lane he sat by the fire in the georgian living room and listened intently when marco was finished the old man took a deep breath get me a brandy marco we always suspected this but its still a shock marco went and got the drink gave it to him and offered a cigarette from a silver case so what do you want me to do nothing yet well see what the prime minister has to say tomorrow and then marco you didnt meet kate rashid it was just before you came into my life and our business dealings of their very nature had to be private but one thing is a fact i am only sitting here now because of her i can only pay her back in one way what she failed to achieve i will achieve for her marco looked taken aback what you dont mean cazalet oh i have something in mind for the president all right but well take it slowly ferguson and dillon come first yes first well deal with them im sure youll be up for that marco wont you at downing street the following morning the baron and marco rossi were admitted and shown to the cabinet room where they found ferguson and blake johnson waiting standing on either side of the prime minister who sat in his usual center chair baron he said please be seated this wont take long the baron sat and rossi stood behind him i appreciate your frankness what is the problem prime minister berger international was already giving us problems your dealings with iraq for example are not acceptable its a free market not when it comes to armsdealing now we hear of your connection with rashid and your control over the oil market it wont do not in the context of terrorism and the middle east and southern arabia to be frank my government will place every obstacle we can think of in your way excellent the baron stood up so now we know where we stand good morning prime minister and he walked out followed by rossi the prime minister turned to ferguson keep an eye on him general i dont trust that man one bit outside number ten the baron was still sitting in his rollsroyce the door open rossi standing beside it as ferguson approached was there something else baron dont bother with your disposal team general im not rupert dauncey oh dear im afraid i dont know what youre talking about ferguson said dont bother i know everything so what does that mean it means that i am declaring jihad on you in memory of my dear friend kate rashid tell that to dillon and the rest of your friends rossi joined him closed the door and they drove away well to quote our hostile friend at least now we know where we stand charles blake shook hands ill see you ferguson went to his daimler the chauffeur standing beside it dillon was waiting in the rear and ferguson joined him he punched a number on his mobile it was answered instantly who is this roper this is ferguson get yourself down to the dark man and bring the file youve prepared on von berger weve got problems will sean be with you yes on my way as they drove off dillon said well oh the prime minister put the boot in hard no kind of government cooperation theyll place all sorts of obstacles in the barons way and how did he take it hes just declared jihad on all of us in memory of kate rashid and he told me he wasnt a candidate for the disposal team thats interesting he knows dillon god knows how so i think its time we had a council of war well that makes sense dillon lit a cigarette quite like old times as they progressed through the usual bad london traffic dillon thought about von berger and what he would entail the daimler turned along a narrow lane between warehouse developments and came out on a wharf beside the thames they parked outside the dark man salters pub its painted sign showing a sinister individual in a dark cloak the main bar was very victorian mirrors mahogany bars behind porcelain beer pumps dora the barmaid sat on a stool reading the london evening standard the afternoon trade was light except for four men in the corner booth and a fifth alongside harry salter his nephew billy his minders joe baxter and sam hall and major roper in his wheelchair harry salter looked up saw dillon first you little irish bastard and you general whats going on oh a great deal harry ferguson squeezed in weve got trouble and it affects all of us how are you roper the man in the stateoftheart wheelchair smiled he wore a reefer coat his hair down to his shoulders and his face was a taut mass of the scar tissue associated with burns a royal engineers bomb disposal expert decorated with the george cross his extraordinary career had been terminated by what he called a silly little bomb in a family car in belfast hed survived and discovered a whole new career in computers now if you wanted to find out anything in cyberspace it was roper you called im fine general and you have the file yes good excellent here what goes on harry salter asked ferguson said you see to the drinks dillon and ill fill them in afterward harry salter said so were back with kate rashid she was going to knock us all off and now this geezer has taken over dillon standing at the bar was joined by billy who said what do you think dillon i think hes serious business billy well weve handled serious business before yes and it got you a bullet through your neck eighteen stitches in your face and two bullets through the pelvis dillon im fit now i work with a personal trainer every day billy you jumped out of an airplane for me at four hundred feet twice its over that kind of thing so im still good on the street well see younger brother behind them ferguson had finished harry salter said a right bastard this one just as bad as her so it would appear what do you think roper well the coming together of rashid and berger does make them one of the most powerful corporations in the world its the apotheosis of capitalism if that doesnt sound too marxist ferguson nodded its like a bad novel the whole thing he turned to harry salter ive had a trying morning harry could i have your famous shepherds pie and an indifferent red wine im in need of comfort at the rashid house in south audley street the baron sat in the drawing room with marco so whats our game plan marco asked lets start by taking some action against the small fry these gangsters the salters ill work something out i have newton and cook keeping dillons place under surveillance any particular reason just to keep an eye on him see where he goes what contacts he makes ive given newton the addresses of those involved on a regular basis with him also computer photos where did you get those from the computer right here in the study theres a mass of information there details of various schemes and operations kate rashid has put into play business of a sort ill leave it all to you for the moment marco with the merger of the two companies i have enough on my hands just keep me informed of course father marco said and went out the next morning the council of war had moved to ropers apartment in regency square it was on the ground floor with its own entrance and a slope to aid wheelchair users roper insisted on looking after himself and had had the apartment from bathroom to kitchen specially designed to take care of his problems his sitting room had been turned into a stateoftheart computer laboratory including some highly classified equipment which was there mainly because it suited charles ferguson over the years since his disaster in belfast roper had become a legend in the world of computers he had broken every kind of system from moscow to washington and he had proved his worth to ferguson and the prime minister on more than one occasion on that morning sean dillon arrived first in his mini cooper parked and pressed the doorbell the voice box crackled and roper said who is it sean you idiot let me in the door swung open and he went through into the sitting room and found roper in his wheelchair at the bank of computers he crossed to a sideboard found a bottle of irish whiskey and poured one paddy okay well its not bushmills but youre improving im on a pension dillon the ministry of defence being as parsimonious as it is i have to watch my pennies you could always sell your medals the military cross would do okay but the george cross would make a fortune youre always so amusing roper tried a smile always difficult with that ravaged burned face dont start feeling sorry for yourself ferguson said you had found something yes but lets wait for them the front doorbell went and he pressed the remote control here they are a moment later ferguson appeared and with him a woman in her late thirties with red hair wearing an armani trouser suit she looked like some highlevel business executive but she was fergusons assistant detective superintendent hannah bernstein on loan to him from special branch she had an ma in psychology from oxford but she had killed more than once in the line of duty ah dillon the general said we can get straight on with it what have you got for us major you wanted me to have a look at von berger in general the way hes been able to take over rashid well i discovered something interesting a couple of years ago he hiked two billion into rashid for their oil exploration in hazar and the empty quarter there was silence hannah said where on earth would he get that sort of money swiss banks and it made me smell a rather large rat it was dillon who said let me guess were into nazi gold and not only that said roper i got this story from an israeli intelligence source von berger was in baghdad to see saddam on some arms deal and he was attacked by a mob in the old city they were going to lynch him when kate rashid came on the scene with a few bedus pistol in hand and saved his life i can see it now dillon said not being able to sleep at twothirty in the morning as often happens roper went on i decided to go back even further on von berger you know that story that he left berlin in a storch that happened to be there as a backup in case von greims arado had problems he told american and british intelligence that it was simply opportunistic he knew it was waiting in goebbelss garage and commandeered it only you dont buy it dillon put in not for a moment it was all too convenient so i decided to access the führer bunker on my computer i worked through the records office the accounts of his interrogations then i got into the university of berlins stuff on the bunker all the people there those who died those who faded away those who rushed into the night in a mostly vain attempt to escape the russians von bergers escape was obviously logged where is this getting us hannah asked theyve kept their records updated would you like to know how many people who were in the führer bunker in are still in the land of the living now ferguson said other than eightyyearold max von berger yes how would you like sara hesser an ss auxiliary who was used by the führer as a relief secretary for his last six months in the bunker she was twentytwo years old in april that makes her seventynine now jesus dillon said ferguson said youre obviously leading up to something yes you could say that in the final debacle when everyone fled the bunker by some miracle she was one of those who got through the underground tunnels and finally reached the west she was in the hands of british intelligence in munich interrogated and released in she met a british captain called george grant who was serving in the army of occupation he married her two years later and what happened hannah demanded she came to england he was a lawyer they never had children according to her interrogation reports shed been gangraped by russian soldiers my god hannah said and now her husband died of cancer five years ago she lives at twentythree brick lane thats in wapping by the thames you can extract anything from these things he tapped the computer its a threestoried terrace house that she and her husband owned for fortyfive years the way london property has gone these days its worth nine hundred thousand i think that deserves another drink dillon went to the paddy bottle ferguson said youre telling us that we have a woman who was a secretary to hitler in the last few months of the war oh yes marrying an english officer and all that she just got lost i suppose and she would have known von berger must have known him said dillon i should imagine so hannah said but what would she have to say god knows said ferguson but i think its worth paying a visit dont you the daimler left first with hannah and ferguson inside and dillon followed in the mini cooper newton said to cook follow them which one well see where it leads he phoned marco rossi on his mobile dillon went to ropers house in regency square then ferguson turned up with bernstein theyve all come out again and were following good stay with it the minute they arrive at any kind of destination phone me brick lane ran down to the thames a row of nineteenthcentury houses on one side mainly renovated the front doors opened to the street which was the only place to park a church was on the other side st marys and a graveyard by the river a path ran beside a low wall leading to a jetty at the far end that stuck out into the water a relic of the old days when barge traffic called in on a regular basis there was a shop at the end of the street called patels the kind that had prospered under indian ownership a general store at that time of the day there was plenty of parking available and certainly in front of number twentythree the daimler turned in and dillon pulled in behind dillon was first out and went to the door there was a bell push and beneath it a brass plate george and sara grant he said as ferguson joined him dillon pressed the bell and heard a dog barking there was the sound of footsteps approaching a bolt being withdrawn the door opened on a chain be quiet benny a voice said a face peered out worn and lined very gray hair pulled back from it above faded blue eyes and when she spoke it was almost a whisper what is it hannah took over mrs grant yes im detective superintendent bernstein she held up her warrant card special branch scotland yard this is general charles ferguson wed like a word my dear ferguson told her there was immediate alarm on her face the police what have i done it was dillon who interjected in excellent german dont worry liebling were not the gestapo information is what we seek but about what every instinct told him to be honest about the führer bunker about those last few months and particularly about what happened to sturmbahnführer max von berger on the thirtieth of april oh my god she said in german youve come for me after all these years but she pulled the chain and opened the door there was a little scottie dog running around her ankles yapping dillon picked him up and fondled him and the dog stopped barking and tried to lick his face the old lady said i dont understand he never takes to strangers oh i have a way with dogs ever since childhood benny is it he handed the scottie to her all we want is a few words theres nothing bad intended i give you my word she held the dog looked at dillon and touched his face with her other hand for a moment and when she spoke it was in english whats your name dillon maam her eyes became vacant for a moment yes i believe you youre a good man mr dillon in spite of yourself dillon almost choked and took a deep breath trust me no harm will come to you on this earth i swear it then come in and she turned and led the way along the hall newton and cook pulled in farther down brick lane close to the shop you stay here and ill take a look newton said and walked back to the house fergusons chauffeur was on the other side of the road smoking a cigarette and walking to the river newton quickly checked the brass plate then returned to the car sara and george grant ill have words in the shop a middleaged indian was leaning on the counter reading the evening standard he glanced up the shop for the moment quiet i seem to be wasting my time as usual newton said can you help me im a debt collector and i was given an anthony smith as being behind in rental payments on a car ive come to check the address i was given twentythree brick lane only its a sara and george grant youve been had patel said a false address the grants have been there forever mr grant died five years ago mrs grant lives there on her own nice old lady german actually is that so and she doesnt own a car really and german you say definitely she told me her name once hesser sara hesser lived there more than forty years another wasted journey but thanks anyway newton went back to the car rang marco rossi on his mobile and explained what was going on rossi said stay there and ill be in touch in the sitting room at south audley street the baron was going through some papers when marco entered when you told me of your final interview with the führer you mentioned a secretary an ss auxiliary called sara hesser is this important it is if shes still in the land of the living and resides at twentythree brick lane wapping youre certain of this absolutely he told the baron of the sequence of events the fact that theyve gone straight to this womans house speaks for itself thank god this indian shopkeeper knows her well or wed have been totally in the dark what do we do nothing the baron said if the woman tells what she knows to ferguson he will come and see me what do you mean the baron gave him a look its time i told you something marco you know of the hitler diary but only what ive told you youve never read it yes and ive often wondered why because theres a secret in it in the führer entered into negotiations with president roosevelt in an effort to promote a negotiated peace the idea was for the germans and americans to turn on the russians to defeat a common enemy roosevelt didnt buy it but he did discuss it hitler sent general walter schellenberg of the ss to sweden and roosevelt sent an american multimillionaire and senator named jake cazalet there was a moments silence then marco said but thats the name of the president of the united states and of jake cazalets father he was a member of roosevelts kitchen cabinet has it occurred to you how that would look that roosevelt with cazalet as his agent actually had such dealings with hitler true it didnt come to anything but what capital americas enemies around the world would make of it cazalet would be finished he smiled ive held this secret for years always certain it would eventually be of great importance its unbelievable so we wait for ferguson the baron smiled again but that doesnt mean we cant have a drink on it the sitting room was crowded not only with furniture but with the bricabrac accumulated over a long life an old grand piano stood in a corner the top crowded with photos some in silver frames the largest of a handsome young man in the uniform of an army captain ferguson picked it up your husband yes thats george he was a military policeman i was an interpreter thats how we met she sat down clutching benny on her lap i was interrogated you know by the intelligence people about being on the staff in the bunker ferguson nodded to hannah who said tell us about that mrs grant theres nothing really to tell i was an ss auxiliary a secretary a typist i was twentytwo years old i was transferred from sd headquarters in berlin sd meant ss intelligence but i was like ive told you just a young office girl so you were there for six months until april fortyfive and the final catastrophe hannah asked thats right i was a relief secretary the most junior of all i made the coffee that sort of thing dillon was filled with an enormous compassion for this woman already old and more than that old beyond her years a woman who had been at the sharp edge of history but also a woman who was lying so you knew the führer hannah asked of course but the others were far more important than me the other secretaries i mean hannah nodded and sturmbahnführer baron von berger you knew him oh yes the old lady stroked bennys head he was in the bunker for the last three months wounded in russia he came to be decorated and the führer took a fancy to him made him an aide i see was there anything special about him no the old lady said the last couple of days were terrible everything was confused then the führer and his wife committed suicide and we all scattered ran for it a lot of us went through the underground tunnels some of us made it i reached the west and the americans a couple of weeks later she shook her head as if looking back into a past that she didnt want to see but i went through all this with the british intelligence people all those years ago ferguson interrupted so you didnt see anything of von berger at the end she shrugged he was there and then he wasnt but that was true of so many people hannah carried on and yet we know that von berger escaped from berlin in a storch aircraft he was a prisoner of war for a couple of years then became a hugely successful businessman i know nothing of that please believe me i was just a relief secretary nobody of any importance she said almost vacantly i made the coffee and because she was old and tired and her guard was down she added the führer liked it black and not too strong the second cup he liked with brown sugar of course at the end he had the palsy his hands shook very much and i had to pour for him he had to lift the cup with both hands it was very awkward when he was dictating in the astonished silence that followed hannah said the führer dictated to you but you told us you were a nobody the old woman looked at her dazed put a hand to her face and dillon in one of the cruelest acts of his life shouted at her in german fräulein hesser you have been less than honest you will speak hannah started to protest for gods sake sean but he pushed her aside and towered over the old lady you took dictation from the führer didnt you yes she was terrified what kind of dictation explain her head shook from side to side frantically no i dare not i swore a holy oath to serve the führer already hating himself dillon raised his voice and thundered at her what was so special you will tell me she broke then and answered him in german for six months each day he dictated his diary to me hannah spoke excellent german and ferguson spoke enough to understand dear god in heaven hitlers bloody diary he said dillon knelt down and kissed sara hesser on the forehead im sorry i frightened you its all right now he hugged her just one more thing what you said about max von berger it wasnt true was it her eyes had filled with tears no he was there in the führers study on the thirtieth i was there too the führer had a mission for him to fly out of berlin in a plane hidden in goebbelss garage to do what hannah asked why to save the diary a holy book the führer called it he said it must never be copied ferguson said the diary was completely up to date then oh yes up to that very day i covered the last six months of the war all the traitors all those who let him down accounts of everything his attempts to negotiate a peace with president roosevelt the secret meetings in sweden the silence was breathtaking his what charles ferguson whispered oh yes she said i wrote down every word general and in spite of the years i remember everything which was exactly what she proceeded to tell them they left half an hour later and paused by the daimler god you were a bastard back there hannah said to dillon he certainly was ferguson said but it worked it was all those years ago but the ss training never goes away dillon said the shouted command the harsh voice and the response is a reflex anyway now we know where max von bergers millions came from ferguson said and cant do a thing about it hannah said were also in possession of the uncomfortable fact that in hitler made a peace overture to roosevelt and roosevelt took it seriously enough to send jake cazalets father to sweden to discuss it with hitlers representative ferguson said but sir if nothing came of it does it matter hannah said oh yes my dear it most certainly does and the involvement of the presidents father makes it worse the media would have a field day roosevelt cazalet and hitler he shook his head it could do the president great harm and at the worst finish him dillon said yes come on lets go see von berger im your man said dillon and hurried to his car as the daimler drove away hannah said to ferguson i hope the old lady will be all right sir yes im sorry about that but it had to be done what do you intend to say to the baron ferguson smiled i havent the slightest idea superintendent newton and cook let them leave and then followed twenty minutes later newton called were just passing the dorchester theyre turning into south audley street fine hang around in case i need you rossi switched off his phone and turned it would seem they intend to pay us a visit max von berger smiled well that should be interesting at the rashid house a maid in a black dress and white apron opened the door hannah said is baron von berger at home general ferguson would like a word yes miss youre expected please follow me she led the way upstairs from the hall and opened the door to the drawing room where the baron sat by the fire marco standing by the window general what a surprise what can i do for you ferguson turned to hannah tell him superintendent afterward the baron shook his head an amazing story ridiculous of course but then what would one expect from an old lady who obviously went through traumatic times in the war she obviously suffers from some delusion some fantasy that she knew the führer i was an aide in the bunker for three months and certainly knew the staff i cant recall a sara hesser well you would say that ould son wouldnt you dillon told him mind you im intrigued by the whole idea the baron said perhaps the superintendent could give me the view from scotland yard if for example i were in control of deposits in private accounts in switzerland would that constitute a crime in the uk hannah glanced at ferguson no sir it would not and if someone gave you their diary for safekeeping would that be illegal of course not but for gods sake lets cut the nonsense and get down to facts ferguson said we now know the truth about how you got out of berlin and why we also know the source of your money the money that got you started again after the war and then theres the diary a holy book sara hesser said a most fanciful idea especially when it records meetings in sweden between hitlers gobetween and president cazalets father as i said a fanciful idea the baron smiled though it certainly wouldnt help jake cazalets political future much would it he smiled again but all this is nonsense stories of the führers diary have abounded for years charlatans and forgers have tried to produce such items repeatedly now we have the fantasy of some aging lady no it wont do even if both british and german records indicate that she was indeed there in the bunker oh really hmm well there you are then im afraid theres not more i can add general though if all of this were true the prospect of it being revealed would be very unpleasant for the president i should think you take my meaning i certainly do ferguson nodded to hannah and dillon lets go and he led the way out marco poured an irish whiskey and took it to his father bravo you deserve it he never knew what hit him ferguson is a very astute man marco he wont let it go and this thing could easily leak but wouldnt that accomplish your aim to hurt the president but i dont want it to happen yet i want it to be on my terms and at a time to suit me he sipped his whiskey but the game is in motion now the ball as the english say is in fergusons court he sighed hitler offered her a seat in my plane it would have got her out and she refused said it was her duty to stay with him he shook his head she should have died with the others marco lit a cigarette and walked to the window staring out into south audley street yes it really would have been better when you think of it march weather dusk falling early rain drifting in across the thames and in the darkness of the porch of the church in brick lane marco rossi waited in a black trench coat and rain hat rossi wasnt sure what he intended to do and had certainly not mentioned to the baron what he was up to and yet there was a certain inevitability to things he hadnt driven in his own car and had taken a taxi to wapping high street and walked the rest of the way which perhaps meant something hed been there an hour watching the house not sure what he was waiting for and then a light went on over the door it creaked open and the old lady appeared with the scottie on a lead she was wearing a headscarf and a raincoat and put up an umbrella good boy benny she said and set off down the pavement for the corner shop whose lights were still on rossi hurried along the other side of the churchyard and paused at the end by the wall opposite the shop where the old jetty jutted out into the river there was no rail just a single lamp giving a subdued glow the old lady turned onto the jetty and walked to the end with benny rossi seizing his opportunity darted up behind her as she gazed out at the bright lights of a riverboat passing by put both hands on her back and pushed her over into the water she had released her grip on the lead and the dog barked and ran to the edge of the jetty rossi looked down saw her flounder and go under he dashed away as quickly as he had come to the shelter of the churchyard and from there made his way back to wapping high street it was perhaps twenty minutes later that mr patel distracted by bennys constant barking went outside and found the little dog still with his lead on him at the end of the jetty what is it benny patel demanded retrieved his lead then looked over and saw her frail body half in the water below the following morning charles ferguson was having breakfast when his phone rang sir its bernstein isnt this a bit early even for you superintendent just listen sir i put mrs sara grant on the special branch priority one list just to keep an eye on her and she was found in the thames last night just off that jetty at the end of brick lane the indian gentleman mr patel who owns the store heard the dog barking and went to investigate he found it at the end of the jetty with its lead still on and she was in the water dear god ferguson said where is she now wapping mortuary oh were such idiots superintendent look well have to fasttrack the postmortem ill telephone professor george langley and ask him to do it this morning that is fast sir hell do it for me you will use your authority to take over the case from the wapping police its a code one matter from now on ill sign the warrant brook no interference from anyone and notify dillon dillon was on his morning run from stable mews the hood of his tracksuit up against a light drizzle when his mobile sounded and hannah said its me sean at this time in the morning jesus girl am i finally getting through to you shut up sean its bad news and she told him dillon stopped in a doorway stunned are you still there sean yes im here what do you think it stinks thats what i think the rage was in his voice she said sean dont do anything stupid we have to be sure george langley will do the postmortem later this morning hes the best there is hes put more murderers behind bars than even you can imagine if theres the smallest thing wrong hell find it hed better dillon said by god hed better she rang off and dillon stayed there for a while in the doorway then walked away he went home and changed then drove to ropers place and found him in the sitting room at the computers the major said youre early that means somethings up dillon told him then went and found the bottle of paddy whiskey and poured a glass its early even for me but i need it he swallowed it down what do you think she was certainly a mine of information which von berger immediately denied as the fantasy of an aging woman who promptly has some sort of accident and ends up in the thames very useful that happening roper said yes its all true everything she told us von bergers mission from hitler his final flight out of berlin the diary all true and now the source of that information is dead roper said dillons face was drawn i told her to trust me i swore no harm would come to her you know what she said to me youre a good man mr dillon in spite of yourself im sorry sean i know somebody wholl be a damn sight sorrier when ive finished with them wait for the postmortem of course i will dillon looked like the devil himself as he left it was the middle of the afternoon when ferguson hannah and dillon arrived at wapping mortuary in response to professor langleys call the reception area was pleasant enough and hannah went to the desk and spoke to a young woman who picked up a phone im sorry professor langley is just cleaning up hell be with you shortly ferguson and hannah sat down dillon lit a cigarette and stood looking out the window ferguson said you seem restless dillon no angry calm yourself well have the result soon we have that now the only result was her death and dont tell me it could have been a coincidence neither you nor i believe in them very much not in our business before ferguson could reply a small grayhaired energetic man entered hello charles ferguson shook hands thanks for rushing this through george detective superintendent bernstein here is the case officer sean dillon is a colleague sorry about the delay would you care to see the body it was dillon who cut in yes very much ferguson nodded and langley said this way then the room he led them to was lined with white tiles the fluorescent lighting was strangely harsh and several steel operating tables stood in a line there was a body on the first one covered with a white rubber sheet mrs sara grant do you know this woman personally charles we all do ill just show you her face then the rest is rather unpleasant autopsies usually are she looked surprisingly calm even the lines on her face seemingly smoothed at peace in a way not a mark on her langley said nor anywhere there was no fight here no blows or wounds the only reason for death was drowning dillon said youre certain of that absolutely i noticed in the police report that the local shopkeeper who found her regularly saw her at night walking her dog along the jetty she liked to stand at the end and watch the boats ive visited the spot myself theres no handrail and a thirtyfoot drop into the river youre sure there were no marks at all professor hannah said no indication of any kind of a struggle not even bruising from the fall into the water of course she was wearing a trouser suit and a heavy overcoat is there anything else you can tell us only that she had lung cancer wouldnt have lasted more than a few months anyway death by drowning charles thats the best i can do dammit dillon said there has to be more no mr dillon she fell from the end of the jetty and drowned now as to whether she had any help which i know is what youre wondering about i couldnt possibly comment on that all i can say is that there are no signs of bruising which on a woman as old and frail as she was means no violence of even the mildest kind he turned to ferguson charles i realize that this is probably some sort of intelligence matter and no doubt classified im happy not to know any more many thanks george ferguson shook hands dillon said thats it then nothing sorry mr dillon langley walked to the door with them oh wait a minute there was something else and what would that be ferguson demanded ive done thousands of postmortems over the years and this was a first for me the number tattooed in her left armpit not on the arm like in the concentration camps but in the armpit it means she served in the ss he smiled but then you would know more about that than me charles in the back of the daimler dillon pulled the glass screen across cutting off the chauffeur they did it general the bastards took her out but how hannah said we never mentioned any address oh come on hannah once they knew she existed how long do you think it took rossi to trace her but thats enough said ferguson squabbling wont bring her back superintendent get von berger on the line for me it was marco who answered the phone and passed it to his father general the baron said what now fräulein sara hesser has turned up in the thames its time for us to talk now why would you prefer me to present a warrant and make it official theres no need for the crudities general ill tell you what lets make it civilized the piano bar at the dorchester lets say seven all right and bring your thug with you he hung up the baron handed the phone back to rossi he doesnt seem to like you much marco sara hesser was discovered in the thames today my god rossi managed to sound horrified do you know anything about this father on my life i swear to you the baron raised a hand well ferguson obviously thinks we do it should be an interesting evening and just to make sure remember this newton and cook dont exist and weve never heard of brick lane only half a dozen people were in the piano bar when ferguson arrived with dillon and hannah dillon wandered over to the piano as he often did and began to play a foggy day in london town hannah came and leaned on the piano ive never understood this sean the piano you seem to be good at so many things you mean like killing people he smiled dont be deceived hannah good barroom piano is all youre angry that always worries me yes good and angry im a bad man hannah ive walked over plenty of corpses but theres something about sara hessers death that grinds at me she deserved better the waiter was pouring champagne when max von berger and rossi appeared at the top of the steps by the bar the baron sat opposite ferguson and hannah rossi and dillon stood in a way confronting each other so what is this about general tell him superintendent when she was finished the baron sighed so this poor lady falls off the jetty and your professor langley confirms she died of drowning with no suspicious circumstances so what does this have to do with me the fact that she died at all is a suspicious circumstance dillon said marco rossi said you dont have a leg to stand on dillon this meeting is not only futile its offensive enough ferguson said were not talking legalities were talking truth we may not be able to arrest you but you know and we know what happened i know no such thing said the baron really marco is right this is most offensive the baron stood dillon said to rossi what did you do push her over rossi took a step toward him and hannah grabbed seans arm let it go the barons face was grim i think well leave now and he walked out followed by his son in the car outside he said quietly you had nothing to do with this swear it to me on my life she was an old woman who had a tragic accident thats all but as ferguson puts it most fortunate for us that his son was lying naturally occurred to him but he pushed the thought away and leaned back in his own car ferguson clicked off his phone and immediately dialed again his direct codex four line to the basement office at the white house johnson at his desk answered at once yes ferguson charles how goes it rather badly ive just talked to the prime minister he wants me to go to washington immediately and speak to the president personally ill bring dillon with me sorry charles but the presidents gone to his house on nantucket for the weekend can i do anything its a very grave matter that affects him personally there was a pause all right go straight to andrews air force base theyll take you there by helicopter and make a beach landing ill arrange it he hesitated this is a bad one charles very much so then ill get down there myself i think that would be wise old boy youll be going to war again i assure you he hung up johnson sat at his desk frowning then picked up the phone and rang the president on his direct line nantucket the daimler arrived at farley field was passed through by raf police and drove to where the citation x waited the airstairs door down squadron leader lacey and flight lieutenant parry stood waiting both held the air force cross an acknowledgment of many hazardous missions on fergusons behalf on more than one occasion theyd dropped sean dillon by parachute into uncertain landings they were essential parts of fergusons tightly knit highly secret group both were in raf uniform i see youve dressed appropriately for once ferguson said some of our closest friends are at andrews air force base sir youre right an raf sergeant a small energetic woman came down the steps june walters general ill be looking after you follow me please she led the way and ferguson obeyed hello boys dillon said here we go again lacey said is this serious business sean well i wouldnt book any outofseason holidays for the next few weeks terrific parry said its always so interesting when you appear nice plane dillon said yes brandnew do you like it fastest commercial plane in the world next to the concorde lacey told him thats impressive lets get on with it then and dillon went up into the aircraft they took off shortly afterward fasttracked by air traffic control as a priorityone flight climbed steadily west and had lifted to fifty thousand feet as they reached the atlantic sergeant walters appeared ive got minestrone soup melon steak new potatoes and vegetables she turned to dillon i understand you like plain food sir theres an item called an irish potato pie lamb onion and dumplings dillon said jesus woman thats what you call plain food she smiled apparently a drink gentlemen bring me a bushmills whiskey and open a bottle of a halfway decent champagne and well share it she restrained laughter glanced at ferguson who nodded and she went away dillon lit a cigarette so what are you going to say to cazalet the truth about this whole affair as we know it and what will he say god knows hes an admirable and decent man and hes suffered many blows in his personal life his wife died of leukemia his father the elder jake cazalet who figures so prominently in the diary was killed in a car accident years ago the kidnapping of his daughter no one knows better than you it was you and blake who saved her dillon held out his hand took the whiskey sergeant walters offered and swallowed it but if this von berger thing leaks the great american public wont give a stuff about whats gone before will it sergeant walters handed them a glass of champagne each youre a cynic sean ferguson said a realist but there you go calling me by my first name again which means that you want me to handle it the hard way he raised his glass cheers charlie cheers sean youre always so dependable on the beach at the old family house on nantucket the president walked with his favorite secret service man an enormous black exmarine named clancy smith and blake johnson the presidents dog murchison a flatcoated retriever ran in and out of the surf the sea was rough the wind keen cazalet spoke to clancy and asked for a cigarette and clancy lit a marlboro inside his coat and passed it blake said ive told you before sir there are voters who would hold that against you were all entitled to a weakness blake and these things got you and me through the vietnam war murchison jumped up and he patted him now if i should beat this wonderful dog that would lose me votes by the thousands blake lit a cigarette for himself inside his storm coat i give in mr president so ferguson gave you no idea of what all this is about only that its a bad one then thats bad enough there was a roaring in the distance and they turned and saw the helicopter landing on the beach beside the house god the sound of those things it always takes me back to the war cazalet said lets go and greet our guests and see whats gone wrong cazalet had always cherished his quiet weekends on nantucket he preferred to have only the housekeeper cum cook mrs boulder organize things and bring in whoever she needed to clean or run the place when he wasnt there so when they sat down in the large drawing room it was only cazalet blake and smith with ferguson and dillon sitting opposite ferguson covered the entire story there was silence the president said obviously blake informed me of the events at kate rashids funeral but this i never expected anything like this there was another pause blake said is it really that bad mr president its not as if anything actually happened dillon said may i speak sir of course your father senator jake cazalet his position in all this is clear he acted under orders and in good faith as president roosevelts man in a most delicate and secret situation that is true in a strange way hitlers emissary general walter schellenberg of the ss was in a similar situation he was not a nazi party member in fact after the war he was tried and found guilty only of being a member of an illegal organization the ss so i could be found guilty of being a member of the ira for more years than i care to remember but that wouldnt change what schellenberg personally felt he was simply the führers mouthpiece and your father was roosevelts mouthpiece dillon watch yourself ferguson said no cazalet put his hand up hes right dillon nodded but you need to explore deeper than that because as sure as hell the press will what do you mean blake asked well many experts would say that roosevelt perhaps did show an interest because hitlers overtures included the idea of halting the red menace seeping into western europe so lets say roosevelt toyed with the idea or why bother sending cazalet in the first place it was cazalet who said go on but he considers all the facts and changes his mind that change of mind would be what all the experts and the press would seize on what the hell are you talking about dillon ferguson asked that close to the end of things the american army crossed the elbe general george pattons tanks could have roared up the autobahn and reached berlin in twentyfour hours only they didnt they were ordered to stay where they were by eisenhower because roosevelt had decided after word from stalin that the russians were entitled to seize berlin and so began fortyfive years of cold war not to mention one hundred thousand german women raped there was a heavy silence and it was jake cazalet who said youre right everything you say is right everything i say is what the world will seize on because the president sent him there your father will be part of it and because he was your father you sir will be part of it in my opinion that is what baron max von berger has already worked out everyone stirred uneasily it was blake who said then how on earth can one combat him do we try preempting the whole thing spilling the story first it was ferguson who said its the story thats the trouble i agree the president said and the trouble is gentlemen im engaged in world affairs of great moment to be arguing with the united nations over iraq with the threat of a scandal like this hanging over us it would be a disaster my opponents at home would rip me to pieces our enemies abroad would immediately take advantage so that means ferguson said looking directly at the president cazalet smiled but there was no humor to it mr dillon he said if we had that diary dillon nodded ill see what we can do sir he looked at johnson you up for it blake blake grinned im your man sean london scotland ireland meanwhile marco rossi trawling the security files at rashid investments had discovered the scale of kate rashids involvement not only in southern arabia but nearer to home in ireland in fact shed had very active arms deals brewing with both dissident ira and protestant loyalist groups kate had been very evenhanded there was one name in particular he knew a man once big with the ulster defence association who after a very public row had moved to the red hand of ulster probably the most extremist loyalist organization of all the sums of money involved were quite staggering no sense letting that all go to waste he thought this explained why he was walking through kilburn the most irish area of london on a dark evening in a black bomber jacket a walther ppk snug against his back to meet one patrick murphy mr murphy was the landlord of a public house called the orange george its outside wall painted in a way reminiscent of a protestant area in belfast marco listened to the irish music then went in the pub was full and an irish band was playing he stood at one end and a goodlooking middleaged woman came up patrick murphy is expecting me is that so she looked him over and smiled youre not having me on he reached over and stroked her cheek id love to and maybe later but pat murphy is expecting me just say marco whats your name janet well who knows janet she flushed and went into the back more excited than she had been in a long time murphy was seated in the back room a latemiddleaged man with a belly on him an account book open on the table when janet showed marco in ah mr rossi youd better sit down he nodded to janet who went out he reached for a whiskey bottle and a couple of glasses and poured good health he drank his whiskey marco ignored his and lit a cigarette so where are we murphy said i was quite thrown to get your phone call i mean derry gibson how would i be knowing a desperate character like that marco saw him for what he was a small man a gobetween useful in his small way probably in love with the idea that he was some kind of rebel youd know him because you had dealings with kate rashid a year ago and brokered a meeting for her with derry gibson who had money from the drug trade and wanted to buy arms two cargoes offloaded in county down earlier this year and a third was arranged just before kate rashids unfortunate death a twomillionpound deal was supposed to take place in a week i dont know derry gibson then im wasting my time here ill have to find another buyer for those aks and stinger missiles maybe the ira marco picked up the glass swallowed the whiskey and stood up the rear door creaked open and a hard toughlooking man of around fortyfive walked in with blond hair wearing a jacket in donegal tweed and an opennecked black shirt his voice had the distinctive ulster accent in a strange way it reminded marco of dillons just hold it right there im derry gibson why what a surprise marco said and me thinking you were at drumgoole on the down coast well i was until this idiot phoned me yesterday so you might say ive flown here in a hurry whats going on its simple you used to deal with kate rashid now shes dead and my father baron max von berger has taken over the firm im marco rossi as im sure you know and im in charge of all security matters for rashid and berger is that so yes and some other affairs as well though to be frank with all her money i wonder why kate bothered with little deals like this two million she was a romantic i suppose and the strange thing was gibsons face changed damn you dont you put her down she was a great lady one hand went inside his jacket and marco said tell you what lets put both our cards on the table and everything else he put his hand behind him found the walther and put it on the table derry gibson hesitated then took a walther of his own from his right pocket and laid it on the table as well youve got good taste in guns lets talk ive got a spanish deepsea trawler the mona lisa that should do the trick rossi said italian registration european fishery regulations allow it to be there it can drop off at drumgoole on the night indicated no problem marco smiled im not going to say hold out the cash as soon as we beach because i know you know how to play the game youll want to make more deals and you mr rossi i wonder why youre doing this youve got money too i understand yes but it keeps things interesting i like the action gibson always did in fact when the mona lisa turns up in drumgoole ill be on board ill go out from the isle of man by another boat and join her all right well have a whiskey on it and gibson picked up the bottle marco said no theres more i require a favor here in london would you happen to know a gangster called harry salter and his nephew billy it was murphy standing by the back door who exploded real villains those two harry salter was one of the top guvnors in the east end big as the krays hes gone legit in the last few years supposedly mind you the whisper is that hes into cigarette smuggling in a big way from holland the profit is enormous it pays better than heroin gibson said you would know i might what have you got against salter marco said have you ever heard of a fellow countryman of yours once a big man with the ira called sean dillon gibson said everyone in our business knows dillon that bloody fenian bastard works for the brits now you know about that of course charlesbloodyferguson hes been the scourge of the ira for years but he doesnt do the loyalist side any favors ould charles and with sean as his good right hand hes a difficult man to deal with you sound like you know dillon personally weve exchanged shots we were once in the same sewer in derry after a riot the british army always had difficulty in telling the difference between the ira and the prods it was dillon who got me out to the river he said keep running only dont run back to me or ill kill you he poured another whiskey he kills everyone thats what they say about him he stared into his glass but he got me out of the sewer and i was the enemy ive always wondered why he did that dont ask me im not into philosophy the thing is charles ferguson and the rashid family had a huge feud you may have heard of how the three brothers came to a bad end dillon killed all of them and kate rashid oh he had something to do with that too and so did ferguson and the salters lets put it this way id like to cause them a lot of grief you mean of the permanent variety not yet first a bit of mischief i hear that salter runs riverboats amongst other things thats right up and down the river murphy said westminster charing cross piers better than the bus including a boat called the river queen thats his pride and joy originally built in the thirties hes spent a fortune refurbishing her murphy said lovely boat excellent marco turned to gibson sink her for me do that and the deal arranged with kate rashid for your arms shipment goes through delivery at drumgoole on the tenth derry looked astonished thats only four days away the mona lisas already left spain i assumed youd be a sensible man gibson laughed oh its a pleasure doing business with you mr rossi as for this business with the salters thatll be a pleasure too it was past midnight when gibson and murphy drove down to wapping in a land rover past the dark man and along cable wharf where the river queen was berthed it was an area still undeveloped mainly decaying warehouses it was dark a few lights on the other side but no traffic on the river because of the hour no one was around or so it seemed unfortunately life being as uncertain as usual there was a movement from one of a stack of packing cases where an old drunk a street person named wally brown habitually kipped with his few wretched possessions disturbed by the noise he crept out and listened jesus derry i dont like it murphy its as simple as hell i go down through the engineroom hatch and open the seacocks water pours in and the boat sinks now do as youre told and well be out of here before you know it fuck me up and youll end up in the river too theres no need for that derry yes well this arms deal with rossi means a lot to me with that final arms shipment ill be ready to take on the ira for real itll be just like the old days the great days im your man derry i wont let you down then lets get on with it they went up the gangplank to the river queen and wally brown having heard everything crept back and cowered inside his packing case murphy stayed on deck to stand guard gibson slid back the engineroom hatch only switching on his light when hed descended the steel ladder the engines were beautiful everything was beautiful and as an irish boy raised in a fishing port he felt genuine regret what a beauty he said softly still he knew there would be at least four seacocks and checked them out sturdy circular wheels in bronze the first one turned very smoothly then clicked to a halt he hurriedly moved to the second by the time he was working on the fourth water was already sloshing along the floor of the engine room and he was ankledeep he came out and joined murphy you cast off forward and ill see to the stern line quick now then get ashore they did that then pulled up the gangplank and stood back from the edge of the wharf and watched the river queen drift out a little and settle a sad sight gibson said as water poured across the deck but weve done our worst its me for the early morning flight to belfast if i need you ill be in touch i know one thing murphy said as he got into the land rover harry salter wont be pleased he wasnt dillon on his morning run answered his mobile and heard harry say some damn bastards sunk the river queen at her moorings what do you mean dillon asked well the bleeding boat didnt just sink on her own billys got his scubadiving gear out hes going down to take a look ah harry he shouldnt be doing that not after having been shot to hell in hazar only a few months ago ill come straight down he switched off thought about it and then rang ferguson at cavendish place at the end of cable wharf he found harry joe baxter and sam hall looking across at the part of the river queen that was sticking out of the water billys shogun was parked nearby the rear door open to reveal various items of diving equipment and a couple of air bottles wheres billy dillon said as he got out of the mini hes been down there for fifteen minutes dammit harry he shouldnt have gone down there leave it to the salvage experts then two things happened ferguson and hannah arrived and billy surfaced he slipped off his air bottle and dillon reached for it billy started up the ladder to the wharf and baxter and hall pulled him up billy took off his mask his face blue with cold you bloody idiot dillon said well i learned it from you it was the seacocks all four of them were wide open ive closed them it was hard going dillon said the salvage people will need to pump her out shell float again which leaves us with the problem of who did this there was a pause and then a quavery old drinksodden voice said i know mr salter i saw them i heard them it was joe baxter who said wally brown he dosses down in the packing cases and you heard them harry demanded yes one of them was called murphy but the one in charge was called derry thats what the other kept calling him and they spoke funny irish but not irish he pointed at dillon come to think of it they talked like him ferguson said derry and talks like you dillon northern irish hannah said could that be derry gibson the red hand of ulster back to haunt me but why dillon said the derry guy mentioned someone called rossi old wally put in the silence was astonishing ill kill him harry said ill kill the bleeder no you wont harry or not yet ferguson said well go back to the dark man thank you mr brown thats been most helpful did you hear anything else they all sat in the corner booth dora the barmaid provided tea and coffee harry and billy salter ferguson hannah and dillon sat at the table baxter and sam hall leaned against the wall theyve declared open warfare harry said true dillon nodded but if youll excuse me harry the most important thing is that rossi has struck a deal to deliver arms to derry gibson wally brown was devouring bacon and eggs at a corner table so according to wally murphy was unhappy about sinking the boat and derry threatened him he said the deal with rossi the final arms shipment would be the one he could use to take on the ira again so what do you suggest ferguson said i wouldnt bother with the baron or rossi again im going to have words with pat murphy you talk to that bastard im going with you harry salter said ferguson nodded try not to leave him floating in the thames dillon dont be silly charles if hes been fronting in london for derry gibson and the red hand hell be far too valuable to waste at south audley street marco sat with his father and told him what had happened the baron found it rather amusing oh the great harry salter will not be pleased at all but this other business the mona lisa the arms shipment is this wise and marco said exactly the right thing it was one of the last things kate rashid organized father shed worked with derry gibson before he pressed his point he was and still is an admirer he thought her a great lady he told me so really he has taste at least this spanish trawler the mona lisa how many in the crew the captain a man called juan martino and five crew members all villains of course and what will your part be in this on their way to drumgoole which is on the down coast of northern ireland theyll come close to the west coast of the isle of man ive arranged with our contacts there to provide a motorboat to take me out to join her is this strictly necessary marco no but it gets me away from the office the old man laughed go on you rogue but come back safe i need you the bar at the orange george opened at nine in the morning because it provided a full irish breakfast it was quiet enough when dillon went in janet the barmaid reading a newspaper dillon said tell patrick id like a word at that moment the door at the end of the bar opened and murphy appeared he saw dillon and a look of horror appeared on his face dillon went round the bar patrick my ould son its me sean dillon he pushed him through to the hall do as youre told go on unlock the back door which murphy terrified did and harry and billy crowded in they shoved murphy into the back parlor and closed the door salter pushed him down into a chair at the table and slapped his face you sodding bastard you sank my boat not me mr salter i swear billy pulled his uncle away let me get at him but dillon intervened no leave it to me he took a walther out of his pocket then produced a carswell silencer from the other and screwed it in place this is much better hardly makes a sound ill start with his left elbow then vary it the right knee maybe thatll put him on sticks for six months dear god no murphy really was terrified what do you want derry gibson dillon said well forget about you sinking mr salters river queen for the moment tell me about derry s deal with rossi the arms shipment jesus hell kill me hes a sadist that one no thats me billy salter said and punched him twice in the stomach now speak up and tell mr dillon what he wants to know or youll end up in concrete in the new extension to the north circular road and murphy aware that he was in truly bad company talked at ferguson s apartment murphy stayed outside in the car with baxter and hall while harry and billy sat with dillon and ferguson hannah hanging around at the back this could be a disaster ferguson said we all know the peace process has become a total shambles the activities of ira dissident groups prove that but with this cargo of weapons the loyalists will be on a roll hannah said we must put it into the hands of the northern ireland police sir we cant afford to if they make any kind of a move in the drumgoole area dillon said derry gibson will know its not only his turf his supporters have relatives in the police so what would you suggest any stranger in the area would be a source of suspicion so what do we do send in the sas nothing so official the last time we did anything like this we used a motor cruiser from oban from the raf air sea rescue base there theres no reason we cant do it again book the boat give me the right diving gear and enough semtex and ill take it over by night and blow the mona lisa to hell on your own ferguson asked why not a totally black operation i dont like it dillon hannah said its just not legal what about me dillon billy said last time you played a gig like that i went too and so did the superintendent the superintendents not up for it because it offends her conscience and youre not up for it because some months ago you had a bullet through the neck and two in the pelvis as the germans used to say when they took someone to prison camp for you the war is over stuff you dillon dillon turned to ferguson do you want it done or not theres an added benefit you know this could be just the thing weve been looking for to stir up von berger get him to make a mistake we sink this boat maybe somethingll happen thatll give us a lead on that damned diary ferguson said youre right on both counts lets do it he turned to hannah lock murphy up at the st johns wood safehouse see he phones the orange george and gives a reasonable excuse for his absence if thats how you want it sir dillon will give you a list of the weaponry and explosives he needs the quartermaster will see to that book the gulfstream with squadron leader lacey what do you think dillon one oclock tomorrow fine by me charles excellent ill see you there im coming with you dillon said what you must be crazy not as crazy as a man who thinks he can make a run from oban to the down coast on his own in what is usually a very rough sea havent you ever heard of sleeping i am something of a yachtsman you know i can actually navigate i surrender dillon held up his hands at farley field the following day dillon reported to the quartermaster a retired guards sergeant major he and dillon had dealt together many times here you go mr dillon three walthers three uzi machine pistols stun grenades and the semtex you wanted tenminute timing pencils thirtyminute and one hour excellent what about diving equipment youll find that on the boat at oban the highlander youve used it before a couple of standard suits and fins the usual extras why two always good to have backup sir yes i suppose so at that moment the daimler arrived and ferguson got out his chauffeur took out a bag and delivered it to parry who took it up the steps and handed it to sergeant walters dillon said you look quite sporty charles corduroys a sweater nice very amusing ferguson said and behind him a shogun drove up harry salter at the wheel billy beside him they got out billy in a black bomber jacket a bag in one hand oh now what in the hell is this dillon asked im coming along for the ride thats what it is billy said you two are older guys you could need some help he grinned dillon looked at ferguson who shrugged he was most insistent i thought why not he can go to hell in his own way harry said just bring him back in one piece dillon because if you dont i get the picture harry dillon turned to billy shaking his head old guy huh all right up you go then he let ferguson follow then went up himself at the raf air sea rescue base at oban the commanding officer himself met them in view of fergusons rank they were delivered in an unmarked car by two raf sergeants named smith and brian i think we met once before dillon said brian said not according to any office record sir he grinned as they pulled in at the quay you may recognize the highlander two hundred yards out i cant say im impressed ferguson said youre not supposed to be dillon told him but its got twin screws a depth sounder radar automatic steering and it does twentyfive knots sergeant brian said weve got a whaleboat to take your gear out it took forty minutes and when it was all stowed brian said i dont know what youre up to but good luck youve got a firstclass inflatable with an outboard motor it should serve you well well be getting back now thanks ferguson said the whaleboat departed and dillon turned to ferguson billys been on board before let him show you around ill contact roper see what his input is roper sat at his computer bank examining the results of his latest hacking job into the rashid computers dillon said whats the story on the mona lisa operates from a small fishing port in northern spain called san miguel the ports a hotbed for illegal transactions but its a bona fide spanish deepsea trawler with a european license to fish off cornwall wales and the irish sea whats its course according to its logged passage with the coast guard shell be close to the western coast of the isle of man tomorrow then drift and fish toward the down coast very convenient anything else not really im sure for instance that you havent the slightest interest in a berger international flight into the isle of man carrying one marco rossi dillon laughed well imagine that if its a sea voyage hes planning hes in for a rough ride tomorrow and tomorrow night therell be rain squalls and high seas youll know youre out there should be interesting do you have a game plan sean yeah the game plan is to blow the hell out of the mona lisa and deposit two million quids worth of arms on the floor of the irish sea what about the crew ive got a captain martino listed here and five others gomez fabio arturo somebody an enrico a sancho youre going to kill them all sean why not theyre a reasonable facsimile of scum theyve run everything from heroin to human beings im told and now arms they shouldnt have joined if they didnt want the risk fine by me ill stay in touch speak to you tomorrow good but stay on the berger case im convinced rossi was responsible for sara hessers death ill see what i can do oban was enveloped in mist and rain beyond kerrara the waters looked disturbed in the firth of lorne and clouds draped across the mountaintops ive said it before billy moaned what a bloody awful place i mean it rains all the bleeding time no billy it rains six days a week dillon turned to ferguson am i right general you usually are dillon good please join me in the wheelhouse there was a flap to one side of the instrument panel and he pressed a button inside was a fuse box and some clips screwed into place he opened one of the weapons bags took out a browning with a twentyoneround magazine protruding from its butt he clipped it into place and added a walther in the other clips ace in the hole he closed the flap my goodness you do mean business ferguson said i always did charles now lets go ashore and eat the early darkness of the far north was against them and he turned on the deck lights then they coasted to the front at oban in the inflatable and tied up a pub close by offered food and they went in there was a meat and potato pie on the menu which they all ordered ill have a large scotch dillon billy what about you billy doesnt drink dillon told ferguson i hate the taste of booze billy said its all in the bible wine is a mocker strong drink raging dillon said well you still do it true dillon swallowed his bushmills whats more ill have another i despair of you dillon ferguson said and then the pies arrived and killed conversation for a while later back on the highlander they sat on the stern deck under the canvas awning rain bouncing off ferguson said so whats the plan roper tells me the mona lisas due off the west coast of the isle of man tomorrow and guess whos flying up there in a berger international plane marco rossi you didnt tell me ferguson said ive been saving it up for you i think it means he fancies a passage by night to drumgoole that could very well be when we get there what do you intend i told roper ill blow the damn boat up and dont ask me what about the crew theyre all what the italians would call animali with any luck rossi could even be on board you really are yourself alone dillon i wonder about derry gibson wonder what he could give us a lot of trouble this red hand of ulster where do they get their absurd names from its their simple irish minds charles id have thought youd have recognized that your sainted mother being a cork woman all right i take your point but this derry gibson thing it could lead to greater civil war than ever catholics and protestants what would you like me to do shoot gibson it wouldnt be a bad idea thats good billy said hes wyatt earp im doc holliday and youd like derry gibson and rossi standing up in coffins in the undertakers window like in dodge city hands folded eyes closed you know something billy i couldnt have put it better myself ferguson got up its me for an early night ill see you in the morning i just have one question getting in close to the drumgoole area wont the locals wonder who we are not if we take out the nets that are in the hold and drape them around the deck there are lots of fishing boats off the down coast good enough ferguson said and went below billy said hes such a gent but you know what i reckon hes harder than harry and thats saying something hes the kind of man who got us the empire in the first place dillon said mind you hes right about derry gibson ill give it some thought you mean youd consider knocking him off why not ive killed for worse reasons i once saved his life you know we were in a sewer in londonderry being hunted by brit paratroopers even though we were on different sides i told him then to keep running and not come back or id kill him and now looks like hes come back come on lets go to bed and dillon led the way below the following morning rain drifting in ferguson went up on deck and discovered dillon swimming in the sea sporting with two seals billy leaning on the rail watching hes mad billy said yes ive been aware of that for some years i mean talk about freeze your balls off dillon swam to the ladder and hauled himself up the grand appetite it gives you charles the shiptoshore radio crackled in the wheelhouse take that charles it could be roper ill get dressed it was roper ah its you general just updating you rossis plane lands at ronaldsway on the isle of man at eleven this morning the mona lisa is five miles out and scheduled to move to the down coastal area later this afternoon the weather isnt good so id say it wouldnt be in the drumgoole area until tonight i dont know the weather makes it uncertain right thanks roper he turned as dillon entered the wheelhouse and filled him in dillon had a look at the chart ive done this kind of run before so i know what im doing but the weather stinks look at it charles the whole of oban was draped in mist bleeding awful billy said all right dillon nodded lets allow for him landing at eleven being driven across the island and then some sort of boat running him five miles out to the mona lisa its two oclock at the earliest before he boards and she turns for ulster but with that weather he shook his head what do you think charles three oclock at the earliest all right well leave at two then for the moment lets get back ashore for a full scots breakfast and by the look of it seasick pills for billy the flights from london to ronaldsway had been bad enough rossi the extornado pilot always liked to take over the controls for a while but it was rough and the crosswinds at the airport had been treacherous although hed managed the landing himself a local rashid employee met him with a car and took him across the island to a small village where a motor cruiser waited it had a crew of two and set out to sea immediately pushing out from the shelter of a small pier into the rough waves obscured by fog it took them an hour to find the mona lisa they pulled alongside the spanish trawler its nets draped high over the stern the two ships collided twice and men leaned over with grappling lines rossi took his chance and jumped over to the other boat he turned and waved to the motor cruiser the captain waved back and then he motored away three or four men at the rail eyed rossi up and down he ignored them and went toward the wheelhouse the door opened and a man emerged in a reefer coat and seamans cap heavily unshaven an unlit cigarette in the corner of his mouth by any estimate he would have been termed a nasty piece of work he looked rossi over with a kind of contempt im martino the captain and im marco rossi your boss a couple of the men laughed and martino lit his cigarette should i be impressed rossi reached grabbed his left ear his thumb well inside and produced his walther and rammed it hard under the chin now you have the option of continuing to be employed by rashid and make a lot of money or i blow your brains out now up through the mouth and into the brain explodes the back of the skull very messy martino tried to smile eh señor theres a mistake here not mine yours screw with me and youre finished do we understand each other perfectly señor good then lets get on with it he walked into the wheelhouse and the crew looked at martino who nodded so they went about their tasks around the middle of the afternoon the highlander was ploughing through a turbulent sea down from oban a couple of miles off the isle of man into the irish sea dillon was at the wheel billy at the chart table and ferguson below the mist was so heavy the driving rain so intense that it was more like evening a kind of early darkness and dillon could see one of the irish ferries redandgreen navigational lights already visible ferguson came into the wheelhouse with three mugs of tea on a tray he put the tray down on the table and looked at the chart then switched the shiptoshore radio to weather and listened its going to get worse before it gets better better let me have the wheel dillon dillon didnt even argue ferguson altered course a couple of points then increased his speed racing the heavy weather that threatened from the east the waves grew rougher jesus billy said im scared to death no need billy he knows what hes doing ill go down to the galley and make some bacon sandwiches not for me i could throw up now take another couple of pills dillon said and went below he came back half an hour later with sandwiches on a plate and found ferguson alone what happened to the boy wonder took a couple of pills and retired to lie down i say those smell good help yourself ferguson put the steering on automatic and took a bacon sandwich dillon splashed whiskey into two plastic cups and they ate together in a kind of companionable silence it was getting really dark now far earlier than normal only a slight phosphorescence shining from the sea you seem at home dillon said i always liked the sea from boyhood the west sussex coast down to the isle of wight the solent loved it he drank the whiskey ill have the other half he helped himself to another sandwich that browning with the twentyshot magazine youve put in the flap there it took me back really yes in i took extended leave i was an acting major then done rather well for my age i did the atlantic run singlehanded portsmouth to long island it had to be long island because i had an old uncle living there he was a general too the american connection in my family a remarkable achievement dillon said therapy dillon therapy he finished the last sandwich and took the wheel again what for well id been shot in the shoulder but it was more than that it was psychological coming to terms with what i was capable of dillon poured two more whiskeys and what was that i was never sas dillon what youve never known was that i served with code nine intelligence he had just named one of the most infamous army units involved in the underground fight with the ira jesus dillon said it was a hell of a way to earn a living in londonderry in but there i was thirty years old oxford sandhurst malaya communist rebels in the yemen eoka in cyprus and then along came ireland i couldnt wait to switch from the grenadier guards to counterinsurgency work you wanted the smell of powder again of war dillon id been engaged for three years a lovely girl called mary from an army family only she could never see the point mind you she hung in there until cork street he was talking as if he was alone taking some kind of solitary journey into the past cork street dillon said what was that that was where i earned the military cross dillon one of those they handed out in northern ireland for unspecified reasons dillon said softly and what would that be charles well i was link man between two safehouses run by the sas one night i was doing a run quite late as we discovered later my cover had been blown going through cork street down by the docks id a car on my tail then another car came out of a side and turned to block me just a minute dillon said july seventythree derry the cork street massacre thats what they called it the sas took out five provos a hell of a thing no they didnt i took out five provos it was only then that dillon was aware of a slight noise turned and found billy the door half open standing there revealed ferguson glanced over his shoulder come in billy yes dillon the second car blocked me and the one in the rear was right up my backside there were three provos in front two at my back they just shouted out out you brit bastard it always seemed ironic being halfirish its the posh voice you see so what did you do i had what youve got in there a browning with a twentyround magazine on the lefthand seat one man wrenched open the drivers door so i shot him between the eyes then shot his two friends through the door i was using hollowpoint cartridges devastating and the two men in the rear car scrambled to get out one of them fired wildly and was lucky hit me in the left shoulder i riddled the car a kind of reflex killed him and the driver then i drove away and made it to one of the safehouses where the sas patched me up and got me out the following morning jesus billy said you killed five all gone to that great ira heaven in the sky billy and the doctors put me together again and my masters gave me the military cross had to really the loss of five members of the londonderry brigade was so mortifying that the provos put it about as another sas atrocity and in the mythology of irish republicanism thats where it remains it was dillon who sensed more so what happened afterward oh i got a call to pick up the medal from her majesty at buckingham palace and i asked mary to go with me shed visited me in the hospital and naturally wanted to know how id come to be there so i told her and what happened she sent the engagement ring back and a letter explaining that she couldnt possibly marry a man whod killed five people well damn her eyes billy said thats one point of view so i went to the palace on my own a nasty wet day it was too the regiment was proud of me gave me leave which you used to sail to long island you thought a hard sea voyage would blow the cobwebs away dillon said something like that but in the end you were still the man who shot five men dead right thats right general they asked for it and they got it billy said true billy i did my duty and it cost me mary he said to dillon god knows why i bothered to tell you after all these years i think im getting maudlin in my old age take the wheel and ill go and have a rest and he went out billy said my god i said he was harder than harry but i never dreamed he was capable of a thing like that oh he probably killed before in all those rotten little wars billy cork street was his spectacular he lit a cigarette remember what i told you before about the people who take care of the bad things that ordinary folk find impossible to handle the soldiers im a soldier whether people approve of me or not and so are you and then we get charles ferguson a decent honorable man who could have been a banker or a lawyer instead hes spent his life saving his country behind them ferguson said from the doorway thats nice of you dillon but dont lets overdo it and as far as the steering goes id say a couple of points west in drumgoole in the back room of the pub derry gibson ate bacon and eggs served by the local publican one keith adair his righthand man in the little port is there anything else i can get you adair asked no this is grand its the weather i dont like its bad out there and getting worse id hoped the mona lisa could come in to the jetty by the old stone quarry if it gets worse the skipper will have to drop his hook out in the bay thatll make it more difficult to unload derry mind you plenty of local fishermen have signed up for that well they would wouldnt they what about the local peelers theyve closed the police station down derry some trouble up in castleton so theyve gone up there to help out excellent they know which side their breads buttered on at that moment the phone sounded and adair passed it to him mr gibson its janet from the orange george i know who you are janet whats the problem well i was wondering if you knew where patrick is its been a couple of days he phoned once and said his uncle arthur had died unexpectedly and i was to carry on running the pub only we got cut off and ive got bills coming in and i cant write the checks so i thought id speak to you knowing youre the real owner just a minute derry told her he doesnt have an uncle arthur well thats what he said and years of bad living made derry gibson sit up very straight he nodded to adair and switched the phone to speaker when did you last see him janet later in the morning when you went off for the plane to belfast i was doing breakfasts this small man came in black bomber jacket jeans and that funny kind of fair hair almost white he asked for patrick and at that moment patrick came in by the rear door and what happened well the little guy said patrick my old son its me sean dillon he had one of those kind of belfast accents like yours mr gibson derry gibson went cold and what happened that was it nothing until the phone call and then today i was talking to that old kelly guy who sells the newspapers outside and he said he was surprised to see patrick getting in a shogun with three guys because he knew two of them well harry salter and his nephew billy big gangsters it was enough derry gibson said theres a lot going on here you dont know about janet just keep things going if you look in the righthand top drawer of patricks desk youll find a company credit card use it to pay bills ill be in touch he switched off and turned to adair sean dillon and those salter guys that means ferguson jesus theyll have squeezed murphy dry adair said were up the creek no not the way ferguson and dillon work gibsons face was hard every job is a black operation to them no police no sas just dillon and whatever he comes up with its always been the way he plays the game which means gibson laughed and it was as if he was enjoying it hes at sea already homing on the mona lisa so what do we do give him a welcome his last on this earth ill phone rossi and let him know what to expect on the bridge of the mona lisa martino was at the wheel rossi at one side the boat pounding through heavy weather as darkness really descended the shiptoshore sounded and martino answered he turned to rossi its for you rossi took it and listened to what gibson had to say in sean dillons hands murphy will spill his guts rossi felt strangely calm not in the least put out dillon really is a piece of work so what do we do well its up to the captain in this weather if he can come in and make the jetty fine gibson said if its too rough drop the anchor in the bay ill have suitable backup here in drumgoole but you break out your weapons on board and keep a weather eye out for any likely craft you really think dillon is actually at sea i wouldnt be surprised he and ferguson will see the mona lisa as a prime target and theyll do it their way look all this rubbish about northern ireland and peace initiatives its crap because the ira and sinn fein have abused the system and the british government has let them do it im a good orange prod and i know it because someone like ferguson classes me with the ira so what are you saying that ferguson doesnt play by the rules because he knows the justice system doesnt work thats why he has sean dillon hell come in the hard way he hung up rossi stood there thinking and turned to martino break out the weapons and tell everyone to keep watch any other boat we approach with caution why señor rossi smiled grimly were about to have company captain dillon spoke to roper as the highlander ploughed through heavy seas toward the northern irish coast its rough dillon said and getting rougher if the mona lisas off drumgoole try and make it to the entrance to the bay by the jetty to the old quarry theres a trough four hundred feet thanks thats helpful and please watch it things are really moving out there dont for gods sake consider only the great sean dillon and his mission to save the world the voice crackled over the shiptoshore radio and dillon turned to ferguson and billy who were listening he said message received and understood roper we who are about to die salute you only i dont plan to die just yet this weather might be just what we need over and out dillon took a bottle of lambs navy rum out of the flare drawer pulled the cork and swallowed deep he passed the bottle to ferguson youre going to need it charles ferguson didnt hesitate he drank wiped the neck and offered the bottle to billy who said no ill manage im so bleeding scared i dont feel seasick anymore ferguson was at the wheel which responded surprisingly well what happens now he demanded dillon leaned over the chart table i dont know if the mona lisa ties up at that jetty fine if it puts its anchor down in the bay ill go in underwater with semtex and timer pencils an inandout job blow the bottom out of her and down she goes it wont be too deep if shes at the jetty well have to see the bay would be better therell be a hell of a lot of confusion there god help all the small harbor craft the fishing boats so thats it then ferguson said thats exactly it charles dillon smiled were totally in the hands of the weather ill go below and get into my wet suit me too billy said not in a million years you can run the inflatable take me close but thats it open the weapons bag and arm up billy i wont be long and he went below in drumgoole harbor the scene was total confusion the wind coming in off the irish sea and gusting to storm force smaller craft were already being torn from their moorings and smashed against the harbor walls other craft were breaking free and being sucked out into the bay on the other side of the jetty in the midst of all this the mona lisa emerged her deck lights on a kind of ghost ship very oldfashioned her superstructure high martino and rossi way up on the bridge derry gibsons voice came over the shiptoshore dont come in youll smash up against the old jetty drop your hook and if youre lucky youll find it about sixty or seventy feet but theres a trough of four hundred feet i cant help you there rossi said no news of our friends jesus marco if theyre out there theyll be as much in harms way as the rest of us ill join you weve got an rnli inshore inflatable lifeboat here they can handle most things ill see you way out in the bay the highlander hove to and ferguson tossed out a sea anchor and dillon in his wet suit looked out toward the distant mona lisa through night binoculars billy was using another pair dillon there are boats floating out of the harbor bouncing off the mona lisas hull like rubber balls only theyre splintering billy ive counted at least three in a sinking condition but the mona lisas got an anchor chain down dillon put the weapons bag on the chart table took out an arm holster a browning with the same twentyround magazine in it as the hidden one put it on then crossed a weapons bag over his shoulder took out three semtex blocks and inserted tenminute pencil timers he slipped an inflatable belt around his waist nothing bulletproof ferguson said a titanium waistcoat under my wet suit charles the best i can afford what do you want me to do cross her stern well drift in like the other boats ill go over and climb the anchor line with luck oh we all need that charles and me billy asked when i hopefully survive long enough to jump over the rail you may need to bring the inflatable in and pick me up turn it on and the engine goes to forty knots ill send a flare up not in this weather ferguson said a huge crosswind turned them half over and they all staggered and grabbed billy said you cant dillon its madness dillon put an arm around him youre a great guy billy but i dont care anymore im going to blow the hell out of that boat and everybody on it whether thats gibson rossi or even me and he said it with great deliberation the mona lisa bucked on its anchor as one craft after another crashed against it there was total confusion on deck the crew who had previously been at the ready with their aks now panicked as the boat rolled from side to side the highlander eased forward and dillon slipped over the side as they passed the stern of the mona lisa the waves sucked him in tossed him over and he grabbed the anchor line he hung there his rubber gloves giving him a grip as the highlander sped away he started to haul himself up waves washing over him and then reached the hole at the top and slid in through to the stern there were two of the crew there fabio and gomez utterly confused by the waves breaking over the rails clutching their aks they saw dillon get to his knees and then he pulled out the browning and shot both of them in the head high up on the bridge it was derry gibson who recognized the sound for what it was hes here the bastards here who is martino asked dillon you miserable idiot gibson went out looked down and saw fabio and gomez rolling in the scuppers there you are martino at his side was horrified i cant believe it at that moment arturo and enrico came round the central area on the port side grabbing for the rail in the heavy sea and dillon crouched in the stern shot them both he moved forward on the port side heavy seas breaking over him reached the prow of the boat heaved the hatch back on the engine room took out the three blocks of semtex with the timer pencils and dropped them in bullets ripped up the decks beside him he turned and found the man sancho standing there firing an ak and up high on the wheelhouse deck martino rossi and gibson at the rail he seemed to be facing an inevitable death and then bullets cut across the decks martino was hurled back and sancho went down gibson ducked and ran away dillon looked over and saw billy at the wheel of the inflatable ferguson standing up and spraying the mona lisa with the browning from the wheelhouse dillon ran and vaulted over the rail and as the inflatable went by grabbed a line and was hauled away out out out gibson called to rossi he went down the side ladder ended up in the bouncing inflatable and had the engine revving as rossi joined him a moment only and they sped away through the heavy sea a moment later out of the gloom the highlanders inflatable appeared ferguson standing up with the browning dillon trailing behind ferguson had no chance to fire they were away rossi said ferguson young salter and dillon gibson said behind them the three semtex blocks dillon had dropped into the engine room exploded one after the other the mona lisa simply blew apart parts of her superstructure flew up and then rained down into the storm below the boat tilted the stern rose the mona lisa slid over the edge of the trough and went all the way down there was another muffled explosion an enormous convulsion to the alreadydisturbed sea surface boats thrown all over the place and then a strange calm the wind dropped just then only the rain continued hard and forceful the inflatable reached the highlander and drifted against the side dillon pulled himself up the ladder paused and turned you must have been fantastic when you were young charles because you are indescribable now dont forget billy and dont try to butter me up dillon just get on board and lets turn for oban weve done what we came here for except that marco rossi and derry gibson are left standing well sort them another day rossi phoned his father ill be back tomorrow i want out of this damned country why what happened rossi explained and his father actually found it rather funny ferguson at his age you must admit marco its rather admirable well ive got a boat with two million pounds of weaponry sent down to the bottom by your admirable ferguson come home and well discuss it afterward the baron sat smoking a cigarette and sipping a large brandy and he was actually smiling the highlander ploughed on ferguson at the wheel billy appeared with the bacon sandwiches ill tell you what you old bastard you were great back there harry wont believe it when i tell him you didnt do badly yourself billy dillon came in now changed in jeans and a shirt ferguson said ill say it now you were totally mad frankly dillon youve got a death wish youre right general but it got the job done i think you should visit professor susan hadentaylor again no shes washed her hands of me and so has god for the moment weve succeeded in what we set out to achieve fewer arms for the conflict in northern ireland and ill be willing to bet weve stirred up a hornets nest with rossi and von berger now we wait and see where it leads with luck to the diary by the way ive phoned harry told him his nephew is still in the land of the living thanks very much dillon billy said thats all right billy he worries about you now would it be all right if i had a bacon sandwich in drumgoole there was a certain amount of chaos but northern ireland had been used to chaos for almost thirtyfive years nevertheless derry gibson was in the market to move on well have the peelers all over the place for a while he said to rossi in the pub after the mona lisa went down ill lie low he was having a whiskey and shook his head as he drank it down sean dillon what a bastard he is and ferguson yes you should never underestimate your opponent ill be out of this pesthole first thing in the morning as far as im concerned you can give northern ireland back to the indians i think youre being a bit rough i could be a damn sight rougher i could point out for instance that you havent paid anything on the mona lisa contract shes gone down and rashid doesnt get a penny what happened happened rossi you were screwed and i was screwed by dillon and ferguson yes ive been thinking about that its time we did something about dillon and ferguson can i help well it would be a way of writing off your debt he thought for a moment where do you think murphy is fergusons got him in some safehouse said gibson the only reason those bastards were here was because murphy talked yes tell you what gibson dont go back to the orange george call that woman janet and tell her shes in charge for a little while more and where do i stay in one of our staff flats on south audley street until when until ive worked out how im going to do it do what something with dillon eventually but not yet first i think itll be ferguson the great man himself gibson was delighted what in the hell are you up to youll have to wait derry ill let you know in good time he lit a cigarette derry said youre enjoying all this you should have been crushed by the loss of the mona lisa instead you dont give a stuff two million its only money derry and money is only a medium of exchange no the games the thing that sounds like shakespeare close but its what you and me are all about as well as dillon ferguson even the salters its the game that makes you feel alive its worth everything as soon as he got back to london ferguson requested a meeting with the prime minister on a onetoone basis no other security people present not even scotland yard when he was ushered into the prime ministers study he found him signing various documents for the foreign secretary who had never approved of ferguson ive heard a rumor youve been up to some kind of nonsense again general he said me foreign secretary cant imagine what ive been up to my neck in things at the ministry of defence for the past few days really the foreign secretary said dryly the prime minister passed across the documents there you go no feuding you two youre both far too important pax ferguson said the foreign secretary smiled reluctantly and departed the prime minister said right general youd better sit down and tell me the worst afterward he said thats the deepest black operation ive ever heard of no wonder you didnt want anyone else present there are rumors of course already god help us if this kind of thing ever reached the ears of the public its too fantastic no one would believe it the prime minister nodded when i won my election and was presented with knowledge of your department a secret passed from one pm to another about an organization responding only to the pms will it made me feel uneasy and yet on so many occasions you dillon and company have saved the day the peace process in northern ireland is in tatters but were still trying if the red hand of ulster had got hold of the mona lisas weaponry it could have been civil war exactly sir so a good job well done theres only one thing that bothers me dillon and young salter i can understand but you charles exchanging shot for shot at your age its not only undignified its also damned dangerous youve got your medals charles no more sorties going into harms way all right i promise prime minister yes well i think im going to make sure you know about the omega program dont you charles yes sir its an implant containing a computer chip that tracks a persons whereabouts exactly ive got one so do the cabinet ministers and ive decided you should have it too must i prime minister yes charles youre too valuable to lose he picked up a card and handed it over professor henry merriman harley street be there at nine oclock tomorrow morning it only takes half an hour or so doesnt hurt would dillon be a candidate no its only for very senior political figures and frankly charles i dont think i want to know where dillon is all the time two american presidents owe him their lives im aware of that and yet dillon has no medals at all yes life can be a bitch general ferguson was silent yes well i will of course present myself at the harley street clinic as you wish prime minister he moved to the door and the prime minister said and von berger charles dont forget von berger ferguson turned and said sir cant have him threatening the president and me it wont do bring him down charles any way it takes of course sir ferguson brushed past the aide went downstairs and out to the daimler where dillon and hannah waited dillon moved to one of the jump seats and closed the glass partition how did it go ferguson told them and hannah said i think omega is a good idea and you are important a damn sight more important than most of the halfbaked cabinet ministers around at the moment dillon said why thank you dillon its a fact of life i wont remind you of how many years youve been around in the intelligence game but i cant think of anyone else in the western world with your experience you should be my press agent glad to so von berger did he come up the pm was explicit bring him down easier said than done unless youd like me to shoot him for you hannah said for gods sake dillon he opened the side window and lit a cigarette as ive said before the almighty has got little to do with it i could take out rossi quite cheerfully would that be okay youre being stupid ferguson said cut it out you two what about rossis movements superintendent he left belfast this morning ferguson turned to dillon call roper see if hes got anything roper had of course landed at gatwick one pilot two passengers you need two pilots for those things its the law of course but marco rossis fully rated he was the other one who was the passenger one charles mackenzie carrying a uk northern irish passport an accountant apparently apparently i went into the new visual system they have at checkin now and had a look at him derry gibson i might have known you dont know anything sean what hes doing here for instance neither of them have any reason to be pleased with you so i should be looking over my shoulder he is red hand of ulster old son im frightened to death roper dillon said goodbye what was that all about ferguson asked dillon told him hmm ferguson said you know ive been thinking blowing up that ship was good but why should we wait for them to make the next move why not stay on the offensive we should know more about von bergers setup in germany schloss adler neustadt the darker place whatever the hell they call it he turned to hannah have a word with roper ask him to do a quick computer analysis of the area see if weve got any intelligence sources there tell him to meet us at that restaurant of salters harrys place well have a meal and listen to what he has to say well call at the dark man first two car lengths back newton and cook followed it was early evening the dark man quiet salter and billy as usual in the corner booth joe baxter and sam hall hanging around when ferguson and the others walked in harry said this is a nice surprise general sit down all of you he said to dillon and you listened to me brought billy back in one piece after covering himself with glory no that was the general billy said harry turned to dillon and you of course did the usual more or less so what gives rossi flew in from belfast this morning with a passenger named charles mackenzie on his passport but in fact derry gibson according to roper hannah put in harry said and what would that bastard be doing here yes thats the thing ferguson said well id say its bleeding obvious billy put in hes out for you dillon dillon lit a cigarette he could be out for any one of us well just let him try harry said he sank my boat ill have him for that the important thing is to find out what the baron and rossi plan to do next said ferguson ive got roper doing one of his searches on von bergers place in germany i suggested he meet us at your restaurant harry if that suits you absolutely newton phoned rossi again weve followed them to this restaurant in wapping harrys place theyve gone in and ropers turned up in his wheelchair stay there rossi turned to the baron interesting von berger said and then with a twinkle in his eye ill tell you what marco lets go meet them oh and go and get mr gibson well all go together well stir the pot wont that be amusing infinitely marco said harrys place was another of salters warehouse conversions on hangmans wharf the whole place had been revitalized its brickwork cleaned new windows in mahogany there was always a line mainly of young people trying to get into the bar which had become a smart place to be seen steps had been added to make the entrance more imposing and there was a ramp beside it which roper used when his black cab arrived joe baxter and sam hall were on the entrance in black tie controlling the line they came down and got roper out of his cab great to see you major joe said and pushed him up the ramp there was a young punk in a silk bomber jacket standing with two girls at the front of the line youve got to be a bloody cripple to get service here sam hall almost casually slapped him backhanded across the face then grabbed him by the front of the jacket that man is probably the biggest hero you ever set eyes on sunshine so you get to go to the back of the line alternatively you could just sod off the youth put his hands up okay he pulled the girls away and went joe baxter said sorry about that major sticks and stones joe i couldnt care less im lucky to be here they went inside and the headwaiter a dark energetic portuguese named fernando came forward major roper a pleasure ill lead the way with baxter at the helm they followed fernando into the restaurant which was beautifully designed in art deco there was a small dance floor a fourpiece band and cocktail bar straight out of the thirties the waiters wore cruise ship monkey jackets the salters ferguson and his people were all in the largest booth harry got up and roughed ropers shoulderlength hair you still go round like a bloody hippie i express my individuality harry salter looked down into that burned ravaged face and gave him a hug youre a real piece of work roper now dont take pity on me harry if that gets out in the east end youll be finished he turned to ferguson okay most of this you know some you dont the whole thing with holstein heath of course is that due to an error it was never east german nor west if anything it was neonazi even though von berger never belonged to the party hes kept the flame alight for years after the war all the police there were former ss and so on he took a drink of whiskey von berger frequently visits schloss adler often with rossi they come in by helicopter at a landing area close to the schloss but its a huge meadow and they can actually land a plane on it too do we have any kind of connection there ferguson asked its a tightknit community as a matter of interest though about forty kilometers from neustadt on the edge of the schwarze platz is a small village called arnheim theres a handful of houses but an old luftwaffe base from the second world war its dilapidated but it has a landing strip that can take most things and its used by a man called max kubel he turned to ferguson hes been on your list out there for a number of years a smuggler of most things including people to the west flies an old storch plane on special jobs his father was luftwaffe in the war he knows neustadt very well ive spoken to him yes well knowing is one thing and being able to access the place is something else dillon said he does a lot of cigarette smuggling uses people he has one guy named hans klein in neustadt who was forced off his farm by the baron and hates him he could be a useful source of information at that moment fernando appeared and said to salter im so sorry a baron von berger and a signor rossi are at the entrance to see you salter looked at ferguson and ferguson nodded fernando went off and ferguson said everyone just go with the flow the baron came down the steps followed by rossi and derry gibson why what a surprise general he said to ferguson i doubt it ferguson said dillon grinned up at gibson derry you were lucky not to get wet gibson smiled reluctantly damn you sean oh thats already taken care of salter said would you like a table baron i think we can manage that thank you but art deco has never appealed i just wanted to say hello he smiled and that im thinking of you all he turned to rossi and gibson we can go now he looked back at ferguson and dillon take care now i wouldnt want anything to happen to you they walked out harry said i dont know what that was all about he shook his head at dillon let the old bastard do his worst that was the point harry hes daring us to do our worst outside the three of them drove away and rossi leaned forward and closed the divider the baron said so youve made a decision yes its ferguson first im going to kidnap him i love it gibson said whats the point of that the baron asked marco im going to take him to schloss adler and explore the market shall we say with all fergusons experience im sure everyone would love to have a piece of him the russians the arabs you name it come on marco you cant fool me the only reason you want to get your hands on ferguson in this way would be to pull in dillon because you know very well that dillon would come to his rescue marco smiled happily let him try i think you underestimate dillon marco youve underestimated him from the beginning never play with a tiger finish him off before he turns on you but its your play if you want to do this i wont give you my blessing but i wont stand in your way thank you father give me a cigarette rossi did and the baron sat back to smoke it thinking of his son his handsome son yale university the war hero with the medals and yet in the end so stupid germany london germany max kubel had been sitting in a bar in berlin the tabu when he had taken ropers call on his mobile born in he was the only son of one of the great luftwaffe night fighter aces of the second world war also named max kubel and a knights cross holder hed been another example of a man who couldnt let go after the war and had made a living out of flying in and out of east germany in the cold war days once too often as it happened when a russian mig fighter downed him one night in because of his fathers record max had been allowed into a governmentsponsored scheme to train as a pilot with the german luftwaffe that was both good and bad he had a flair for it like his father but a restless temperament not much suited to discipline the years had rolled by rather boringly the german governments reluctance to commit to combat situations leaving little room for his fathers kind of war and max had worshiped his fathers exploits his life in his case there was no combat just flying into countries in africa or the middle east on behalf of the united nations cargo planes humanitarian work and he hated it and then out of saudi and skirting iraq flying three un peace officials hed been bounced by an iraqi mig and fired on he had pulled his fathers old luftwaffe trick gone down low and used full flaps at the last moment and the mig had gone headfirst into the desert to avoid him the three un officials had been delighted at still being in the land of the living one of them an irish woman had said he deserved a medal instead the luftwaffe had thrown him out for flouting their nocombat rules since then hed discovered the lucrative delights of various kinds of smuggling using an old storch from the second world war doing night runs sometimes as far as poland he had fair hair and insolent blue eyes and wore his fathers old black leather luftwaffe flying jacket his personal talisman and he sat there thinking about the phone call roper had been impressive had even managed fluent german the mention of ferguson was enough roper had said he only wanted information on the barons movements at neustadt but there had to be more to it than that it was quite exciting really he was aware of the barons background knew of the general whispers about who rossi was had a professionals respect for his flying record no the prospect intrigued and he did have that drunken oaf hans klein to call on who helped him on occasion on cigarette runs a bar girl approached him he waved her away and dialed kleins number after a while there was an answer the words were slurred hed been drinking who is this max kubel where are you living now not much better than a pigsty the cottage at the back of the church you know the baron robbed me of my farm and that son of his beat the shit out of you ill have my day what do you want are you doing another run soon hans but i need to know whats going on in neustadt the barons movements and rossis are they in or out why because ill pay you well you stupid bastard and youll do it anyway because you hate them youve got my mobile number so get on with it he switched off feeling suddenly incredibly cheerful and the bar girl came back and stroked his hair a drink max he ran a hand up her leg very definitely whiskey liebchen malt whiskey well both have one and then can i come back well see elsa well see at harrys place they reached the end of their meal and split up on the pavement as they all started for their cars dillon said ill hang on with roper and share his cab if you like ferguson said they departed the cab drove up the driver got out and put the ramp down and dillon pushed roper inside stable mews he called to the driver when he got in and turned to roper on your way what are you up to me nothing im restless thats all thats when i worry about you no need i dont believe that for a moment he murdered sara hesser dillon lit a cigarette ive never been so certain of anything in my life i should shoot him but ferguson says no even though weve taken out people as bad as rossi before maybe ferguson is intent on handling this differently and maybe marco rossi has his own ideas about handling maybe hes a lot like me the cab drew up in stable mews and dillon got out roper said sean whatever it is dont youre a great guy roper one of the few people in this rotten old world i truly admire but as we say in belfast good night to you he let himself into the cottage went upstairs changed into jeans and a bomber jacket went down opened the secret drawer under the stairs selected a walther and slipped it into the back of his jeans he left a few moments later in his mini cooper after the meeting at harrys place rossi had phoned newton and cook and told them to report to south audley street you stay on ferguson first thing tomorrow you find out every single place he goes but why newton said whats the purpose of this the purpose you stupid oaf is that were going to lift him at the right moment there was consternation on both faces now look here cook said were not into that marco rossi said youre into what i say you are or ill see you never work again do what youre told and dont fuck with me there was a moment of hesitation then newton said as you say mr rossi right get on with it and dont use your car get a white van something anonymous right they went out and gibson whod been in the room watching said they used to be sas no wonder the provos did so well what happens now theres an old airbase at fotley its got a decaying runway but its usable ill have one of our planes left there when we lift ferguson ill fly it myself to where schloss adler the game starts there the game derry that will bring in sean dillon well that will suit me fine in south audley street dillon left the mini and walked through light rain to the side street where the rashid house stood he stood in the shadows and watched and suddenly the door opened and newton and cook emerged he recognized them at once and drew back into the shadows they crossed to their car and got in it was only then that dillon hurried across the street opened the door and put the muzzle of his walther to newton s temple hello guys am i your worst nightmare or not newton said christ its you dillon as ever was whats going on with rossi for gods sake we just work for rashid on security hes our new boss thats all i swear he was genuinely fearful and dillon sensed it okay piss off but come up against me and ill kill you both of you they drove away dillon turned to walk and the door opened and rossi emerged in a blue tracksuit a towel at his throat he started to run dillon called hey you bastard rossi paused turned and saw him dillon is that you what are you going to do shoot me id love to but youve been put offlimits at the moment dillon shook out a cigarette and lit it killing the old woman a big war hero like you it couldnt have given much of a kick fuck you dillon rossi said youve got it wrong right time right place ill kill you marco she was a nice old lady you shouldnt have done it he turned and walked away marco rossi took a deep breath and started to run again behind him the front door of the house gently closed the baron had followed him had wanted a word and instead had heard everything he turned and with a heavy heart mounted the stairs the daimler picked ferguson up the following morning at cavendish place where newton and cook were parked in a british telecom van wearing appropriate yellow anoraks they followed at a discreet distance to harley street watched the daimler park and waited cook opening the rear door of the van taking out a large toolbox and looking busy newton strolled up the street glancing at the brass nameplate on the door as he passed and returned to cook he leaned against the van and lit a cigarette some surgeon name of merriman professor henry merriman was a large avuncular man who greeted ferguson warmly a young nurse stood at a side table various medical items laid out beside her a pleasure general well get straight on with it its a very quick procedure just strip to the waist and emily here will take care of your things he went to the table ferguson got his jacket tie and shirt off i hope it doesnt hurt he said cheerfully nothing a little local anaesthetic cant handle he turned a small plastic ampoule in his hand sit down please and raise your left arm its instant a slight prick and his skin was numb excellent ferguson said emily was standing with what looked like a small aluminum pistol in one hand merriman took it from her i call it my stun gun but thats a joke he placed the muzzle against ferguson s armpit pulled a trigger there was the slightest of clicks he smiled you can get dressed he handed the gun to the girl ferguson picked up his shirt thats it what happens now nothing your implant is already codeindexed into the omega programs computer where you go it goes any corner of the world ferguson finished dressing it made him feel rather gloomy what about the toilet will it locate me there which the young nurse found very funny and laughed merriman smiled a possibility ferguson said good morning professor its been a sincere treat dillon called in at ropers and found him as usual at the computer banks he paused from what he was doing did you do something stupid i suppose so dillon told him what had happened damn you sean for an idiot youre baiting stirring the pot its rossi i want to see him in i know hell have you told ferguson no he wouldnt be pleased anyway he was doing the omega thing today can you access that i can access anything dillon ive already extracted his index code but he only had it this morning the microchip is precoded into the system so hes on the system from the moment hes implanted watch his fingers danced over the keys a map of england appeared there he is the yellow luminous dot now we go in closer london and theres the dot again closer and there we are pall mall and moving knowing ferguson id say lunch at the reform club thanks for the information but ill keep out of his way and dillon left rossi landed at fotley the old raf airbase he had chosen and found gibson waiting for him rossi taxied to the end of the runway and turned then switched off and got out and gibson drove up to him you found it then rossi said i must have im here arent i queer sort of place everything looks as if its falling down it is the war was a long time ago but the runways still sound and thats all that matters twenty miles i made it thats what i figured back to town to what derry asked as he turned onto a country road youll see to his astonishment what he returned to was not what he had expected the rolls was parked outside the rashid house the chauffeur loading luggage into the trunk the baron appeared out of the door in his trilby and black leather coat and leaning on his cane rossi said to gibson pull over and leave this to me he approached von berger father what is this ive decided to go away marco to schloss adler but why i need time to think i heard you and dillon last night my son you lied to me you shouldnt have done it it wasnt honorable but father the baron said nothing more he got in the rolls the chauffeur slipped behind the wheel and they drove away gibson said what in the hell was that all about dillon rossi said damn him hes been a stone in my shoe too long ill have him at that moment his mobile sounded and when he answered newton said were around the corner from the reform club in pall mall ferguson s gone in probably for lunch rossi said okay dont stay go to cavendish place and set up there ill send gibson to join you were going to do it today now look im not sure about this newton said i am look newton i can finish you or i can give you a nice fat fee which is it in or out greed and fear of course won the day in dillon turned up at the ministry of defence and found hannah in the main office at her computer she stopped and leaned back to look at him whats up why should anything be up i know my sean oh i suppose i was a bit stupid last night tell me which he did lighting a cigarette and looking out the window when he finished she said you fool i know its rossi and what he did i cant get sara hesser out of my mind sean ive a psychology degree so heres a free reading oh rossi did the murder but you feel as guilty as hell because you gave that woman a promise what was it no harm will come to you on this earth i swear it dillon never so emotional in his life said and remember what happened she touched my face and said i believe you youre a good man in spite of yourself she had never seen him so haggard and drawn me the great sean dillon and you know what happened and who was responsible and ill see rossi in hell for it he turned and found the door to ferguson s office open and the general standing in the doorway then youll go straight down the same road to hell yourself dillon what on earth did you think you were doing confrontation direct threats its not the way to handle things at the moment you were totally out of order i usually am right youre suspended leave the office now ill speak to you again at what i consider to be an appropriate time you will surrender all your weapons dillon managed a gentle smile ah well charles i always thought the day would come but youve been a decent ould stick and in spite of serbia in the old days when you sold me out youve treated me well he turned to hannah oh sean she said i know i always take the hard approach and i know that doesnt hold with your fine jewish morality but revenge is a concept not unknown in the old testament ill be on my way and god bless all here he disappeared and ferguson said damn him why did he do it it unscrambles things in the wrong way its simple sir he can be more emotional than you think hes put himself on the line for me in the past for you all he could think of was an old lady who trusted him and ended up in the river in spite of everything dillons done if you want a psychopath here its not him its marco rossi to hell with it im going home order the daimler its not available general out for maintenance today remember then get me a bloody taxi and he stormed back into his office dillon sat in his mini cooper thinking about things well everything had to come to an end that was life still and all thered been a lot of water under the bridge he reached for a cigarette lit it looked out and saw ferguson walk to a waiting black taxi and get in it moved off and dillon switched on the mini cooper and went after him there was no logical reason that he should except perhaps for some instinct an irish thing but he did eased out into the traffic and followed the cab in cavendish place newton and cook had taken up a manhole to explain their presence derry gibson also wearing a yellow telecom jacket sat inside the van reading a newspaper newton moved to the passenger window come on its been nearly four hours are we getting anywhere at that moment a black cab drew up derry said i think we might be and then ferguson got out and paid the driver who drove away now gibson said and opened the small leather case on the seat beside him and took out a small plastic ampoule get him he got out and as ferguson turned away they grabbed him by each arm and gibson moved in a real pleasure general and he jabbed ferguson in the neck the effect was almost instantaneous ferguson sagged they walked him to the back of the van gibson opened the door and they put him inside gibson following get going he said dillon turning in at the entrance to cavendish place saw everything and put his foot down a delivery van drove in front of him dillon braked and swerved beyond him the telecom van swung out into the traffic he joined in well behind the usual london traffic made things difficult but he always managed to stay focused on the telecom van he got out his codex four and checked into hannah who answered at once i followed ferguson home he was jumped by derry gibson newton and cook and dumped in a fake british telecom van im following where for gods sake north london i dont know essex way get in touch with roper he can invoke the omega thing that should tell you where were going tell him to keep me informed derry gibson called marco rossi weve bagged the bird im on my way ill see you at fotley well lets hope youre there before we are kidnapping draws at least ten years in this country roper cut into dillon ive heard the story im on the case omega is working fine ill track and keep you informed no reason to worry if you lose him ill put you back on track dillon had a thought these three goons are working for rossi so where are they going maybe its where are they flying ill check emerging from london the traffic thinned a little not all that much but enough to keep dillon well back roper came on the baron just left northolt destination munich ive checked there hes got a helicopter booked for neustadt has he now even more interesting rossi had a plane delivered to a place called fotley in essex this morning its an old raf airbase now disused with a long runway i think thats where youre going i hope you make it sean are you carrying i damn well am but what if i fail where are they going well omega will confirm but i think we both know schloss adler right then i suggest you get on to this max kubel he can alert the klein man at neustadt tell kubel to put in place whatever plan wed need to mount a rescue operation itll be a huge payday for him ill press on and hope to catch them at fotley in the end he failed mainly because of a farm tractor on a narrow country road he finally made the old airfield only to see the abandoned van and the gulfstream already moving as it lifted and roared past newton looked out jesus he said thats dillons mini cooper is that a fact derry gibson laughed ferguson unconscious was strapped in one of the seats derry patted his cheek ill go and tell rossi hell be so pleased at arnheim max kubel was working on the storch prior to a foray into poland hed always remembered the adage from the second world war half the airmen who die arent shot down by the enemy they die of engine failure it was why hed always taken care of his own maintenance he closed the engine cowling and slapped the fuselage which had a fresh coat of dull black paint good girl he said and his mobile went he listened to roper for a long five minutes and was immediately interested and full of energy ill talk to klein this meadow outside the schloss can it accommodate rossis plane especially at night its huge and the schloss is floodlit theres plenty of light so what would we do could you fly in while dillon attempts a recovery come off it the minute i attempted a landing the whole thing would be blown then how would we get to neustadt what could we do parachute in dillons done that before not into schloss adler battlements courtyards roofs it isnt nice then when you want to make a nefarious trip into holstein heath how do you do it i know how mysterious the damn place is the locals must be suspicious of any kind of strangers yes but if i put a group together for an inandout job they wont look like strangers the police in holstein heath look very like the vopos of the old east german days believe it or not they still use russian cossack motorcycles and field cars so what are you saying in the past ive gone in with my people when ive needed them using those vehicles and uniforms would dillon buy that well his german is fluent he couldnt do it on his own what about you no way my task would be to do the extracting dillon and whoever helped by kleins intelligence pull ferguson and all hell breaks out so the smart thing would be for me to fly in from arnheim its a short flight id drop in at the schloss in my storch and pick them up and youre confident you could do that to the great kubel anything is possible and to avoid any problem with angry foresters it would be the only way these are the barons people you mean its indian territory exactly another thing in the storch i could manage ferguson but only two others two men only to take on the situation at the castle ive got the idea that dillons that crazy but does he know someone else who is oh yes roper said i think so theres a big payday for you on this by the way stuff the payday ive been getting stale and ive looked you up roper youre what the jews call a mensch im a great admirer flattery is always appreciated ill speak to klein and get things moving at his cottage behind the church at neustadt klein took the call from kubel and listened to what he had to say so what do you want me to do let me know the minute the baron turns up in the helicopter after that rossi in his plane can you get into the schloss of course i can ive known it backwards since i was a child in spite of security the security is crap i can go around all that get this right hans theres a lot of money in it for you and where the baron is concerned it will be a pleasure ill go and check things out up there kubel switched off and klein got a hunting jacket on put a sawnoff shotgun in one pocket a double handful of cartridges in the other and went out smiling on the final stretch back to london dillon listened to everything roper had to say fine he said alert hannah tell her to book lacey and parry alert the quartermaster the destination will be arnheim theres one thing sean roper said you cant do this on your own dont tell me youre going to ride a cossack through the schwarze platz and do a dirty harry you need a friend ill get a friend youre sure trust me ill ask him and for this hell be there dillon turned down to hangmans wharf and the dark man parked and went inside there were only a couple of customers dora at the bar and harry and billy in their usual corner booth harry looked up and frowned you look stressed you could say that dillon sat down just listen when he was finished harry said i knew that rossi was bad news dillons phone sounded and roper said no question sean its neustadt theyre aiming for everything all right with you the extra man well see im sure you will he switched off dillon said billy you heard the story im going to go in like a vopo on a cossack its a good thing i speak german which i dont but you need a gun and i can wear one of these vopo uniforms as well as you can billy had that cold pale smile on his face it was harry who cut in wed better get sorted dillon we cant leave ferguson in the hands of these bastards anyway i like the old sod you and billy do it billys come on a bit since you took him in hand right billy likes doing something because its the right thing to do i should say so billy got up ill go and pack he smiled at dillon this is getting to be a habit at farley field dillon arrived to surprises first of all the presence of hannah bernstein he said what in the hell are you doing here i speak german sean and its my boss at the sharp end i think i should be here then the salter rolls appeared and disgorged not only billy but harry both with hand luggage dillon said what is this this german police thing im going with you ill stay back at base with the superintendent if you want but you always want to do it on your own well this time you cant its too important dillon said fine just dont get in the way he walked toward the citation and lacey came out dressed in anonymous flying overalls you know what were up to here the superintendent filled us in youll notice weve sprayed over our raf rondels dont want anybody identifying us you know where were going ropers filled us in sean this is something else i mean the general dont worry ill bring him back i swear it i dont want crew just you and parry board and ill see the quartermaster with billy the departments quartermaster waited with his list all loaded mr dillon walthers and carswell silencers three mp machine pistols thats going back a bit ive checked mr dillon and the police in the holstein heath area are rather oldfashioned i would point out that the schmeisser is still an extremely efficient weapon some stun grenades some smoke that should do you in the present circumstances you know what they are mr dillon the sergeant major said twentyfive years ago in the grenadier guards i was trying to hunt you down in the ira in south armagh and failed im glad because it means youre here to save the general who is one of the finest men ive ever known now ill load these items for you sir and youll return them to me when you get back dillon walked out with billy who said well hes got faith in you a lot of people do it can be a burden billy come on lets go were not saving the world this time were saving charles ferguson he went up the airstairs door followed by billy parry closed the door as they joined harry and hannah a few moments later the engines turned over on the citation and it lifted up into the sky charles ferguson came back to the real world to find himself on a bed in a periodlooking bedroom the door was locked and when he went to the window the fall was at least a hundred feet down it was immediately apparent that there was nowhere he could go he was standing at the window looking out when the door opened derry gibson came in ah there you are general you look well well ive felt better wheres rossi busy elsewhere youll have to compose yourself the grand man you are ill see you get some food the door closed and ferguson looked out the window again suddenly more alone than hed ever felt god dammit he thought you were right dillon at the same time rossi found his father in the great hall the baron was sitting by the fire a drink at his hand marco said father i think we should talk i think we should too have you succeeded in your endeavor if you mean have i lifted ferguson yes hes here in the schloss and you intend your purpose i dont see why not and dillon hot on the trail and thats what you want a facetoface confrontation any time he likes the baron nodded ive given things a great deal of thought i just dont know if i agree its in motion father everything i must see it through must you unless i am mistaken this is still schloss adler i am still the baron let me think about this marco me your father and at that moment the young ss sturmbahnführer was in charge again ill let you know what i want what i want not you now please go away for the moment hans klein had gone in at the lowest end of the schloss and found what he called the chamber entrance a great grill overgrown by shrubbery it was a legacy of german army engineering when the schloss had been used as a command headquarters and the whole drainage system had been modernized klein lifted the grill moved in and switched on his light the concrete tunnel was dry except for a steady stream of water down a center channel klein walked along one of the sides reached a steel ladder and climbed up raising the manhole cover at the top he emerged into a basement area that he knew well filled with storage rooms and kitchen areas gradually reaching up to the glories of the great hall he often penetrated that far when the baron and rossi were away it always gave him a feeling of power now he hovered in the basement area was aware of voices resonating and withdrew and went back down the ladder when he emerged into the wooded area he replaced the grill moved away squatted down by a tree and called kubel afterward kubel spoke to roper all systems go his secret way into the schloss works when the gulfstream landed he saw rossi and four other men one of them being supported between two others the general probably newton and cook holding him up plus derry gibson that would make sense are you going to be ready for us max the right gear all here so i wont need help which means security will be nice and tight well be ready roper whenever your friends are it was a couple of hours later that a key rattled in the door ferguson turned and rossi came in with derry gibson i just wanted to make sure you were comfortable how kind when do i get to see the baron when he wants to see you compose yourself your turn will come he turned away ferguson said you seem to be going to a lot of trouble id have thought youd have given me a bullet in the head by now rossi smiled not for you general youre much too valuable what happens to me then ill probably sell you to the arabs rossi said and the door closed at the same moment at arnheim they all grouped around the table in max kubels office and examined the map thats it kubel said neustadt he turned to dillon its an oldfashioned motorcycle the cossack dont worry ill manage dillon said he turned to billy you get the sidecar kubel said thanks to these mobiles youve brought well be in constant touch you should get there in an hour at the most once you bring him out i can make the meadow in twenty minutes ill be sitting in the cockpit ready to go that sounds reasonable dillon said how about you billy im always reasonable once you leave ill call klein hell be waiting his place is the only cottage at the back of the church you cant miss it he glanced around the table how does it sound lacey and parry looked dubious it was hannah who said the whole thing seems to depend on splitsecond timing absolutely but it is possible the distances involved are not great well in the circumstances harry salter said can they get on with it its not good for my nerves exactly billy said personally i cant wait to dress as a copper the old lags i was at wandsworth with will never believe it fine this way then kubel said in the hangar the storch waited black like something from another time the old cossack motorcycle waited too everyone waited uncertainty thick in the air kubel stood with lacey and parry and looked out as it started to rain not good lacey said it never is when good is needed squadron leader havent you noticed that a door clanged they turned and dillon and billy emerged strange and menacing figures from the past in their steel helmets vopo uniforms and dispatch riders raincoats each had a schmeisser machine pistol slung across his chest dillon was fastening his helmet strap have you got everything kubel asked absolutely big pockets extra magazines a walther apiece stick grenade in the boot just like the old days christ you look like youre going to make a dday movie salter said who knows dillon looked out nice evening for it he turned you up for this billy lets get going for gods sake were going to get bleeding soaked he settled himself in the sidecar and dillon mounted the cossack and kicked it into life hannah ran forward and put a hand on his sleeve sean her face was desperate well bring him back he smiled you worry too much and he drove away into the driving rain the road into the schwarze platz was well surfaced but quite narrow the forest crowding in and already the gloom of early evening was turning toward darkness the rain was relentless and both dillon and billy wore goggles the cossack responded well and there was little traffic twice they passed farm trucks going in the other direction and once a sedan dillon turned and shouted to billy well be there sooner than kubel thought and in spite of the weather he pushed the cossack up to sixty at the schloss the baron sat by the log fire as rossi came in with ferguson newton and cook stood on either side of the grand stairway on the landing holding aks derry gibson stood to one side of the fireplace ah there you are general join me perhaps youd like a drink how very kind a large whiskey would do it marco it was an order and rossi went to a sideboard poured the whiskey and ferguson savored it your chaps look as if theyre expecting trouble no actually were expecting dillon rossi said how on earth would he know where i was ferguson was wary could they know about omega because he saw you being kidnapped and chased us all the way to fotley airfield arrived just too late how unfortunate it certainly was for you the baron said enough marco lets show our guest some courtesy he got up and leaned on his cane come with me general and ill show you some of the rarer sights of the schloss he led the way to a door beside the stairway and nodded to marco who opened it a tunnel built in the fifteenth century to give access to the chapel which incidentally is very fine lets take a look and he led the way in at that moment dillon was kicking on kleins door after a while it opened and klein stood there he recoiled instinctively at the uniforms they pushed him back inside dont worry were from kubel dillon said in german are you ready to take us in yes klein said eagerly he reeked of drink but turned took down his hunting coat and put the sawnoff shotgun in one of the pockets dillon called kubel on his codex four it was answered instantly were here already and made contact with klein so were going straight in to hell with waiting you said it would take you twenty minutes leave in fifteen im your man kubel said good luck dillon said to billy right lets get it done he turned to klein my friend doesnt speak german just lead the way and lets get on with it the baron leading they went into the chapel the candles guttering the great bowl of the eternal flame burning the heraldic banners hung from each side of the roof in the gloom seven hundred years of my familys history general very impressive ferguson said no hint of the third reich i see no nazi banners but i was never a member of the nazi party however you did give distinguished service to the ss the waffen ss the greatest fighting soldiers the world has ever seen thats one point of view and you were hitlers aide true but he had many i was an office boy if you like come now entrusted with the holiest of missions on the whim of a man who had become unbalanced at the end wait there he walked behind the mausoleum opened the secret cavity took out the diary and held it up you think this is what its all about the führers diary a holy book thats what sara hesser told me wrong my family motto is a matter of honor the führers mission got me out of berlin gave me money to make a fresh start because of that it is a matter of honor to guard it oh some of the information particularly that affecting the president could be useful but that was never the point of my feud with you he replaced the diary ferguson heard a creak as the cavity closed so what is the point kate rashid saved my life in baghdad dillon killed her brothers and was responsible for her death and through him you so im to pay the blood price dillon will also pay if as my son hopes he comes for you so whats my price well go back to the hall and discuss it in spite of the floodlighting of the schloss the wooded area on the slopes was dark and gloomy as klein led the way through the shrubbery to the chamber entrance and removed the grill he went down the steps switched on a large flashlight and splayed it across the concrete tunnel here we are takes us straight into the heart of the schloss he took out half a bottle of schnapps and poured it down good dillon said but cut that out we need you sober at the same moment at arnheim max kubel boosted power and let the storch go the argus engine responding magnificently he lifted off into rain the others stood watching hannah said its all up to dillon now well it usually bleeding is harry salter said when they emerged into the basement area klein led the way through a series of deserted corridors and kitchens no servants dillon asked i checked in the village he only keeps a handful hes given them all time off they went up a flight of stairs and he opened a door cautiously the outer hall he whispered it was dark they could hear voices close by they must be in the great hall klein said follow me if we go up the stairway over there theres a place where you can look down he swallowed more schnapps while dillon explained to billy and they moved on their weapons at the ready seated by the fire again ferguson said so lets hear the worst its simple rossi told him your record in the field of international intelligence makes you a very valuable commodity of course i could simply shoot you but that would be a waste what i get for you will in some way make up for the financial loss over the mona lisa debacle theres only one problem with that ferguson said cheerfully my value would depend on what i had to say and im not a very talkative individual oh we can take care of that a little drug called succinylcholine its used as a muscle relaxant in certain operations but only if the patient is unconscious if he isnt it leaves him totally paralyzed unable to breathe and in exquisite pain the effect lasts two minutes but the idea of a repeat performance would be too terrible to contemplate no youd sing for your supper and ferguson knew fear as he never had before but managed a smile sounds pretty ghastly and he turned to the baron and you would approve of this business im sure i wont have to you will of course be sensible halfway up the great stone stairs was a small viewing room to one side a very medieval item with an open front through which one could see everything in the great hall dillon billy and klein staying cautiously back had a clear enough sight the magnificent chandelier hanging from the boarded ceiling illuminated the scene below the oaken table the silver candlesticks candles flaring newton and cook on the landing at the top of the marble stairs gibson by the log fire the baron and ferguson seated opposite each other rossi to one side dillon took it all in and pulled them back does this staircase link up to the other landing he asked klein in german yes and the door down below is the only way into the great hall thats right good ill send my friend up to the landing and ill go through the door and what about me you stay here and keep watch now look dillon said do as youre told he jammed his machine pistol against kleins chest i mean it klein put up a hand okay fine billy said is he being awkward more like a pain in the arse go up those stairs turn at the top and youll be on the landing overlooking the hall think you can handle newton and cook any day including my day off what about you ill go downstairs and go in hard through the hall door fifty billy counting from now they parted billy up and dillon down klein furious took out the bottle of schnapps and drank from it then went back into the viewing room taking out his sawnoff shotgun below rossi was saying i thought an auction might be fun you do like to twist the knife old son ferguson said like the ivory madonna oh i know all about that when you were on the run behind serb lines you killed four people only two of whom were women you make a habit of that witness sara hesser damn you ferguson rossi cried his right hand coming out of his pocket holding the madonna at the same moment klein up above and thoroughly drunk leaned out and shouted ive got you now baron hurled the empty schnapps bottle and fired both barrels of his sawnoff strangely enough it was ferguson who saved the baron hurling himself forward and knocking him from his chair but it was derry gibson the old irish hand who got klein firing a browning three times catching klein in the forehead sending him back into the wall to bounce back over the edge and fall into the hall below all of their timing was blown billy advancing on newton and cook had no choice but to shoot newton while dillon below kicked in the door stood to one side and sprayed across ferguson and the baron were behind the sofa rossi and gibson upended the table and fired toward the door dillon called you okay billy got newton cook to go there was a burst of firing dillon called see what you can do with the chandelier ill help one two three go they gave it sustained fire it splintered shards flying everywhere sagged then ripped out of the ceiling plunging the hall into darkness and crashed to the floor parts of it showering the table on the landing cook panicked totally stood up firing his ak and billy drove him back with a short burst then started down the stairs dillon ran in firing high and confronted rossi and derry gibson as they emerged from behind the wreck of the chandelier and table billy came up behind them hold it he ran his hands over them and relieved them of two pistols and rossi of the ivory madonna he sprang the blade thats handy he snapped the blade shut and put it in his pocket ferguson and the baron were standing now ferguson said what kept you billy said from what i could see from up there you saved this old sod what on earth for it seemed like the civilized thing to do and he was very civilized to me dillon he took me to the chapel and produced a tantalizing glimpse of the diary hidden in the mausoleum really well we came for you charles but the diary is definitely a bonus rossi hadnt said a word merely stood there glowering and gibson was poised to take any chance to run for it dillon knew that all right he said to rossi lead the way coming in at six hundred feet kubel had a perfect view of the schloss wonderfully floodlit the meadow below at one hundred and sixty miles per hour hed made a hugely quick run in spite of the heavy rain but at the end it had faded into a drizzle there was a quartermoon pale rainwashed and then the floodlit schloss the great meadow and he went down and made a perfect landing taxied to the far end turned and taxied back his codex four sounded and he replied kubel dillon here heard you coming in weve got him fine ready to leave when you are they grouped close to the mausoleum in the chapel billy covering rossi gibson and the baron with his schmeisser ferguson fiddled about at the back its in here somewhere a secret cavity of some sort youll never find it the baron said tranquilly i havent got time to waste dillon grabbed rossi by the hair took a walther from the pocket of his raincoat and rammed the muzzle against the side of his skull produce it or ill kill him i dont think so then you dont know me dillon turned to gibson i told you never to run back to me he shot him between the eyes hurling him back against the steps of the mausoleum blood flying there was general shock and then he rammed the muzzle of the walther against rossis skull again its up to you no the baron cried in anguish ill give it to you but only if you swear on your honor to spare him it was ferguson who intervened you have my word the old man went to the back of the mausoleum and there was one slight creaking as he opened the cavity he came back with the diary and held it out to ferguson who took it a holy book according to sara hesser you swore an oath never to copy it i never did excellent ferguson went up the two steps to the eternal flame and dropped the diary inside it started to burn at once rossi cried out you bloody fool father theyll kill us anyway dillon shoved him away and raised his walther but ferguson said no its over and i did give my word we leave now and he walked out youre a lucky man dillon said i gave up on honor a long time ago come on billy they went out following ferguson back along the tunnel hurrying past the carnage in the great hall and out to the front door turning down the steps to the courtyard several vehicles were parked there including a land rover with the keys in it this will do dillon said and got behind the wheel the other two scrambled in and he drove away and out across the drawbridge rossi emerged from the front of the chapel his father on his heels and looked far down into the meadow my god its a storch theyre leaving in an old crate like that well ill show them he stormed down the path to the courtyard and his father stumbled along behind him but what are you going to do my gulfstream is three times faster than that thing ill run the bastards into the ground he was beside himself with rage youre crazy the baron said as he plucked at rossis sleeve rossi pulled away started to run and the old man went after him in the courtyard rossi scrambled into a station wagon switched it on drove for the gate and found the baron standing there arms outstretched the familiar cane in one hand rossi had no option but to stop and the baron had the passenger door open in a second and hauled himself in whatever we do we do together now get on with it ferguson dillon and billy packed into the storch and max kubel grinned and shouted over the roaring of the engine alls well that ends well lets get the hell out of here a sound idea weve left four dead men up there ferguson told him then we really had better get moving he boosted power roared down the meadow and lifted into the air dillon looked out and down in time to see the station wagon drawing up to the gulfstream and gestured kubel glanced back if you didnt leave rossi dead back there then that will be him theres no one else it could be lets move it he didnt stand a hope of course there was no way of getting away not with the gulfstreams speed there was no chance of being shot down because the gulfstream wasnt a fighting aircraft which meant only one thing he was going to get bounced rossi would force him to crash in the forest and rossi was a damn good pilot he was at one thousand feet when he felt a great shock wave the storch rocked in the turbulence the gulfstream passed over them then banked came around and took up a station to port as rossi reduced speed he had the cockpit lights on and looking across dillon could see von berger siting in the righthand pilots seat staring out my god hes got the baron with him he shouted the gulfstream roared away banked and came back toward them headon lifting at the last moment and passing over the storch rocking again in the turbulence no kubel said hes trying to force me down so low ill hit the trees lets play a different game he hauled back the column and climbed to two and a half thousand feet and in the cockpit of the gulfstream rossi snarled what in the hell is he doing that pilot this is ridiculous the baron said madness lets go back im damned if i will and at that moment kubel took the storch nosedown into the steepest dive of his career and rossi went roaring after him the storch held true and kubel didnt haul back the column until the last suicidal moment leveling at five hundred feet the baron placed his hand over rossis its enough he said and pushed the control column forward the gulfstream chasing at four hundred miles an hour ploughed straight into the forest in a ball of fire dillon shouted to kubel youre a genius he wasnt in his right mind kubel replied nobody flying a plane that way could be it was his choice ferguson said i cant say im sorry he had a terrible fate in mind for me and the baron was going to stand by and let him get on with it they can roast in hell as far as im concerned dillon said lets go home they came into arnheim shortly afterward and landed by the hangar where hannah harry lacey and parry waited my god its great to see you general harry said hannah impulsively kissed ferguson on the cheek im so glad you made it sir well all that can wait all aboard i want us out of here fast dillon you and billy had better change what about you ferguson asked kubel oh ill fly off after youre gone time for an extended holiday i think you were wonderful back there yes i was wasnt i lacey and parry were in the cockpit of the citation hannah and harry boarded ferguson followed and dillon and billy came running out of the hangar a moment later dillon said to kubel i thought i was a good pilot but youre a great pilot isnt he a great pilot billy bleeding marvelous lets go they went up the airstairs door and parry closed it behind them a few moments later they were rolling down the runway taking off and climbing fast okay what happened harry demanded it can wait harry ferguson said as usual they covered themselves with glory he turned to hannah be kind enough to call roper mission accomplished hitler diary destroyed baron max von berger marco rossi and derry gibson departed this life for who knows what ask him to relay that information to blake johnson too of course sir and the prime minister ill deal with him myself she went to the back of the cabin and moved into the kitchen for privacy harry got the bar cupboard open i reckon a drinks in order except for billy here im going to have a kip anyway billy said putting his seat back and closing his eyes bushmills harry held the bottle up youve got friends at court you little irish sod he found three glasses and paused there was a kind of companionable silence they drank it down and harry poured again ferguson toasted dillon a hard one sean but you did well they get harder dillon said i sometimes think i should find a better class of work ferguson shook his head and said softly dont be silly where on earth would you go
