jumped onto the wall and bowedat your fucking service thank you the yeoman grumbled and spat after the raven there have always been ravens at the white tower a thousand years ago before george ii idiot king of merica destroyed the world there were ravens here the legend says that as long as there are ravens at the tower england will stand strong still it may have been a mistake to teach one to talk the earl of gloucester approaches cried a sentry on the west wall with his son edgar and the bastard edmund the yeoman by me grinned gloucester eh be sure you do that bit where you play a goat and drool plays the earl mistaking you for his wife that would be unkind said i the earl is newly widowed you did it the last time he was here and she was still warm in the grave well yes a service

the wall when opportunity presented heard he was going to have you assassinated but he couldnt make a case to the king gloucesters a noble he doesnt need a case for murder just a whim and a blade not bloody likely the yeoman said everyone knows the kings got a wing oer you that was true i enjoy a certain license have you seen drool with gloucester here therell be a command performance my apprentice droola beefwitted bloke the size of a draught horse he was in the kitchen before the watch said the yeoman the kitchen buzzedthe staff preparing for a feast have you seen drool i asked taster who sat at the table staring sadly at a bread trencher trenchera thick wide slice of stale bread used like a plate laid out with cold pork the kings dinner he was a thin sickly lad chosen no doubt for his weakness of constitution and a predisposition toward dropping dead at the slightest provocation i liked to tell him my troubles sure that they would not travel far does this look poisoned to you its pork lad lovely eat up half the men in england would give a testicle to feast thus and it only midday im tempted myself i tossed my headgave him a grin and a bit of a jingle on the ol hat bells to cheer him i pantomimed stealing a bit of his pork after you of course a knife thumped into the table by my hand back fool said bubble the head cook thats the kings lunch and ill have your balls before ill let you at it my balls are yours for the asking milady said i would you have them on a trencher or shall i serve them in a bowl of cream like peaches bubble harrumphed yanked her knife from the table and went back to gutting a trout at the butcher block her great bottom rolling like thunderclouds under her skirt as she moved youre a wicked little man pocket said squeak waves of freckles riding oer her shy smile she was second to the cook a sturdy gingerhaired girl with a high giggle and a generous spirit in the dark taster and i often passed pleasant afternoons at the table watching her wring the necks of chickens pocket is my name by the way given to me by the abbess who found me on the nunnery doorstep when i was a tiny babe true i am not a large fellow some might even say i am diminutive but i am quick as a cat and nature has compensated me with other gifts but wicked i think drool was headed to the princesss chambers squeak said aye said taster glumly the lady sent for a cure for melancholy and the git went jest on his own the boy wasnt ready what if he blundered tripped fell on the princess like a millstone on a butterfly are you sure bubble dropped a gutless trout into a bushel of slippery cofishes cofishesother fish in a group coworkers cohorts etc shut up its a word chanting off to do ma duty he was we told him youd be looking for him when we heard princess goneril and the duke of albany was coming albanys coming aint he sworn to string your entrails from the chandelier asked taster no corrected squeak that was duke of cornwall albany was going to have his head on a pike i believe pike wasnt it bubble aye have his head on a pike funny thing thinkin about it youd look like a bigger version of your puppetstick there jones said taster pointing to my jesters scepter jones who is indeed a smaller version of my own handsome countenance fixed atop a sturdy handle of polished hickory jones speaks for me when even my tongue needs to exceed safe license with knights and nobles his head prepiked for the wrath of the dull and humorless my finest art is oft lost in the eye of the subject yes that would be right hilarious bubbleironic imagerylike the lovely squeak turning you on a spit over a fire an apple up both your ends for coloralthough i daresay the whole castle might conflagrate in the resulting grease fire but until then wed laugh and laugh i dodged a wellflung trout then and paid bubble a grin for not throwing her knife instead fine woman she despite being large and quick to anger well ive a great drooling dolt to find if we are to prepare an entertainment for the evening cordelias chambers lay in the north tower the quickest way there was atop the outer wall as i crossed over the great main gatehouse a young spotfaced yeoman called hail earl of gloucester below the greybeard gloucester and his retinue were crossing the drawbridge hail edmund you bloody bastard i called over the wall the yeoman tapped me on the shoulder beggin your pardon sirrah sirrahform of address dude but im told that edmund is sensitive about his bastardy aye yeoman said i no need for prodding and jibe to divine that pricks tender spot he wears it on his sleeve i jumped on the wall and waved jones at the bastard who was trying to wrench a bow and quiver from a knight who rode beside him you whoreson scalawag said i you fleshturd dropped stinking from the poxy arsehole of a harelipped harlot the earl of gloucester glowered up at me as he passed under the portcullis portcullisa heavy vertical grate usually spiked on the bottom and made of or clad in iron to resist fire typically the inner gate of a fortress an open grate so attackers could be hit with arrows or spears if they broke through the outer gates shot to the heart that one said the yeoman too harsh then you reckon a bit sorry excellent hat though bastard i called by way of making amends edgar and two knights were trying to restrain the bastard edmund below i jumped down from the wall havent seen drool have you in the great hall this morning said the yeoman not since a call came around the top of the wall passing from yeoman to yeoman until we heard the duke of cornwall and princess regan approach from the south fuckstockings cornwall polished greed and pure born villainy hed dirk dirka knife especially a dagger or the act of using a dagger on someone a nun for a farthing farthingthe smallest denomination of english coinage equal to one quarter of a penny and short the coin for the fun dont worry little one the kingll keep your hide whole aye yeoman he will and if you call me little one in company the kingll have you walking watch on the frozen moat all winter sorry sir jester sir said the yeoman he slouched then as not to seem so irritatingly tall heard that tasty princess regans a right bunny cunny eh he leaned down to elbow me in the ribs now that we were best mates and all youre new arent you just two months in service advice then young yeoman when referring to the kings middle daughter state that she is fair speculate that she is pious but unless youd like to spend your watch looking for the box where your head is kept resist the urge to wax ignorant on her naughty bits i dont know what that means sir speak not of regans shaggacity son cornwall has taken the eyes of men who have but looked upon the princess with but the spark of lust the fiend i didnt know sir ill say nothing and neither shall i good yeoman neither shall i and thus are alliances made loyalties cemented pocket makes a friend the boy was right about regan of course and why i hadnt thought to call her bunny cunny myself when i of all people should knowwell as an artist i must admit i was envious of the invention cordelias private solar solara sitting room or parlor in the top story of a tower the tower unblocked by outer walls receives a lot of sun thus the name lay at the top of a narrow spiral staircase lit only with the crosses of arrow loops i could hear giggling as i topped the stairs so i am of no worth if not on the arm and in the bed of some buffoon in a codpiece i heard cordelia say you called said i stepping into the room codpiece in hand the ladiesinwaiting giggled young lady jane who is but thirteen shrieked at my presencedisturbed no doubt by my overt manliness or perhaps by the gentle clouting on the bottom she received from jones pocket cordelia sat at the center of the circle of girlsholding court as suchher hair down blond curls to her waist a simple gown of lavender linen loosely laced she stood and approached me you honor us fool did you hear rumors of small animals to hurt or were you hoping to accidentally surprise me in my bath again i tipped my hat a slight contrite jingle there i was lost milady a dozen times finding my way is not my strong suit if you want a navigator ill send for him but hold me blameless should your melancholy triumph and you drown yourself in the brook your gentle ladies weeping damply around your pale and lovely corpse let them say she was not lost in the map confident as she was in her navigator but lost in heart for want of a fool the ladies gasped as if id cued them id have blessed them if i were still on speaking terms with god out out out ladies cordelia said give me peace with my fool so that i might devise some punishment for him the ladies scurried out of the room punishment i asked for what i dont know yet she said but by the time ive thought of the punishment im sure therell be an offense i blush at your confidence and i at your humility said the princess she grinned a crescent too devious for a maid of her tender years cordelia is not ten years my junior im not sure exactly of my own age seventeen summers has she seen and as the youngest of the kings daughters shes always been treated as if fragile as spun glass but sweet thing that she is her bark could frighten a mad badger shall i disrobe for my punishment i offered flagellation fellation whatever i am your willing penitent lady no more of that pocket i need your counsel or at least your commiseration my sisters are coming to the castle unfortunately they have arrived oh thats right albany and cornwall want to kill you bad luck that anyway they are coming to the castle as are gloucester and his sons goodness they want to kill you as well rough critics said i sorry and a dozen other nobles as well as the earl of kent are here kent doesnt want to kill you does he not that i know of but it is only lunchtime right and do you know why they are all coming to corner me like a rat in a barrel barrels do not have corners pocket does seem like a lot of bother for killing one small if tremendously handsome fool its not about you you dolt its about me well even less effort to kill you how many can it take to snap your scrawny neck i worry that drool will do it by accident someday you havent seen him have you he stinks i sent him away this morning she waved a hand furiously to return to her point father is marrying me off nonsense who would have you the lady darkened a bit then blue eyes gone cold badgers across blighty blightybritain great britain slang shuddered edgar of gloucester has always wanted me and the prince of france and duke of burgundy are already here to pay me troth troth about what troth about what troth troth you fool not truth the princes are here to marry me those two edgar no i was shaken cordelia married would one of them take her away it was unjust unfair wrong why she had never even seen me naked why would they want to troth you i mean for the night to be sure who wouldnt troth you crosseyed but permanently i think not im a bloody princess pocket precisely what good are princesses dragon food and ransom markersspoiled brats to be bartered for real estate oh no dear fool you forget that sometimes a princess becomes a queen ha princesses what worth are you if your father has to tack a dozen counties to your bum to get those french poofters to look at you oh and what worth a fool nay what worth a fools second for you merely carry the drool cup for the natural a naturalthe natural jester was one who had some physical deformity or anomaly a hunchback a dwarf a giant downs syndrome etc naturals were thought to have been touched by god whats the ransom for a jester pocket a bucket of warm spittle i grabbed my chest pierced to the core i am i gasped i staggered to a chair i bleed i suffer i die on the forked lance of your words she came to me you do not no stay back blood stains will never come out of linenthey are stubborned with your cruelty and guilt pocket stop it now you have kilt me lady most dead i gasped i spasmed i coughed let it always be said that this humble fool brought joy to all whom he met no one will say that shhhh child i grow weak no breath i looked at the imaginary blood on my hands horrified i slid off a chair to the floor but i want you to know that despite your vicious nature and your freakishly large feet i have always and then i died bloody fucking brilliantly id say too hint of a shudder at the end as deaths chilly hand grabbed my knob what what you have always what i said nothing being dead and not a little exhausted from all the bleeding and gasping truth be told under the jest i felt like id taken a bolt to the heart youre absolutely no help at all said cordelia the raven landed on the wall as i made my way back to the common house in search of drool no little vexed was i by the news of cordelias looming nuptials ghost said the raven i didnt teach you that bollocks replied the raven thats the spirit ghost piss off bird said i then a cold wind bit at my bum and at the top of the stairs in the turret ahead i saw a shimmering in the shadows like silk in sunlightnot quite in the shape of a woman and the ghost said with grave offense to daughters three alas the king a fool shall be rhymes i inquired youre looming about all diaphanous in the middle of the day puking cryptic rhymes low craft and tawdry art ghosting about at noona parsons fart heralds darker doom thou babbling wisp ghost cried the raven and with that the ghost was gone theres always a bloody ghost two now gods stand up for bastards king lear act i scene edmund i found drool in the laundry resolving a wank spouting great gouts of gitseed across the laundry walls floors and ceiling giggling as young shanker mary wagged her tits at him over a steaming cauldron of the kings shirts put those away tart weve a show to do i was just giving im a laugh if you wanted to show charity you could have bonked him honest and thered be a lot less cleaning to do thatd be a sin besides id as soon straddle a gatemans halberd as try to get a weapon that girth up me drool pumped himself dry and sat down on the floor splaylegged huffing like a great dribbling bellows i tried to help the lout repack his tackle but getting him into a codpiece against his firm enthusiasm was like trying to pound a bucket over a bulls heada scenario i thought comical enough to perhaps work into the act tonight should things get slow nothing stopping you from givin the lad a proper cleavage toss mary you had em out and all soaped up a couple of jumps and a tickle and hed have carried water for you for a fortnight he already does and i dont even want that thing near me a natural he is theres devils in his jizm devils devils theres no devils in there lass chock full o nitwits to be sure but no devils a natural was either blessed or cursed never just an accident of nature as the name implied sometime during the week shanker mary had gone christian on us despite being a most egregious slut you never knew anymore who you were dealing with half the kingdom was christian the other half paid tribute to the old gods of nature who were always showing promise on the moonrise the christian god with his day of rest was strong with the peasants come sunday but by thursday when there was drinking and fucking to be done nature had her kit off legs aloft and a flagon of ale in each hand taking converts for the druids as fast as they could come they were a solid majority when the holiday was about dancing drinking shagging the virgins and sharing the harvest but on the human sacrifice or burndownthekingsforest days there was none but crickets cavorting round the stonehengethe singers having forsaken mother earth for father church pretty said drool trying to wrestle back control of his tool mary had commenced to stirring the laundry but had neglected to pull her dress up had the gits attention hostage she did right shes a bloody vision of loveliness lad but youve buffed yourself to a gleam already and weve work to do the castles awash in intrigue subterfuge and villainytheyll be wantingcomic relief between the flattery and the murders intrigue and villainy drool displayed a gapetoothed grin imagine soldiers dumping hogsheads of spittle through the crenellations atop the castle wallthus is drools grin as earnest in expression as it is damp in executiona slurry of good cheer he loves intrigue and villainy as they play to his most special ability will there be hiding there will most certainly be hiding said i as i shouldered an escaped testicle into his cod and listening listening of cavernous proportionswe shall hang on every word as god on popes prayers and fuckery will there be fuckery pocket heinous fuckery most foul lad heinous fuckery most foul aye thats the dogs bollocks the dogs bollocks excellent the bees knees the cats pjs literally the dogs balls which doesnt seem to be that great a thing yet there you are then said drool slapping his thigh did you hear mary heinous fuckery afoot aint that the dogs bollocks oh yeah the dogs bloody b it is love if the saints are smilin on us maybe one of them nobles will hang your wee mate there like they been threatening two fools wellhung wed have then wouldnt we said i elbowing my apprentice in the ribs aye two fools wellhung wed have wouldnt we said drool in my voice tone to note coming out his great maw as like hed caught an echo on his tongue and coughed it right back thats the oafs giftnot only can he mimic perfectly he can recall whole conversations hours long recite them back to you in the original speakers voices and not comprehend a single word hed first been gifted to lear by a spanish duke because of his torrential dribbling and the ability to break wind that could darken a room but when i discovered the naturals keener talent i took him as my apprentice to teach him the manly art of mirth drool laughed two fools wellhung stop that i said its unsettling unsettling indeed to hear your own voice sluicing pitchperfect out of that mountain of lout stripped of wit and washed of irony two years id had drool under my wing and i was still not inured to it he meant no harm it was simply his nature the anchoress at the abbey had taught me of nature making me recite aristotle it is the mark of an educated man and a tribute to his culture that he look for precision in a thing only as its nature allows i would not have drool reading cicero or crafting clever riddles but under my tutelage he had become more than fair at tumbling and juggling could belch a song and was at court at least as entertaining as a trained bear with slightly less proclivity for eating the guests with guidance he would make a proper fool pocket is sad said drool he patted my head which was wildly irritating not only because we were facetofaceme standing him sitting bumtofloorbut because it rang the bells of my coxcomb in a most melancholy manner im not sad said i im angry that youve been lost all morning i werent lost i were right here the whole time having three laughs with mary three youre lucky you two didnt burst into flames you from friction and her from bloody thunderbolts of jesus maybe four said drool you do look the lost one pocket said mary face like a mourning orphan whats been dumped in the gutter with the chamber pots im preoccupied the king has kept no company but kent this last week the castle is brimming with backstabbers and theres a girlghost rhyming ominous on the battlements well theres always a bloody ghost aint there mary fished a shirt out of the cauldron and bobbed it across the room on her paddle like she was out for a stroll with her own sodden steaming ghost youve got no cares but making everyone laugh right aye carefree as a breeze leave that water when youre done would you mary drool needs a dunking nooooooo hush you cant go before the court like that you smell of shit did you sleep on the dung heap again last night it were warm i clouted him a good one on the crown with jones warms not all lad if you want warm you can sleep in the great hall with everyone else he aint allowed offered mary chamberlain chamberlaina servant usually in charge of running a castle or household says his snoring frightens the dogs not allowed every commoner who didnt have quarters slept on the floor in the great hallstrewn about willynilly on the straw and rushesnearly dogpiled before the fireplace in winter an enterprising fellow with night horns aloft and a predisposal to creep might find himself accidentally sharing a blanket or a tumble with a sleepy and possibly willing wench and then be banished for a fortnight from the halls friendly warmth and indeed i owe my own modest apartment above the barbican barbicana gatehouse or extension of a castle wall beyond the gatehouse used for defense of the main gate often connected to a drawbridge to such nocturnal proclivity but put out for snoring unheard of when nights inky cape falls oer the great hall a gristmill it becomes the machines of mens breath grind their dreams with a frightful roar and even drools great gears fall undistinguished among the chorus for snoring not allowed in the hall balderdash and for having a wee on the stewards wife mary added it were dark explained drool aye and even in daylight she is easily mistaken for a privy but have i not tutored you in the control of your fluids lad aye and with great success said shanker mary rolling her eyes at the spunkfrosted wall ah mary well said lets make a pact if you do not make attempts at wit i will refrain from becoming a soapsmelling prickpull what say ye you said you liked the smell of soap aye well speaking of smell drool fetch some buckets of cold water from the well we need to cool this kettle down and get you bathed nooooooo jones will be very unhappy with you if you dont hurry said i brandishing jones in a disapproving and somewhat threatening manner a hard master is jones bitter no doubt from being raised as a puppet on a stick a halfhour later a miserable drool sat in the steaming cauldron fullyclothed his natural broth having turned the lyewhite water to a rich brown oafsauce shanker mary stirred about him with her paddle being careful not to stir him beyond suds to lust i was quizzing my student on the coming nights entertainments so because cornwall is on the sea we shall portray the duke how dear drool as a sheepshagger said the despondent giant no lad thats albany cornwall shall be the fishfucker aye sorry pocket not a worry not a worry youll still be sodden from your bath i suspect so well work that into the jest bit of sloshing and squishing will but add to the merriment and if we can thus imply that princess regan is herself a fishlike consort well i cant think of anyone who wont be amused cepting the princess said mary well yes but she is very literalminded and often has to be explained the thrust of the jest a time or two before lending her appreciation aye remedial thrustings the remedy for regans stubborn wit said the puppet jones aye remedial thrustings the remedy for regans stubborn wit said drool in joness voice youre dead men sighed shanker mary youre a dead man knave said a mans voice from behind me and there stood edmund bastard son of gloucester blocking the only exit sword in hand dressed all in black was the bastard a simple silver brooch secured his cape the hilts of his sword and dagger were silver dragon heads with emerald eyes his jet beard was trimmed to points i do admire the bastards sense of stylesimple elegant and evil he owns his darkness i myself am called the black fool not because i am a moor although i hold no grudge toward them moors are said to be talented wifestranglers and would take no offense at the moniker were that the case but my skin is as snowy as any sunstarved son of england no i am called so because of my wardrobe an argyle of black satin and velvet diamondsnot the rainbow motley of the runaday fool lear said after thy black wit shall be thy dress fool perhaps a new outfit will stop you tweaking deaths nose im short for the grave as it is boy no need to anger the worms before my arrival when even a king fears ironys twisted blade what fool is ever unarmed draw your weapon fool said edmund sadly sir i have none said i jones shook his head in unarmed woe we both were lying of course across the small of my back i wore three wickedlypointed throwing daggersfashioned for me by the armorer to be used in our entertainmentsand while i had never used them as weapons truly flung they had spitted apples off the head of drool nipped plums from his outstretched fingers and yea even speared grapes out of the air i had little doubt that one might find its way into edmunds eye and thus vent his bitter mind like a lanced boil if he needed to know he would know soon enough if not well why trouble him if not a fight then a murder it is said edmund he lunged his blade aimed for my heart i sidestepped and knocked his blade away with jones who lost a bell from his coxcomb for his trouble i hopped up onto the lip of the cauldron but sir why spend your wrath on a poor helpless fool edmund slashed i leapt he missed i landed on the far side of the cauldron drool moaned mary hid in the corner you shouted bastard at me from the battlements aye they announced you as bastard you sir are a bastard and a bastard most unjust to make me die with the foul taste of truth still on my tongue allow me a lie before you strike you have such kind eyes but you spoke badly of my mother as well he put himself between me and the door bloody bad planning building a laundry with only one exit i may have implied that she was a poxy whore but from what your father says that too is not breaking the bonds of verity what asked edmund what asked drool a perfect parrot of edmund what inquired mary its true you git your mother was a poxy whore beggin your pardon sir poxiness aint so bad said shanker mary shining a ray of optimism on these dark ages unfairly maligned the poxy are methinks a spot o the pox implies experience worldliness if you will the tart makes an excellent point edmund but for the slow descent into madness and death with your bits dropping off along the way the pox is a veritable blessing said i as i skipped just out of blades reach from the bastard who stalked me around the great cauldron take mary here in fact theres an idea take mary why spend your energy after a long journey murdering a speck of a fool when you can enjoy the pleasures of a lusty wench who is not only ready but willing and smells pleasantly of soap aye said drool expelling froth as he spoke shes a bloody vision of loveliness edmund let his sword point drop and looked at drool for the first time are you eating soap just a wee sliver bubbled drool they werent saving it edmund turned back to me why are you boiling this fellow couldnt be helped said i how dramatic the bastard the water was barely steaming what appeared to be boiling was drool venting vapors common fuckin courtesy aint it said mary speak straight both of you the bastard wheeled on one heel and before i knew what was happening he had the point of his blade at marys throat ive been nine years in the holy land killing saracens killing one or two more makes no difference to me wait i leapt back to the lip of the cauldron reaching to the small of my back with my free hand wait hes being punished by the king for attacking me punished for attacking a fool boil him alive the king said i jumped down to edmunds side of the cauldronmoved toward the doorway id needed a clear line of sight and should he move i didnt want the blade to hit mary everyone knows how fond the king is of his dark little fool said mary nodding enthusiastically bollocks shouted edmund as he pulled the sword back to slash mary screamed i flipped a dagger in the air caught it by the blade and was readying to send it to edmunds heart when something hit him in the back of the head with a thud and he went bum over eyebrows into the wall his blade clanging across the floor to my feet drool had stood up in the cauldron and was holding marys laundry paddlea bit of dark hair and bloody scalp clung to the bleached wood did you see that pocket smashing fall he did all of it a pantomime to drool edmund was not moving as far as i could see he was not breathing either gods bloody balls drool youve kilt the earls son well all be hung now but he were going to hurt mary mary sat on the floor by edmunds prostrate body and began stroking his hair on a spot where there was no blood i was going to shag him docile too he would have killed you without a thought ah blokes have their tempers dont they look at him hes a fair form of a fellow innit he and rich too she took something from his pocket whats this well done lass not so much as a comma between grief and robbery and much the better when hes still so fresh his fleas have not sailed to livelier ports the church wears well on you no im not robbing look its a letter give it here you can read the tarts eyes widened as if i had confessed the ability to turn lead into gold i was raised in a nunnery wench i am a walking library of learningbound in comely leather and suitable for strokingat your service should you fancy a bit of culture to go with your lack of breeding or vice versa of course then edmund gasped and stirred oh fuckstockings the bastards alive three our darker purpose king lear act i scene king lear well this is a downy lot of goose toss if ive ever read it said i i sat on the bastards back crosslegged reading the letter hed written to his father and my lord must understand how unjust it is that i the issue of true passion is shorn of respect and position while deference is given my half brother who is the product of a bed made of duty and drudgery its true said the bastard am i not as true of shape as sharp of mind a youre a whiny little wanker wankerone who wanks a tosser is what you are said i my brashness perhaps spurred by the weight of drool who was sitting on the bastards legs what did you think you would possibly gain by giving this letter to your father that he might relent and give me half my brothers title and inheritance because your mother was a better boff than edgars youre a bastard and an idiot you could not know little man it was tempting then to clout the knave across the head with jones or better slit his throat with his own sword but as much as the king might favor me he favors the order of his power more the murder of gloucesters son no matter how deserved would not go unpunished but i was fast on my way to fools funeral anyway if i let the bastard up before his anger cooled id sent shanker mary away in hope that any wrath that fell might pass her by i needed a threat to stay edmunds hand but i had none i am the least powerful of all about the court my only influence is raising others ire i do know what it is to be deprived by the accident of birth edmund we are not the same you are as common as field dirt i am not i could not know then edmund what it is to have my title cast as an insult if i call you bastard and you call me fool can we answer as men no riddles fool i cant feel my feet why would you want to feel your feet is that more of the debauchery of the ruling class i hear so much about so blessed are you with access to the fleshs pleasures that you have to devise ingenious perversions to get your withered inbred plumbing to come to attentionneed to feel your feet and whip the stable boy with a dead rabbit to scratch your scurvy libidinous itch is it what are you on about fool i cant feel my feet because theres a great oaf sitting on my legs oh quite right sorry drool lift off a bit but dont let him up i climbed from the bastards back and walked to the laundry doorway where he could see me what you want is property and title do you imagine that you will get it by begging the letters not begging you want your brothers fortune how much better would a letter from him convince your father of your worth he would never write such a letter and besides he does not play for favor it is his already then perhaps the problem is moving favor from edgar to you the right letter from him would do it a letter wherein he confesses his impatience with waiting for his inheritance and asks for your help in usurping your father youre mad fool edgar would never write such a letter i didnt say he would do you have anything written in his hand i do a letter of credit he was to grant to a wool merchant in barking upminster do you sweet bastard know what a scriptorium is aye its a place in the monastery where they copy documentsbibles and such and so my accident of birth is the remedy of yours for because i hadnt even one parent to lay claim to me i was brought up in a nunnery that had just such a scriptorium where yes they taught a boy to copy documents but for our darker purpose they taught him to copy it in exactly the hand that he found on the page and the one before that and the one before that letter to letter stroke for stroke the same hand as a man long gone to the grave so you are a skilled forger if you were raised in a nunnery how is it you are a fool and not a monk or a priest how is it that you the son of an earl must plead mercy from under the arse of an enormous nitwit were all fates bastards shall we compose a letter edmund im sure i would have become a monk but for the anchoress the closest to court i would have come would have been praying for the forgiveness of some nobles war crimes was i not reared for the monastic life from the moment mother basil found me squirming on the steps of the abbey at dog snogging snogging to snogkissing making out swapping spit sucking face on the ouze i never knew my parents but mother basil told me once that she thought my mother might have been a madwoman from the local village who had drowned in the river ouze shortly after i appeared on the doorstep if that were so the abbess told me then my mother had been touched by god like the natural and so i was given to the abbey as gods special child the nuns most of whom were of noble birth second and third daughters who could not find a noble husband doted on me like a new puppy so tiny was i that the abbess would carry me with her in her apron pocket and thus i was given the name of pocket little pocket of dog snogging abbey i was much the novelty the only male in that allfemale world and the nuns competed to see who might carry me in their apron pocket although i do not remember it later after i learned to walk they would stand me on the table at mealtime and have me parade up and down waving my winky at them a unique appendage in those feminine environs i was seven before i realized that you could eat breakfast with your pants on still i always felt separate from the rest of them a different creature isolated i was allowed to sleep on the floor in the abbesss chambers as she had a woven rug given her by the bishop on cold nights i was permitted to sleep under her covers to keep her feet warm unless one of the other nuns had joined her for that purpose mother basil and i were constant companions even after i grew out of her marsupial affection i attended the masses and prayers with her every day from as long as i could remember how i loved watching her shave every morning after sunup stropping her razor on a leather strap and carefully scraping the blueblack whiskers from her face she would show me how to shave the little spot under your nose and how she pulled aside the skin on her neck so as not to nick her adams apple but she was a stern mistress and i had to pray every three hours like all the other nuns as well as carry water for her bath chop wood scrub floors work in the garden as well as take lessons in maths catechism latin and greek and calligraphy by the time i was nine i could read and write three languages and recite the lives of the saints from memory i lived to serve god and the nuns of dog snogging hoping that one day i might be ordained as a priest myself and i might have but then one day workmen came to the abbey stonecutters and masons and in a matter of days they had built a cell off of one of the abandoned passages in the rectory we were going to have our very own anchorite or in our case anchoress an acolyte so devoted to god that she would be walled up in a cell with only a small opening through which she would be passed food and water and there she would spend the rest of her life literally part of the church praying and dispensing wisdom to the people of the village through her window until she was taken into the bosom of the lord next to being martyred it was the most holy act of devotion a person could perform daily i crept out of mother basils quarters to check on the progress of the cell hoping to somehow bask in the glory that would be bestowed upon the anchoress but as the walls rose i saw there was no window left to the outside no place for the villagers to receive blessings as was the custom our anchoress will be very special mother basil explained in her steady baritone voice so devout is she that she will only lay eyes on those who bring her food she will not be distracted from her prayers for the kings salvation she is the charge of the king no other said mother basil the rest of us were bound by payment to pray for the forgiveness of the earl of sussex who had slaughtered thousands of innocents in the last war with the belgians and was bound to toast on the coals of hell unless we could fulfill his penance which had been pronounced by the pope himself to be seven million hail marys per peasant even with a dispensation and a halfprice coupon purchased at lourdes the earl was getting no more than a thousand hail marys to the penny so dog snogging was becoming a very rich monastery on his sins but our anchoress would answer for the sins of the king himself he was said to have perpetrated some jollygood wickedness so her prayers must be very potent indeed please mother please let me take food to the anchoress no one is to see or speak to her but someone has to take her food let me do it i promise not to look i shall consult the lord i never saw the anchoress arrive the rumor simply passed that she was in the abbey and the workmen had set the stones around her weeks went by with me begging the abbess to allow me the holy duty of feeding the anchoress but it was not until one evening when mother basil needed to spend the night alone with young sister mandy praying in private for the forgiveness of what the abbess called a smashing horny weekender that i was allowed to attend to the anchoress in fact said the reverend mother you stay there outside her cell until morning and see if you can learn some piety dont come back until morning late morning and bring tea and a couple of scones with you when you come back and some jam i thought i would burst i was so excited when i first made my way down that long dark hallwaycarrying a plate of cheese and bread and a flagon of ale i half expected to see the glory of god shining through the window but when i got there it wasnt a window at all but an arrow loop like in a castle wall cut in the shape of a cross the edges tapered so that the broad stone came to a point at the opening it was as if the masons only knew one window they could put in a thick wall funny that arrow loops and sword hilts mechanisms of death form the sign of the crossa symbol of mercybut on second thought i guess it was a mechanism of death in itself the opening was barely wide enough to pass the flagon through the plate would just fit through at the cross i waited no light came from inside the cell a single candle on the wall across from the opening was the only illumination i was terrified i listened to see if i could hear the anchoress reciting novenas there wasnt even the sound of breathing was she sleeping what kind of sin was it to interrupt the prayers of someone so holy i put the plate and ale on the floor and tried to peer into the darkness of the cell perhaps see her glow then i saw it the dim sparkle of the candle reflecting in an eye she was sitting there not two feet from the opening i jumped back against the far wall knocking over the ale on the way did i frighten you came a womans voice no no i was just i amforgive me i am awed by your piety then she laughed it was sad laughter as if it had been held a long time and then let out in almost a sob but she was laughing and i was confused im sorry mistress no no no dont be sorry dont you dare be sorry boy im not i wont be what is your name pocket mum pocket she repeated and she laughed some more youve spilled my ale pocket aye mum shall i fetch you some more if you dont want the glory of my bloody godliness burning us both down you better had hadnt you friend pocket and when you come back i want you to tell me a story that will make me laugh yes mum and that was the day that my world changed remind me why is it were not just murdering my brother asked edmund from whimpering scribblings to conspiracy to murder in the course of an hour edmund was a quick study when it came to villainy i sat quill in hand at the table in my small apartment above the great gatehouse in the outer wall of the castle i have my own fireplace a table two stools a bed a cupboard for my things a hook for my coxcomb and clothes and in the middle of my room a large cauldron for heating and pouring boiling oil upon a siege force through gutters in the floor but for the clanking of the massive chains when the drawbridge is raised or lowered it is a cozy den in which to pursue slumber or other horizontal sport best of all it is private with a thumping big bolt on the door even among the nobles privacy is rare as conspiracy thrives there while that is an attractive course unless edgar is disgraced disinherited and his properties willfully given to you the lands and title could pass to some legitimate cousin or worse your father might set about trying to sire a new legitimate heir i shuddered a bit thenalong with im sure a dozen maidens about the kingdomat the mental vision of gloucesters withered flanks bared and about the business of making an heir upon their nubile nobility they would be clawing at the nunnery door to escape the honor i hadnt thought of that said edmund really you not think how shocking although a simple poisoning does seem cleaner the letter is the sharper sword if i gave the scoundrel proper rope perhaps he could hang for both our purposes i can craft such a letter subtle yet condemning youll be the earl of gloucester before you can get dirt shoveled on your fathers still twitching body but the letter may not do all speak your mind fool as much as id love to silence your yammering speak the king favors your father and your brother which is why they were called here if edgar becomes betrothed to cordelia which could happen before the morrowwell with the princesss dowry in hand therell be no cause for him to resort to the treachery we are about to craft around him youll be left with your fangs showing noble edmund and the legitimate son will be all the richer ill see he is not betrothed to cordelia how will you tell him horrid things i have it on good authority that her feet are like ferryboats they strap them up under her gown to keep them from flapping when she walks i will see to it that there is no marriage little man dont you worry but you must see to this letter tomorrow edgar goes on to barking to deliver the letters of credit and ill return to gloucester with my father ill let the letter slip to him then so his anger has time to fester in edgars absence quick before i waste parchment promise youll not let edgar marry cordelia fine fool promise youll not tell anyone that you ever penned this letter and i will i promise said i by the balls of venus then so do i said the bastard all right then said i dipping my quill in ink although murder would be a simpler plan ive never cared for the bastards brother edgar either earnest and openfaced is he i dont trust anyone who appears so trustworthy they must be up to something of course edmund hanging blacktongued for his brothers murder would make for a festive chandelier as well a fool does enjoy a party in a halfhour i had crafted a letter so wily and peppered with treachery that any father might strangle his son at the sight of it and if childless bastinade his own bollocks with a war hammer to discourage conspirators yet to be born it was a masterpiece of both forgery and manipulation i blotted it well and held it up for edmund to see ill need your dagger sir said i edmund reached for the letter and i danced away from him first the knife good bastard edmund laughed take my dagger fool youre no safer i still have my sword aye which i handed you myself i need your dagger to razor the seal off that letter of credit so i may affix it to this missive of ours youll need to break it only in your fathers presence as if you yourself are only then discovering your brothers black nature oh said edmund he gave me the knife i performed the deed with sealing wax and candle and handed the blade back with the letter could i have used one of my own knives for the task of course but it was not time for edmund to know of them the letter was barely in his pocket before edmund had drawn his sword and had it leveled at my throat i think i can assure your silence better than a promise i didnt move so you lament being born out of favor what favor will you court by killing the kings fool a dozen guards saw you come in here ill take my chances just then the great chains that ran through my room began to shake rattling as if a hundred suffering prisoners were shackled to them rather than a slab of oak and iron edmund looked around and i scampered to the far side of the room wind rushed through the arrow loops that served as my windows and extinguished the candle i had used for the sealing wax the bastard spun to face the arrow loops and the room went dark as if a cape had been thrown over the day the golden form of a woman shimmered in the air at the dark wall the ghost said a thousand years of torture rule the knave who dares to harm a fool i could only see edmund by the glow of the spirit but he was moving crablike toward the door that led out onto the west wall reaching frantically for the latch then he threw the bolt and was through the door in an instant light filled my little apartment and i could again view the thames through the slits in the stone well rhymed wisp said i to the empty air well rhymed four the dragon and his wrath king lear act i scene king lear dont despair lad i said to taster its not as grim as it looks the bastard will stay edgar and im relatively sure that france and burgundy are buggering each other and would never let a princess come between themalthough ill wager theyd borrow her wardrobe were it not guardedso the day is saved cordelia will remain in the white tower to torment me as always we were in an antechamber off the great hall taster sat head in hands looking paler than normal a mountain of food piled before him on the table the king doesnt like dates does he asked taster not likely hell eat any of the dates that were brought as gifts right did goneril or regan gift them aye a whole larder they brought with them sorry lad youve work ahead then how it is youre not as fat as a friar with all youre required to eat is beyond me bubble says i must have a city of worms living up my bum but that aint it ive a secret if you wont tell anyone go on lad im hardly paying attention what about him he nodded to drool who was sitting in the corner petting one of the castle cats drool i called is tasters secret safe with you as dim as a snuffed candle he is said the git in my voice telling a secret to drool is like casting ink in the night sea see there said i well said taster looking around as if anyone would want to be in our miserable company im sick a lot of course you are its the bloody dark ages everyone has the plague or the pox its not like youre leprous and dropping fingers and toes like rose petals is it no not sick like that i just vomit nearly every time i eat so youre a little chundermonkey not to worry taster you keep it down long enough for it to kill you dont you i reckon he nibbled at a stuffed date duty done then alls well that ends well but back to my concerns do you think france and burgundy are poofters poofterhomosexual or are they you know just fucking french ive never even seen them taster said oh quite right what about you drool drool stop that drool pulled the damp kitten out of his mouth but it were licking me first you said it was only proper manners i was talking about something completely different put the cat down the heavy door creaked open and the earl of kent slipped into the room as stealthy as a church bell rolling down stairs kents a broadshouldered bull of a fellow and while he moves with great strength for his grandfather years grace and subtlety remain blushing virgins in his retinue there you are boy what boy said i i see no boy here true i only stand to kents shoulder and it would take two of me and a suckling pig to balance him on a scale but even a fool requires some respect except from the king of course fine fine i just wanted to tell you not to make sport of feebleness nor age tonight the kings been brooding all week about crawling unburdened to the grave i think its the weight of his sins well if he werent so dogfuckingly old there would be no temptation toward mirth would there not my fault that kent grinned then pocket you would not willfully hurt your master aye kent and with goneril and regan and their lords in the hall therell be no need to jest geriatric is that why the king has kept company only with you this week brooding upon his years he hasnt been planning on marrying off cordelia then hes spoken of it but only as part of his entire legacy of property and history he seemed set on a course to hold the kingdom steady when i last left him he bade me leave while he gave private audience to the bastard edmund hes talking to edmund alone aye the bastard drew on his fathers years of service for the favor i must go to the king kent stay here with drool if you would theres food and drink to hold you taster show good kent the best of those dates taster taster drool shake taster he appears to have fallen asleep fanfare sounded then a single anemic trumpet the other three trumpeters having recently succumbed to herpes a sore on the lip is as bad as an arrow in the eye to a trumpeter the chancellor had them put down or maybe theyd just been made drummers they werent blowing bloody fanfare thats all im saying drool put down his kitten and climbed to his feet with grave offense to daughters three alas the king a fool shall be said the giant in a lilting female voice where did you hear that drool who said that pretty said drool massaging the air with his great meaty paws as if caressing a womans breasts time to go said kent the old warrior threw open the door into the hall they stood all around the great tableround after the tradition of some long forgotten kingthe center open to the floor where servants served orators orated and drool and i performed kent took his place near the kings throne i stood with some yeomen to the side of the fire and motioned for drool to find a place to hide behind one of the stone pillars that supported the vault fools do not have a place at the table most times i served at the foot of the king providing quips criticisms and brilliant observations through the meal but only after he had called for me lear had not called for a week he came into the room head up scowling at each of his guests until his eye lit on cordelia and he smiled he motioned for everyone to sit and they did edmund said the king fetch the princes of france and burgundy edmund bowed to the king and backed toward the main entrance of the hall then looked to me winked and motioned for me to come join him dread rose in my chest like a black serpent what had the bastard done i should have cut his throat when id had the chance i sidled down the side wall the bells on the tips of my shoes conspicuously unhelpful in concealing my movement the king looked to me then away as if the sight of me might cause rot on his eye once through the door edmund pulled me roughly aside the big yeoman at the threshold lowered the blade of his halberd an inch and frowned at the bastard edmund released me and looked bewildered as if his own hand had betrayed him i bring food and drink to the guards when they are on post during feasts i believe it is written in the obfuscations of st pesto in nine cases out of ten a large friend with a poleax shall truly a blessing be what have you wrought bastard i whispered with great fury and no little spit only what you wanted fool your princess will have no husband that i can assure but even your sorceries wont keep you safe if you reveal my strategy my sorceries what oh the ghost yes the ghost and the bird when i was crossing the battlement a raven called me a tosser and shat on my shoulder right my minions are everywhere said i and youre right to fear my canny mastery of the heavenly orbs and command of spirits and whatnot but lest i unleash something unpleasant upon you tell me what did you say to the king edmund smiled then which i found more unsettling than his blade i heard the princesses speaking amongst themselves about their affections for their father earlier in the day and was enlightened to their character i merely hinted to the king that he might ease his burden with the same knowledge what knowledge go find out fool im off to fetch cordelias suitors and he was away the guard held the door and i slipped back into the hall and to a spot near the table the king it seemed had only then finished a roll call of sorts naming each of his friends and family at court proclaiming his affection for each and in the cases of kent and gloucester recalling their long history of battles and conquests together bent whitehaired and slight is the king but there is a cold fire in his eye stillhis visage puts one in mind of a hunting bird fresh unhooded and set for its kill i am old and my burdens of responsibility and property weigh heavily on me so to avoid conflict in the future i propose to divide my kingdom among younger strengths now so i may crawl to the grave light of heart what better than a lighthearted grave crawl i said softly to cornwall villainous twat that he is i crouched between him and his duchess regan princess regan tall fair ravenhaired with a weakness for plunging red velvet gowns and another for rascals both grievous faults had they not played out so pleasurably for this teller of tales oh pocket did you get the stuffed dates i sent you regan asked and generous to a fault as well shhhhhh bunny cunny i shushed father is speaking cornwall drew his dagger and i moved along the table to gonerils side lear went on these properties and powers i will divide between my sonsinlaw the duke of albany and the duke of cornwall and that suitor who takes the hand of my beloved cordelia but so i may determine who shall have the most bounteous share i ask of my daughters which of you loves me most goneril my eldest born speak first no pressure pumpkin i whispered i have this fool she snapped and with a great smile and no little grace she made her way around the outside of the round table and to the opening at the center bowing to each of the guests as she went she is shorter and rather more round than her sisters more generously padded in bosom and bustle her eyes a grey sky short of emerald her hair a yellow sun short of ginger her smile falls on the eye like water on the tongue of a thirstmad sailor i slid into her chair a handsome creature is she i said to the duke of albany that one breast the way it juts a bit to the sidewhen shes naked i meandoes that bother you at all make you wonder what its looking at over therebit like a walleyed man you think is always talkin to someone else hush fool albany said he is nearly a score years older than goneril goatish and dull methinks but somewhat less of a scoundrel than the average noble i do not loathe him mind you its obviously part of the pair not some breasterrant off on a quest of its own i like a bit of asymmetry in a womanmakes me suspicious when natures too evenhandedfearful symmetry and all but its not like youre shaggin a hunchback or anythingi mean once shes on er back its hard to get either one of them to look you in the eye innit shut up barked goneril having turned her back on her fatherwhich one is never supposed to doin order to scold me bloody clumsy etiquette that sorry go on said i waving her on with jones who jingled gaily sir she addressed the king i love you more than words can say i love you more than eyesight space and liberty i love you beyond anything that can be valued rich or rare no less than life itself with grace health beauty and honor as much as any child or father has loved so i love thee a love that takes my breath away and makes me scarcely able to speak i love you above all things even pie oh bollocks who had said it i was relatively sure it was not my voice as it hadnt come from the normal hole in my face and jones had been silent as well cordelia i scooted out of gonerils chair and scampered to the junior princesss side staying low to avoid attention or flying cutlery bloody buggering bollocks said cordelia lear refreshed from his shower of flowered bullshit said what i stood then well sirrah lovable as thou art the ladys profession strains credibility its no secret how much the bitch loves pie i crouched again quickly silence fool chamberlain bring me the map the distraction had worked the kings ire had turned from cordelia to me she took the opportunity to poke me in the earlobe with her fork ouch whispered yet emphatic tart knave harpy rodent whore whoremonger do you have to pay to be a whoremonger because strictly speaking shhh she said grinning she poked me in the ear again then nodded toward the king that we should pay attention the king pointed to the map with a bejeweled dagger all these lands from here to here with rich farmlands bounteous rivers and deep forests i do grant to goneril and her husband albany and to their offspring in perpetuity now we must hear from our second daughter dearest regan wife to cornwall speak regan made her way to the center floor looking down at her older sister goneril as she passed as if to say ill show you she raised her arms out to her sides trailing the long velvet sleeves down to the floor so she described the shape of a grand and bosomy crucifix she looked to the ceiling as if drawing inspiration from the heavenly orbs themselves then pronounced what she said huh said the king and verily huh was echoed around the room regan seemed to realize that she should probably go on my sister has expressed my thoughts exactlyas if she may have looked at my notes even before we here entered except i love thee more in the list of all senses all fall short and i am touched by nothing but your love she bowed then looking up a bit to see if anyone was buying it im going to be sick said cordelia probably louder than was really necessary as were the coughing and gagging noises she perpetrated thereafter deflecting i stood and said shes been touched by a bit more than his majestys love i dare say i mean in this very room i can name the king shot me his best must i chop off your head look and i fell silent he nodded and looked to the map to regan and cornwall i leave this third of the kingdom no smaller or less valuable than that bestowed upon goneril now cordelia our joy who is courted by so many eligible young nobles what can you say to receive a third more opulent than your sisters cordelia stood at her chair not making her way to the middle of the room as her sisters had nothing she said nothing asked the king nothing youll get nothing for nothing said lear speak again well you cant blame her really can you i interjected i mean youve given all the good bits to goneril and regan havent you whats left a bit of scotland rocky enough to starve a sheep and this poxy river near newcastle id taken the liberty of going over to the map id say nothing is a fair start for bargaining you should counter with spain majesty now cordelia moved to the center of the room im sorry father that i cant heave my heart into my mouth like my sisters i love you according to my bond as a daughter no more no less be careful what you say cordelia said lear your dowry is draining away with every word my lord you have sired me raised me and loved me i return those duties back as is proper i obey you love you and most honor you but how can my sisters say they love you above all they have husbands dont they have to reserve some love for them yes but have you met their husbands said i there was growling from various points around the table how can you call yourself a noble if youll just start growling for no reason uncivilized it is when i shall marry you can rest assured that my husband will get at least half my care and half my love as well to say anything else id be lying to you this was edmunds doing i was sure of it somehow hed known that cordelia would answer this way and had convinced the king to ask the question and she did not know that her father had been wrestling with his own mortality and worth for the week i hopped over to the princess and whispered lying now would be the better part of valor repent later throw the old gent a bone lass so this is how you feel asked the king aye my lord it is so young and so untender said lear so young my lord and true said cordelia so young and so bloody stupid said the puppet jones fine child so be it let your truth be your dowry then for by the radiance of the sun the dark of the night all the saints the holy mother the orbs of the sky and nature herself i disown you in his spirituality lear iswellflexible when pressed for a curse or a blessing he will sometimes invoke gods from a halfdozen pantheons just to be sure to catch the ear of whichever might be on watch that day no property land or title shall be yours cannibals of darkest merica who would sell their own young in the meat market shall be closer to me than you my usedtobe daughter i wondered about that no one had ever seen a merican being as they are mythical legend goes that in the name of profit they did sell the limbs of their own children as foodthat was before they burned the world of course since i didnt expect a state visit from the merchant cannibals of the apocalypse anytime soon it appeared my liege was either herniating the metaphor or speaking the tongue of a frothing nutter kent stood then my liege sit down kent the king barked come not between the dragon and his wrath i loved her the best and hoped that she would take care of me in my dotage but since she doesnt love me enough only in the grave will there be peace for lear cordelia looked more confused than hurt but father out of my sight where is france where is burgundy finish this business goneril regan your younger sisters share of the kingdom shall be divided between you let cordelia marry her own pride cornwall and albany shall divide the power and property of a king evenly i shall retain only my title and enough of a stipend to maintain one hundred knights and their carriers you shall keep me from month to month in your own castles but the kingdom shall be yours royal lear this is madness kent again now making his way around the table to the center floor careful kent said lear the bow of my anger is bent dont make me loose the arrow loose it if you must youd kill me for being bold enough to tell you that youre mad the best of loyalty is that a loyal man has the courage to speak plainly when his leader moves to folly reverse your decision sir your youngest daughter doesnt love you least because shes quiet any more than those who speak loudest are the most sincere the older sisters and their husbands were on their feet at that kent glared at them no more kent the king warned on your life not another word what has my life ever been but a thing i risked in service for you protecting you threaten my life as you will it will not stop me from telling you that you do wrong sir lear started to draw his sword then and i knew he had truly lost all sense of judgment if turning on his favorite daughter and closest advisor and friend hadnt shown it already if kent decided to defend himself hed go through the old man like a scythe through a wheat straw it was unfolding too fast even for a fool to stay the kings blade with wit i could only watch but albany moved quickly down the table and stayed the kings hand pushing his sword back down into the scabbard kent grinned then the old bear and i saw that he wouldnt have drawn blade on the old man at all he would have died to make his point to the king whats more lear knew it too but there was no mercy in his eye and the madness had gone cold he shook himself free of albanys grasp and the duke backed away when lear spoke again his voice was low restrained but palsied with hate hear me thou traitorous ferret no one challenges my authority my decisions or my vowsto do so on british land is death and in the rest of the known world is war ill not have it your years of service noted i give you your life but only your life and never again in my sight you have five days kent to provision yourself and on the sixth day turn your back on our kingdom forever if twelve days pass and you are still in the land your life is forfeit now go this is my decree and it shall not be revoked kent was shaken this was not the blade he had braced for he bowed then fare thee well king i go for i dare to question a power so high that you give it away for a flattering tongue he turned to cordelia then take heart girl youve spoken truly and done nothing wrong may the gods protect you he turned on a heel putting his back to the king something id never seen him do before and marched out pausing only a second to look at regan and goneril well lied you spiteful bitches i wanted to cheer the old brute write a poem for him but the hall had fallen silent and the sound of the great oaken door closing behind kent echoed through the hall like the first thunder of a worldbreaking storm well said i dancing to the middle of the floor i think that went about as well as could be expected five pity the fool kent banished cordelia disinherited the king having given away his property and power but most important my home the white tower the two older sisters insulted by kent the dukes ready to cut my throat wellgetting a laugh might be a challenge royal succession it seemed would not be a prudent subject to broach and i was lost for a transition to slapstick or pantomime after lears high drama so drool was but a millstone on comedys neck i juggled apples and sang a little song about monkeys while i pondered the problem the king was of late leaning decidedly pagan while the elder sisters favored the church gloucester and edgar were devout to the roman pantheon and cordelia well she thought the whole lot was shit and england should have her own church with women in the clergy quaint so the highminded comedy of religious satire it would be i tossed my apples around the table and said two popes are shagging a camel behind a mosque when this saracen comes up there is only one true pope shouted cornwall great tower of malignant smegma that he is its a jest you wanker said i suspend fucking disbelief for a bit would you he was right in a way although not for the purpose of the camel bit for the last year there had only been one pope in the holy city of amsterdam but for the prior fifty years there had been two popes the retail pope and the discount pope after the thirteenth holy crusade when it was decided that to avoid future strife the birthplace of jesus would be moved to a different city every four years holy shrines lost their geographical importance there arose a great price war in the church with shrines offering pilgrims dispensation at varying competitive rates now there didnt need to be a miracle declared on the spot anywhere could basically be declared a holy site and often was lourdes would still sell dispensation coupons with the healing watersbut also some bloke in puddinghoe could plant some pansies and hawk jesus had a wee right on this very spot when he was a ladtwo pennies and a spliff of cardiff chronic ill get you out o purgatory for an eon mate soon a whole guild of lowpriced shrine keepers around europe named their own popeboldface the relatively shameless discount pope of prague the price war was on if the dutch pope would give you a hundred years out of purgatory for a shilling and a ferrymans ticket the discount pope would let you out for two hundred years and send you home with the femur of a minor saint and a splinter of the true cross the retail pope would offer cheesy bacon toppings on the host with communion and the discount pope would counter with toplessnun night for midnight mass it came to a head though when st matthew appeared in a vision to the retail pope telling him that the faithful were more interested in the quality of their religious experience not just the quantity thus inspired the retail pope moved christmas to june when the weather wasnt so shit for shopping and the discount pope not realizing the game had changed responded by forgiving hell altogether for anyone who gave a priest a hand job without hell there was no fear and without fear there was no further need for the church to supply redemption and more important no means for the church to modify behavior the discount faithful defected in droves either to the retail branch of the church or to a dozen different pagan sects why not get pissed and dance naked around a pole all sabbath if the worst of it was a rash on the naughty bits and the dropping of the odd bastard now and then pope boldface was burned in a wicker man the next beltane and cats shat in his ashes so yes a twopope joke was untimely but fuck all it was dire times and i sallied forth for a bit so the second pope says your sister i thought she was kosher and no one laughed cordelia rolled her eyes and made a raspberry sound the pathetic onetrumpet fanfare dribbled the great doors were thrown open and france and burgundy ponced poncedverb form of ponce a gay man meaning to walk in a gay manner could possibly be a real word into the hall followed by the bastard edmund silence fool commanded lear with great superfluity hail burgundy hail france hail edmund the bloody bastard said i lear ignored me and motioned for france and burgundy to come before him they were both fit taller than me but not tall a few years south of thirty burgundy had dark hair and the sharp features of a roman france sandy hair and softer features each wore sword and dagger that i doubted had been ever drawn but for ceremony fucking frogs lord burgundy said lear you have rivaled for the hand of our youngest daughter what dowry do you require for her no less than your highness has offered said the dark poofter alas that is no more good burgundy what we offered was offered when she was dear to us now she has roused our anger and betrayed our love and her dowry is nothing if you want her as she is there take her but there will be no dowry burgundy was stunned he backed away nearly stepping on frances feet im sorry then sir but i must tend to property and power in my choice of duchess she shall have neither said lear so be it said burgundy he nodded bowed and stepped back i am sorry cordelia no worry sir said the princess if burgundys heart is wed only to property and power then it could never be to me truly peace be with you i breathed half a sigh of relief we might be driven from our home but if cordelia was driven out with us ill take her said edgar you will not you blubbering beetlebrowed dogbuggering dolt i may have accidentally exclaimed you

happened beforenothing like it i was the alllicensed fool i of all people could speak truth to poweri am chief cheeky monkey to the king of bloody britain you dont know what youre getting into france have you seen her feet or perhaps that is your game put her to work in the vineyards crushing wine grapes majesty the poofter means to force servitude on her mark my words but no one heard the last of it the yeomen had dragged me from the room and held me in the hall outside i sought to brain one with jones but he caught the puppet stick and tucked him in his belt at the small of his back sorry pocket said curan the captain of the guard a grizzled bear in chain mail who held me by my right arm twas a direct order and you were fast cutting your throat with your own tongue not me said i he wouldnt hurt me id have said hed not banish his best friend or disown his favorite daughter before this night hanging a fools an easy leap lad aye said i youre right let me go then not until the kings business is done said the old yeoman the doors came open fanfare trickled anemic through the portal and out came the prince of france on his arm cordelia radiant and wearing a grim smile i could see her jaw clenched but she relaxed when she saw me and some of the fire of anger left her eyes so youre off with the frog prince said i france laughed at that bloody buggering french fuck that he is is there anything so irritating as a noble who actually behaves nobly yes i am leaving pocket but there is one thing you must always remember and never forget both at once shut up aye milady you must

be a virtue mine now and forever milady you may kiss my hand fool the yeoman released me and i bent to take her hand she pulled it away and turned her gown fanning out around her as she walked away sorry having you on i smiled into the floor you bitch ill miss you pocket she said over her shoulder and she hurried down the corridor take me with you take us both with you france you could use a brilliant fool and a great lumbering bag of flatulence like drool couldnt you the prince shook his head entirely too much pity in his eyes for my tastes you are lears fool with lear you shall stay thats not what your wife just said she will learn said the prince he turned on his heel and followed cordelia down the corridor i started after them but the captain yanked me back by the arm let her go lad next out of the hall came the sisters and their husbands before i could say anything the captain had clamped his hand over my mouth and was lifting me off my feet as i kicked cornwall made as to draw his dagger but regan pulled him away youve just won a kingdom my duke killing vermin is a servants task leave the bitter fool stew in his own bile she wanted me it was clear goneril would not look me in the eye but hurried past and her husband albany just shook his head as he walked by a hundred brilliant witticisms died suffocating on the captains heavy glove thus muted i pumped my codpiece at the duke and tried to force a fart but my bum trumpet could find no note as if the gods had sent down a dim and gaseous avatar to help me drool came next through the door walking rather more straight than was his habit then i saw that someone had looped a rope around his neck the noose fixed to a spear whose point was almost piercing drools throat edmund stepped into the corridor holding the other end of the spear two men at arms flanking him the captain havin a laugh with you then pocket said drool innocent of his peril the captain dropped me to my feet then but held my shoulder to keep me from going at edmund whose father and brother passed behind him you were right pocket said edmund poking drool a bit with the spear for emphasis killing you would be enough to cement my unfavorable position forever but a hostagetheres a mute i can use i so enjoyed your performance in there that i prevailed upon the king to provide me with a fool of my own and look at his gift hell be coming to gloucester with us to assure that you dont forget your promise you dont need the spear bastard hell go if i ask him are we going on holiday pocket asked drool blood beginning to trickle down his neck then i approached the giant no lad said i youre going to go with the bastard here do as he says i turned to the captain give me your knife the captain eyed edmund and the men at arms beside him who had hands on hilts i dont know pocket give me your bloody knife i whirled pulled the knife from the captains belt and before the men at arms could draw id cut the rope around drools neck and pushed edmunds spear aside you dont need the spear bastard i handed the captain his knife and motioned for drool to bend down so we were eyetoeye i want you to go with edmund and dont give him any trouble you understand aye you aint comin ill be along ill be along ive business at the white tower first shagging to be done drool nodded so enthusiastically you could nearly hear his tiny brain rattling around his gourd ill be helping right no lad but youll have your own castle youll be the proper fool wont you therell be all kinds of hiding and listening drool do you understand what im saying lad i winked hoping against hope that the git would get my meaning will there be heinous fuckery pocket aye i think you can count on it smashing drool clapped his hands and danced a little jig then chanting heinous fuckery most foul heinous fuckery most foul i looked to edmund youve my word bastard but youve also my word that if any harm comes to the natural ill see to it that ghosts ride you into your grave a flash of fear showed in edmunds eye then but he fought it down and affected his usual swaggering smirk his life is on your word little man the bastard turned and strutted down the corridor drool looked back a big tear welling in his eye as he realized what was happening i waved him on id have taken the other two if youd dirked him said curan the other guard nodded in agreement evil bastard was asking for it well now you fucking tell me said i another guard hurried out of the hall then and seeing it was only the fool with his captain reported captain the kings food taster hes dead sir three friends had i six friendship and the odd bonk life is loneliness broken only by the gods taunting us with friendship and the odd bonk i admit it i grieved perhaps i am a fool to have expected cordelia to stay well yes i am a fooldont be overly clever eh its annoying but for most of my manly years she had been the lash on my back the bait to my loins and the balm of my imaginationmy torment my tonic my fever my curse i ache for her there is no comfort in the castle drool gone taster gone lear gone mad at best drool was little more company than jones and decidedly less portable but i worry for him great child that he is stumbling about in the circle of so many villains and so much sharp metal i miss his gapetoothed smile filled as it was with forgiveness acceptance and often cheddar and taster what did i know of him really just a wan lad from hog nostril on thames yet when i needed a sympathetic ear he provided even if he was oft distracted from my woes by his own selfish dietary concerns i lay on my bed in the portislodge staring out the cruciform arrow loops at the grey bones of london stewing in my misery yearning for my friends for my first friend for thalia the anchoress on a chill autumn day at dog snogging the third time i was allowed to bring food to the anchoress we became fast friends i was still in awe of her and merely being in her presence made me feel base unworthy and profane but in a good way i passed the plate of rough brown bread and cheese through the cross in the wall with prayers and a plea for her forgiveness this fare will do pocket it will do ill forgive you for a song you must be a most pious lady and have great love for the lord the lord is a tosser i thought the lord was a shepherd well that too but a bloke needs hobbies do you know greensleeves i know dona nobis pacem do you know any pirate songs i could sing dona nobis pacem like a pirate it means give us peace in latin doesnt it aye mistress bit of a stretch then innit a pirate singing give us bloody peace i suppose i could sing you a psalm then mistress all right then pocket a psalm it isone with pirates and loads of bloodshed if you have it i was nervous desperate for approval from the anchoress and afraid that if i displeased her i might be struck down by an avenging angel as seemed to happen often in scripture try as i might i could not recall any piraty psalms i cleared my throat and sang the only psalm i knew in english the lord is my tosser i shall not want wait wait wait said the anchoress doesnt it go the lord is my shepherd well yes mistress but you said and she started to laugh it was the first time i heard her truly laugh and it felt as if i was getting approval from the virgin herself in the dark chamber just the single candle on my side of the cross it seemed like her laughter was all around me embracing me oh pocket you are a love thick as a bloody brick but such a love i could feel the blood rise in my face i was proud and embarrassed and ecstatic all at once i didnt know what to do so i fell to my knees and prostrated myself before the arrow loop pushing my cheek against the stone floor im sorry mistress she laughed some more arise sir pocket of dog snogging i climbed to my feet and stared into the dark crossshaped hole in the wall and there i saw that dull star that was her eye reflecting the candle flame and i realized that there were tears in my own eyes why did you call me that because you make me laugh and you are deserving and valiant i think were going to be very good friends i started to ask her what she meant but the iron latch clanked and the door into the passageway swung slowly open mother basil was there holding a candelabra looking displeased pocket whats going on here said the mother superior in her gruff baritone nothing reverend mother ive just given food to the anchoress mother basil seemed reluctant to enter the passageway as if she was afraid to be in view of the arrow loop that looked into the anchoresss chamber come along pocket its time for evening prayers i bowed quickly to the anchoress and hurried out the door under mother basils arm as the sister closed the door the anchoress called reverend mother a moment please mother basils eyes went wide and she looked as if shed been called out by the devil go on to vespers pocket ill be along she made her way into the deadend passageway and closed the door behind her even as the bell calling us to vespers began to toll i wondered what the anchoress would discuss with mother basil perhaps some conclusion she had realized during her hours of prayer perhaps i had been found wanting and she would ask that i not be sent to her again after just making my first friend i was sorely afraid of losing her while i repeated the prayers in latin after the priest in my heart i prayed to god to not take my anchoress away and when mass ended i stayed in the chapel and prayed until well after the midnight prayers mother basil found me in the chapel there are going to be some changes pocket i felt my spirit drop into my shoe soles forgive me reverend mother for i know not what i do what are you on about pocket im not scolding you im adding duties to your devotion oh said i from now on you are to take food and drink to the anchoress in the hour before vespers and there in the outer chamber shall you sit until she has eaten but upon the bell for vespers you are to leave there and not return until the next day no longer than an hour shall you stay do you understand yes mum but why only the hour more than that and you will interfere with the anchoresss own communion with god further you are never to ask her about where she was before this about her family or her past in any way if she should speak of these things you are to immediately put your fingers in your ears and verily sing la la la la i cant hear you i cant hear you and leave the chamber immediately i cant do that mum why not i cant work the latch to the outer door with my fingers in my ears ah sweet pocket i do so love your wit i think you shall sleep on the stone floor this night the rug shields you from the blessed cooling of your fevered imagination which god finds an abomination yes a light beating and the bare stone for you and your wit tonight yes mum and so you must never speak with the anchoress about her past and if you should you shall be excommunicated and damned for all eternity with no hope for redemption the light of the lord shall never fall upon you and you shall live in darkness and pain for ever and ever and in addition i shall have sister bambi feed you to the cat yes mum said i i was so thrilled i nearly peed i would be blessed by the glory of the anchoress every single day well thats a scaly spot o snake wank said the anchoress no mum its a cracking big cat not the cat the hour a day only an hour a day mother basil doesnt want me to disturb your communion with god madame anchoress i bowed before the dark arrow loop call me thalia i darent mum and neither may i ask you about your past or from whence you come mother basil has forbidden it shes right on that but you may call me thalia as we are friends aye mum thalia and you may tell me of your past good pocket tell me of your life but dog snogging is all i knowall i have ever known i could hear her laughing in the dark then tell me a story from your lessons pocket so i told the anchoress of the stoning of st stephen of the persecution of st sebastian and the beheading of st valentine and she in turn told me stories of the saints i had never heard of in catechism and so said thalia that is the story of how st rufus of pipewrench was licked to death by marmots that sounds a most horrible martyring said i aye said the anchoress for marmot spit is the most noxious of all substances and that is why st rufus is the patron of saliva and halitosis unto this day enough martyring tell me of some miracles and so i did i told of the magic selffilling milk pail of st bridgid of kildare of how st fillan after his ox was killed by a wolf was able to compel the same wolf to pull a cart full of materials for building a church and how st patrick drove the snakes out of ireland aye said thalia and snakes have been grateful ever since but let me apprise you of the most wondrous miracle of how st cinnamon drove the mazdas out of swinden ive never heard of st cinnamon said i well that is because these nuns at dog snogging are base and not worthy to know such things and why you must never share what you learn here with them lest they become overwhelmed and succumb to an ague an ague of overpiety aye lad and you will be the one to have killed them oh i would never want to do that of course you wouldnt did you know in portugal they canonize a saint by actually shooting him out of a cannon and so it went day in day out week in week out trading secrets and lies with thalia you might think that it was cruel of her to spend her only time in contact with the outside world telling lies to a little boy but then the first story that mother basil had told me was about a talking snake who gave tainted fruit to naked people and the bishop had made her an abbess all along what thalia was teaching me was how to entertain her how to share a moment in story and laughterhow you could become close to someone even when separated from them by a stone wall once a month for the first two years the bishop came from york to check on the anchoress and she would seem to lose her spirit for a day as if he were skimming it off and taking it away but soon she would recover and our routine of chat and laughter would go on after a few years the bishop stopped coming and i was afraid to ask mother basil why lest it be a reminder and the dour prelate resume his spiritsucking sojourns the longer the anchoress was in her chamber the more she delighted in my conveying the most mundane details from the outside tell me of the weather today pocket tell me of the sky and dont skip a single cloud well the sky looked like someone was catapulting giant sheep into the frosty eye of god fucking winter crows against the sky aye thalia like a vandal with quill and ink set loose to randomly punctuate the very dome of day ah well spoken love completely incoherent imagery thank you mistress while about my chores and studies i tried to take note of every detail and construct metaphors in my head so i might paint word pictures for my anchoress who depended on me to be her light and color my days seemed to begin at four when i came to thalias chamber and end at five when the bell rang for vespers everything before was in preparation for that hour and everything after until sleep was in sweet remembrance the anchoress taught me how to singnot just the hymns and chants i had been singing from the time i was little but the romantic songs of the troubadours with simple patient instruction she taught me how to dance juggle and perform acrobatics and all by verbal descriptionnot once in those years had i laid eyes on the anchoress or seen more than her partial profile at the arrow loop i grew older and fuzz sprouted on my cheekmy voice broke making me sound as if a small goose was trapped in my gullet honking for her supper the nuns at dog snogging started to take notice of me as something other than their pet for many were sent to the abbey when they were no older than i they would flirt and ask me for a song a poem a story the more bawdy the better and the anchoress had taught me many of those where she had learned them she would never say were you an entertainer before you became a nun no pocket and i am not a nun but perhaps your father no my father was not a nun either i mean was he an entertainer sweet pocket you mustnt ask about my life before i came here what i am now i have always been and everything i am is here with you sweet thalia said i that is a fiery flagon of dragon toss isnt it though youre grinning arent you she held the candle close to the arrow loop illuminating her wry smile i laughed and reached through the cross to touch her cheek she sighed took my hand and pressed it hard against her lips then in an instant she had pushed my hand away and moved out of the light dont hide said i please dont hide fat lot of choice i have about whether i hide or not i live in a bloody tomb i didnt know what to say never before had she complained about her choice to become the anchoress of dog snogging even if other expressions of her faith seemedwellabstract i mean dont hide from me let me see you you want to see you want to see i nodded give me your candles she had me hand four lit candles through the arrow loop whenever i performed for her she had me set them in holders around the outer chamber so she could see me dance or juggle or do acrobatics but never had she asked for more than one candle in her own chamber she placed the candles around her chamber and for the first time i could see the stone pallet where she slept on a mattress of straw her meager possessions laid out on a heavy table and thalia standing there in a tattered linen frock look she said she pulled her frock over her head and dropped it on the floor she was the most beautiful thing i had ever seen she looked younger than i had imagined thin but womanlyher face was that of a mischievous madonna as if carved by a sculptor inspired more by desire than the divine her hair was long and the color of buckskin catching the candlelight as if a single ray of sunlight might make it explode in golden fire i felt a heat rise in my face and another kind of rise in my trousers i was excited and confused and ashamed all at once and i turned my back on the arrow loop and cried out no suddenly she was right behind me and i felt her hand on my shoulder then rubbing my neck pocket sweet pocket dont its all right i feel like the devil and the virgin are doing battle in my body i didnt know you were like that like a woman you mean her hand was warm and steady kneading the muscles in my shoulder through the cross in the wall and i leaned into it i wanted to turn and look i wanted to run out of the chamber i wanted to be asleep or just wakingashamed that the devil had visited me in the night with a damp dream of temptation you know me pocket im your friend but you are the anchoress im thalia your friend who loves you turn around pocket and i did give me your hand said she and i did she put it on her body and she put her hands on mine and pressed against the cold stone through the cross in the wall i discovered a new universeof thalias body of my body of love of passion of escapeand it was a damn sight better than bloody chants and juggling when the bell rang for vespers we fell away from the cross spent and gasping and we began to laugh oh and i had chipped a tooth one for the devil then love said thalia when i arrived with the anchoresss supper the next afternoon she was waiting with her face pressed nearly through the center of the arrow crossshe looked like one of the angelfaced gargoyles that flanked the main doors of dog snogging except they always seemed to be weeping and she was grinning so didnt go to confession today did you i shuddered no mum i worked in the scriptorium most of the day pocket i think i would prefer you not call me mum if its not too much to ask given the new level of our friendship it seemsoh i dont knowunsavory yes muhmistress mistress i can work with now pass me my supper and see if you can fit your face in the opening the way that i have thalias cheekbones were wedged in the arrow loop which was little wider than my hand doesnt that hurt id been finding abrasions on my arms and various bits all day from our adventure the night before its not the flaying of st bart but yes it stings a bit you cant confess what we did or what we do love you know that right then am i going to have to go to hell well she pulled back rolled her eyes as if searching the ceiling for an answer not alone give us our supper lad and get your face in the loop i have something to teach you and so it went for weeks and months i went from being a mediocre acrobat to a talented contortionist and thalia seemed to regain some of the life that i had thought sure shed lost she was not holy in the sense that the priests and nuns taught but she was full of spirit and a different kind of reverence more concerned with this life this moment than an eternity beyond the reach of the cross in the wall i adored her and i wanted her to be out of the chamber in the world with me and i began to plan her escape but i was but a boy and she was bloody barking so it was not meant to be ive stolen a chisel from a mason who passed by on his way to work on the minster at york it will take some time but if you work on a single stone you might escape in summer you are my escape pocket the only escape i can ever allow myself but we could run off be together that would be smashing except i cant leave so hop up and get your tackle in the cross thalias a special treat for you i never seemed to make my point once my tackle went in the cross distracted i was but i learned and while i was forbidden confessionand to tell the truth i didnt feel that badly about iti began to share what i had learned thalia i must confess to you i have told sister nikki about the little man in the boat really told her or showed her well showed her i reckon but she seems a bit thick she kept making me show her over and overasked me to meet her in the cloisters to show her again after vespers tonight ah the joy of being slow still its a sin to be selfish with ones knowledge thats what i thought said i relieved and speaking of the little man in the boat i believe there is one on this side of the loop who has been naughty and requires a thorough tonguelashing aye mistress said i wedging my cheeks into the arrow loop present the rascal for punishment and so it went i was the only person i knew who had calluses on his cheekbones but i had also developed the arms and grip of a blacksmith from suspending myself with my fingertips wedged between the great stones to extend my bits through the arrow loop and thus i hung spread spiderlike across the wall my business being tended to frantic and friendly by the anchoress when the bishop entered the antechamber the bishop entered the antechamber the bishop entered the antechamber at this point youre going coy on us euphemizing about parts and positions when youve already confessed to mutual violation with a holy woman through a bloody arrow slot well no the actual sodding bishop of bloody york entered the sodding antechamber with mother sodding basil who bore a brace of sodding storm lanterns and so i let go unfortunately thalia did not it appeared that her grip too had been strengthened by our encounters on the wall what the hell are you doing pocket said the anchoress what are you doing asked mother basil i hung there more or less suspended to the wall by three points one of them not covered by shoes ahhhhhhhhh said i i was finding it somewhat difficult to think give us a little slack lad said thalia this is meant to be more of a dance not a tugofwar the bishop is out here said i she laughed well tell him to get in the queue and ill tend to him when were finished no thalia hes really out here oh toss said she releasing my knob i fell to the floor and quickly rolled onto my stomach thalias face was at the arrow loop evening your grace a big grin there fancy a spot of stony bonking before vespers the bishop turned so quickly his miter went halfpast on his head hang him he said he snatched one of mother basils lanterns and walked out of the chamber bloody brown bread you serve tastes like goat scrotum thalia called after a lady deserves finer fare thalia please i said not a comment on you pocket your serving style is lovely but the bread is rubbish then to mother basil dont blame the boy reverend mother hes a love mother basil grabbed me by the ear and dragged me out of the chamber youre a love pocket said the anchoress mother basil locked me in a closet in her chambers then midway through the night opened the door and handed in a crust of bread and a chamber pot stay here until the bishop is on his way in the morning and if anyone asks youve been hung yes reverend mother said i she came to get me the next morning and hustled me out through the chapel id never seen her so distraught youve been like a son to me pocket she said fussing about me strapping a satchel and other bits of kit on me so its going to pain me to send you off but reverend mother hush lad well take you to the barn hang you in front of a few farmers then youre off to the south to meet up with a group of mummers mummerstraveling entertainers often associated with winter solstice celebrations but could be anything from acrobats to a theatrical troupe who will take you in beggin pardon mum but if im hung what will mummers do with me a puppet show ill not really hang you just make it look good we have to lad the bishop ordered it since when does the bishop order nuns to hang people since you shagged the anchoress pocket at the mention of her i broke away from mother basil ran through the abbey down the old corridor and into the antechamber the arrow cross was gone completely bricked up and mortared in thalia thalia i called i screamed and beat the stones until my fists bled but not a sound came from the other side of the wall ever the sisters pulled me away tied my hands and took me to the barn where i was hanged seven a brother traitor am i to be forever alone the anchoress told me it might be so trying to comfort me when i felt pushed aside by the sisters of dog snogging youre gifted with wit pocket but to cast jibe and jest you must stand separate from the target of your barbs i fear you may become a lonely man even in the company of others perhaps she was right perhaps it is why i am such an accomplished hornbeast and eloquent crafter of cuckoldry i seek only succor and solace beneath the skirts of the soft and understanding and so sleepless did i make my way to the great hall to find some comfort among the castle wenches who slept there the fire still blazed logs the size of oxen set in before bed my sweet squeak who had oft opened her heart and whatnot to a wayfaring fool had fallen asleep in the arms of her husband who spooned her mercilessly as he snored shanker mary was not to be seen no doubt servicing the bastard edmund somewhere and my other standard lovelies had fallen into slumber in proximity too close to husbands or fathers to admit a lonely fool ah but the new girl just in the kitchen a fortnight called tess or kate or possibly fiona her hair was jet and shone like oiled iron milky skin cheeks brushed by a roseshe smiled at my japes and had given drool an apple without his asking i am relatively sure that i adored her i tiptoed across the rushes that lined the floor i had left jones in my chamber his hat bells no help in securing stealthy romance lay down beside her and introduced my personage to the nether of her blanket an affectionate nudge at the hip woke her hello said she hello said i not a papist are you love christ no druid born and raised thank god what are you doing under my blanket warming up im terribly cold no youre not brrrr freezing its hot in here all right then im just being friendly would you stop prodding me with that sorry it does that when its lonely perhaps if you petted it then praised be the merciful goddess of the wood she petted it tentatively almost reverentially at first as if she sensed how much joy it could bring to all who came in contact with it an adaptable lass not given to fits of hysteria or modestyand soon a gentle surety in her grip that betrayed some experience in the handling of manly bitssimply lovely she was i thought it would have a little hat with bells ah yes well given a private place to change im sure that can be arranged under your skirt perhaps roll to the side love well be less obvious if we keep the cuddle on a lateral plane i popped her bosoms out of her frock then freed the rolypoly pinknosed puppies to the firelight and the friendly ministries of this master juggler and thought to burble my cheeks softly between them when the ghost appeared the spirit was more substantial now features describing what must have been a most comely creature before she was shuffled off to the undiscovered country no doubt by a close relative weary of her irritating nature she floated above the sleeping form of the cook bubble rising and falling on the draft of her snores sorry to haunt you while youre rogering the help said the ghost the rogering has not commenced wisp i have barely bridled the horse for a moist and bawdy ride now go away right then sorry to have interrupted your attempted rogering are you calling me a horse asked possibly fiona not at all love you pet the little jester and ill attend to the haunting theres always a bloody ghost about aint there commented possibly a squeeze on my knob for emphasis when you live in a keep where blood runs blue and murder is the favored sport yes said the ghost oh do fuck off said i thou visible stench thou steaming aggravation thou vaporous nag im wretched sad and lonely and trying to raise a modicum of comfort and forgetting here in the arms of uh kate said possibly fiona really she nodded not fiona kate since the day me da tied me belly cord to a tree well bugger sorry pocket here called the black fool charmed im sure shall i kiss your hand doublejointed then are ye said kate a tickle to my tackle making her point bloody hell would you two shut up said the ghost im haunting over here go on said we the ghost boosted her bosom and cleared her throat expectorating a tiny ghost frog that evaporated in the firelight with a hiss then said when a second siblings base derision proffers lies that cloud the vision and severs ties that families bind shall a madman rise to lead the blind what said the former fiona what said i prophecy of doom innit said the ghost spot o the old riddly foreshadowing from beyond dont you know cant kill her again can we asked faux fiona gentle spook said i if it is a warning you bring state it true if action you require ask outright if music you must make play on but by the winestained balls of bacchus speak your bloody business quick and clear then be gone before times iron tongue licks away my mercy bonk with second thoughts you are the haunted one fool its your business i do what do you want i want you to go away i want fiona to come along quietly and i want cordelia drool and taster backnow can you tell me how to make those things come about can you you yammering flurry of fumes it can be done said the ghost your answer lies with the witches of great birnam wood or you could just fucking tell me said i nooooo sang the ghost all ghosty and ethereal and with that she faded away leaves a chill when she goes dont she said formerly fiona appears to have softened your resolve if you dont mind my sayin the ghost saved my life last evening said i trying to will life back into the wan and withered kilt the little one though didnt she back to your bed fool the kings leaving on the morrow and theres a wicked lot of work to do in the morning to prepare for his trip sadly i tucked away my tackle and sulked back to the portislodge to pack my kit for my final journey from the white tower well i wont miss the bloody trumpets at dawn i can tell you that and sod the bloody drawbridge chains rattling in my apartment before the cock crows we might have been going to war for all the racket and goingson at first light through the arrow loop i could see cordelia riding out with france and burgundy standing in the stirrups like a man like she was off to the hunt rather than leaving her ancestral home forever to her credit she did not look back and i did not wave to her even after she crossed the river and rode out of sight drool was not so fickle and as he was led out of the castle by a rope round his neck he kept stopping and looking back until the man at arms to whom he was tethered would yank him back into step i could not bear to let him see me so i did not go out onto the wall instead i slunk back to my pallet and lay there my forehead pressed to the cold stone wall listening as the rest of the royals and their retinues clomped across the drawbridge below sod lear sod the royals sod the bloody white tower all i loved was gone or soon to be left behind and all that i owned was packed in a knapsack and hung on my hook jones sticking out the top mocking me with his puppety grin then a knock at my door like dragging myself from the grave was making my way to open it there she stood fresh and lovely holding a basket fiona kate said fiona aye your stubbornness suits you even in daylight bubble sends her sympathies over taster and drool and sends you these sweet cakes and milk for your comfort but says to be sure and remind you to not leave the castle without saying your farewells and further that you are a cur a rascal and a scurvy patch ah sweet bubble when kindness shagged an ogre thus was she sired and im here to offer comfort myself finishing what was started in the great hall last night squeak says to ask you about a small chap in a canoe my my fi bit of a tart arent we druish love my people burn a virgin every autumnone cant be too careful well all right but im forlorn and i shant enjoy it in that we shall suffer together onward off with your kit fool what is it about me that brings out the tyrant in women i wonder the next morning stretched into a week of preparation for departure from the white tower when lear pronounced that he would be accompanied by one hundred knights it was not as if one hundred men could mount up and ride out of the gates at sunrise each knightthe unlanded second or third son of a noblewould have at least one squire a page usually a man to tend his horses and sometimes a man at arms each had at least one warhorse a massive armored beast and two sometimes three animals to carry his armor weapons and supplies and albany was three weeks journey to the north near aberdeen with the slow pace set by the old king and so many on foot wed need a crashing assload of supplies by the end of the week our column numbered over five hundred men and boys and nearly as many horses we would have needed a wagon full of coin to pay everyone if lear had not conscripted albany and cornwall to maintain his knights i watched lear pass under the portislodge at the head of the column before going downstairs and climbing on my own mount a short swayback mare named rose mud shall not sully my black fools motley lest it dull his wit as well said lear the day he presented the horse i did not own the horse of course she belonged to the kingor now his daughters i suppose i fell in at the end of the column behind hunter who was accompanied by a long train of hounds and a wagon with a cage built on it which held eight of the royal falcons well be raiding farms before we get to leeds said hunter a stout leatherclad man thirty winters on his back i cant feed this lotand theyve not enough stowed to last them a week cry calamity if you will hunter but im the one to keep them in good spirits when their bellies are empty aye ive no envy for you fool is that why you ride back here with we catchfarts and not at the kings side just drawing plans for a bawdy song at supper without the clank of armor in my ear good hunter i wanted to tell hunter that i was not overburdened by my duties but by my disdain for the senile king who had sent my princess away and i wanted time to ponder the ghosts warnings the bit about daughters three and the king becoming a fool had come to pass or at least was in the way of it so the girl ghost had predicted the grave offense to daughters three even if all the daughters had not seen the offense yetwhen lear arrived at albany with this rowdy retinue offense would soon follow but what of this when a second siblings base derision proffers lies that cloud the vision did it mean the second daughter regan what did it matter if her lies clouded lears vision the king was nearly blind as it was his eyes milky with cataractid taken to describing my pantomimes as i performed them so the old man would not miss the joke and with no power what tie could be severed that would make a difference now a war between the two dukes none of it about me why do i care why then would the ghost appear to this most irrelevant and powerless fool i puzzled it and fell far behind the column and when i stopped to have a wee was accosted by a brigand he came up from behind a fallen tree a great bear of a fiend his beard matted and befouled with food and burrs a maelstrom of grey hair flying about under a widebrimmed black hat i may have screamed in surprise and a less educated ear might have likened my shriek to that of a little girl but be assured it was most manly and more for the fair warning of my attacker for next i knew i had pulled a dagger from the small of my back and sent it flying his miserable life was saved only by my slight miscalculation of his distancethe butt of my blade bounced off his behatted noggin with a thud ouch fucks sake fool what is wrong with you hold fast knave said i ive two more blades at the ready and these ill send pointy end firstthe quality of my mercy having been strained and my ire aroused by having peed somewhat upon my shoes i believed it a serviceable threat hold your blades pocket i mean you no harm came the voice under the hat brim then y ddraig goch ddyry gychwyn y ddraig goch ddyry gychwynwelsh the red dragon should go forward originally the welsh national motto later replaced by yes we have shepherds pie i wound up to send my second dagger to the scoundrels heart you may know my name but that gargling with catsick that youre doing will not stop me from dropping you where you stand ydych chin cymryd cerdynnau credid ydych chin cymryd cerdynnau credid welsh do you take credit cards said the highwayman no doubt trying to frighten me further his consonants chained like anal beads strung out of hells own bunghole i may be small but im not a child to be afraid of a pretended demon speaking in tongues im a lapsed christian and a pagan of convenience the worst i can do on my conscience is cut your throat and ask the forest to count it as a sacrifice come the yule so cease your nonsense and tell me how you know my name its not nonsense its welsh said the brigand he folded back the brim of his hat and winked what say you save your wicked sting for an enemy true its me kent in disguise indeed it was the kings old banished friendall of his royal trappings but his sword gonehe looked like hed slept in the woods the week since id last seen him kent what are you doing here youre as good as dead if the king sees you i thought youd be in france by now ive no place to gomy lands and title are forfeit what family i have would risk their own lives to take me in i have served lear these forty years i am loyal and i know nothing else my thought is to affect accents and hide my face until he has a change of heart is loyalty a virtue when paid to virtues stranger i think not lear has misused you you are mad or stupid or you lust for the grave but there is no place for you good greybeard in the company of the king and there is for you or did i not see you restrained and dragged from the hall for that same offense truth told boldly dont preach virtue to me fool one voice can without fear call the king on his folly and here he stands pissshoed two leagues back from the train fuckstockings truth is a surly shrew sometimes he was right of course loudmouthed old bull have you eaten not for three days i went to my horse and dug into my satchel for some hard cheese and an apple i had left from bubbles farewell gift i gave them to kent come not too soon said i lear still fumes about cordelias honest offense and your supposed treason follow behind to albanys castle ill have hunter leave a rabbit or a duck beside the road for you every day do you have flint and steel aye and tinder i found the stub of a candle in the bottom of my bag and handed it to the old knight burn this and catch the soot upon your sword then rub the black into your beard cut your hair short and blacken it too lear cant see clearly more than a few feet away so keep your distance and carry on with that ghastly welsh accent perhaps ill fool the old man but what of the others no righteous man thinks you a traitor kent but i dont know all of these knights nor which might reveal you to the king just stay out of sight and by the time we reach albanys castle ill have flushed out any knave who might betray your cause youre a good lad pocket if ive shown you disrespect in the past im sorry dont grovel kent it doesnt wear well on the aged a swift sword and a strong shield are allies i can well use with scoundrels and traitors weaving intrigue about like the venomous spiderwhore of killarney spiderwhore of killarney ive never heard of her aye well sit on that downed tree and eat your lunch ill spin the tale for you like it was web from her own bloody bum youll fall behind the column sod the column that tottering old tosspot so slows them theyll be leaving a snail trail soon sit and listen greybeard by the way have you ever heard of great birnam wood aye its not two miles from albany really how do you feel about witches eight a wind from fucking france hunter was right of course he wasnt able to feed lears train we imposed on villages along the way for fare and quarter but north of leeds the villages had suffered bad harvests and they could not bear our appetites without starving themselves i tried to foster good cheer among the knights while keeping distance from leari had not forgiven the old man for disowning my cordelia and sending away drool secretly i relished the soldiers complaints about their lack of comfort and made no real effort to dampen their rising resentment for the old king on the fifteenth day of our march outside of lintupontweed they ate my horse rose rose rosewould a horse by any other name taste so sweet the knights chanted they thought themselves clever slinging such jests while spraying roasted bits of my mount from their greasy lips the dull always seek to be clever at the fools expense to somehow repay him for his cutting wit but never are they clever and often are they cruel which is why i may never own things never care for anyone nor show desire for anything lest some ruffian thinking he is funny take it away i have secret desires wants and dreams though jones is a fine foil but i should like someday to own a monkey i would dress him in a tiny jesters suit of red silk i think i would call him jeff and he would have his own scepter that would be called tiny jeff yes i should very much like a monkey he would be my friendand it would be forbidden to murder banish or eat him foolish dreams we were met at the gate of castle albany by gonerils steward adviser and chief toady that most pernicious twat oswald id had dealings with the rodentfaced mucksucker when he was but a footman at the white tower when goneril was still princess at court and i a humble jongleur was found wandering naked amid her royal orbs but that tale is best left for another time the scoundrel at the gate impedes our progress spidery in appearance as well as disposition oswald lurks even when in the open lurking being his natural state of locomotion a fine black fuzz he wears for a beard the same is on his head when his blue tartan tam is humbled at his heart which it was not that day he neither removed his hat nor bowed as lear approached the old king was not pleased he stopped the train an arrowshot from the castle and waved me forward pocket go see what he wants said lear and ask why there is no fanfare for my arrival but nuncle nunclearchaic uncle said i shouldnt the captain of the guard be the one go on fool a point is to be made about respect i send a fool to meet this rascal and put him in his place spare no manners remind the dog that he is a dog aye majesty i rolled my eyes at captain curan who almost laughed then stopped himself seeing that the kings anger was real i pulled jones from my satchel and sallied forth my jaw set as determined as the prow of a warship hail castle albany i called hail albany hail goneril oswald said nothing did not so much as remove his hat he looked past me to the king even when i was standing an arms length from him i said king of bloody britain here oswald id suggest you pay proper respect ill not lower myself to speak with a fool primping little whoreson wanker innit he said the puppet jones aye said i then i spotted a guard in the barbican looking down on us hail capn seems someones emptied a privy on your drawbridge and the steaming pile blocks our way the guard laughed oswald fumed mlady has instructed me to instruct you that her fathers knights are not welcome in the castle that so shes actually talking to you then ill not have an exchange with an impudent fool hes not impudent said jones with proper inspiration the lad sports a woody as stout as a mooring pin ask your lady i nodded in agreement with the puppet for he is most wise for having a brain of sawdust impudent impudent not impotent oswald frothing a bit now oh well why didnt you say so said jones yes hes that to be sure said i aye said jones aye said i the kings rabble shall not be permitted in the castle aye that so oswald i reached up and patted his cheek you should have ordered trumpets and rose petals scattered on our path i turned and waved the advance to the train curan spurred his horse and the column galloped forward now get off the bridge or be trampled you ratfaced little twat i strode past oswald into the castle pumping jones in the air as if i was leading cadence for war drummers i think i should have been a diplomat as lear rode by he clouted oswald on the head with his sheathed sword knocking the unctuous steward into the moat i felt my anger for the old man slip a notch kent his disguise now completed by nearly three weeks of hunger and living in the outdoors fell in behind the train as i had instructed he looked lean and leathery now more like an older version of hunter than the old overfed knight he had been at the white tower i stood to the side of the gate as the column entered and nodded to him as he passed im hungry pocket all i had to eat yesterday was an owl perfect fare for witch finding methinks youre with me to great birnam wood tonight then after supper aye if goneril doesnt poison the lot of us ah goneril goneril gonerillike a distant love chant is her name not that it doesnt summon memories of burning urination and putrid discharge but what romance worth the memory is devoid of the bittersweet when i first met her goneril was but seventeen and although betrothed to albany from the age of twelve she had never seen him a curious roundbottomed girl she had spent her entire life in and around the white tower and shed developed a colossal appetite for knowledge of the outside world which somehow she thought she could sate by grilling a humble fool it started on odd afternoons when she would call me to her chambers and with her ladiesinwaiting in attendance ask me all manner of questions her tutors had refused to answer lady said i i am but a fool shouldnt you ask someone with position mother is dead and father treats us like porcelain dolls everyone else is afraid to speak you are my fool it is your duty to speak truth to power impeccable logic lady but truth be told im here as fool to the little princess i was new to the castle and did not want to be held accountable for telling goneril something that the king didnt wish her to know well cordelia is having her nap so until she wakes you are my fool i so decree it the ladies clapped at the royal decree again irrefutable logic said i to the thick but comely princess proceed pocket you have traveled the land tell me what is it like to be a peasant well milady ive never been a peasant strictly speaking but for the most part im told its wake early work hard suffer hunger catch the plague and die then get up the next morning and do it all again every day well if youre a christianon sunday you get up early go to church suffer hunger until you have a big meal of barley and swill then catch the plague and die hunger is that why they seem so wretched and unhappy that would be one of the reasons but theres much to be said for hard work disease runofthemill suffering and the odd witch burning or virgin sacrifice depending on your faith if they are hungry why dont they just eat something that is an excellent idea milady someone should suggest that oh i shall make a most excellent duchess i think the people will praise me for my wisdom most certainly milady said i your father married his sister then did he love heavens no mother was a belgian princess why do you ask heraldry is my hobby go on once we were inside the main curtain wall curtain wallthe outer wall of a castle compound usually surrounding all of the buildings of castle albany it was clear that we would go no farther the main keep of the castle stood behind yet another curtain wall and had its own drawbridge over a dry ditch rather than a moat the bridge was lowering even as the king approached goneril walked out on the drawbridge unaccompanied wearing a gown of green velvet laced a bit too tightly if the intent was to lessen the rise of her bosom it failed miserably and brought gasps and guffaws from several of the knights until curan raised his hand for silence father welcome to albany said goneril all hail good king and loving father she held out her arms and the anger drained from lears face he climbed down from his horse i scampered to the kings side and steadied him captain curan signaled and the rest of the train dismounted as i straightened lears cape about his shoulders i caught gonerils eye missed you pumpkin knave said she under her breath she was always the most fair of the three i said to lear and certainly the most wise my lord means to accidentally hang your fool father ah well if accident theres no fault but fate said i with a grinpert and nimble spirit of mirth that i am but call then for a spanking of fates fickle bottom and hit it good lady i winked and smacked the horses rump wits arrow hit and goneril blushed ill see you hit you wicked little dog enough of that said lear leave the boy alone come give your father a hug jones barked enthusiastically and chanted a fool must hit it a fool must hit it hit it good the puppet knows a ladys weakness father said she im afraid weve accommodation only for you in the castle your knights and others will have to make do in the outer bailey baileycourtyard inside a castle wall weve quarters and food for them by the stables but what about my fool your fool can sleep in the stable with the rest of the rabble so be it lear let his eldest lead him into the castle like a milk cow by the nose ring she truly loathes you doesnt she said kent he was busy wrapping himself around a pork shoulder the size of a toddlerhis welsh accent actually sounding more natural through the grease and gristle than when clear not to worry lad said curan who had joined us by our fire well not let albany hang you will we lads soldiers all around us cheered not sure what they were cheering for beyond the fact that they were enjoying the first full meal with ale that theyd had since leaving the white tower a small village was housed inside the bailey and some of the knights were already wandering off in search of an alehouse and a whore we were outside the castle but at least we were out of the wind and we could sleep in the stables which the pages and squires had mucked out on our arrival but if were not welcome in the great hall then they are not welcome to the talents of the kings fool said curan sing us a song pocket a cheer went up around the camp sing sing sing kent raised an eyebrow go ahead lad your witches will wait i am what i am i drained my flagon of ale set it by the fire then whistled loudly jumped up did three somersaults and laid out into a backflip wherefrom i landed with jones pointed at the moon and said a ballad then aye came the cheer and ever so sweetly i crooned the lilting love song shall i shag my lady upon the shire i followed that with a bit of a narrative song by way of a troubadour tradition the hanging of willie wagging william well everyone likes a story after supper and by the oneeyed balls of the cyclops that one got them clapping so i slowed it down a bit with the solemn ballad dragon spooge befouled my bonny bonny lass bloody inconsiderate to leave a train of fighting men fighting back tears so i danced my way around the camp while singing the shanty alehouse lilly shell bonk you silly i was about to say good night and head out when curan called for silence and a roadworn herald wearing a great golden fleurdelis on his chest entered the camp he unrolled his scroll and read hear ye hear ye let it be known that king philip the twentyseventh of france is dead god rest his soul long live france long live the king no one long lived the king back at him and he seemed disappointed although one knight did murmur so and another good bloody riddance well you british pig dogs prince jeff is now king said the herald we all looked at each other and shrugged and princess cordelia of britain is now queen of france the herald added rather huffy now oh said many realizing at last at least a glancing relevance jeff said i the bloody frog prince is called jeff i strode to the herald and snatched the scroll out of his hand he tried to take it back and i clouted him with jones calm lad said kent taking the scroll from me and handing it back to the herald merci said he to the messenger he took my bloody princess and my monkeys name said i taking another swing with jones which missed its mark as kent was dragging me away you should be pleased said kent your lady is the queen of france and dont think shes not going to rub my nose in that when i see her come lad lets go find your witches well want to be back by morning in time for albany to accidentally hang you oh shed like that wouldnt she nine toil and trouble so why is it that we are going to great birnam wood to look for witches asked kent as we made our way across the moor there was only a slight breeze but it was bloody cold what with the mist and the gloom and my despair over king jeff i pulled my woolen cape around me bloody scotland said i albany is possibly the darkest dampest coldest bloody crevice in all of blighty sodding scots witches reminded kent because the bloody ghost told me id find my answers here ghost the girl ghost at the white tower keep up kent rhymes and riddles and such i told him of the grave offense to daughters three and the madman rising to lead the blind kent nodded as if he understood and im along because because it is dark and i am small you might have asked curan or one of the others im reticent about witches nonsense theyre just like physicians only without the bleeding nothing to fear in the day when lear was still christian we did not do well by witches ive had a cartload of curses cast on me not very effective though were they youre childfrighteningly old and still strong as a bull i am banished penniless and live under the threat of death upon discovery of my name oh good point brave of you to come then aye thanks lad but im not feeling it whats that light there was a fire ahead in the wood and figures moving around it stealthy now good kent let us creep up silently and see what is to be seen before revealing ourselves now creep kent you crashing great ox creep and with but two steps my strategy revealed its flaw youre jingling like a coin purse possessed of fits said kent you couldnt creep up on the deaf nor dead silence your bloody bells pocket i placed my coxcomb on the ground i can leave my hat but ill not take off my shoeswell surrender all stealth if im screaming from trodding tenderfooted across lizards thorns hedgehogs and the lot here then said kent pulling the remains of the pork shoulder from his satchel dampen your bells with the fat i raised an eyebrow quizzicallyan unappreciated and overly subtle gesture in the darkthen shrugged and began working the suet into the bells at my toes and ankles there i shook a leg to the satisfying sound of nothing at all forward creep we did until we were just outside the halo of firelight three bentbacked hags were walking a slow circle around a large cauldron dropping in twisted bits of this and that as they chanted double double toil and trouble fire burn and cauldron bubble witches whispered kent paying tribute to the god of all things bloody fucking obvious aye said i in lieu of clouting him jones stayed behind to guard my hat eye of newt and toe of frog wool of bat and tongue of dog adders fork and blindworms sting lizards leg and owlets wing for a charm of powerful trouble like a hellbroth boil and bubble they doublebubbled the chorus and we were readying ourselves for another verse of the recipe when i felt something brush against my leg it was all i could do not to cry out i felt kents hand on my shoulder steady lad its just a cat another brush and a meow two of them now licking my bells and purring it sounds more pleasant than it was its the bloody pork fat i whispered a third feline joined the gang i stood on one foot trying to hold the other above their heads but while i am an accomplished acrobat the art of levitation still eludes me thus my groundbound foot became my achilles heel as it were one of the fiends sank its fangs into my ankle fuckstockings said i somewhat emphatically i hopped i whirled i made disparaging remarks toward all creatures of the feline aspect hissing and yowling ensued when at last the cats retreated i was sitting splayedlegged by the fire kent stood next to me with his sword drawn and ready and the three hags stood in ranks across the cauldron from us back witches said kent you may curse me into a toad but theyll be the last words out of your mouths while your heads are attached witches said the first witch who was greenest of the three what witches we are but humble washerwomen making our way in the wood rendering laundry service humble and good said witch two the tallest all it be is as it should said witch three who had a wicked wart over her right eye by hecates hecategreek goddess of witchcraft sorcery and ghosts nighttarred nipples stop rhyming said i if youre not witches what was that curse you were bubbling about stew said warty stew stew most true said tall stew most blue said green its not blue said kent looking in the cauldron more of a brown i know said green but brown doesnt rhyme does it love im looking for witches said i really said tall i was sent by a ghost the hags looked at one another then back at me ghost told you to bring your laundry here did it said warty youre not washerwomen youre bloody witches and thats not stew and the bloody ghost of the bloody white tower said to seek you here for answers so can we get about it ye gnarled knots of erect vomitus ah were toads for sure now sighed kent always a bloody ghost innit said tall what did she look like asked green who the ghost i didnt say it was a she what did she look like fool snarled warty i suppose i shall pass my days eating bugs and hiding under leaves until some crone drops me in a cauldron mused kent leaning on his sword now watching moths dart into the fire she was ghostly pale said i all in whitevaporous with fair hair and she was fit fitbritish slang attractive sexy though asked tall lovely you might even say bit more transparent than i care for in my wenches but aye she was fit aye said warty looking to the others who huddled with her when they came up green said state your business then fool why did the ghost send you here she said you could help me i am fool to the court of king lear of britain he has sent away his youngest daughter cordelia of whom i am somewhat fond hes given my apprentice fool drool to that blackguard bastard edmund of gloucester and my friend taster has been poisoned and is quite dead and dont forget that theyre going to hang you at dawn added kent dont concern yourselves with that ladies said i about to be hanged is my status quo not a condition that requires your repair the hags huddled again there was much whispering and a bit of hissing they broke their conference and warty who was the apparent coven leader said that lears a nasty piece of work last time he went christian a score of witches were drowned said tall kent nodded and looked at his shoes the petite inquisitionnot a high point aye we were a decade spelling them all back to life for the revenge said warty rosemary here still seeps pondwater from the ears on damp days said tall aye and carps ate my small toes while i was pondbottom said green her toes thus gefilted gefilte fisha poached ground fish patty usually made of carp we had to seek an enchanted lynx and take two of his for replacement rosemary who was green nodded gravely goes through shoes in a fortnight but theres no better witch to chase a squirrel up a tree said tall thats true said rosemary beats the burnings though said warty aye thats true said tall no amount of cat toesll fix you if youve all your bits burnt off lear had him some burnings as well im not here on behalf of lear said i im here to correct the madness hes done well why didnt you say so said rosemary were always keen on sending a bit of the mayhem lears way said warty shall we curse him with leprosy by your leave ladies i dont wish the old mans undoing only the undoing of his deeds a simple curse would be easier said tall a bit o bat spittle in the cauldron and we can have him walking on duck feet before breakfast make him quack too if youve a shilling or a freshlystrangled infant for the service i just want my friends and my home back said i well if you cant be persuaded let us have a consult said rosemary parsley sage a moment she waved the other witches over to an old oak where they whispered parsley sage and rosemary said kent what no thyme rosemary wheeled on him oh weve the time if youve the inclination handsome jolly good show hag said i i liked these crones they had a fineedged wit rosemary rolled her good eye at the earl lifted her skirts aimed her withered bottom at kent and rubbed a palsied claw over it round and firm good knight round and firm kent gagged a little and backed away a few steps gods save us away you ghastly carbuncled tart i would have looked away should have but i had never seen a green one a weaker man might have plucked out his own eyes but being a philosopher i knew the sight could never be unseen so i persevered hop on kent said i beastshagging is thy calling and thou surely have been called kent backed into a tree and half coldcocked himself he slid down the trunk dazed rosemary dropped her skirts just having you on the crones cackled as they huddled again weve a proper toading for you once the fools business is finished though a moment please the witches whispered for a moment then resumed their march around the cauldron nose of turk and tartars lips griffin spunk and monkey hips mandrake rubbed with tiger nads to divine undoing for the old king mad oh bollocks said sage were all out of monkey hips parsley looked into the cauldron and gave it a stir we can make do without them you can substitute a fools finger no said i well then get a finger from that comely hunk of manmeat with the bootblack on his beardhe seems foolish enough no said kent still a tad dazed and its not bootblack its a clever disguise the witches looked to me theres no counting on accuracy without the monkey hips or fools finger said rosemary i said let us make do and gallantly bugger on shall we ladies all right said parsley but dont blame us if we bollocksup your future there was more stirring and chanting in dead languages and no little bit of wailing and finally when i was about to doze off a great bubble rose in the cauldron and when it burst it released a cloud of steam that formed itself into a giant face not unlike the tragedy mask used by traveling players it glowed against the misty night ello said the giant face sounding cockney and a little drunk hello large and steamy face said i fool fool you must save the drool quick to gloucester or blood will pool oh for fucks sake this one rhymes too said i to the witches cant a bloke find a straightforward prose apparition quiet fool snapped sage who i was back to thinking of as warty to the face she said apparition of darkest power were clear on the where and the what but the fool was hoping for some direction of the how variety aye sorry said large steamy face im not slow you know your recipe was short a monkey hip well use two next time said sage well all right then to reverse the will of a flighty king remove his train to clip his wings to eldest daughters knights be dower and soon a fool will yield the power the steamy face grinned i looked at the witches so im to somehow get goneril and regan to take lears knights in addition to everything else they have he never lies said rosemary hes often wildly fucking inaccurate said parsley but not a liar again said i to the apparition good to know what to do and all but a method to the madness would be most welcome as well a strategy as it were cheeky little bastard ent e said steamy to the witches want us to put a curse on him asked sage no no the lads a rocky road ahead without adding a curse to slow him the apparition cleared his throat or at least made the throatclearing noise as strictly speaking he had no throat a princess to your will shall bend if seduction in a note you send and fates of kings and queens shall tell when bound are passions with a spell with that the apparition faded away thats it then i asked a couple of rhymes and were finished i have no idea what im to do bit thick yourself then are you said sage youre to go to gloucester youre to separate lear from his knights and see that theyre under the power of his daughters then youre to write letters of seduction to the princesses and bind their passions with a magic spell couldnt be any clearer if it was rhymed kent was nodding and shrugging as if the bloody obviousness of it all had sluiced through the wood in an illuminating deluge leaving me the only one dry oh do fuck off you greybearded sot where would you get a magic spell to bind the bitches passion them said kent pointing rudely at the hags us said the hags in chorus oh said i letting the flood wash over me of course rosemary stepped forward and held forth three shriveled grey orbs each about the size of a mans eye i did not take them fearing they might be something as disgusting as they appeared to bedesiccated elf scrotums or some such puff balls from a fungus that grows deep in the wood said rosemary in lovers breath these spores release an enchanting charm you shall unleash passion which can be never broken for him whose name next is spoken so to recap simply and without rhyme squeeze one of these bulbs under your ladys nose then say your name and she will find your charms irresistible and become overwhelmed with desire for you explained sage redundant then really said i with a grin the hags laughed themselves into a wheezearound then rosemary dropped the puff balls into a small silk pouch and handed it to me theres the matter of payment said she as i reached for the purse im a poor fool said i all we have between us is my scepter and a wellused shoulder of pork i suppose i could wait while each of you takes kent for a roll in the hay if that will do you will not said kent the hag held up a hand a price to be named later said she whenever we ask fine then said i snatching the purse away from her swear it she said i swear said i in blood but as quick as a cat she scratched the back of my hand with her ragged talon ouch blood welled in the crease let it drip in the cauldron and swear said the crone i did as i was told since im here is there any chance i could get a monkey no said sage no said parsely no said rosemary were all out of monkeys but well put a glamour on your mate so his disguise isnt so bloody pathetic go to it then said i we must be off act ii how sharper than a serpents tooth it is to have a thankless child king lear act i scene ten all your dread pleasures the sky threatened a dismal dawn as we reached castle albany the drawbridge was up who goes there shouted the sentry tis lears fool pocket and his man at arms caius caius is the name the witches gave kent to use to bind his disguise theyd cast a glamour on him his beard and hair were now jet black as if by nature not soot his face lean and weathered only his eyes as brown and gentle as a moo cows showed the real kent i advised him to pull down the wide brim of his hat should we encounter old acquaintances where in bloody hell have you been asked the sentry he signaled and the bridge ground down the old kings nearly torn the county apart looking for you accused our lady of tying a rock to you and casting you in the north sea he did seems a spot o bother i must have grown in her esteem just last night she was only going to hang me last night you drunken sot weve been looking for you for a month i looked at kent and he at me then we at the sentry a month bloody witches said kent under his breath if you turn up were to take you to our lady immediately said the sentry oh please do gentle guard your lady does so love seeing me at first light the sentry scratched his beard and seemed to be thinking well spoken fool perhaps you lot could do with some breakfast and a washup before i take you to my lady the drawbridge thumped into place i led kent across and the sentry met us by the inner gate beggin your pardon sir the sentry said directing his speech to kent you wouldnt mind waiting until eight bells to reveal the fools return would you that when youre off watch lad aye sir im not sure i want to be the bearer of the joyous news of the wayward fools arrival the kings knights have been raising rabble round the castle for a fortnight and ive heard our lady cursing the black fool as part of the cause blamed even in my absence said i i told you caius she adores me kent patted the sentry on the shoulder well escort ourselves lad and tell your lady we came through the gate with the merchants in the morning now back to your post thank you good sir but for your rough clothes id take you for a gentleman but for my clothes id be one said kent his grin a dazzle amid his newlyblack beard oh for fucks sake would you two just have a gobble on each others knob and be done with it said i the two soldiers leapt back as if each was on fire sorry just having you on said i as i breezed by them and into the castle you poofters are such a sensitive lot im not a poofter said kent as we approached gonerils chambers midmorning the time in between allowed us to eat wash do some writing and ascertain that we had indeed been gone for over a month despite it seeming only overnight to us perhaps that was the hags payment to extract a month from our lives in exchange for the spells potions and prognosticationit seemed a fair price but bloody complicated to explain oswald sat at a scribes desk outside the duchesss chambers i laughed and wagged jones under his nose still guarding the door like a common footman then oswald oh the years have been good to you oswald wore only a dagger at his belt no sword but his hand fell to it as he stood kent dropped his hand to his sword and shook his head gravely oswald sat back down on his stool ill have you know that im both steward and chamberlain as well as trusted adviser to the duchess a veritable quiver of titles shes given you to sling tell me do you still answer to toady and catchfart or are those titles only honorary now all better than common fool oswald spat true i am a fool and also true i am common but i am no common fool catchfart i am the black fool i have been sent for and i shall be given entry to your ladys chambers while you fool sit by the door announce me i believe oswald growled then a new trick hed learned since the old days hed always tried to cast my title as an insult and boiled that i took it as a tribute would he ever understand that he found favor with goneril not because of his groveling or devotion but because he was so easily humiliated good i suppose that hed learned to growl beaten down dog that he was he stormed through the heavy door then returned a minute later he would not look me in the eye my lady will see you now he said but only you this ruffian can wait in the kitchen wait here ruffian said i to kent and make some effort not to bugger poor oswald here no matter how he should beg for it im not a poofter said kent not with this villain youre not said i his bum is property of the princess ill see you hanged fool said oswald aroused by the thought are you oswald no matter youll not have my ruffian adieu then i was through the doors and into gonerils chambers goneril sat to the back of a great round room her quarters were housed in a full tower of the castle three floors this hall for meeting and business another floor above it would have rooms for her ladies her wardrobe bathing and dressing the top would be where she slept and played if she still played do you still play pumpkin i asked i danced a tightstepped jig and bowed goneril waved her ladies away pocket ill have you oh i know hanged at dawn head on a pike guts for garters drawn and quartered impaled disemboweled beaten and made into bangers and mashall your dread pleasures visited on me with glorious crueltyall stipulated ladyduly noted and taken as truth now how may a humble fool serve before his hour of doom descends she twisted up her lip as if to snarl then burst out laughing and quickly looked around to make sure that no one saw her i will you knowyou horrible wicked little man wicked moi said i in perfect fucking french tell no one she said it had always been that way with goneril her tell no one however applied only to me not to her i had found out pocket she once said brushing her redgold hair near a window where it caught the sun and seemed to shine as if from within she was perhaps seventeen then and had gotten in the habit of calling me to her chambers several times a week and questioning me mercilessly pocket i am to be married soon and i am mystified by man bits ive heard them described but thats not helping ask your nurse isnt she supposed to teach you about such things aunties a nun and married to jesus a virgin you dont say she went to the wrong bloody convent then i need to talk to a man but not a proper man you are like one of those fellows that saracens have look over their harems a eunuch see you are worldly and know of things i need to see your willie pardon what why because ive never seen one and i dont want to seem naïve on my wedding night when the depraved brute ravages me how do you know hes a depraved brute auntie told me all men are now out with your willie fool why my willie theres willies aplenty you can look at what about oswald he may even have one or knows where you can get hold of one ill wager oswald was her footman then i know but this is my first and yours will be small and not so frightening its like when i was learning to ride and first father gave me a pony but then as i got older all right then shut up here oh would you look at that what thats it then yes what nothing really to be afraid of then was there i dont know what all the fuss is about its rather pitiful if you ask me it is not are they all this small most are smaller in fact may i touch it if you feel you must well would you look at that see now youve angered it where in gods name have you been she said fathers been a madman looking for you he and his captain have gone out on patrol every day and well into the evening leaving the rest of his knights to wreak havoc on the castle my lord has sent soldiers as far as edinburgh asking after you i should have you drowned for all the worry youve caused you did miss me didnt you i cradled the silk purse at my belt wondering when best to spring the spell and once she was bewitched how exactly would i use the power he was supposed to be in regans care but by the time he moves his bloody hundred knights all the way to cornwall it will be my turn again i cant abide the rabble in my palace what does lord albany say he says what i tell him to say its all intolerable gloucester said i offering the very model of a non sequitur wrapped in an enigma gloucester asked the duchess the kings good friend is there its midway between here and cornwall and the earl of gloucester darent deny the request of the dukes of both albany and cornwall you wouldnt be leaving the king without care yet you wouldnt have him underfoot either with the witches warning about drool in danger there i was determined for all the drama to descend on gloucester i sat down on the floor near her feet held jones across my knees and waited both i and the puppet wearing jolly grins gloucester said goneril letting a bit of a smile seep out she really could be lovely when she forgot she was cruel gloucester said jones the dogs bollocks of western bloody blighty do you think hell agree to it its not how he laid out his legacy he wont agree to gloucester but hell agree to go to regans by way of gloucester the rest will be up to your sister should i have felt myself a traitor no the old man brought this on himself but if he doesnt agree and he has all these men she looked me in the eye now its too much power in the hands of the feeble and yet he had all the power of the kingdom not two months ago youve not seen him pocket the legacy and banishment of cordelia and kent was just the beginning since you went away hes gotten worse he searches for you he hunts he rails about his days as a soldier of christ one minute then calls to the gods of nature the next with a fighting force of that sizeif he should feel that weve betrayed him take them said i what i couldnt you have seen my apprentice drool he eats with his hands or with a spoon we dare not let him have a knife or fork lest the points imperil all dont be obtuse pocket what of fathers knights you pay them take them for his own good lear with his train of knights is like a child running with a sword are you cruel to relieve him of deadly force when he is neither strong enough nor wise enough to wield it tell lear he must dismiss fifty of his knights and their attendants and keep them here tell him they will be at his beck and call when he is in residence fifty just fifty you must leave some for your sister send oswald to cornwall with your plan have regan and cornwall make haste to gloucester so they are there upon lears arrival perhaps they can bring gloucester into the fold with lears knights dismissed the two whitebeards can reminisce about their glory days and crawl together to the grave in peaceful nostalgia yes goneril was becoming breathless now excited id seen it before it wasnt always a good sign quickly said i send oswald to regan while the sun is high no goneril sat forward quickly her bosom nearly spilling out of her gown which captured my attention more than her fingernails digging into my arm what said i the bells of my coxcomb but a fingers breath from jingling her décolletage décolletagethe road to hooterville cleavage from the fucking french filecprogramfilesfictionbookeditorchristophermoorefoolvhtmlfootnotehtml there is no peace for lear in gloucester havent you heard the earls son edgar is a traitor had i heard had i heard of course the bastards plan was afoot of course lady where do you think ive been youve been all the way to gloucester she was panting now aye and back ive brought you something a present she showed the delighted wide greygreen eyes shed had when she was a girl perhaps i wont hang you but punishment is due you pocket then the lady grabbed me and pulled me across her lap facedown jones rolled to the floor beside me lady perhaps smack there fool ive hit it hit it hit it hit it so give it give it give it a smack with every iamb iambin poetry a metrical foot consisting of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable hit it give it bloody hell you insane tart i squirmed my ass burned with her handprint smack oh good god said goneril yes she wiggled under me now smack ouch its a letter a letter said i ill see your little bum as red as a rose smack i squirmed in her lap turned grabbed her bosoms and pulled myself upright until i was sitting in her lap here i pulled the sealed parchment out of my jerkin and held it out not yet said she trying to roll me over and get back to smacking my bum she honked my codpiece you honked my codpiece aye give it up fool she tried to get a hand under my codpiece i reached into the silk purse and retrieved one of the puffballs as i tried to keep my manhood out of her grasp i heard a door open surrender the willie said the duchess she had it then there was nothing i could do i squoze the puffball under her nose its from edmund of gloucester said i milady said oswald who was standing in the doorway let us down pumpkin said i the catchfart needs his task set it all smacked of history the game had progressed further that first day when oswald first interrupted us all those years ago but it had begun as always with one of gonerils query sessions pocket said she since you were raised in an abbey i should think you know much about punishment aye lady i had my share and it didnt end there i still endure an inquisition almost daily in these very chambers gentle pocket surely you jest that is part of the job mum she stood then and dismissed the ladies from her solar with a minor tantrum when they were gone she said ive never been punished aye lady well youre christian theres always time id left the church with a curse after they walled up my anchoress and i was leaning heavily pagan at the time no one is allowed to strike me so theres always been a girl to take my punishment for me my spankings aye mum as it should be spare the royal withers and all and i feel funny about it just last week i mentioned during mass that regan might be a bit of a cunt and my whipping girl was soundly spanked for it might as well have whipped her for your calling the sky blue eh a beating for talking truth of course you felt funny about it not that kind of funny pocket funny like when you taught me about the little man in the boat it had been a verbal lesson only shortly after shed insisted i teach her about manly bits but it had kept her amused on and off for a fortnight oh of course said i funny i need to be spanked said goneril a constant id agree lady but again were declaring the sky blue arent we i want to be spanked oh said i eloquent and quickwitted rascal that i am thats different by you said the princess fuckstockings i thus declared my doom well by the time oswald came into the room that first time both the princess and i were as redbottomed as barbary monkeys quite naked except for my hat which goneril had donned and administering rhythmically to each others front sides oswald was somewhat less than discreet about it all alarm alarm my lady is ravaged by a fool alarm said oswald fleeing from the room to raise the alarm through the castle i caught up to oswald as he entered the great hall where lear was sitting on his throne regan sitting at his feet to one side doing needlepoint cordelia at the other playing with a doll the fool has violated the princess oswald announced pocket said cordelia dropping her doll and running to my side sporting a great goofy grin she was perhaps eight then oswald stepped in front of me i found the fool rutting the princess goneril like a rapacious goat sire tis not true nuncle said i i was called to the ladys solar this morning only to jest her out of a morning funk which can be smelt upon her breath if you have doubts at that point goneril came running into the room trying to arrange her skirts as she moved she stopped beside me and curtsied before her father she was breathless barefoot and one breast peeked cyclopean out the bodice of her gown i snatched my coxcomb off her head with a jingle and concealed it behind my back there fresh as a flower said i hello sister said cordelia morning lamb said goneril blindfolding the pinkeyed cyclops with a quick tuck lear scratched his beard and glared at his eldest daughter what ho daughter said he hast thou shagged a fool methinks any wench who shags a man hath shagged a fool father that was a distinct no said i what is shagged asked cordelia i saw it said oswald shag a man and shag a fool one is the same as another said goneril but this morning i have your fool shagged righteous and rowdy i bonked him until he cried out for gods and horses to pull me off what was this was she hoping for more punishment that is so said oswald i heard the call shagged shagged shagged said goneril oh what is this i feel tiny bastard fools stirring in my womb i can hear their tiny bells you lying tart said i a fool is no more born with bells than a princess with fangs both must be earned lear said if that were true pocket id have a halberd run up your bum you cant kill pocket said cordelia ill need him to cheer me when im visited by the red curse and a horrible melancholy comes over me said cordelia what are you on about child said i all women get it said cordelia they must be punished for eves treachery in the garden of evil nurse says it makes you ever so miserable i patted the childs head for fucks sake sire youve got to get the girls some teachers who arent nuns i should be punished said goneril ive had my curse for simply months said regan not even bothering to look up from her needlepoint i find that if i go to the dungeon and have some prisoners tortured i feel better no i want my pocket said cordelia starting to whine now you cant have him said goneril hes to be punished too after what hes done oswald bowed for no particular reason may i suggest his head on a pike on the london bridge sire to discourage any more debauchery silence said lear standing he came down the steps walked past oswald who fell to his knees and stood before me he put his hand on cordelias head the old king locked his hawks gaze upon me she didnt speak for three years before you came he said aye sire said i looking down he turned to goneril go to your quarters have your nurse tend to your illusions she will see that there is no issue from it but father the fool and i nonsense youre a maid said lear we have agreed to deliver you thus to the duke of albany and so it is true sire the lady has been violated said oswald desperate now guards take oswald to the bailey and flog him twenty lashes for lying but sire oswald squirmed as two guards seized his arms twenty lashes to show my mercy another word of this ever and your head will decorate london bridge we watched stunned as the guards dragged oswald away the unctuous footman weeping and redfaced from trying to hold his tongue may i go watch goneril asked go lear said then to your nurse regan was on her feet now and had skipped to her fathers side she looked at him hopefully up on her toes clapping her hands lightly in anticipation yes go said the king but you may only watch regan streamed out of the hall after her older sister her raven hair flying behind her like a dark comet youre my fool pocket said cordelia taking my hand come help me im teaching dolly to speak french the little princess led me away the old king watched us go without another word one white eyebrow raised and his hawk eye burning under it like a distant frozen star eleven a sweet and bitter fool goneril dumped me on the floor as if shed suddenly found a bag of drowned kittens in her lap she snapped open the letter and began reading without even bothering to tuck her bosoms back into her gown milady said oswald again hed learned from that first whipping he acted as if he didnt even see me your father is in the great hall asking after his fool goneril looked up irritated well then take him take him take him take him she waved us away like flies very well milady oswald turned on his heel and marched away come fool i stood and rubbed my bum as i followed oswald out of the solar yes my backside was bruised but there was pain in my heart as well what a bitter bitch to cast me out while my bum still burned with the blows of her passion the bells on my coxcomb drooped in despair kent fell in beside me in the hall so is she smitten with you with edmund of gloucester said i edmund shes smitten with the bastard aye the fickle whore said i kent looked startled and folded back the brim of his hat to better see me but you bewitched her to do so didnt you oh yes i suppose i did said i so she was only immune to my charms by means of dark and powerful magic ha i felt better she reads the letter i forged in his hand even now your fool oswald announced as we entered the hall the old king was there with captain curan and a dozen other knights who looked like theyd just returned from the huntfor me no doubt my boy lear called throwing his arms wide i walked into his embrace but did not return it i found no tenderness in my heart at the sight of him but my anger boiled still oh joy said oswald his disdain dripping like venom in his voice the prodigal git returns see here said lear my men have yet to be paid tell my daughter i will see her oswald did not acknowledge the old man but kept walking you sir roared the king did you hear me oswald turned slowly as if hed heard his name carried in faintly on the wind aye i heard you do you know who i am oswald picked a front tooth with the nail of his small finger aye my ladys father he smirked the rascal had cheek that i will give him that or a burning desire to be catapulted cod over cap into the afterlife your ladys father lear pulled off his heavy leather hunting gauntlet and backhanded it across oswalds face you knave you whoreson dog you slave you cur the metal studs on lears glove were beginning to draw blood where they struck oswald i am none of these things i will not be struck by you oswald was backing toward the great double doors as lear worried at him with the glove but when the steward turned to run kent threw out a leg and swept him off his feet or tripped neither you tosser said kent oswald rolled into a heap at the foot of one of gonerils guards then scrambled to his feet and ran out the guards pretended theyd seen nothing well done friend said lear to kent are you the one who brought my fool home aye he is nuncle said i rescued me from the darkest heart of the forest fought off brigands pygmies and a brace of tigers to bring me here but dont let him talk his welsh at you one tiger was vanquished in a sluice of phlegm and mortally beaten with consonants lear looked closely now at his old friend then shiveredguilts chill claws scuttling across his spine no doubt welcome then sir i thank thee lear handed kent a small purse of coin earnest payment for your service my thanks and my sword said kent bowing what is your name asked lear caius said kent and whence do you hail from bonking sire well yes lad as do we all said lear but from what town bonking ewe on worms head i offered with a shrug wales fine then join my train said lear youre hired oh and allow me to hire you as well said i removing my hat and handing it to kent with a jingle whats this asked kent who but a fool would work for a fool watch your tongue boy said lear youll have to get your own hat fool said i to the king mine is already promised captain curan turned to conceal a smile you call me a fool oh should i not call you fool all your other titles you have given away along with your land ill have you whipped i rubbed my burning bottom that is the only legacy you have left nuncle youve become a bitter fool in your absence said the king and you the sweet one said i the fool who makes a jest of his own fate the boy is not altogether fool said kent lear turned on the old knight but not in anger perhaps said he weakly his eye drifting to the stones of the floor as if searching for an answer there perhaps the lady goneril duchess of albany announced one of the guards craven hosebeast i added relatively certain the guard would forget that part goneril breezed into the room no notice of me she went right to her father the old man opened his arms but she stopped short a swordlength away did you strike my man for chiding your fool now she scowled at me i rubbed my bum and blew her a kiss oswald peeked through the doors to the hall as if waiting for the answer i struck the knave for being impudent i but asked him to fetch you my fool has only just returned from being lost this is not a time for frowns daughter therere no smiles for you sire said i not now that youve nothing to offer the lady has only bile for fools and those with no title at all quiet boy said the king you see said goneril not just your alllicensed fool but your whole train treats my palace like a tavern and a brothel they fight and eat all day drink and carouse all night and you care for nothing but your precious fool as it should be said jones albeit softlywhen royal ire is raging even the spittle sprayed from their lips can rain down death on the common puppet or person i care for much and my men are the best in the land and they have not been paid since we left london perhaps if you they will not be paid said goneril and suddenly all the knights in the hall came to attention when i gave you all twas on the condition of you maintaining my retinue daughter aye father and they shall be maintained but not in your charge and not in their full number lear was growing redfaced now and shaking with anger as with palsy speak clearly daughter these old ears deceive now goneril went to her father and took his hand yes father you are old very old really really extraordinarily mindbogglingly she turned to me for a cue dogfuckingly i suggested dogfuckingly old said the duchess you are feebly incontinently desiccatedly smellingofboiledcabaggely old you are brainrottingly ballsdraggingly im fucking old said lear well stipulate that said i and continued goneril while you in your dotage should be revered for your wisdom and grace you piss on your legacy and reputation by keeping this train of ruffians they are too much for you they are my loyal men and you have agreed to maintain them and i shall i shall pay your men but half will stay here at albany under my charge under my orders in soldiers quarters not running about the bailey like marauders darkness and devils cursed lear it shall not be curan saddle my horses call my train together i have another daughter go to her then said goneril you strike my servants and your rabble makes servants of their betters be gone then but half your train shall remain prepare my horses said lear curan hurried out of the hall followed by the other knights passing the lord albany as he entered the duke looking more than somewhat confused why does the kings captain exit with such urgency asked the duke do you know of this harpys intent to strip me of my train asked lear this is the first ive heard of it said albany pray be patient sire my lady albany looked to goneril we do not strip him of his knights i have offered to maintain them here with our own force while father goes on to my sisters castle we shall treat his men as our own with discipline as soldiers not as guests and revelers they are out of the old mans control albany turned back to lear and shrugged she lies said lear now wagging a finger under gonerils nose thou detested viper thou ungrateful fiend thou hideousuh slag slagbritish slang for slut tramp i offered thou piteous prickpull thou vainglorious virago thou skunkbreathed licker of dog scrotums do jump in albany i cant go on forever no matter how inspired surely youve years of suppressed resentment to vent thou leprous spunkcatch thou wormeaten shut up fool said lear sorry sirrah i thought you were losing your momentum how could i have given preference to this villainess over my sweet cordelia asked lear doubtless that question was lost worse in the wood than i seeing as it has only caught up with you now sire shall we take cover against the impact of the revelation that youve awarded your kingdom to the best liars of your loins who would have thought it but id felt more charity toward the old man before he realized his folly now he turned his eyes skyward and began to invoke the gods hear me nature dear goddess hear convey sterility onto this creature dry up her womb and never let a babe spring from her body to honor her instead create in her a child of spleen and bile let it torment her and stamp wrinkles in her youthful brow let it turn all of her mothers benefits to laughter and contempt that she may feel how sharper than a serpents tooth it is to have a thankless child with that the old man spat at gonerils feet and stormed out of the hall i think he took that as well as could reasonably be expected said i i was ignored despite my positive tone and sunny smile oswald called goneril the smarmy steward slithered forth quickly take the letter to my sister and cornwall take two of the fastest horses and alternate them do not rest until it is in her hand and then take you to gloucester and deliver that other message as well you have given me no other message lady said the worm yes right come with me we shall draft a letter she led oswald out of the great hall leaving the duke of albany looking to me for some sort of explanation i shrugged she can be a whirlwind of tits and terror when she puts her mind to a purpose cant she sir albany didnt seem to notice my comment somewhat forlorn he looked his beard seemed to be greying with worry as he stood there i dont approve of her treatment of the king the old man has earned more respect and what of these messages to cornwall and gloucester i started to speak thinking it a perfect opportunity to mention her newfound affection for edmund of gloucester my recent session of bawdy discipline with the duchess and a halfdozen metaphors for illicit shagging that had come to mind while the duke mused when jones said sex and cuckoldry youve mastered those jokes for a more challenging jape a new seal should be broke what said i whenever jones has spoken before it has been in my own voicesmaller and muted sometimes from the art of throwing it but my voice alone unless drool is mimicking the puppet and it is i who works the little ring and string that move joness mouth but this was not my voice and i had not moved the puppet it was the voice of the girl ghost from the white tower dont be tedious pocket said albany ive no patience for puppets and rhymes jones said a thousand rough nights to call the lady a whore only today may a fool jest the land into war and like a shooting star cutting brilliant across the ignorant night of my mind i saw the ghosts meaning i said i know not what the lady sends to cornwall good albany but while i was this last month in gloucester i heard soldiers talk of cornwall and regan gathering forces by the sea gathering an army whatever for with gentle cordelia and jeff now on the throne in france it would be folly to cross the channel weve a safe ally there oh they arent gathering forces against france they are gathering forces against you my lord regan would be queen of all of britain or so i heard said you heard this from soldiers under whose flag these soldiers mercenaries lord no flag but fortune for them and the word was there is coin aplenty for a free lance fighter in cornwall i have to be off the king will need someone to whip for your ladys rude announcements that doesnt seem fair said albany he had a spark of decency in him really and somehow goneril had not yet been able to smother it plus he seemed to have forgotten about accidentally hanging me dont worry for me good duke you have worries of your own someone must take a hit for your lady let it be this humble fool pray tell her i said that someone must always hit it fare thee well duke and merrily i was off bottom stinging to let slip the dogs of war hi ho lear sat on his horse outside castle albany howling at the sky like a complete lunatic may natures nymphs bring great lobstersized vermin to infest the rotted nest of her woman bits and may serpents fix their fangs in her nipples and wave there until her poisoned dugs dugsbreasts teats go black and drop to the ground like overripe figs i looked at kent built up a spot of steam hasnt he said i may thor hammer at her bowels and produce flaming flatulence that wilts the forest and launches her off the battlements into a reeking dung heap not really adhering to any particular pantheon is he said kent oh poseidon send your oneeyed son to stare into her bituminous heart and ignite it with flames of most hideous suffering you know said i the king seems to be leaning rather heavily on curses for someone with his unsavory history with witches aye said kent seems to have steered his wrath toward the eldest daughter if im not mistaken oh you dont say said i sure sure that could be it i suppose we heard horses galloping and i pulled kent back from the drawbridge as two riders leading a train of six horses thundered across oswald said kent with extra horses said i hes gone to cornwall lear broke with his cursing and watched the riders take out across the moor what business has that rascal in cornwall he carries a message nuncle said i i heard goneril order him to report her mind to her sister and for regan and her lord to go to gloucester and not to be in cornwall when you arrive goneril thou foul monstress said the king clouting himself on the forehead indeed said i oh evil monstress to be sure said kent oh pernicious monstress perfect in her perfidy kent and i looked at each other knowing not what to say i said said lear most pernicious monstress perfect in her perfidy kent mimed a set of generous bosoms on himself and raised an eyebrow as if to ask boobs i shrugged as if to say aye boobs sounds right aye most pernicious perfidy indeed sire said i aye most bouncy and jiggling perfidy perfidytreachery definitely not bosoms said kent then as if coming out of a trance lear snapped to attention in his saddle you caius have curan saddle a fast horse for you you must go to gloucester tell my friend the earl that we are coming aye my lord said kent and caius see that my apprentice drool comes to no harm said i kent nodded and went back across the drawbridge the old king looked down to me oh my pretty black fool where from fatherly duty did i stray that such ingratitude should rise in goneril like mad fever i am only a fool my lord but making a guess id say the lady may have in her delicate youth required more discipline to shape her character speak plain pocket ill not hold harm against you you needed to smack the bitch up when she was tender my lord instead now you hand your daughters the rod and pull down your own breeches ill have you flogged fool his word is like the dew said the puppet jones good only until put under light of day i laughed simple fool that i am no thought at all that lear was becoming as inconstant as a butterfly i need to speak to curan and find a horse for the journey sirrah said i ill bring your cloak lear sagged in the saddle now spent now from his ranting go good pocket have my knights prepare so i shall said i so i shall i left the old man there alone outside the castle twelve a kings road having set the course of events in motion i wonder now if my training to be a nun and my polished skills at telling jokes juggling and singing songs fully qualify me to start a war i have so often been the instrument of the whims of others not even a pawn at court merely an accoutrement to the king or his daughters an amusing ornament a tiny reminder of conscience and humanity tempered with enough humor so it can be dismissed laughed off ignored perhaps there is a reason that there is no fool piece on the chessboard what action a fool what strategy a fool what use a fool ah but a fool resides in a deck of cards a joker sometimes two of no worth of course no real purpose the appearance of a trump but none of the power simply an instrument of chance only a dealer may give value to the joker make him wild make him trump is the dealer fate god the king a ghost witches the anchoress spoke of the cards in the tarot forbidden and pagan as they were we had no cards but she would describe them for me and i drew their images on the stones of the antechamber in charcoal the fools number is zero she said but thats because he represents the infinite possibility of all things he may become anything see he carries all of his possessions in a bundle on his back he is ready for anything to go anywhere to become whatever he needs to be dont count out the fool pocket simply because his number is zero did she know where i was heading or do her words only have meaning to me now as i the zero the nothing seek to move nations war i couldnt see the appeal drunk and dire of mood one night lear mused of war when i suggested that what he needed to cast off his dark aspect was a good wenching oh pocket i am too old and the joy of a fuck withers with my limbs only a good killing can still boil lust in my blood and one will not do either kill me a hundred a thousand ten thousand on my commandrivers of blood running through the fieldsthats what pumps fire into a mans lance oh said i i was going to fetch shanker mary for you from the laundry but ten thousand dead and rivers of blood might be a bit beyond her talents majesty no thank you good pocket i shall sit and slide slowly and sadly into oblivion or said i i could put a bucket on drools head and beat him with a sack of beets until the floor is splattered crimson while shanker mary gives you a proper tug to accentuate the gore no fool there is no pretending to war whats wales doing majesty we could invade the welsh perpetrate enough slaughter to raise your spirits and have you back for tea and toast wales is ours now lad oh bugger whats your feeling on attacking north kensington then kensingtons not a mile away practically in our own bailey aye nuncle thats the beauty of it theyd never see it coming like a hot blade through butter wed be we could hear the widows and orphans wailing from the castle wallslike a horny lullaby for you i should think not im not attacking neighborhoods of london to amuse myself pocket what kind of tyrant do you think me oh above average sire well above bloody average ill have you speak no more of war fool youve too sweet a nature for such dastardly pursuits too sweet moi methinks the art of war was made for fools and fools for war kensington trembled that night on the road to gloucester i let my anger wane and tried to comfort the old king as best i could by lending him a sympathetic ear and a gentle word when he needed it you simple sniveling old tossbeast what did you expect to happen when you put the care of your halfrotted carcass in the talons of that carrion bird of a daughter i may have had some residual anger but i gave her half my kingdom and she gave you half the truth in return when she told you she loved you all the old man hung his head and his white hair fell in his face we sat on stones by the fire a tent was set in the wood nearby for the kings comfort as there was no manor house in this northern county for him to take refuge the rest of us would sleep outside in the cold wait fool until we are under the roof of my second daughter said lear regan was always the sweet one she will not be so shabby in her gratitude i had no heart to chide the old man any more expecting kindness from regan was hope sung in the key of madness always the sweet one regan i think not my second week in the castle i found young regan and goneril in one of the kings solars teasing little cordelia passing a kitten the little one had taken a fancy to over her head taunting her oh come get the kitty said regan be careful lest it fly out the window regan pretended she might throw the terrified little cat out the window and as cordelia ran arms stretched out to grab the kitten regan reeled and tossed the kitten to goneril who swung the kitten toward another window oh look cordy shell be drowned in the moat just like your traitor mother said goneril nooooooo wailed cordelia she was nearly breathless from running sister to sister after the kitten i stood in the doorway stunned at their cruelty the chamberlain had told me that cordelias mother lears third queen had been accused of treason and banished three years before no one knew exactly the circumstances of the crime but there were rumors that she had been practicing the old religion others that she had committed adultery all the chamberlain knew for sure was that the queen had been taken from the tower in the dead of night and from that time until my arrival at the castle cordelia had not uttered a coherent syllable drowned as a witch she was said regan snatching the kitten out of the air but this time the little kittens claws found royal flesh ow you little shit regan tossed the kitten out the window cordelia loosed an earshattering scream without thinking i dived through the window after the cat and caught the braided cord with my feet as i flew through i caught the kitten about five feet below the window as the cord burned between my ankles not having thought the move completely through i hadnt counted on how to catch myself kitten in hand when the cord slammed me into the tower wall the cord tightened around my right ankle i took the impact on that shoulder and bounced while i watched my coxcomb flutter like a wounded bird to the moat below i tucked the kitten into my doublet then climbed back up the cord and in through the window lovely day for a constitutional dont you think ladies the three of them all stood with their mouths hanging open the older sisters had backed against the walls of the solar you lot look like you could use some air said i i took the kitten from my doublet and held it out to cordelia kittys had quite an adventure perhaps you should take her to her mum for a nap cordelia took the kitten from me and ran out of the room we can have you beheaded fool said regan shaking off her shock anytime we want said goneril with less conviction than her sister shall i send in a maid to tie back the tapestry mum i asked with a grand wave to the tapestry id loosed from the wall when i leapt uh yes do that commanded regan this instant this instant barked goneril right away mum and with a grin and a bow i was gone from the room i made my way down the spiral stairs clinging to the wall lest my heart give out and send me tumbling cordelia stood at the bottom of the stairs cradling the kitten looking up at me as if i were jesus zeus and st george all back from a smashing day of dragon slaying her eyes were unnaturally wide and she appeared to have stopped breathing bloody awe i suppose stop staring like that lamb its disturbing people will think youve a chicken bone caught in your throat thank you she said with a great shouldershaking sob i patted her head youre welcome love now run along pocket has to fish his hat from the moat and then go to the kitchen and drink until his hands stop shaking or he drowns in his own sick whichever comes first she backed away to let me pass never taking her eyes from mine it had been thus since the night i arrived at the towerwhen her mind first crept out from whatever dark place it had been living before my arrivalthose wide crystalblue eyes looking at me with unblinking wonder the child could be right creepy do not make yourself a maid to surprise nuncle said i i held the reins of my and the kings horse as they drank from an icelaced stream some hundred miles north of gloucester regan is a treasure to be sure but she may have the same mind as her sister although they will deny it its often been the case i cannot think it so said the king regan will receive us with open arms there was a racket behind us and the king turned ah what is this a gaily painted wagon was coming out of the wood toward us several of the knights reached for swords or lances captain curan waved for them to stand at ease mummers sire said the captain aye said lear i forgot the yule is nearly on us theyll be going to gloucester as well ill wager to play for the yule feast pocket go tell them that we grant them safe passage and they may follow our train under our protection the wagon creaked to a stop happening upon a train of fifty knights and attendants in the countryside would put any performer on guard the man driving the wagon stood at the reins and waved he wore a grand purple hat with a white plume in it i leapt the narrow stream and made my way up the road when the driver saw my motley he smiled i too smiled in reliefthis was not the cruel master from my own days as a mummer hail fool what finds you so far from court and castle i carry my court with me and my castle lies ahead sirrah carry your court then that whitehaired old man is aye king lear himself then you are the famous black fool at your bloody service said i with a bow youre smaller than in the stories said the bighatted weasel aye and your hat is an ocean in which your wit wanders like a lost plague ship the mummer laughed you give me more than my due sirrah we trade not in wit like you wily fool we are thespians with that three young men and a girl stepped out from behind the wagon and bowed gracefully and with far too much flourish than was called for thesbians said they in chorus i tipped my coxcomb well i enjoy a lick of the lily from time to time myself said i but its hardly something you want to paint on the side of a wagon not lesbians said the girl thesbians we are actors oh said i thats different aye said big hat weve no need of witthe plays the thing you see not a word passes our lips that hasnt been chewed thrice and spat out by a scribe unburdened by originality are we said an actor in a red waistcoat the girl said although we do bear the cross of fabulously shiny hair blank slates we are said another of the actors we are mere appendages of the pen so to speak said big hat yeah youre a bloody appendage all right i said under my breath well actors then smashing the king has bade me tell you that he grants you safe passage to gloucester and offers his protection oh my said big hat we are only going as far as birmingham but i suppose we could double back from gloucester if his majesty wishes us to perform no said i please do pass through and on to birmingham the king would never impede the progress of artists youre certain said big hat weve been rehearsing a classic from antiquity green eggs and hamlet the story of a young prince of denmark who goes mad drowns his girlfriend and in his remorse forces spoiled breakfast on all whom he meets it was pieced together from fragments of an ancient merican manuscript no said i i think it will be too esoteric for the king he is old and nods off during long performances shame said big hat a moving piece let me do a selection for you green eggs or not green eggs that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to eat them in a box with a fox stop said i go now and quickly war has come to the land and rumor has it that as soon as theyve finished with the lawyers theyre going to kill all the actors really aye i nodded most sincerely quick on to birmingham before you are slaughtered everyone jump on said big hat and the actors did as directed fare thee well fool then he snapped the reins and drove off the wagons wheels bouncing in the ruts of the road lears train parted and watched as the team pulled the wagon by at a gallop what was that asked lear when i returned wagonload of knobs said i why do they hurry so we commanded it so nuncle half their troupe is ill with fever we want them nowhere near your men oh good show then lad i thought you might be missing the life and were going to join their troupe i shuddered at the thought it had been a cold december day like this when id first come to the white tower with my mummer troupe we were decidedly not thespians but singers jugglers and acrobats and i a special asset because i could do all three our master was a crooked belgian named belette who bought me from mother basil for ten shillings and the promise to feed me he spoke dutch french and a very broken english so i dont know how he managed to secure the white tower for a performance that christmas but i was told later that the troupe that was supposed to have performed had suddenly taken ill with stomach cramps and i suspect that belette poisoned them i had been with belette for months and except for the beatings and cold nights sleeping under a wagon i had received little but my daily bread the occasional cup of wine and the skills of knifethrowing and sleight of hand as it could be applied to purse cutting we were led into the great hall at the tower which was filled with nobles reveling and feasting on platters of food such as i had never seen king lear sat at the center of the main table flanked by two beautiful girls about my age who i would later find out were regan and goneril beside regan sat gloucester his wife and their son edgar the intrepid kent sat on the other side next to goneril under that table at lears feet a little girl was curled up watching the celebrationwideeyed like a frightened animal clinging to a rag doll i must confess i thought the child might be deaf or even simpleminded we performed for perhaps two hours singing songs of the saints during dinner then moving on to bawdier fare as the wine flowed and the guests loosened their hold on propriety by late in the evening everyone was laughing the guests were dancing with the performers and even the commoners who lived in the castle had joined the party but the little girl remained under the table making not a sound not a smile not an eyebrow raised in delight there was light there behind those crystalblue eyesthis was not a simpletonbut she seemed to be staring out of them from afar i crawled under the table and sat next to her she barely acknowledged my presence i leaned in close and nodded toward belette who stood by a column near the center of the hall leering lecherously at the young girls who frolicked about him i could see the little girl spied the scoundrel too ever so softly i sang a little song the anchoress had taught me with the lyrics changed a bit to adapt to the situation belette was a rat was a rat was a rat was a rat belette was a rat was a rat was a rat was a rat belette was a rat who ate his tail and the little girl pulled back and looked at me as if to see if i had really sung such a thing and i sang on belette was a rat was a rat was a rat belette was a rat was a rat was a rat belette was a rat who drowned in a pail and the little girl cackleda broken littlegirl yodel of a laugh that rang of innocence and joy and delight i sang on and ever so softly she sang with me belette was a rat was a rat was a rat belette was a rat and we were no longer alone under the table there was another pair of crystalblue eyes and behind them a whitehaired king the old king smiled and squeezed my biceps and before the other guests noticed that the king was under the table he sat back up on his throne but he reached down and lay a hand across the little girls shoulder and the other upon mine it was a hand reached across a vast chasm of realityfrom the highest position of ruler of the realm to a lowborn orphan boy who slept in the mud under a wagon i thought it must have been how a knight felt when the kings sword touched his shoulder elevating him to nobility was a rat was a rat was a rat we sang when the party died down and noble guests hung drunk over the tables the servants piled onto the floor before the fire belette began to move among the revelers and tap each of his performers calling them to gather by the door i had fallen asleep under the table and the little girl against my arm he pulled me up by my hair you did nothing all night i watched i knew there was a beating in store for when we got back to the wagon and i was prepared for it at least i had eaten some supper at the feast but as belette turned to drag me away he stopped abruptly i looked up to see the master frozen in space a swordpoint pressed into his cheek just below his eye he let go of my hair good thought said kent the old bull pulling his sword back but holding it steadily aimed a hands breadth from belettes eye there was a sound of coin on the table and belette couldnt help but look down even at the peril of his life a doeskin purse as big as a mans fist lay before him the chamberlain a tall severe chap who looked perpetually down his nose stood beside kent he said your payment plus ten pounds which you shall accept as payment for this boy but said belette you are a word from your mortality sirrah said lear do go on he sat straight and regal on his throne one hand pressed to the cheek of the little girl who had awakened and was clinging to his leg belette took the purse bowed deeply and backed across the hall the other mummers of my troupe bowed and followed him out what is your name boy asked lear pocket your majesty well then pocket do you see this child yes majesty her name is cordelia she is our youngest daughter and henceforth shall be your mistress you have one duty above all pocket that is to make her happy yes majesty take him to bubble said the king have her feed and bathe him then find him new clothes back on the road to gloucester lear said so what is your will pocket would you be a traveling mummer againtrade the comfort of the castle for the adventure of the road apparently i have nuncle said i we camped at the stream which froze over during the night the old man sat shivering by the fire with his rich fur cloak wrapped around him the garment so full and the man so slight that it appeared he was being consumed by a slow but wellgroomed beast only his white beard and the hawk nose were visible outside the cloaktwo stars of fire shone back in the cape creature his eyes snow fell around us in great wet orgies of flakes and my own woolen cloak which id pulled over my head was sodden have i been so unfit as a father that my daughters would turn on me so asked lear why now did he choose to stare into the dark barrel of his soul when hed been content all these years to simply scoop out his desires and let the consequences wash over whomever they may bloody inopportune time for introspection after youve given away the roof over your head but i did not say so what would i know of proper fathering sire i had no father nor mother i was reared by the church and id not give a hot squirt of piss for the lot of them poor boy said the king as long as i live you shall have father and family i would have pointed out that he had himself declared his crawl to the grave commenced and that given his performance with his daughters i might do better to go forth an orphan but the old man had rescued me from the life of a slave and wanderer and given me a home in the palace with friends and i suppose family of a sort so i said thank you majesty the old man sighed heavily and said none of my three queens ever loved me oh for fucks sake lear im a jester not a bloody wizard if youre going to keep diving into the muck of your regrets then ill just hold your sword for you and you can see if you can get your ancient ass moving enough to fall on the pointy part so we can both get some bloody peace lear laughed thentwisted old oak that he wasand patted my shoulder i could ask nothing more of a son than he give me laughter in my despair im off to bed sleep in my tent tonight pocket out of the cold aye sire i was touched by the old mans kindness i cannot deny it the old man tottered over to his tent one of the pages had been carrying hot stones into the tent for an hour and i felt the heat rush out as the king ducked inside ill be in after ive had a wee said i i walked to the edge of the fires light and beside a great bare elm was relieving myself when a blue light shimmered in the forest before me well thats a woolly tuft of lamb wank said a womans voice just as the girl ghost stepped out from behind the tree upon which i was weeing gods balls wisp ive almost peed on you careful fool said the ghost looking frighteningly solid nowjust a tad translucentsnowflakes were passing through her but i was not frightened warm thy grateful heart in the kings family but for his royal crimes youd not an orphan be thats it i asked rhymes and riddles still all you need for now said the ghost i saw the witches said i they seemed to know you aye said the ghost theres dark deeds afoot at gloucester fool dont lose sight sight of what but she was gone and i was standing in the woods my willie in my hand talking to a tree on to gloucester in the morning and id see what i was not to lose sight of or some such nonsense cornwalls and regans flags flew over the battlements alongside gloucesters showing they had already arrived castle gloucester was a bundle of towers surrounded by a lake on three sides and by a wide moat at the frontno outer curtain wall like the white tower or albany no bailey just a small front courtyard and a gatehouse that protected the entrance the city wall on the land side of the castle provided the outer defenses for stables and barracks as we approached a trumpet sounded from the wall announcing us drool came running across the drawbridge his arms held high pocket pocket where have you been my friend my friend i was greatly relieved to see him alive but the great simple bear pulled me from my horse and hugged me until i could barely breathe dancing me in a circle my feet flying in the air as if i was a doll stop licking drool you lout youll wear my hair off i clouted the oaf on the back with jones and he yowled ouch dont hit pocket he dropped me and crouched hugging himself as if he were his own comforting mother which he may have been for all i know i saw redbrown stains on his shirt back and so lifted it to see the cause oh lad what has happened to you my voice broke tears tried to push out of my eyes and i gasped the muscular slab of drools back was nearly devoid of skinhis hide had been torn and scabbed over and torn again by a vicious lash ive missed you most awful said drool aye me too but how happened these stripes lord edmund says i am an insult to nature and must be punished edmund bastard thirteen a nest of villains edmund edmund would have to be dealt with forces turned on him and i fought the urge to find the blackhearted fiend and thread one of my throwing daggers between his ribs but a plan was already in place or one of sorts and i still held the purse with the two remaining puffballs the witches had given me i swallowed my anger and led drool into the castle lo pocket is that you lad a welsh accent is the king with you i saw the top of a mans head sticking through the stocks set in the middle of the courtyard his hair was dark and long and hung in his face i approached and bent down to see who it was kent youve found yourself a cruel collar call me caius said the old knight is the king with you the poor fellow couldnt even look up aye on his way the men are stabling their horses in the town how came you to be in the stocks i tangled with that whoreson oswald gonerils steward cornwall judged me the offender and had me thrown in the stocks ive been here since last evening drool fetch some water for this good knight said i the giant loped off to find a bucket i walked around behind kent patted him lightly on his bottom you know kent ercaius you are a very attractive man you rascal pocket ill not be buggered by you i smacked his bottom again dust rose from his trousers no no no not me not my cup of tea but drool now hed shag the night if he wasnt afraid of the dark and hung like an ox that one is i suspect youll extrude stools untapered for a fortnight once drools laid the bugger to ya supperll dump through you like a cherry pit out a church bell drool was returning now carrying a wooden bucket and a dipper across the courtyard no stop shouted kent villainy violation stop these fiends guards were looking down from the walls i scooped a dipper of water from the bucket and threw it in kents face to calm him he sputtered and struggled against the stocks easy good kent i was just having you on well get you out of there as soon as the king arrives i held the dipper for the knight and he drank deeply when he finished he gasped christs codpiece pocket whyd you go on like that pure evil incarnate i reckon well stop it it doesnt suit you im working on the fit said i lear came through the gatehouse seconds later flanked by captain curan and another older knight whats this asked the king my messenger in stocks how came this to be who put you here man your daughter and soninlaw sire said kent no by jupiters beard i say no said lear aye by st cardomons scaly feet by st cardomons scaly feetthe legend goes that st cardomon was a monk from italy to whom the archangel raziel appeared asking for a drink of water while looking for water cardomon accidentally wandered into a cave that led into hell there he was lost for forty days and forty nights and while his feet burned when he first arrived he soon developed the green and scaly feet of a lizard and was protected from the fires of hell when he returned to the angel with a flagon of icewater which no one had seen before he was granted the gift of scaly feet for all time and it is often said that a woman with feet so rough that they will tear the bedsheets are blessed by st cardomon cardomon is the patron saint of combination skin cold beverages and necrophilia i say aye said kent by the flapping foreskin of freya i say bugger all said jones and they looked at the puppet confident on his stick thought we was swearing by whatever we could come up with said the puppet do go on i say no continued lear tis worse than murder to treat a messenger of the king so where is my daughter the old king stormed through the inner gate followed by captain curan and a dozen other knights from his train who had come into the castle drool sat down in the dirt splaylegged his face even with kents and said so howve you been im in the stocks said kent locked like this overnight drool nodded starting a string of his namesake down his chin so not so good then nay lad said kent better now that pocket is here to save us innit aye im a rescue in progress didnt see any keys in there when you were getting the water no no keys said drool theyve a laundress with smashing knockers works by the well sometimes but she wont have a laugh with you i asked her five times drool you mustnt just go asking that sort of thing without some prelude said i i said please said drool well done then glad youve kept your manners in the face of so much villainy thank you kind sir said drool in edmund the bastards voice pitchperfect dripping with evil thats unbloodysettling said kent pocket think you could see about liberating me i lost feeling in my hands a good hour ago and it wont go well for holding a sword if they have to be cut off from gangrene aye ill see to it said i let regan vent some venom on her father then ill go see her for the key she quite fancies me you know youve weed on yourself aint ya said drool back in his own voice but with a bit of a welsh accent no doubt to comfort the disguised kent hours ago and twice since said kent i does that sometime in the night when its cold or its too far to the privy im just old and my bladders shrunk to the size of a walnut ive started a war said i since we seemed to be sharing privacies kent struggled in the stocks to look at me whats this from keyto weeto ive started a bloody war without so much as a byyourleave im bewildered pocket aye which concerns me as you lot are my army smashing said drool the earl of gloucester came himself to release kent im sorry good man you know i would not have allowed this but once cornwall has set his mind i heard you try said kent the two had been friends in a former life but now kent lean and darkhaired looked younger and more than a measure dangerous while the weeks had weighed like years on gloucester he was near feeble and struggled with the heavy key to the stocks i took it from him gently and worked the lock and you fool ill not have you chiding edmund for his bastardy hes no longer a bastard then you married his mother congratulations good earl no his mother is long dead his legitimacy comes from the treachery of my other son edgar who betrayed me how so i asked knowing full well how he planned to take my lands from me and hasten me to the grave this was not what i had written in the letter certainly the lands would be forfeit but there had been no mention of murder of the old man this was edmunds doing what have you done to anger our father said drool pitchperfect in edmunds voice we all turned and stared at the great oaf the wrongsized voice coming from his cavernous mouth i have done nothing said drool in another voice edgar said gloucester indeed it was edgars voice i tensed at what might come next arm yourself and hide the bastards voice said father has it in his mind that you have committed some offense and he has ordered guards to seize you what said gloucester what dodgy magic is this then the bastards voice again i have consulted the constellations and they foretell of our father going mad and hunting you at that point i clamped my hand over drools mouth its nothing my lord said i the natural is not right in his mind fever methinks he mimics voices but not intent his thoughts are a jumble but those were the very voices of my sons said gloucester aye but only in sound only in sound like a jabbering bird is the great fool if you have quarters where i might take him and the kings most favored fool and abused servant added kent rubbing at the rash on his wrists left from the stocks gloucester considered a moment you good fellow have been wrongly punished gonerils steward oswald is less than honorable and while i find it a mystery lear does love his black fool theres an unused solar in the north tower it leaks but it will be out of the wind and close to your master who will have quarters in the same wing aye thank you good lord said i the natural needs tending well wrap him in blankets then ill run down to the chemist for a leech we hustled drool into the tower and kent closed the heavy door and bolted it there was one cathedral window with cracked shutters and two arrow loops all set in alcoves with tapestries pulled aside and tied to allow in the little light we could see our breath in the winter air drop those tapestries said kent well go grab some candles first said i itll be dark as nyxs nyxgreek goddess of the night bunghole once we pull the tapestries kent left the solar and returned a few minutes later with a heavy iron candelabra with three lit candles a chambermaid is bringing us a brazier of charcoal and some bread and ale said the knight old gloucesters a good sod and survivor enough not to speak his mind to the king about his daughters said i ive learned some said kent aye i turned to the natural who was playing with the wax dripping off the thick candles drool what was it you were saying that bit with edmund and edgar plotting i dont know pocket i just says it i dont know whats said but lord edmund beats me when i talk in his voice im an insult to nature and should be punished says he kent shook his head like a great hound clearing his ears of water what sort of convoluted wickedness have you set in motion pocket me this isnt my doing this villainy is authored by that blackguard edmund but it will work for our plan the conversations between edgar and edmund lie on the shelves of drools mind like forgotten volumes in a library we need only prompt the git to open them now to it drool say the words of edgar when edmund advises him to hide and so we pried events out of drools memory using cues like a cats paw cats pawa small crowbar often used by thieves to jimmy windows open and by the time we had warmed ourselves over the brazier and eaten our bread we saw the pieces of edmunds treachery played out as in the voices of the original players so edmund wounded himself and claimed that edgar did it said kent why didnt he simply slay his brother he needs to assure his inheritance first and a knife to the back would have been suspect said i besides edgar is a formidable fighteri dont think edmund would face him a traitor and a coward said kent and those are his assets said i or we shall use them thus i patted drools shoulder softly good lad excellent foolcraft now i need you to see if you can say what i say in the voice of the bastard aye pocket ill give it a go i said oh my sweet lady regan thou art more fair than moonlight more radiant than the sun more glorious than all the stars i must have you or i shall surely die in a wink drool repeated my words back to me in the voice of edmund of gloucester the intonation and desperation in the perfect key to unlock regans affections or so id wager howzat asked the git excellent said i uncanny said kent how is it that edmund let the natural live he must know he bears witness to his treachery that is an excellent question lets go ask him shall we it occurred to me as we made our way to edmunds quarters that since i had seen the bastard the power of my protection being king lear had waned somewhat while edmunds influence and therefore immunity had expanded when he became heir to gloucester in short the deterrents to keep the bastard from murdering me had all but evaporated i had only kents sword and edmunds fear of ghostly retribution to protect me the witches pouch of puffballs weighed heavily as a weapon however a squire showed me to an antechamber off castle gloucesters great hall his lordship will receive only you fool said the squire kent looked ready to bully the boy but i held up a hand to stay him ill see that the door is left unlatched good caius if i should call please enter and dispatch the bastard with lethal vigor i grinned at the spotfaced squire unlikely said i edmund holds me in very high esteem and i him there will be little time between compliments to discuss business i breezed by the young knight and into the chamber where edmund was alone sitting at a writing desk i said thou scaly scalawag of a corpsegorged carrion worm cease your feast on the bodies of your betters and receive the black fool before vengeful spirits come to wrench the twisted soul from your body and drag it into the darkest depths of hell for your treachery oh well spoken fool said edmund you think so oh yes im cut to the quick i may never recover completely impromptu said i with time and polishwell i could go out and return with a keener edge on it perish the thought said the bastard take a moment to catch your breath and revel in your rhetorical mastery and achievement he gestured toward a highbacked chair across from him thank you i will still tiny though i see said the bastard well yes nature being the recalcitrant twat that she is and still weak i presume not of will of course not i referred simply to your willowy limbs oh yes in that case im a bit of a soggy kitten splendid here to be murdered then are you not immediately uh edmund if you dont mind my saying youre being offputtingly pleasant today thank you ive adopted a strategy of pleasantness it turns out that one can perpetrate all manner of heinous villainy under a cloak of courtesy and good cheer edmund leaned over the desk now as if to take me into his most intimate confidence it seems a man will forfeit all sensible selfinterest if he finds you affable enough to share your company over a flagon of ale so youre being pleasant yes its unseemly of course so youve received the dispatch from goneril oswald gave it to me two days ago and i asked evidently the lady fancies me and how do you feel about that well who could blame her really especially now that im both pleasant and handsome i should have cut your throat when i had the chance said i ah well water under the bridge isnt it excellent plan with the letter to discredit my brother edgar by the way went smashingly of course i embellished somewhat improvised if you will i know said i implied patricide and the odd selfinflicted wound i nodded toward his bandaged sword arm oh yes the natural talks to you doesnt he curious then why is that bloody great oaf still drawing breath knowing what he does about your plans fear of ghosts is it for the first time edmund let his pleasant and insincere grin falter well there is that but also i quite enjoy beating him and when im not beating him having him around makes me feel more clever you simple bastard drool makes anvils feel more clever how bloody common of you that did it pretense of pleasantness fell when it came to questions of class evidently edmunds hand dropped below the table and came up with a long fighting dagger but alas i was already in the process of swinging down hard with joness stick end and struck the bastard on his bandaged forearm the blade went spinning in such a way that i was able to kick the hilt as it hit the floor and flip it up into my own waiting weapon hand to be fair that is right or left whether it was the juggling or the pickpocket training of belette i am agile with either hand i flipped the blade and held it ready for a throw sit youre exactly a halfturn from hell edmund do twitch please do hed seen me perform with my knives at court and knew my skill the bastard sat cradling his hurt arm as he did so blood was seeping through the bandage he spat at me and missed ill have you ah ah ah said i brandishing the blade pleasant edmund growled but stopped as kent stormed into the room knocking the door back on its hinges his sword was drawn and two young squires were drawing theirs as they followed him kent turned and smashed the lead squire in the forehead with the hilt of his own weapon knocking the boy backward off his feet quite unconscious then kent spun and swept the feet out from under the other with the flat of his sword and the lad landed on his back with an explosion of breath the old knight drew back to thrust through the squires heart hold said i dont kill him kent held and looked up assessing the situation for the first time i heard a blade clang i thought the villain was murdering you no he gave me this lovely dragonhilted dagger as a peace offering that is not true said the bastard so said kent paying particular attention to my readied weapon youre murdering the bastard then merely testing the weapons balance good knight oh sorry no worries thank you ill call you if i need you take that unconscious one with you would you i looked at the other who trembled on the floor edmund do instruct your knights to be pleasant toward my ruffian he is a favorite of the king let him alone grumbled edmund kent and the conscious squire dragged the other one out of the chamber and closed the door youre right this being pleasant is the dogs bollocks edmund i flipped the dagger and caught it by the hilt when edmund made as if to move i flipped it again and caught it by the blade i raised a suspicious eyebrow at him so you were saying about how well my plan had worked edgar is branded a traitor even now my fathers knights hunt him i will be lord of gloucester but really edmund is that enough exactly said the bastard uh exactly what had he already set his sights on albanys lands not even having spoken with goneril now i was doubly unsure of what to do my own plan to pair the bastard with goneril and undermine the kingdom was the only thing keeping me from sending the dagger to his throat and when i thought of the lash marks on poor drools back my hand quivered wanting to loose the knife to its mark but what had he set his sights on the spoils of war can be as great as a kingdom said edmund war how knew he of war my war aye fool war fuckstockings said i i let the knife fly and ran out of the room bells jingling as i approached our tower i heard what sounded like someone torturing an elk in a tempest i thought that edmund might have sent an assassin for drool after all so i came through the door low with one of my daggers at the ready drool lay on his back on a blanket a goldenhaired woman with a white gown spread around her hips was riding him as if competing in the nitwit steeplechase id seen her before but never so solid the two were wailing in ecstasy drool what are you doing pretty said drool a great joyous goofy grin on him aye shes a vision lad but youre knobbing a ghost no the dim giant paused in his upward thrusting lifted her by her waist and looked closely at her as if hed found a flea in his bed ghost she nodded drool tossed her aside and with a long shuddering scream ran to the window and dove through shattering the shutters as he went the scream trailed off and ended with a splash the ghost pulled her gown down tossed her hair out of her face and grinned water in the moat she said hell be fine guess ill be going away halfcocked though well yes but jolly good of you to take time from chain rattling and delivering portents of bloody doom to shag the beefbrained boy not up for a spirity tumble yourself then she made as if to lift her gown above her hips again piss off wisp ive got to go fish the git out of the moat he cant swim not keen on flight neither evidently no time for this i sheathed my dagger wheeled on my heel and started out the door not your war fool said the ghost i stopped drool was slow at most things perhaps he would be so at drowning the bastard has his own war aye the ghost nodded fading back to mist as she moved a fools best plan plays out to chance but a bastards hope arrives from france thou loquacious fog thou nattering mist thou serpenttongued steam for the love of truth speak straight and no sodding rhyme but in that moment she was gone who are you i shouted to the empty tower fourteen on tender horns i shagged a ghost said drool wet naked and forlorn sitting in the laundry cauldron under castle gloucester theres always a bloody ghost said the laundress who was scrubbing the louts clothes which had been most befouled in the moat it had taken four of lears men along with me to pull the great git from the stinking soup no excuse for it really said i youve the lake on three sides of the castle you could open the moat to the lake and the offal and stink would be carried away with the current ill wager that one day they find that stagnant water leads to disease breeds hostile water sprites ill wager blimey youre longwinded for such a wee fellow said the laundress gifted i explained gesturing grandly with jones i too was naked but for my hat and puppet stick my own apparel having taken a glazing of oozy moat mess during the rescue as well sound the alarm kent came storming down the steps into the laundry sword unsheathed and followed closely by the two young squires hed trounced not an hour before bolt the door to arms fool hello said i youre naked said kent once again feeling the need to voice the obvious aye said i find the fools kit lads and get him into it wolves are loosed on the fold and we must defend stop said i the squires stopped thrashing wildly around the laundry and stood at attention excellent now caius what are you on about i shagged a ghost said drool to the young squires they pretended they couldnt hear him kent shuffled forward held back some by the alabaster grandeur of my nakedness edmund was found with a dagger through his ear pinned to a highbacked chair bloody careless eater he is then twas you who put him there pocket and you know it moi look at me i am small weak and common i could never hes called for your head he hunts the castle for you even now said kent i swear i saw steam coming out his nostrils not going to spoil the yule celebration is he yule yule yule chanted drool pocket can we go see phyllis can we aye lad if theres a pawnbroker in gloucester ill take you soon as your kit is dry kent raised a startled porcupine of an eyebrow what is he on about every yule i take drool down to phyllis steins pawnshop in london and let him sing happy birthday to jesus then blow the candles out on the menorah but the yules a pagan holiday said one of the squires shut up you twat do you want to ruin the twits fun why are you here anyway arent you edmunds men shouldnt you be trying to put my head on a pike or something theyve changed allegiance to me said kent after the thrashing i gave them aye said squire one weve more to learn from this good knight aye said squire two and we were edgars men anyway lord edmund is a scoundrel if you dont mind me saying sir and dear caius said i do they know that you are a penniless commoner and cant really maintain a fighting force as if you were sayoh i dont knowthe earl of kent excellent point pocket said kent good sirs i must release you from your service so we wont be paid then my regrets no oh then well take our leave fare thee well keep your guard up lads said kent fightings done with the whole body not only the sword the two squires left the laundry with a bow will they tell edmund where were hiding i asked i think not but you better get your kit on just the same laundress how progresses my motley steamin by the fire sir dry enough to wear indoors i reckon did i hear it right that you put a dagger through lord edmunds ear what a mere fool no silly girl im harmless a jab from the wit a poke to the pride are the only injuries a fool inflicts shame said the laundress he deserves that and worse for how he treats your dim friend she looked away and others why didnt you just kill the scoundrel outright pocket asked kent kicking subtlety senseless and rolling it up in a rug well just shout it out will you you great lummox aye like youd never do such a thing top of the morning grim weather were having ive started a bloody war edmund has his own war see you did it again i was coming to tell you when i found the girl ghost having a go at drool then the lout leapt out the window and the rescue was on the ghost implied that the bastard might be rescued by france maybe hes allied with bloody king jeff to invade ghosts are notoriously unreliable said kent did you ever consider that you might be mad and hallucinating the whole thing drool did you see this ghost aye i had a half a laugh wif her before i got frightened said drool sadly contemplating his tackle through the steamy water i fink i gots deaf on me willie laundress help the lad wash the death off his willie would you not bloody likely said she i held the tip of my coxcomb to stay any jingling and bowed my head to show my sincerity really love ask yourself what would jesus do if he had smashing knockers added drool dont help sorry war murder treachery reminded kent our plan aye right said i if edmund has his own war it will completely bollocks up our plans for civil war between albany and cornwall all well and good but you didnt answer my question why didnt you just slay the bastard he moved so you meant to kill him well i hadnt thought it through completely but when i sent his dagger at his eye socket i believed that there might be a fatal outcome and i must say although i didnt stay to revel in the moment it was very satisfying lear says that killing takes the place of bonking in the ancient youve killed a multitude of chaps kent do you find that to be the case no thats a disgusting thought and yet with lear lies your loyalty im beginning to wonder said kent sitting down now on an overturned wooden tub who do i serve why am i here you are here because in the expanding ethical ambiguity of our situation you are steadfast in your righteousness it is to you my banished friend that we all turna light amid the dark dealings of family and politics you are the moral backbone on which the rest of us hang our bloody bits without you we are merely wiggly masses of desire writhing in our own devious bile really asked the old knight aye said i im not sure i want to keep company with you lot then not like anyone else will have you is it i need to see regan before my bastard ear piercing poisons our cause will you take her a message kenter caius will you put on your trousers or at least your codpiece oh i suppose that had always been part of the plan then i will bear your message to the duchess tell herno ask herif she still holds the candle she promised for pocket then ask her if i may meet her somewhere private im off then but try to manage not to get murdered while im gone fool kitten said i you poxy little vermin said regan in glorious red what do you want kent had led me to a chamber far in the bowels of the castle i couldnt believe that gloucester would house royal guests in an abandoned dungeon regan must have somehow found her own way here she had an affinity for such places you received the letter from goneril then i asked yes what is it to you fool the lady confided in me said i bouncing my eyebrows and displaying a charming grin what is your thought why would i want to dismiss fathers knights let alone take them into my service we have a small army at cornwall well youre not at cornwall are you love what are you saying fool im saying that your sister bade you come to gloucester to intercept lear and his retinue and thus stop him from going to cornwall and my lord and i came with great haste and with a very small force correct yes the message said it was urgent we needed to move quickly so when goneril and albany arrive you will be away from your castle and nearly defenseless she wouldnt dare let me ask you lady where do you think the earl of gloucesters allegiance lies he is our ally he has opened his castle to us gloucester who was nearly usurped by his eldest sonyou think he sides with you well with father then which is the same thing unless lear is aligned with goneril against you but she relieved him of his knights he ranted about it for an hour after his arrival called goneril every foul name under the sun and praised me for my sweetness and loyalty even overlooking my throwing his messenger into the stocks i said nothing i removed my coxcomb scratched my head and sat on some dusty instrument of torture to observe the lady by torchlight and watch her eyes as the rust ground off the twisted gears of her mind she was simply lovely i thought about what the anchoress had said about a wise man only expecting so much perfection in something as its nature allows i thought that i might indeed be witnessing the perfect machine her eyes went wide when the realization hit that bitch aye said i theyll have it all she and father aye said i i could tell her anger didnt arise from the betrayal but from not having thought of it first you need an ally lady and one with more influence than this humble fool can provide tell me what do you think of edmund the bastard hes fit enough i suppose she chewed a fingernail and concentrated id shag him if my lord wouldnt murder himor come to think of it maybe because he would perfect said i oh regan patron saint of priapus priapusa greek god whose lust was so strong he was cursed with a permanent erection that was so large he was unable to move the medical condition priapism is named for him the most slippery of the sisters in disposition preciously oily in discourse deliciously dry my venomous virago my sensuous charmer of serpentsthou art truly perfection did i love her of course for even though i have been accused of being an egregious hornbeast my horns are tender like the snailsand never have i hoisted the horns of lust without ive taken a prod from cupids barb as well i have loved them all with all my heart and have learned many of their names regan perfect regan oh yes i loved her she was a beauty to be surethere was none in the kingdom more fair a face that could inspire poetry and a body that inspired lust longing larceny treachery perhaps even war i am not without hope men had murdered each other in competition for her favorsit was a hobby with her husband cornwall and to her credit while she could smile as a bloke bled to death with her name on his lips she was not tightfisted with her charms it only added to the tension around her that someone was going to be shagged silly in the near future and how much more thrilling if his life hung by a thread as he did the deed in fact the promise of violent death might be to the princess regan like the nectar of aphrodite herself now that i think of it why else would she have called for my death all those years ago when i had so diligently served her after goneril had left the white tower to wed albany it had begun it seems with a bit of jealousy pocket said regan she was perhaps eighteen or nineteen at the time but unlike goneril had been exploring her womanly powers for years on various lads about the castle i find it offensive that you gave personal counsel to my sister yet when i call you to my chambers i get nothing but tumbling and singing aye but a song and a tumble seem all thats needed to lift the ladys spirits if i may say so you may not am i not fair extremely so lady shall i compose a rhyme to your beauty a ravishing tart from nantucket am i not as fair as goneril next to you she is less than invisible just a shimmering envious vacuum is she but do you pocket find me attractivein a carnal waythe way you did my sister do you want me ah of course lady from the morning i wake i have but one thought one vision of your deliciousness under this humble and unworthy fool writhing naked and making monkey noises really thats all you think about aye and occasionally breakfast but its only seconds before im back to regan writhing and monkey noises wouldnt you like to have a monkey we should have one around the castle dont you think so all you think of is this and with that she shrugged off her gown red as always and there she stood ravenhaired and violeteyed snowy fair and finely fit as if carved by the gods from a solid block of desire she stepped out of the pool of bloodred velvet and said drop your puppet stick fool and come here and i ever the obedient fool did and oh it led to many months of clandestine monkey noises howling grunting screeching yipping squishing slapping laughing and no little bit of barking but there was no flinging of poo as monkeys are wont to do only the most decent forthright monkey sounds as are made from proper bonking i put my heart into it too but the romance was soon crushed beneath her cruel and delicate heel i suppose i shall never learn it seems a fool is not so often taken as a medicine for melancholy as for ennui incurable and recurring among the privileged youve been spending a lot of time with cordelia of late said regan basking glorious in the gentle glow of the afterbonk your narrator in a sweaty puddle on the bedside floor having been summarily ejected after rendering noble service i am jealous shes a little girl said i but when she has you i cannot shes my junior its not acceptable but lady its my duty to keep the little princess smiling your father has commanded it besides if i am otherwise engaged you can have that sturdy fellow you fancy from the stable or that young yeoman with the pointy beard or that spanish duke or whatever he is thats been about the castle for a month does that bloke speak a word of english i think he may be lost they are not the same i felt my heart warm at her words could it be real affection well yes what we share is they rut like goatstheres no art to it and i weary of shouting instructions to them especially the spaniardi dont think he speaks a word of english im sorry milady said i but that said i must away i stood and gathered my jerkin from under the wardrobe my leggings from the hearth my codpiece from the chandelier ive promised to teach cordelia about griffins and elves over tea with her dolls youll not said regan i must said i i want you to stay alas parting is such sweet sorrow said i and i kissed the downy dimple at the small of her back guard called regan pardon i inquired guard the door to her solar opened and an alarmed yeoman looked in seize this scoundrel he hath ravaged your princess she had conjured tears in that short span of time a bit of a wonder she was fuckstockings said i as two stout yeomen took me by the arms and dragged me down to the great hall in regans wake her dressing gown open and flowing out behind her as she wailed it seemed a familiar motif yet i did not feel the confidence that comes with rehearsal perhaps it was that lear was actually holding court before the people when we entered the great hall a line of peasants merchants and minor noblemen waited as the king heard their cases and made judgments still in his christian phase he had been reading about the wisdom of solomon and had been experimenting with the rule of law thinking it quaint father i insist you hang this fool immediately lear was taken aback not only by the shrillness of his daughters demand but by the fact that she stood frontally bare to all the petitioners and made no effort to close her red gown tales would be told of that day of how many a plaintiff having seen the snowyskinned princess in all her glory did hold his grievance pitiful indeed his life worthless and went home to beat his wife or drown himself in the mill pond father your fool hath violated me thats a fluttering bottle of bat wank sire said i begging your pardon you speak rashly daughter and you appear frothingdog mad calm yourself and state your grievance how hath my fool offended he hath shagged me roughly against my will and finished too soon by force pocket he isnt eight stone on a feast dayhe couldnt shag a cat by force thats not true sire said i if the cat is distracted with a trout thenwell uh nevermind he violated my virtue and spoiled my virginity said regan i insist you hang himhang him twice the second time before hes finished choking from the firstthatll be fitting justice i said what has put vengeance in your blood princess i was just going to tea with cordelia since the little one wasnt present i hoped invoking her name might awaken the king to my cause but it only seemed to incense regan forced me down and used me like a common tart said regan adding rather more pantomime than the petitioners in the hall could bear several began to beat their fists to their heads others grabbed at their groins and sank to their knees no said i ive had many a wench by stealth a few by guile a number by charm a brace by mistake the odd harlot for coin and when all else has failed ive made do by begging but by gods blood none by force enough said lear ill hear no more regan close your robe as i have decreed we are a kingdom of laws there shall be a trial and if the rascal is found guilty then ill see him hanged twice myself make way for a trial now asked the scribe yes now said lear what do we need a couple of chaps to do the prosecuting and defending grab a few of those peasants for witnesses and with due process habeas corpus fair weather and whatnot well have the fool dangling blacktongued before tea will that suit you daughter regan closed her robe and turned away coyly i suppose and you fool lear winked at me none too subtly aye majesty a jury perhaps chosen from that same group as the witnesses well one has to make an effort from their reaction i would be acquitted on a who could blame him basis justifiable shaggicide theyd call it but no no said the king bailiff read the charges the bailiff obviously hadnt written up charges so he unrolled a scroll on which was written something entirely unconnected to my case and faked it the crown states that on this day october fourteenth year of our lord one thousand two hundred and eightyeight the fool known as pocket did with forethought and malice shag the virgin princess regan there was cheering from the gallery a little scoffing from the court there was no malice said i without malice then said the bailiff at this point the magistrate who normally functioned as a castle steward whispered to the bailiff who normally was the chamberlain the magistrate wishes to know how was that twas sweet yet nasty your honor note that the accused hath stated that it was sweet and nasty thereby admitting his guilt more cheering wait i wasnt ready smell him said regan he reeks of sex like fish and mushroom and sweat doesnt he one of the peasant witnesses ran forth and sniffed my bits mercilessly then looked to the king nodding aye your honor said i im sure i have an odor about me i must confess i was sans trou today in the kitchen while awaiting my laundry and bubble had left a casserole out on the floor to cool and it did trip me and i fell prickdeep in gravy and goobut i was on my way to chapel at the time you put your dick in my lunch said lear then to the bailiff the fool put his dick in my lunch no in your beloved daughter said regan quiet girl barked the king captain curan send a guard to watch the bread and cheese before the fool has his way with it it went on like that with things looking rather grim for me as the evidence mounted against me peasants taking the opportunity to describe the most lecherous acts they could imagine a wicked fool might perpetrate on an unsuspecting princess i thought testimony of the sturdy stable boy particularly damning at first but eventually it led to my acquittal read that back so the king may hear the true heinous nature of the crime said my prosecutor who i believe butchered cattle for the castle as his normal vocation the scribe read the stable boys words yes yes yes ride me you crashing treecocked stallion thats not what she said said i yes it is its what she always says said the scribe aye said the steward aye it is said the priest sí said the spaniard well she never says that to me said i oh said the stable boy then its prance you twigdicked little pony is it possibly said i she never says that to me said the yeoman with the pointy beard then there was a moment of silence while all who had spoken looked around at one another then furiously avoided eye contact and found spots on the floor of great interest well said regan chewing a fingernail as she spoke there is a chance that uh i was having a dream then the fool did not take your virtue asked lear sorry said regan sheepishly it was but a dream no more wine at lunch for me release the fool said lear the crowd booed i walked out of the hall side by side with regan he might have hung me i whispered id have shed a tear said she with a smile really woe to you lady should you leave that rosebud asterisk of a bumhole unguarded on our next meeting when a fools surprise comes unbuttered a pockets pleasure will a princess punish oooo do tease fool shall i put a candle in it so you can find your way harpy rascal pocket where have you been said cordelia who was coming down the corridor your tea has gone cold defending big sisters honor sweetness said i oh bollocks said regan pocket dresses the fool but he is ever our hero isnt he regan said cordelia i think im going to be ill said the elder princess so love said i rising from my perch on the torture machine and reaching into my jerkin im pleased you feel that way about lord edmund for he has sent me with this letter i handed her the letter the seal was dodgy but she wasnt looking at the stationery hes smitten with you regan in fact so smitten he tried to cut off his own ear to deliver with this missive to show you the depth of his affection really his ear say nothing at the yule feast tonight lady but youll see the bandage mark it as a tribute of his love you saw him cut his ear yes and stopped him before the deed was done was it painful do you think oh yes lady he has already suffered more than have others in months of knowing you thats so sweet do you know what the letter says i was sworn not to look upon pain of death but come close she leaned close to me and i squeezed the witchs puffball under her nose i believe it speaks of a midnight rendezvous with edmund of gloucester fifteen in a lovers eye a warm wind blew in from the west completely cocking up the yule druids like snow round stonehenge during the festival and burning down the forest is all the more satisfying if theres a chill in the air as it was it looked like wed have rain for the feast the clouds rolling over the horizon looked like theyd been born of a summer storm them look like summer storm clouds said kent we were hiding in the barbican above the gate looking out over the walled village of gloucester and the hills beyond id been hiding since my encounter with edmund evidently the bastard was somewhat put out with me we could see goneril and her train entering the outer gates she rode with a dozen soldiers and attendants but noticeably the duke of albany was not with her a sentry on the wall called out the approach of the duchess of albany gloucester and edmund appeared in the courtyard followed by regan and cornwall regan was working to keep her eyes off of edmunds bandaged ear this should be interesting said i they swarm like vultures over a corpse britains the corpse said kent and we baited her to be torn apart nonsense kent lears the corpse but ambitious scavengers do not wait for his death to begin their dining youve a deeply wicked side pocket truth has a deeply wicked side kent theres the king said kent no one attends him i should go to him lear shuffled into the courtyard wearing his heavy fur cape like looking down on a lubricious chess set isnt it the king moves in tiny steps with no direction like a drunkard trying to avoid the archers bolt the others work their strategies and wait for the old man to fall he has no power yet all power moves in his orbit and to his mad whim do you know that theres no fool piece on the chessboard kent methinks the fool is the player the mind above the moves well thats a scratchy spot of cat wank i turned to the old knight but bloody well said go to lear then edmund wont dare molest you and cornwall must pretend some contrition for throwing you into the stocks the princesses will be burning bright for edmunds eye and gloucesterwell gloucester proffers hospitality before jackals he is well occupied what will you do i seem to have rendered myself undesirable as impossible as that sounds i need to find us a spysomeone more stealthy devious and underhanded than my own sweet nature allows good luck with that said kent i loathe you i despise you i curse your existence and the foul demons that spawned you you sicken me with anger and bilious hatred oswald said i youre looking well drool and i had intercepted him in a corridor there is an unwritten edict that when negotiating with an enemy one does not reveal his knowledge of that enemys agenda even unto death its a point of honor of sorts but i see it as petty playacting and i had no intention of indulging in it with oswald yet i had need of his spidery talents so some finesse was required i would give an arm to see you hang fool said oswald oh an excellent starting point said i dont you think drool aye pocket said drool who loomed between oswald and me a thick table leg unsuccessfully concealed behind his back oswald might make as to draw his sword but drool would have beaten his brains into bloody marmalade before the blade cleared its scabbard unspoken but understood smashing good start said the giant so oswald let us go from there say you get what you want say you lose an arm and i am hanged how then is life better for your fine self your quarters more comfortable wine taste better will it its unlikely but lets explore the possibilities shall we very well said i you first sever an arm and drool here will hang me you have my word you have my word said drool in my voice stop wasting my time fool my lady is arriving and i need to go to her ah theres the rub oswald what you want what do you really want you could never know your ladys approval i have that ah thats right your ladys love oswald became still then as if i had taken the breath from the corridor in which we stood to prove such was not the case i pressed on you want your ladys love her respect her power her submission her bottom in the air before you her begging for satisfaction and mercythat about it i am not so base as you fool and yet the very reason you hate me is that i have been to that place you have not she has not loved you nor respected you nor given you power you were an amusement at best yet i know the way there my coalhearted friend i know the way a servant might find such favor she could never i am of common blood oh im not saying i could make you duke only that you would be her lord in body heart and mind you know her weakness for scoundrels oswald did you yourself not pimp your lady to edmund i did not i only delivered a message and edmund is heir to an earldom just this bloody week he is and dont act as if you dont know what was in that message i have the power oswald given me by three witches in the great birnam wood to put a spell upon your lady so she will adore and desire you oswald laughed not something he did often his face was not fit for it and he looked like he had something caught in his back teeth what kind of fool do you think me out of the way and all you have to do is what your lady would have you do anyway serve her desires said i i needed to make my case quickly she is bewitched already you know you were there oswald had been backing away from drool off to find another route to the courtyard and goneril when he stopped you were there oswald at albany goneril was having a grab at my tackle and you came in youd just come through the door i heard it i had this purse in my hand i held up the silk pouch the witches had given me remember i was there and i handed your lady a letter and said it was from edmund of gloucester remember aye and she dumped you on your arse right you are and sent you here to deliver a message to edmund had she ever made a note of the bastard before oswald you are with her nearly every waking moment had she noted him before no not once she gave some notice to edgar but not the bastard exactly she is bewitched to love edmund and i can do the same for you youll die a frustrated toady any other way oswald ive one more spell left oswald took careful steps back to me like he was walking a wire rather than the stone floor of a castle corridor why wouldnt you use it for yourself well for one you would know and i presume you would not be slow to inform lord albany who would quickly have me hanged and second i had three such spells and i have used one for myself already not the duchess of cornwall i could tell oswald was aghast at the idea yet there was an excitement in his eye i showed him a sly grin and flicked the bells of my hat with jones ive a rendezvous with her this very night after the yule feastmidnight in the abandoned north tower you dastardly little monster oh sod off oswald would you have a princess of your own or not what do i have to do almost nothing said i but it will take some strength of character for you to see this through first you must counsel your lady to keep peace with her sister and convince her to relieve lear of the remainder of his force then you must have your lady rendezvous with edmund at the second bell of the watch two in the bloody morning watch how she leaps at the chance shes bewitched remember it is critical that she ally herself with the house of gloucester even if it is in secret i know that will be difficult for you but you must endure it if you are going to have the lady and her power someone will have to dispatch the duke of albanysomeone who will be of no loss when hanged the bastard edmund is perfect for the part is he not oswald nodded his eyes getting larger with my every word his whole life he had carried messages and run errands for goneril but at last he could see reward in sight for being intrigues pawn fortunately the possibility blinded him to reason when will the lady be mine when all is in place catchfart when all is in place what do you know of a military force coming from france why nothing then skulk and eavesdrop edmund knows of such a force or he has constructed a rumor find out what you can find out but do not speak to edmund of his rendezvous with your lady he thinks it a secret oswald stood to his full height hed been bending over to talk facetoface with me what do you gain from this fool i had hoped he wouldnt ask like you even with love there are those who would stand in the way of my happiness i need you and those affected by your deeds to help them out of my way you would kill the duke of cornwall he is one but no matter who loves me i am bound to leari am his slave so you would kill the king too no worries fool i can do that you have a deal fuckstockings said i jolly good show pocket said kent go looking for a messenger and end up setting a bloody assassin loose on the king a born diplomat you are sarcasm is very unattractive in the elderly kent i couldnt very well call him off my sincerity would have been questioned you werent being sincere well conviction then just stay by lear during the yule feast and dont let him eat anything unless youve eaten it first if i know oswald hell try to slay the king using the most cowardly means or not at all what what makes you think oswald was telling you the truth any more than you were telling it to him im counting on his lying to a degree but to what degree i paced in a circle around our little tower room what a wimpled wagon of nun wank this is id rather juggle fire blindfolded im not built for these dark dealingsim better suited for laughter childrens birthdays baby animals and friendly bonking the sodding witches got it wrong and yet youve set a civil war in motion and sent an assassin after the king said kent grand ambition for a childrens birthday clown dont you think youve become bitter in your dotage you know well perhaps my duties as food taster will end my bitterness just keep the old man alive kent since the yule feast is still on i take it dear regan didnt tell lear that she was taking his knights yet the lady tried to make peace between goneril and her father she only served to calm the old man enough that he agreed to come to the feast good no doubt shell make her move on the morrow i grinned if shes well enough wicked said kent justice said i regan came up the spiral stairs alone the single candle she carried in a storm lantern cast her shadow tall up the stone wall like the very specter of a shaggable death i stood outside the solar door candelabra in one hand the door latch in the other happy christmas kitten said i well that feast was complete crap wasnt it bloody gloucester pagan twat calling it the feast of st stephen instead of christmas theres no presents on the feast of bloody stephen without presents id rather celebrate yule for the winter solstice at least then you get to sacrifice a pig and build a cracking huge fire gloucester was being deferential to your christian beliefs as it was love the holiday is saturnalia saturnaliathe celebration of the winter solstice in the roman pantheon paying tribute to saturn the sower of seeds celebration of saturnalia involved much drunkenness and indiscriminate shagging observed in modern times by the ritual of the office christmas party for him and edmund proper orgy it is so perhaps theres a present for you yet to be unwrapped she smiled then perhaps edmund was so coy at the feastbarely looking my way fear of cornwall i suppose but you were right his ear was bandaged aye lady and im to tell you that hes a bit modest about it he may not wish to be fully seen but i saw him at the feast aye but hes hinted that there may have been other selfpunishment performed in your honor and hes shy a joyous child at christmas she suddenly wasvisions of a bloke lashing himself dancing in her head oh pocket do let me in and so i did i opened the door and slipped the storm lantern from her grasp as she passed ah ah ah love no more light than that one candle hes ever so shy i heard edmunds voice say from behind the tapestry oh my sweet lady regan thou art more fair than moonlight more radiant than the sun more glorious than all the stars i must have you or i shall surely die i slowly closed and latched the door no my goddess undress there said edmunds voice let me watch you id been all evening coaching drool on what to say and exactly how to say it next he would comment on her loveliness then ask her to blow out the single candle on the table and join him behind the tapestry at which point he was to unceremoniously snog her soggy and shag her silly it sounded rather like what id guess would be the auditory effect of a bull elk trying to balance a wildcat on a redhot poker there was no little bit of yowling growling squealing and screeching going on by the time i saw the second light coming up the stairs i could see by the shadow that the lantern bearer was leading with a drawn sword oswald had been true to his treacherous nature just as i had calculated put down that blade you git youll put someones eye out the duke of cornwall rounded the stairs with blade lowered a bewildered look on his face fool what if a child was running down the stairs i said awkward explaining to gloucester why his beloved toddler grandson was wearing a yard of sheffield steel through his gizzard gloucester doesnt have a grandson said cornwall surprised i think that he was engaged in this discussion that doesnt diminish the need for basic weapons safety but im here to slay you moi said i in perfect fucking french whatever for because you are shagging my lady there was a great bellow from the tower room followed by a female feral screech was that pain or pleasure would you say i asked who is in there cornwall raised his sword again well it is your lady and she is most certainly being shagged by the bastard edmund of gloucester but prudence would have you stay your blade i laid jones across the dukes wrist and pushed his sword hand down unless you care nothing for being king of britain what are you on about fool the duke very much wanted to do some killing but his ambition was trumping his bloodlust oh ride me you great treecocked rhinoceros screamed regan from the next room she still says that i asked well usually its treecocked stallion said cornwall she does get good wear out of a metaphor i put my hand on his shoulder for comfort aye a sad surprise for you ill wager at least when a man after looking into his soul finally stoops to fuck a snake he hopes at least not to see pairs of boots already lined up outside her burrow he shook me off ill kill him cornwall you are about to be attacked even now albany prepares to take all of britain for his own youll need edmund and the forces of gloucester to prevail against him and when you do youll be king if you go in that room now you will kill a hornbeast but you will lose a kingdom gods blood said cornwall is this true win the war good sirrah then kill the bastard at your leisure when you can take your time and do it right regans honor is well malleable is it not youre sure about this war aye its why you need to take lears remaining knights and squires just as goneril and albany took the others and you mustnt let goneril know you know even now your lady is assuring gloucesters allegiance to your side really thats why shes shagging edmund it hadnt occurred to me until id said it but it really did work quite nicely oh yes my lord her enthusiasm is inspired by her fierce loyalty to you of course said cornwall sheathing his sword i should have seen it that doesnt mean you cant kill edmund when its over said i absolutely said the duke when cornwall was gone and some time after the first bell had rung for the watch i knocked on the door and peeked my head in lord edmund said i theres a stirring in the dukes tower perhaps you should say your farewells i held regans storm lantern at the crack of the door so she could find her way out and a few moments later she stumbled out of the solar with her gown on backward her hair in knots and a slick of drool running in a river between and over her breasts overall in fact she looked quite slippery she was dazed and limping in a way that seemed she couldnt quite figure which side to favor and she was dragging one shoe by its strap around her ankle lady shall i get your other shoe sod it she said waving drunkenly or what seemed like drunkenly almost falling down the stairs i steadied her helped her get her gown turned around swabbed her down a bit with her skirt then took her arm and helped her down the stairs hes quite a bit larger close up than he appears across the room that so i shant sit down for a fortnight ah sweet romance can you make it to your quarters kitten i think so youre clever pocketstart thinking of excuses for edmund if im not able to get out of bed tomorrow my pleasure kitten sleep well i made my way back upstairs where drool was standing trouserless by the candle still sporting enough of an erection to bludgeon a calf senseless sorry i came out pocket it were dark no worries lad good show she were fit aye quite whats a rhinoceros its like a unicorn with armored bollocks its a good thing chew these mint leaves and lets get you wiped down practice your edmund lines while i look for a towel when the watch rang the second bell the scene was set another storm lantern illuminated the stairs and cast a buxom shadow up the wall pumpkin what are you doing here worm just keeping watch go in but leave your lantern with me edmund is shy about the injury he has inflicted on himself in your honor goneril grinned at the prospect of the bastards pain and went in a few minutes passed before oswald crept up the stairs fool youre still alive aye i held my hand up to my ear but listen to the children of the nightwhat music they make sounds like a moose trying to shit a family of hedgehogs said the scoundrel oh thats good i was thinking more of moo cow being beaten with a flaming goose but you may have it ah whos to say we should leave good oswald and give the lovers their privacy did you not meet with princess regan oh we changed the rendezvous to the fourth bell of the watch why sixteen a storm rising the storm blew in during the night i was eating my breakfast in the kitchen when a row erupted in the courtyard i heard lear bellow and left to attend him leaving my porridge with drool kent intercepted me in the corridor so the old man lived through the night said i i slept at his door said kent where were you trying to see two princesses ruthlessly shagged and starting a civil war thank you and with no proper supper neither fine feast said kent ate till i nearly burst just to see the king went unpoisoned who is bloody st stephen anyway then i saw oswald coming down the corridor good kent go see that the daughters dont kill the king and that cornwall doesnt kill edmund and that the sisters dont kill each other and if you can help it dont kill anyone its too early for killing kent hurried off as oswald reached me so said oswald you lived through the night of course why wouldnt i i asked well because i told cornwall of your rendezvous with regan and i expected him to slay you oh for fucks sake oswald show a little guile would you the state of villainy in this castle is rubbish what with edmund being pleasant and you being straightforward whats next cornwall starts feeding orphans while bloody bluebirds fly out of his bum now lets try it again see if you can at least keep up a pretense of evil go so you lived through the night said oswald of course why wouldnt i i asked oh no reason i was worried about you i clouted oswald on the ear with jones no you nitwit id never believe youre concerned for my welfareyoure a right weasel arent you he made to reach for his sword and i hit his wrist a vicious blow with joness stick end the villain leapt back and rubbed his bruised wrist despite your incompetence our agreement stands i need you to consult with edmund give him this letter from regan i handed him the letter id written at first light regans hand was easy to duplicate she dotted her is with hearts dont break the seal it professes her devotion for him but instructs him to show no outward affection for her you must also caution him against showing any deference to your lady goneril in front of regan and because i know the intrigue confuses you let me map out your interest here edmund will dispatch your lord albany thus releasing your lady to other affections only then will we reveal to cornwall that edmund has cuckolded him with regan and the duke will dispatch the bastard at which time i will cast the love spell on goneril sending her into your own ferrety arms you could be lying i tried to have you killed why would you help me excellent question first i unlike you am not a villain therefore i can be expected to proceed with a modicum of integrity and second i wish to visit revenge on goneril for how she has treated me her younger sister cordelia and king lear i can think of no better punishment for her than pairing her with the manshaped tower of excrement that is yourself oh thats reasonable said oswald off you go then see that edmund doesnt show deference i might slay him myself for violating my lady no you wont youre a coward or had you forgotten oswald started to quiver then with anger but he did not try to reach for his sword run along mate pockets got a bumload of foolin yet to do a randy hand of wind groped the courtyard sending the sisters skirts tossing and snapping their hair in their faces kent crouched and clung to his great broadbrimmed hat to keep it from being carried away the old king held his fur cape tight around him and squinted against the dust while the duke of cornwall and earl of gloucester stood by the great gate for shelterthe duke content it seemed to let his duchess do the talking i was relieved to see that edmund was not in attendance so i danced into the courtyard bells ajingle song in heart hi ho said i everyone get a proper bonking for the saturnalia did they the two sisters looked at me blankly as if i might have been speaking chinese or dog and they had not overnight each received rousing repeated bonkings from an enormous donkeydonged nitwit gloucester looked down embarrassed i suppose over abandoning his own pantheon for st stephen and a wholly bollocks holy holiday feast cornwall sneered ah said i then a crispy biscuit baby jesus cornubloodycopia of christmas cheer was it silent night camels and wise menfrankenstein gold and myrrh all around then sodding christian harpies want to take away my knights said lear ive already lost half my train to you goneril ill not lose the rest oh yes sire said i christianity is their fault i forgot that the wind blew out of a pagan sky for you today regan stepped forward then and yes she was walking a bit bowlegged why do you need to keep fifty men father weve plenty of servants to tend to you and said goneril they will be under our charge so there will be no discord within the walls of our homes im of my sisters mind on this said regan youre always of your sisters mind said lear an original thought would crack your feeble skull like a thunderbolt you craven vulture thats the spirit sire said i treat them like bins of used nappies and watch them come around a wonder theyve turned out so delightful with fathering of that quality take them then you fleshtearing harpies would that i could drag your mother from her tomb and accuse her of most grievous adultery for you cannot be issue from my loins and treat me so i nodded and lay my head on gonerils shoulder evidently the adultery comes from mums side of the family pumpkinthe bitterness and stunning bosoms are from papa she pushed me aside despite my wisdom lear was losing all control now trembling as he shouted impotently at his daughters looking weaker and more slight with every word hear me gods if it be you that stir these daughters hearts against their father then touch me with noble anger and stain not my mans cheeks with womens weapons the water drops those arent tears on your cheeks nuncle said i its raining gloucester and cornwall looked away embarrassed for the old man kent had his hands on the kings shoulders and was trying to lead him gently out of the rain lear shrugged him off and stormed up to his daughters you unnatural hags i will have such revenges on you both that the worlder i will do such things that i dont even know yet but they will be horriblethe very terrors of the earth but ill not weep ill not even if my heart shall break into a hundred thousand shards i shall not weep o fool i shall go mad aye nuncle smashing good start youre off to i tried to put an arm around lears shoulders but he elbowed me away rescind your orders harpies or i shall leave this house he made for the great gate it is for your own good father said goneril now cease this ranting and come inside i gave you all screeched lear waving a palsied claw at regan and you took your bloody time giving it too you senile old fuck said regan she came up with that one all on her own nuncle said i looking on the bright side i will go threatened lear another step toward the gate im not having you on ill head right out that door pity said goneril shame really said regan here i go right out that gate never to return all alone ta said goneril au revoir said regan in nearly perfect fucking french i mean it the old man was actually through the gate now close it said regan but lady its not fit for man nor beast out there said gloucester fucking close it said goneril she ran forward and pushed the great iron lever by the gatehouse with all her might the heavy ironclad portcullis slammed down the points just missing the old king as they set in the ports a foot deep in the stone ill go said lear through the grate dont think i wont the sisters left the courtyard for the shelter of the castle cornwall followed them and called for gloucester to come along but this storm said gloucester watching his old friend through the bars no one should be out in this storm he brought it on himself said cornwall now come along good gloucester gloucester pulled himself away from the grate and followed cornwall into the castle leaving just kent and me standing in the rain in only our woolen cloaks kent looked tortured over the old mans fate hes alone pocket its not even noon and the sky is as dark as midnight lear is outside and alone oh buggering bugger said i i looked at the chains leading up to the top of the gatehouse the beams that protruded from the walls the crenellations at the top to protect the archers damn the anchoress and belette for my monkeytraining as an acrobat ill go with him but you have to hide drool from edmund talk to the laundress with the smashing knockers shell help she fancies the lad no matter what she says ill go get help to crank up the gate said kent not to worry you look after the natural and watch your back for edmund and oswald ill return with the old man when i can and with that i shoved jones down the back of my jerkin ran and leapt onto the massive chain spidered up it hand over hand swung up onto one of the beams that protruded from the stone above then hopped from beam to beam until i could find a handhold in the stoneand scurried up another story to the top of the wall sorry sodding fortress i shouted to kent with a wave in a wink i was over the wall and down the drawbridge chains on the other side to the ground below the old man was already at the gates of the walled village nearly disappearing amid the rain tottering out onto the heath in his fur cape looking like an ancient sodden rat act iii jesters do oft prove prophets king lear act v scene regan seventeen reigning fools hailing nutters blow wind crack your cheeks rage blow thundered lear the old man had perched himself on the top of a hill outside gloucester and was shouting into the wind like a bloody lunatic even as lightning raked the sky with whitehot claws and thunder shook me to my ribs come in from there you bloody decrepit old looney said i huddled under a holly bush nearby drenched and cold and at the end of my patience with the old man come back to gloucester and ask shelter from your daughters oh ye heartless gods send your oakcleaving thunderbolts down on me burn me with your sulfurous and lifeending fires singe my white head and reduce me to a pillar of ash strike me dead let your wrath take fiery form and smite me take me spare no violence i do not blame thee thou art not my daughters ive given you nothing and expect no quarter do your horrible pleasure direct to a poor infirm despised old man crack the sky strike me dead the old man paused as a thunderbolt split a tree on the heath with blinding fire and a noise that would send statues to shitting themselves i ran out from under my bush to the kings side come in nuncle take some shelter under a shrub if only to take the sting out of the rain i need no shelter let nature take her naked revenge fine then said i then you wont be needing this i took the old mans heavy fur cape tossed him my sodden woolen cloak and retreated to my shrubbery and the relative shelter of the heavy animal skin hey said lear bewildered go on said i crack the sky fry your old head mash your balls et cetera et cetera ill prompt you if you lose your place and off he went again mighty thor send your thunderbolts to cease this weary heart neptunes waves beat these limbs from their joints hecates claws tear my liver and sup upon my soul baal blast my bowels from their unhealthy home jupiter strew the land with my shredded muscle the old man stopped his tirade for a moment and the madness went out of his eyes he looked to me its really fucking cold out here like being struck by a bolt of the bloody obvious on the road to damascus innit nuncle i held open the great fur cloak and nodded for the old man to join me in it under my shrubbery he crept down the hill careful not to slip in the rivulets of mud and water that cascaded by and ducked under the cover with me the old man shuddered and put his skeletal arm around my shoulders rather closer than were accustomed to eh boy aye nuncle did i ever tell you that you are a very attractive man said jones poking his puppety head out of the cloak and the old man began to laugh and he laughed until his shoulders shook and the laughter broke into a jarring cough and that continued until i thought he might expectorate vital organs i caught some freezing rain in my cupped hand and held it for him to sip dont make me laugh boy im mad with grief and rage and ive no stomach for jests you should stand clear lest a thunderbolt scorch you when the gods heed my challenge nuncle begging pardon but you arrogant old tosser the gods arent going to strike you down with a thunderbolt simply because you asked them why would they accommodate you with a thunderbolt more likely a carbuncle festered and gone fatal or perhaps a thankless child or two being how the gods love their irony the cheek said lear oh yes cheeky gods they are said i and you named off a bushel of them too now if you are struck down we wont even know who to blame unless lightning brands a signature in your old hide you should have dared one then waited an hour perhaps before calling fire down from the whole lot at a go the king wiped rain out of his eyes ive set a thousand monks and nuns to pray for my forgiveness and the pagans slaughter goats by the herd for my salvation but i fear it is not enough not once did i act in the interest of my people not once did i act in the interest of my wives or my daughters mothersi have served myself as god and i find i am little forgiving be kind pocket lest you one day face the darkness as i do or in absence of kindness be drunk but nuncle said i i do not need to be cautious for the day when i become frail i am frail now and on the bright side there may be no god at all and the evil deeds youve done will be their own reward perhaps i dont even rate a righteous slaughtering sobbed lear the gods have sent these daughters to suck out my life blood it is punishment for how i treated my own father do you know how i became king pulled a sword out of a stone and slayed a dragon with it didnt you no that never happened sodding convent education buggered if i know then nuncle how did lear become king my own father i murdered him i do not deserve a noble death i was speechless i had been in service of the king over a decade and never had i heard of this the story went that old king bladud had handed the kingdom over to lear and went to athens where he learned to be a necromancer then returned to britain and died from the plague in service of the goddess minerva at the temple at bath but before i could gather my wits for a reply lightning cracked the sky illuminating a hulking creature that was making its way across the hillside toward us whats that i asked a demon said the old man the gods have sent a monster to take their revenge on me the thing was covered in slime and walking as if it had just been constructed from the very earth over which it slogged i felt for the daggers at the small of my back and pulled one from its sheath thered be no knife throwing in this downpouri wasnt even sure i could hold the blade steady for a thrust your sword lear said i draw and defend i stood and stepped out of the shelter of the shrubbery i spun jones so his stick end was at the ready and drew a flourish in the air with my dagger come hither demon pockets got a coach ride back to the underworld for thee i crouched thinking to leap aside as the thing lunged although it described the shape of a man i could see long slimy tendrils dragging from it and mud oozing off of it once it stumbled id leap on its back and see if i could cause it to fall and slide down the hillside away from the old king no let it take me said lear suddenly the old man shrugged off his fur cloak and charged at the monster his arms wide as if offering his very heart to the beast slay me ye merciless godrend this black heart from britains chest i could not stop him and the old man fell into the beasts arms but to my surprise there was no tearing of limbs or bashing of brains the thing caught the old man and lowered him gently to the ground i lowered my blade and inched forward leave him beast the thing was kneeling over lear whose eyes were rolled back in his head even as he twitched as if in a fit the beast looked at me and i saw streaks of pink through the mud the whites of its eyes help me it said help me get him to shelter i stepped forth and wiped the mud away from the things face it was a man covered with mud so thick it even ran out of his mouth and coated his teeth but a man just the same vines or rags i couldnt tell which trailed off his arms help poor tom bring him out of the cold said he i sheathed my dagger retrieved the old mans cape and helped the muddy naked bloke carry king lear into the wood it was a tiny cabin barely enough room to stand in but the fire was warm and the old woman stirred a pot that smelled of boiling meat and onions like breath of the muses it was on this dank night lear stirred now hours since we brought him in from the rain the king reclined on a pallet of straw and skins his fur cloak still steamed by the fire am i dead asked the old man nay nuncle but ye were close enough to lick deaths salty taint said i back foul fiend said the naked fellow waving at the very air before his eyes i had helped him wash away much of the mud so now he was merely filthy and mad but no longer misshapen oh poor tom is cold so cold aye we can tell that said i unless youre just a crashingly large bloke what was born with a willie the size of a raisin the fiend makes tom eat the swimming frog the tadpole lizards and ditchwateri eat cow dung for salads and swallow rats and bits of dead dogs i drink pond scum and in every village i am beaten and thrown into stocks away fiend leave poor cold tom alone blimey said i the loonies are in full bloom tonight i offered him some stewed mutton said the old woman by the fire without turning but no he had to have his frogs and cow pies right fussy eater for a naked nutter pocket said lear clawing at my arm who is that large naked chap he calls himself tom nuncle says hes pursued by the devil he must have daughters see here tom did you give all to your daughters is that what drove you mad and poor even until you are naked tom crawled across the floor until he was at lears side i was a vain and selfish servant said the nutter i slept with my mistress every night and woke thinking of putting it to her again in the morning i drank and caroused and made merry even while my half brother fought a crusade for a church for which he held no faith i took all without thought for those who had nothing now i have nothingnot a stitch not a crumb not a coin and the devil dogs me to the ends of the earth for my selfishness you see said lear only a mans cruel daughters could drive him to such a state he didnt say that you daft geezer he said he was a selfish libertine and the devil took his kit the old woman turned now aye the fools right the younger nutter has no daughters tis his own unkindness that curses him she crossed the cabin with two steaming bowls of stew and set them before us on the floor and its your own evil hounds you lear not your daughters the old woman id seen her before she was one of the crones from the great birnam wood different togs and somewhat less green but this was surely rosemary the cattoed witch lear slid to the floor and grabbed poor toms hand i have been selfish i have thought nothing of the weight of my deeds my own father i imprisoned in the temple at bath because he was a leper and later had him killed my own brother i did murder when i suspected him of bedding my queen no trial not even the honor of a challenge i had him murdered in his sleep without proof and my queen is dead too for my jealousy my kingdom is the fruit of treachery and treachery have i reaped i do not deserve to even wear clothes on my back you are true tom that you have nothing i too shall have nothing as is my just reward the old man began to tear off his clothes ripping at the collar of his shirt tearing more of his parchmentlike skin than the linen i stayed his hand held his wrists and tried to catch his eye with my own to pull him back from madness oh i have wronged my sweet cordelia the old man wailed the only one who loved me and i have wronged her my one true daughter gods tear these clothes from my back tear the meat from my bones then i felt claws clamp on my own wrists and i was pulled away from lear as if i had been drawn by heavy iron shackles let him suffer hissed the witch in my ear but i have made this pain said i lears pain is of his own making fool she said with that i felt the room spinning and i heard the voice of the girl ghost telling me to sleep sleep sweet pocket whos the muddy naked bloke snogging the kings noggin asked kent i awoke to see the old knight standing in the doorway with the earl of gloucester the storm still raged outside but by firelight i could see the naked nutter tom obedlam had wrapped himself around lear and was kissing the kings bald head as if blessing a newborn babe oh majesty said gloucester cant you find better company than this who is this rough beast he is a philosopher said lear i will talk with him poor tom obedlam is he said tom eater of tadpoles cursed and damned by demons kent looked to me and i shrugged both mad as cat herds said i i looked around for the old woman as a witness but she was gone well snap to majesty i bring news from france said kent hollandaise sauce excellent on eggs i inquired no said kent more urgent wine and cheese complement one another nicely i further queried no you rasptongued rascal france has landed an army at dover and theres rumor theyve forces hidden in other cities around the british coast ready to strike oh well that does trump the wine and cheese news then doesnt it gloucester was trying to pry tom off king lear but having a hard time doing so while keeping mud off his cloak ive sent word to the french camp at dover that lear is here said gloucester ive made the case to the kings daughters to let me bring him in from the storm but they will not relent even in my own home my power has been usurped by the duke of cornwall regan and cornwall have taken command of lears knights and with them my castle we come to bring you to a hovel at the city wall said kent when the storm breaks gloucester will send a cart to take lear to the french camp at dover no said lear let me talk to my philosopher friend in private he pawed at mad tom he knows much of how life should be lived tell me friend why is there thunder kent turned to gloucester and shrugged hes not in his right mind who can blame him said gloucester after what his daughters have donehis very flesh rising up against him i had a beloved son who conspired to murder me and just the thought of that nearly drove me mad do you nobles have any reaction to hardship besides going bloody barking and running off to eat dirt said i hitch up your bollocks and get on with it would you caius what of drool i left him hidden in the laundry but edmund will find him when his mind turns full to the task right now he is distracted by trying to avoid the sisters and conspiring with cornwall my son edmund he is still true said gloucester yes right milord said i and mind you dont trip on the honeysuckle sprouting from his bum when you next see him do you have means to get me into the castle without edmund knowing im there i suppose but i take no commands from you fool you are but a slave and an impudent one at that youre still angry over my jesting about your dead wife arent you do the fools will boomed lear his word is as mine a slight breeze then would have knocked me off my feet so shocked was i oh there was still madness glowing in the old mans eyes but so was the fire of his authority a feeble babbling wretch one moment the next a dragon deep inside the old man barked fire yes your majesty said gloucester hes a good lad said kent by way of easing the bite of lears command nuncle bring your naked madman and let us go with gloucester to this hovel by the city wall ill retrieve my nitwit apprentice from the castle and off well be to meet up with the bloody frog king jeff at dover kent rubbed my shoulder a sword in support then no thank you said i you stay with the old man get him to dover i pulled kent over by the fire and bade him bend down so i could whisper in his ear did you know that lear murdered his brother the old knights eyes went wide then narrowed as if he were in pain he gave the order oh kent thou loyal old fool eighteen kittens claws we entered castle gloucester in stealth which does not suit me as you might guess i am better suited to entering a room with a series of somersaults a clackstick rude noise and a top o the mornin to ye tossers im fitted out in bells and puppets for fucks sake all this sneaking and subterfuge was wearing on me i followed the earl of gloucester through a secret hatch in the stable and into a tunnel that passed under the moat we waded through a foot of cold water in the dark making for a slosh in my step as well as a jingle id never fit drool through the narrow passage even if i could chase the dark with a torch the tunnel opened through another hatch in the floor of the dungeon the earl took his leave in the very torture chamber where i had met regan im off to arrange the passage for your master to dover fool i still have a few servants who are true to me i felt indebted to the old man for helping me into the castle especially given his former bitterness toward me steer clear of the bastard your grace i know he is your favored son but not rightly so hes a villain dont disparage edmund fool i know your conniving ways only last evening he stood with me in protest against cornwalls treatment of the king i could tell gloucester about the letter id forged in edgars hand about the bastards plan to usurp his brother but what could he do likely hed storm into edmunds quarters and the bastard would murder him on the spot right then said i be careful my lord cornwall and regan are a fourfanged viper and if they should turn their venom on edmund you must let him go do not come to his aid lest you too are scratched with poisonous pricks my last true son shame on you fool said the earl he scoffed and hurried out of the dungeon and up the stairs i thought to prevail upon one god or another to protect the old man but if the gods were working in my favor they would continue unbidden and if they opposed there was no need to alert them to my cause it pained me but i took off my shoes and hat and tucked them into my jerkin to still the bells jones had remained back at the hovel with lear the laundry lay in the lower levels of the castle so i made my way there first the laundress with the aforementioned knockers of the smashing persuasion was hanging a basketload of shirts by the fire when i entered wheres drool love i asked hidden she said i know hes bloody hidden otherwise asking would have been superfluous wouldnt it just want me to give him up then how do i know youre not out to kill him that old knight who brought him here said not to let anyone know where he was but im here to get him out of the castle rescue him as it were aye you say that but listen you bloody tart give up the git emma said the laundress i sat down on the hearth and rested my head in my hands love ive spent the night in a storm with a witch and two raving nutters ive a brace of wars to see to as well as the summary violation of two princesses and consequent cuckolding of a pair of dukes im heartbroken aggrieved for the loss of a friend and the great drooling lummox that is my apprentice is evidently wandering the castle in search of a mortal chest wound pity a fool loveanother non sequitur may dash my brittle sanity to splinters my name is emma said the laundress im right here pocket said drool standing up in the great cauldron a pile of laundry on his head had been concealing his great empty melon as he lurked in the water knockers hided me shes a love you see said emma he keeps calling me knockers its a compliment love its disrespectful she said my names emma i will never understand women the laundress it would seem dressed in a manner that accentuated indeed celebrated her bosomsa tightly cinched waist pushing bits up until they bloomed out of a swooping necklineyet a chap notices and the lady takes offense i will never understand it you know hes a complete nitwit dont you emma just the same fine drool apologize to emma for saying how smashing her knockers are sorry about your knockers said drool bowing his head so his laundry hat dropped back into the drink satisfied emma i asked i suppose good now do you know where captain curan the commander of king lears knights might be oh yes said emma lord edmund and the duke consulted me this morning on all the military matters as they are wont to dome being a laundress and having access to all the best bloody tactics and strategies and the lot sarcasm will make your tits fall off said i will not said she her arm going to a support position its a known fact i said nodding earnestly then looking to drool who also nodded earnestly and said its a known fact note for note in my voice thats bloody spooky emma shuddered you lot can get out of my laundry very well then said i i motioned for drool to climb out of the cauldron i thank you for looking after the natural emma i wish there were something i could kill edmund she said pardon the son of a guild builder were going to marry me before i came to work here a respected man edmund took me against my will and bragged about it in the village my lad wouldnt have me then no one worth his salt will have me except the bastard and him whenever he wants tis edmund who commanded that i wear this low frock says hell set me out with the pigs if i dont give him service kill him for me but lass im just a fool a clown a small one at that theres more to you than that you blackhatted rascal ive seen them wicked daggers at your back and i can see whos pulling the strings round this castle and it aint the duke or the old king kill the bastard edmund beated me said drool and she do have smashing knockers drool well she do all right then said i taking the laundresss hand but in time weve things to accomplish first i bowed over her hand kissed it then turned on my heel and padded barefoot out of the laundry to set history heinous fuckery drool whispered to the laundress with a wink i hid drool in the gatehouse among the heavy chains that i had used for my escape when i pursued lear into the storm getting the lummox up on the wall and to the gatehouse undetected was no small task and he left a dripping trail on the stones until we gained the castle exterior but the guard was light in the tempest so most of the way we went across the top of the walls unseen my feet felt as if theyd been set in ice by the time i came back in to a fire but there was no other way drool in the tight space of the secret tunnel with his fear of the dark was not something i would wish on an enemy i found a woolen blanket and wrapped the lout in it to await my return guard my shoes and my satchel drool i made my way dodging from nook to cranny through the kitchen to the servants entrance into the great hall hoping i might get a moment with regan there the halls massive fireplace would be an enticement for the princess on such a frigid day for as much as she took to the activities of a dungeon she was drawn to heat like a cat because castle gloucester had no curtain wall even the great hall was fitted with arrow loops so the edifice might be defended at all levels from an attack by water the arrow loops while shuttered were notoriously drafty so arrases arrasestapestries and carpets hung across alcoves to cut down on drafts or preserve privacy in hamlet polonius is stabbed while hiding behind an arras were hung over the alcoves against the windthe perfect place for a fool to watch warm himself and find his moment i slipped into the room behind a brace of serving girls and into the alcove nearest the fireplace she was there by the fire in a heavy hooded black fur robe only her face revealed to the world i pulled the tapestry aside and was about to call to her when the latch was thrown on the halls main doors and the duke of cornwall entered wearing his usual finery with the red lion crest on his chest but more pointedly lears crownthe one the old man had thrown on the table that fateful night at the white tower even regan seemed startled to see it on the head of her husband my lord is it prudent to wear the crown of britain when our sister is still in the castle right right we must keep up appearances as if we dont know that albany raises an army against us cornwall took the crown off and hid it under a cushion by the hearth i am to meet edmund here and lay a plan for the dukes undoing one hopes that your sister can be kept out of harms way regan shrugged if she throws herself under destinys hooves who are we to save her brains from being pulped cornwall took her in his arms and kissed her passionately oh lady thought i push him away lest you debase your lovely lips with villainy then it occurred to me and perhaps rather later than it should have that she would no more taste villainy than a garlic eater will taste the stinking rose on another the lady had evil on her breath already even as the duke held her tight and professed his adoration of her she wiped her mouth on her sleeve behind his back she pushed the duke away when the bastard edmund entered the hall my lord said edmund only nodding to regan our plans for albany must be delayed look at this letter the duke took the parchment from edmund what said regan what what what france has landed forces he knows of unrest between ourselves and albany and has hidden forces in coastal cities all over britain regan snatched the parchment out of cornwalls hand and read it for herself this is addressed to gloucester edmund bowed in false contrition aye milady i found it in his closet and brought it here as soon as i saw its contents guard called cornwall the great doors opened and a soldier looked in bring me the earl of gloucester give no deference to his title he is a traitor i looked for a way back to the kitchen to perhaps find gloucester and warn him of the bastards treachery but edmund faced the alcove where i was hiding and there was no getting out undiscovered i opened the shutter to the arrow loop even if i could manage to wiggle through it the wall was a sheer drop to the lake below i palmed the shutter closed and latched it the latch on the main doors clanked again and i returned to the gap between the wall and the tapestry from which i saw goneril enter trailed by two soldiers who held gloucester by the arms the old man looked as if he had given up already and hung between the soldiers like a drowned man hang him said regan turning to warm her hands by the fire what is this said goneril cornwall handed her the letter and stood looking over her shoulder while she read pluck out his eyes she said making an effort not to look at gloucester cornwall took the letter gently from her hand and put his hand on her shoulder in brotherly support leave him to our displeasure sister edmund keep our sister company and see her safely home lady tell your duke we must unite against this foreign force well send dispatches quickly between us go now earl of gloucester you do not want to see the dealings with this traitor edmund couldnt conceal a smile upon being addressed by the title he had lusted after for so many years i will said edmund he offered his arm to goneril who took it they started out of the hall no said regan everyone stopped cornwall stepped between regan and her sister lady now is the time when we must all be united against the foreign power regan gritted her teeth and turned back to the fire waving them away go edmund and goneril left the hall bind him to that chair then leave us cornwall commanded his soldiers they tied the old earl to a heavy chair and stood back you are my guests said gloucester do me no foul play filthy traitor said regan she took the letter from her husband and threw it in the old mans face she grabbed a pinch of gloucesters beard and yanked it out the earl yowled so white and such a traitor she said i am no traitor i am loyal to my king she pulled another pinch from his beard what letters do you have late from france what is their plan gloucester looked at the parchment on the floor i have only that cornwall charged up to gloucester and pulled the old mans head back by the back of his hair speak now to whose hands have you sent the lunatic king we know youve sent him aid to dover i sent him to dover only a few hours ago why dover said regan because i would not see your cruel nails pluck out his old eyes or your sister tear his flesh with her boarish fangs because there are those who would care for him there not put him out in the storm he lies said regan theres a smashing torture chamber in the dungeon shall we but cornwall would not wait in a second he was sitting astraddle the old man and was digging his thumb into gloucesters eye socket gloucester screamed until his voice broke and there was a sickening pop i reached for one of my throwing daggers the main door to the hall cracked and heads popped up in the stairwell from the kitchen why dover said regan thou carrion bird said gloucester with a cough thou shedevil ill not say then youll not see light again said cornwall and he was on the old man again i would not have it i drew back my dagger to cast it but before i could a band like ice encircled my wrist and i looked to see the girl ghost right beside me staying my throw in fact paralyzing me i could move only my eyes to look back on the horror playing out in the great hall suddenly a boy brandishing a long butcher knife ran out of the kitchen stairwell and leapt on the duke cornwall stood and tried to draw his sword but could not get it clear of the scabbard before the boy was on him plunging the knife into his side as the lad pulled back to stab again regan drew a dagger from the sleeve of her robe and plunged it into the boys neck then stepped back from the spray of blood the boy clawed at his neck and fell away regan shrieked waving the dagger at the servants in the kitchen stairwell and the main door and they all disappeared like frightened mice cornwall climbed unsteadily to his feet and plunged his sword into the boys heart then he sheathed his sword and felt his side his hand came away bloody serves you right you scurvy vermin said gloucester with that cornwall was on him again out foul jelly he shouted digging his thumb into the earls good eye but in that instant regans dagger snapped down and took the eye dont trouble yourself my lord gloucester passed out then from the pain and hung limp in his bonds cornwall stood and kicked the old mans chest knocking him over backward the duke looked on regan with adoring eyes filled with the warmth and affection that can only come from watching your wife dirk another mans eye out on your behalf evidently your wound said regan cornwall held his arm out to his wife and she walked into his embrace it glanced across my ribs ill bleed some and it pains me but if bound itll not be mortal pity said regan and she plunged her dagger under his sternum and held it as his hearts blood poured over her snowywhite hand the duke seemed somewhat surprised bugger he said then he fell regan wiped her dagger and her hands on his tunic she sheathed the blade in her sleeve then went to the cushion where cornwall had hidden her fathers crown pulled back her hood and fitted it on her head well pocket said the duchess without turning to the alcove where i was hidden how does it fit i was somewhat surprised although somewhat less so than the duke the ghost released me then and i stood behind the tapestry my knife still poised for the throw youll grow into it kitten said i she looked to my alcove and grinned yes i will wont i did you want something let the old man go i said king jeff of france has landed his army at dover thats why gloucester sent lear there youd be wise to set a camp farther south rally your forces with edmunds and albanys at the white tower perhaps the great doors creaked and a head peeked in a helmeted soldier send for a physician regan called trying to sound distressed my lord has been wounded throw his attacker on the dung heap and cast this traitor out the front gate he can smell his way to dover and his decrepit king in a moment the chamber was filled with soldiers and servants and regan walked out casting one last look and a sly smile to my hiding place i have no idea why she left me alive i suspect its because she still fancied me i slipped out through the kitchen and made my way back to the gatehouse the ghost stood over drool who was cowering under his blanket in the corner come on you lovely brute give us a proper snog leave him be wisp said i although she was nearly as solid as a mortal woman balls up balls upslang to ruin to fuck up also bollocks up and cock up your jaunty murdering for the day did i fool i might have saved the old mans second eye you wouldnt have i might have sent regan to join her duke in whatever hell he inhabits no you wouldnt have then she held up a ghostly finger cleared her throat and rhymed when a second siblings base derision proffers lies that cloud the vision and severs ties that families bind shall a madman rise to lead the blind youve said that one already i know bit prematurely too sorry i think youll find it much more relevant now even a slow git like yourself can solve the riddle now i reckon or you could just fucking tell me what it means said i sorry cant do it ghostly mystery and whatnot ta and with that she faded away through the stone wall i dinna shag the ghost pocket wailed drool i dinna shag her i know lad shes gone get up now weve got to monkey down the drawbridge chains and find the blind earl nineteen shall a madman rise gloucester was wandering around outside the castle just beyond the drawbridge coming dangerously close to tumbling into the moat the storm was still raging and bloody rain streamed down the earls face from his empty eye sockets drool caught the old man by the back of his cloak and lifted him like he was a kitten gloucester struggled and waved about in horror as if hed been snatched up by some great bird of prey instead of an enormous nitwit there there said drool trying to calm the old man the way one might try to settle a frightened horse i gots you bring him away from the edge and set him down drool said i lord gloucester this is pocket lears fool were going to take you to shelter and bandage your wounds king lear will be there too just take drools hand get away said the earl your comforts are in vain i am lost my sons are scoundrels my estate is forfeit let me fall in the moat and drown drool set the old man down and pointed him toward the moat go on then milord grab him drool you woodenheaded ninny but he told me to let him drown and hes an earl with a castle and the lot and youre only a fool pocket so i got to do what he says i strode forth grabbed gloucester and led him away from the edge hes not an earl anymore lad he has nothing but his cloak to protect him from the rain like us hes got nothing said drool can i teach him to juggle so he can be a fool lets get him to shelter and see that he doesnt bleed to death first then you can give him fool lessons were going to make a fool of ye said drool clapping the old man on the back thatll be the dogs bollocks wont it milord drown me said gloucester being a fool is ever so much better than being an earl said drool far too cheery for a colddismal day of postmaiming you dont get a castle but you make people laugh and they give you apples and sometimes one of the wenches or the sheeps will have a laugh with you its the mutts nuts the mutts nutsinformal for the dogs bollocks it is i stopped and looked at my apprentice youve been having a laugh with sheep drool rolled his eyes toward the slate sky no iwe have pie sometimes too when bubble makes it youll like bubble shes smashing gloucester seemed to lose all his will then and let me lead him through the walled town taking weak halting steps as we passed a long halftimbered building i took to be barracks i heard someone call my name i looked to see curan lears captain standing under an awning he waved us over and we stood with our backs hard to the wall to try to escape the rain is that the earl of gloucester asked curan aye said i i told curan what had transpired inside the castle and out on the heath since id last seen him gods blood two wars cornwall dead who is master of our force now mistress said i stay with regan the plan is as before no its not we dont even know who her enemy is albany or france aye but your action should be the same id give a months wages to be behind the blade that slays that bastard edmund at the mention of his son gloucester started wailing again drown me i will suffer no more give me your sword that i may run upon it and end my shame and misery sorry i said to curan hes been a bit of a weepy little nancy to be around since they ripped his eyes out well you might bandage him up bring him in hunters still with us hes right handy with a cauterizing iron let me end this suffering wailed gloucester i can no longer endure the slings and arrows my lord gloucester would you please by the firecharred balls of st george shut the fuck up bit harsh innit said curan what i said please still sorry gloucester old chap most excellent hat hes not wearing a hat said curan well hes blind isnt he if you hadnt said anything he might have enjoyed his bloody hat mightnt he the earl started wailing again my sons are villains and i have no hat he made to go on but drool clamped his great paw over the old mans mouth thanks lad curan do you have any food aye pocket we can spare as much bread and cheese as you can carry and one of the men can scare up a flask of wine too ill wager his lordship has been most generous in providing us with fare curan said for the benefit of gloucester the old man began struggling against drools grip oh curan youve set him off again hurry if you please weve got to find lear and head to dover dover it is then youll join with france aye bloody king jeff great froggy monkeynamed womanstealing ponce that he is youre fond of him then oh do piss off captain just see to it that whatever force regan might send after us doesnt catch us dont mutiny just make your way to dover east then south ill take lear south then east let me come with you pocket the king needs more protection than two fools and a blind man the old knight caius is with the king you will serve the king best by serving his plan here not strictly true but would he have done his duty if he thought his commander a fool i think not aye then ill get your food said curan when we arrived at the hovel tom obedlam stood outside naked in the rain barking that barking bloke is naked said drool for once not singing praise to st obvious as we were actually traveling with a blind fellow aye but the question is is he naked because hes barking or is he barking because hes naked i asked im hungry said drool his mind overchallenged poor tom is cold and cursed said tom between barking fits and for the first time seeing him in daylight and mostly clean i was taken aback without the coat of mud tom looked familiar very familiar tom obedlam was in fact edgar of gloucester the earls legitimate son tom why are you out here poor tom that old knight caius said he had to stand in the rain until he was clean and didnt stink anymore and did he tell you to bark and talk about yourself in the third person no i thought up that bit on my own come inside tom help drool with this old fellow tom looked at gloucester for the first time and his eyes went wide and he sank to his knees by the cruelty of the gods said he hes blind i put my hand on his shoulder and whispered be steadfast edgar your father needs your help in that moment a light came into his eye like a spark of sanity returning and he nodded and stood up taking the earls arm shall a madman rise to lead the blind come good sir said edgar tom is mad but he is not beyond aiding a stranger in distress just let me die said gloucester trying to push edgar away give me a rope so i may stretch my neck until my breath is gone he does that a lot i said i opened the door expecting to see lear and kent inside but the hovel was empty and the fire had died down to embers tom where is the king he and his knight set out for dover without me the king was mad to be back in the storm twas the old knight said to tell you they were headed for dover here here bring the earl inside i stood aside and let edgar coax his father into the cabin drool throw some wood on the fire we can stay only long enough to eat and dry out we must be after the king drool ducked through the door and spotted jones sitting on a bench by the fire where i had left him jones my friend said the dolt he picked up the puppet stick and hugged it drool is somewhat unclear on the art of ventriloquism and although i have explained to him that jones speaks only through me he has developed an attachment to the puppet hello drool you great sawdustbrained buffoon put me down and stoke the fire said jones drool tucked the puppet stick in his belt and began breaking up kindling with a hatchet by the hearth while i portioned out the bread and cheese that curan had given us edgar did his best to bandage gloucesters eyes and the old man settled down enough to eat some cheese and drink a little wine unfortunately the wine and the blood loss no doubt took the earl from inconsolable wailing grief to a soulsmothering sablecolored melancholy my wife died thinking me a whoremonger my father thought me damned for not following his faith and my sons are both villains i thought for a turn that edmund might have redeemed his bastardy by being good and true by fighting infidels in the crusade but he is more of a traitor than his legitimate brother edgar is no traitor i said to the old man even as i said it edgar held a finger to his lips and signaled for me to speak no further i nodded to show i knew his will and would not give his identity away he could be tom as long as he wished or for as long as he needed for all i cared as long as he put on some bloody trousers edgar was always true to you my lord his treachery was all devised for your eyes by the bastard edmund it was two sons worth of evil done by one edgar may not be the sharpest arrow in the quiver but he is no traitor edgar raised an eyebrow to me in question youll make no case for your intelligence sitting there naked and shivering when theres a fire and blankets you can fashion into warm robes good tom said i he rose from his fathers side and went over to the fire then it is i who have betrayed edgar said gloucester oh the gods have seen fit to rain misery down on me for my unsteady heart i have sent a good son into exile with hounds at his heels and left only the worms as heirs to my only estate this withered blind body oh we are but soft and squishy bags of mortality rolling in a bin of sharp circumstance leaking life until we collapse flaccid into our own despair the old man began to wave his arms and beat at his brow whipping himself into a frenzy causing his bandages to unravel drool came over to the old man and wrapped his arms around him to hold him steady its all right milord said drool you aint leakin hardly at all let me send this broken house to ruin and rot in deaths eternal cold let me shuffle off this mortal coilmy sons betrayed my king usurped my estates seizedlet me end this torture he really was making a very good argument then the earl grabbed jones and tore him out of drools belt give me your sword good knight edgar made to stop his father and i threw out an arm to hold him backa toss of my head stopped drool from interceding the old man stood put the stick end of jones under his rib cage then fell forward onto the dirt floor the breath shot from his body and he wheezed in pain my cup of wine had been warming by the fire and i threw it on gloucesters chest i am slain croaked the earl fighting for breath the lifeblood runs from me even now bury my body on the hill looking down upon castle gloucester and beg forgiveness of my son edgar i have wronged him edgar again tried to go to his father and i held him back drool was covering his mouth trying not to laugh i grow cold cold but at least i take my wrongdoings to my grave you know milord i said the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interred with their bones or so ive heard edgar my boy wherever you are forgive me forgive me the old man rolled on the floor and seemed somewhat surprised when the sword on which he thought himself impaled fell away lear forgive me that i did not serve you better look at that said i you can see his black soul rising from his body where said drool a frantic finger to my lips silenced the natural oh great carrion birds are rending poor gloucesters soul to tatters oh fates revenge is upon him he suffers i suffer said gloucester he is bound to the darkest depths of hades never to rise again down the abyss i go forever a stranger to light and warmth oh cold and lonely death has taken him said i and a right shit he was in life likely hell be buggered by a billion barbdicked devils now cold and lonely death has me said the earl no it hasnt said i what youre not dead soon then ive fallen on this cruel blade and my life runs wet and sticky between my fingers youve fallen on a puppet said i no i havent its a sword i took it from that soldier you took my puppet stick from my apprentice youve thrown yourself on a puppet you knave pocket youre not trustworthy and would jest at a man even as his life drains where is that naked madman who was helping me you threw yourself on a puppet said edgar so im not dead correct said i i threw myself on a puppet that is what ive been saying you are a wicked little man pocket so milord how do you feel now that youve returned from the dead the old man stood up and tasted the wine on his fingers better said he good then let me present edgar of gloucester the erstwhile naked nutter who shall see you to dover and your king hello father said edgar they embraced there was crying and begging for forgiveness and filial snogging and overall the whole business was somewhat nauseating a moment of quiet sobbing by the two men passed before the earl resumed his wailing oh edgar i have wronged thee and no forgiveness from you can undo my wretchedness oh for fucks sake said i come drool let us go find lear and on to dover and the sanctuary of the bloody fucking french but the storm still rages said edgar ive been wandering in this storm for days im as wet and cold as i know how to get and no doubt a fever will descend any hour now and crush my delicate form with heavy heat but by the rugmunching balls of sappho ill not spend another hour listening to a blind old nutter wail on about his wrongdoings when theres a stack of wrongs yet to be done carpe diem edgar carpe diem fish of the day said the rightful heir to the earldom of gloucester yes thats it im invoking the fish of the bloody day you git i liked you better when you were eating frogs and seeing demons and the lot drool leave them half the food and wrap yourself as warm as you can were off to find the king well see you lot in dover act iv as flies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport king lear act iv scene gloucester twenty a pretty little thing drool and i slogged through the cold rain for a day across hill and dale over unpaved heath and roads that were little more than muddy wheel ruts drool affected a jaunty aspect remarkable considering the dark doings he had just escaped but a light spirit is the blessing of the idiot he took to singing and splashing gaily through puddles as we traveled i was deeply burdened by wit and awareness so i found sulking and grumbling better suited my mood i regretted that i hadnt stolen horses acquired oilskin cloaks found a firemaking kit and murdered edmund before we left the latter among many reasons because i could not ride upon drools shoulders as his back was still raw from edmunds beatings bastard i should say here that after some days in the elements the first id spent there since my time with belette and the traveling mummer troupe many years ago i determined that i am an indoor fool my lean form does not fend off cold well and it seems no better at shedding water i fear i am too absorbent to be an outdoor fool my singing voice turns raspy in the cold my japes and jokes lose their subtlety when cast against the wind and when my muscles are slowed by an unkind chill even my juggling is shit i am untempered for the tempest unsuited for a stormbetter fit for fireplace and featherbed oh warm wine warm heart warm tart where art thou poor cold pocket a drowned and wretched rat is he we traveled in the dark for miles before we smelled meatsmoke on the wind and spotted the orange light of an oilskinned window in the distance look pocket a house said drool we can sit by the fire and maybe have a warm supper weve no money lad and nothing to trade them we trade em a jest for our supper like we done before i can think of nothing amusing to do drool tumbling is out of the question my fingers are too stiff to work joness talk string and im too weary even for the simple telling of a tale we could just ask them they might be kind thats a blustery bag of tempest toss innit they might insisted the oaf bubble once give me a pie without i ever jested a thing just give it to me out of the kindness of her heart fine fine we shall prevail upon their kindness but should that fail prepare yourself to bash in their brains and take their supper by force what if theres a lot of em aint you going to help i shrugged and gestured to my fair form small and weary lad small and weary if im too weak to perform a puppet show i think the brainbashing duties will by necessity fall upon you find a sturdy stick of firewood there theres a woodpile over there i dont want to bash no brains said the stubborn nitwit fine here take one of my daggers i handed him a knife give a good dirking to anyone who requires it at that point the door opened and a wizened form stepped into the doorway and raised a storm lantern who goes there beggin pardon sirrah said drool we was wondering if you required a good dirking this evening give that to me i snatched the dagger away from the git and fitted it into the sheath at my back sorry sir the natural jests out of turn we are looking for some shelter from the storm and perhaps a hot meal weve only bread and a little cheese but we will share it for the shelter we are fools said drool shut up drool he can see that by my kit and your empty gaze come in pocket of dog snogging said the bent figure mind your head on the doorjamb drool were buggered said i pushing drool through the door ahead of me witches three parsley sage and rosemary oh no not in the great birnam wood where they are generally kept where one might fairly expect to encounter them but here in a warm cabin off the road between the gloucestershire villages of tossing sod and bongwater crash a flying house perhaps its rumored that witches are afraid of such structures i thought you was an old man but you is an old woman said drool to the hag who had let us in sorry no proof please said i afraid that one of the hags might confirm her gender by lifting her skirts the lads suffered enough of late some stew said the crone sage the warty one a small pot hung over the fire ive seen what you put in your stew stew stew true and blue said the tall witch parsley yes please said drool its not stew said i they call it stew because it rhymes with bloody blue but its not stew no its stew said rosemary beef and carrots and the lot afraid it is said sage not bits of bat wing eye of lecher sweetbreads of newt and the lot then a few onions said parsley thats it no magical powers no apparitions no curse you appear out here in the middle of nowherenay on the very fringe of the ticks knickers that sucks the ass of nowhereand youve no agenda except to feed the natural and me and give us a chance to chase the chill aye thats about it said rosemary why couldnt think of nothin that rhymes with onions said sage aye we were right fucked for spell casting once the onions went in said parsley truth be told beef put us against the wall didnt it said rosemary yeah fief i suppose mused sage rolling her good eye toward the ceiling and teef although strictly speaking that aint a proper rhyme right said parsley no telling what kind of dodgy apparition youll conjure you cock up the rhyme like that fief teeth pathetic really stew please said drool i let the crones feed us the stew was hot and rich and mercifully devoid of amphibian and corpse bits we broke out the last of the bread curan had given us and shared it with the witches who produced a jug of fortified wine and poured it for all i warmed both inside and out and for the first time in what seemed days my clothes and shoes were dry so its going well then asked sage after wed each had a couple of cups of wine i counted out calamities on my digits lear stripped of his knights civil war between his daughters france has invaded duke of cornwall murdered earl of gloucester blinded but reunited with his son who is a raving loony the sisters enchanted and in love with the bastard edmund i shagged em proper added drool yes drool boffed them until both walked unsteady and lets see lear wanders across the moors to find sanctuary with the french at dover handfuls of happenings lear suffers then asked parsley greatly said i hes nothing left a great height from which to fall being king of the realm reduced to a wandering beggar gnawed from the inside by regret for deeds he did long ago you feel for him then pocket asked rosemary the greenish cattoed witch he rescued me from a cruel master and brought me to live in his castle its hard to hold hatred with a full stomach and a warm hearth just so said rosemary have some more wine she poured some dark liquid into my cup i sipped it it tasted stronger warmer than before weve a gift for you pocket rosemary brought out a small leather box from behind her back and opened it inside were four tiny stone vials two red and two black youll be needing these what are they my vision began to blur then i could hear the witches voices and drool snoring but they seemed distant as if down a tunnel poison said the witch that was the last i heard from her the room was gone and i found myself sitting in a tree near a quiet river and a stone bridge it was autumn i could tell as the leaves were turning below me a girl of perhaps sixteen was washing clothes in a bucket on the riverbank she was a tiny thing and i would have thought her a child by her size but her figure was quite womanlyperfectly proportioned just a size smaller in scale than most the girl looked up as if she heard something i followed her gaze down the road to a column of soldiers on horseback two knights rode at the head of the train followed by perhaps a dozen others they rode under my oak tree and paused their horses on the bridge look at that said the heavier of the two knights nodding toward the girl i heard his voice as if it were in my own head pretty little thing have her said the other i knew the voice immediately and with it i saw the face for who it was lear younger stronger not nearly so grey but lear as sure as id ever seen him the hawk nose the crystalblue eyes it was him no said the younger man we need to make york by nightfall weve no time to find an inn come here girl called lear the girl came up the bank to the road keeping her eyes to the ground here barked lear the girl hurried across the bridge until she stood only a few feet from him do you know who i am girl a gentleman sir a gentleman i am your king girl i am lear the girl fell to her knees and stopped breathing this is canus duke of york prince of wales son of king bladud brother to king lear and he would have you no lear said the brother this is madness the girl was trembling now you are brother to the king and you may have whom you want when you want said lear he climbed off his horse stand up girl the girl did but stiffly as if she were bracing for a blow lear took her chin in his hand and lifted it you are a pretty thing shes a pretty thing canus and she is mine i give her to you the kings brothers eyes were wide and there was hunger there but he said no we havent time now boomed lear youll have her now with that lear grabbed the front of the girls frock and ripped it exposing her breasts when she tried to cover up he pulled her arms away then he held her and barked commands while his brother raped her on the wide stone rail of the bridge when canus had finished and fell breathless between her legs lear shouldered him aside then lifted the girl by the waist and threw her over the rail into the river clean yourself he shouted then he patted his brothers shoulder there shell not haunt your dreams tonight all subjects are property of the king and mine to give canus you may have any woman you want except one they mounted their horses and rode away lear hadnt even looked to see if she could swim i couldnt move i couldnt cry out all during the attack on the girl i felt as if id been lashed to the tree now i watched her crawl naked from the river her clothes in tatters behind her and she curled into a ball on the riverbank and sobbed suddenly i was whisked out of the tree like a feather on an errant wind and i settled on the roof of a twostory house in a village it was market day and everyone was out going from cart to cart table to table bargaining for meat and vegetables pottery and tools a girl stumbled down the street a pretty little thing perhaps sixteen or seventeen with a tiny babe in arms she stopped at every booth and showed them the babe then the villagers would reward her with rude laughter and send her to the next booth hes a prince she said his father was a prince go away girl youre mad no wonder no one will have you tart but hes a prince he looks to be a drowned puppy lass youll be lucky if he lives the week out from one end of the village to the other she was laughed at and scorned one woman who must have been the girls mother simply turned away and hid her face in shame i floated overhead as the girl ran to the edge of town across the bridge where shed been raped and up to a compound of stone buildings one with a great soaring steeple a church she made her way to the wide double door and there she lay her baby on the steps i recognized those doors id seen them a thousand times this was the entrance to the abbey at dog snogging the girl ran away and i watched as a few minutes later the doors opened and a broadshouldered nun bent and picked up the tiny squalling baby mother basil had found him suddenly i was at the river again and the girl that pretty little thing stood on the wide stone rail of the bridge crossed herself and leapt in she did not swim the green water settled over her my mother when i awoke the witches were gathered around me like i was a sumptuous pie just out of the oven and they were ravenous pie whores so youre a bastard then said parsley and an orphan said sage both at once said rosemary surprised then said parsley lear not quite the kind old codger you thought him eh a royal bastard you are i gagged a bit in response to the crones collective breath and sat up would you back off you disgusting old cadavers well strictly speakin only rosemarys a cadaver said the tall witch parsley you drugged me put that nightmare vision in my head aye we did drug you but you was just looking through a window to the past there was no vision except what happened got to see your dear mum didnt you said rosemary how lovely for you i had to watch her raped and driven to suicide you mad hag you needed to know little pocket before you went on to dover dover im not going to dover i have no desire to see lear even as i said it i felt fear run down my spine like the tip of a spike without lear i was no longer a fool i had no purpose i had no home still after what he had done i would have to find some other means to make my way i can rent out drool for plowing fields and hoisting bales of wool and such well make our way maybe he wants to go on to dover i looked over to drool who i thought to still be asleep by the fire but he was sitting there staring at me wideeyed as if someone had frightened him and hed forgotten how to talk you didnt give him the same potion you gave me did you it was in the wine said sage i went to the natural and put my arm around his shoulder or as far around as i could reach anyway drool lad youre fine lad i knew how horrified i had been with my superior mind and understanding of the world poor drool must have been terrified what did you wicked hags show him he had a window on the past just like you the great oaf looked up at me then i was raised by wolfs said he nothing can be done now lad dont be sad weve all things in our past we were better not remembering i glared at the witches i aint sad drool said standing up he had to stoop to avoid hitting his head on the roof beams my brother nipped at me cause i didnt have no fur but he didnt have no hands so i throwed him against a tree and he didnt get up youre but a pathetic dimwit said i you cant be blamed my mum only had eight teats but after that there was only seven of us so i got two it were lovely he didnt really seem that bothered by the whole experience tell me drool have you always known you were raised by wolves aye i want to go outside and have a wee on a tree now pocket you want to come no you go love im going to stay here and shout at the old ladies once the natural was gone i turned on them again im finished doing your bidding whatever politics you want to engineer ill have no more part of it the crones laughed at me in chorus then coughed until finally rosemary the greenish witch calmed her breath with a sip of wine no lad nothing so sordid as politics were about vengeance pure and simple we dont give a weasels twat about politics and succession but youre evil incarnate and in triplicate arent you said i respectfully one must give due aye evil is our trade but not so deep a darkness as politics better business to dash a suckling babes brains upon the bricks than to boil in that tawdry cauldron aye said sage breakfast anyone she was stirring something in the cauldron i assumed it was the leftover hallucination wine from the night before well revenge then ive no taste left for it not even for revenge on the bastard edmund edmund what a storm of suffering that blackguard had loosed upon the world but still if i never had to see him again couldnt i forget about his damage edmund will find his just reward said i not believing it for a second and lear i was angry with the old man but what revenge would i have on him now he had lost all and i had always known him to be cruel but so long as his cruelty didnt extend to me i was blind to it no not even lear fine then where will you go asked sage she pulled a ladle of steaming liquid from the pot and blew on it ill take the natural into wales we can call at castles until someone takes us in then youll miss the queen of france at dover cordelia i thought bloody fucking froggy king jeff was at dover cordelia is with him the hags cackled oh no king jeff is in burgundy queen cordelia commands the french forces at dover oh bugger said i youll want to take them poisons we fixed for you said rosemary keep them on you at all times a need for them will present itself twentyone at the white cliffs years ago pocket said cordelia have you ever heard of this warrior queen named boudicca cordelia was about fifteen at the time and she had sent for me because she wished to discuss politics she lay on her bed with a large leather volume open before her no lamb who was she queen of why of the pagan britons of us lear had recently shifted back to the pagan beliefs thus opening a whole new world of learning for cordelia ah that explains it educated in a nunnery love ive a very shallow knowledge of pagan ways although i have to say their festivals are smashing rampant drunken shagging while wearing flower wreaths seems far superior to midnight mass and selfflagellation but then im a fool well it says here that she kicked nine colors of shit out of the roman legions when they invaded really thats what it says nine colors of shit im paraphrasing why do you think weve no warrior queens anymore well lamb war requires swift and resolute action and youre saying that a woman cant move with swift resolve im saying no such thing she may move with swiftness and resolve but only after choosing the correct outfit and shoes and therein lies the undoing of any potential warrior queen i suspect oh bollocks ill wager your boudicca lived before they invented clothing easy days then for a warrior queen just hitch up your tits and start taking heads it was now well i daresay erosion would take down a country before most women could pick out their invading kit most women but not me of course not you lamb them i meant only weakwilled tarts like your sisters pocket i think i shall be a warrior queen of what the royal petting zoo at boffingshire youll see pocket the whole of the sky will darken with the smoke from my armys fires the ground will tremble under their horses hooves and kings will kneel outside their city walls crowns in hand begging to surrender rather than feel the wrath of queen cordelia fall upon their people but i shall be merciful goes without saying doesnt it and you fool will no longer be able to behave like the right shit that you are fear and trembling love thats all youll get from me fear and bloody trembling as long as we understand each other so it sounds as if youre thinking of conquering more than just the petting zoo europe said the princess as if stating the unadorned truth europe said i to start said cordelia well then you had better get moving hadnt you yes i suppose said cordelia with a great silly grin dear pocket would you help me pick an outfit shes already taken normandy brittany and the aquitaine said edgar and belgium soils itself at the mention of her name cordelia can be a bundle of rumpus when she sets her mind to something said i i smiled at the thought of her barking orders to the troops all fury and fire from her lips but those crystalblue eyes hinting laughter at every turn i missed her oh i did betray her love and flay her sweet heart with stubborn pride said lear looking madder and weaker than when id seen him last where is kent i asked edgar ignoring the old king drool and i had found them above a cliff at dover they all sat with their backs to a great chalk boulder gloucester edgar and lear gloucester snored softly his head on edgars shoulder we could see smoke from the french camp not two miles away in the distance hes gone to cordelia to ask her to accept her father into her camp why didnt you go yourself i asked lear i am afraid said the old man he hid his head under his arm like a bird trying to escape the daylight beneath its wing it was wrong i wanted him strong i wanted him stubborn i wanted him full of arrogance and cruelty i wanted to see those parts of him i knew were thriving when hed thrown my mother on the stones so many years ago i wanted to scream at him humiliate him hurt him in eleven places and watch him crawl in his own shit dragging his bloody pride and guts behind him in the dirt there was no revenge to be satisfied on this trembling shell of lear i wanted no part of it im going to go nap behind those rocks said i drool keep watch wake me when kent returns aye pocket the natural went to the far side of edgars boulder sat and stared out over the sea if we were attacked by a ship hed be johnnyonthespot i lay down and slept perhaps an hour before there was shouting behind me and i looked over my boulders to see edgar holding his fathers head steadying him as the old man stood on a rock perhaps a foot above the ground are we at the edge aye there are fishermen on the beach below that look like mice the dogs look like ants what do the horses look like asked gloucester there arent any horses just fishermen and dogs dont you hear the sea crashing below yes yes i do farewell edgar my son i am sorry gods do your will with that the old man leaped off the rock expecting to plummet hundreds of feet to his death i reckon so he was somewhat surprised when he met the ground in an instant oh my lord oh my lord said edgar trying to use a different voice and failing completely sir you have duly fallen from the cliffs above i have said gloucester aye sir can you not see well no you git my eyes are bandaged and bloody can you not see sorry what i saw was you fall from a great height and land as softly as if you were a feather floating down i am dead then said gloucester he sank to his knees and seemed to lose his breath i am dead yet i still suffer my grief is manifest my eyes ache even though they are not there thats because hes fucking with you said i what said gloucester shhhh said edgar tis a mad beggar pay him no heed good sir fine youre dead enjoy said i i lay back on the ground out of the wind and pulled my coxcomb over my eyes come come sit with me said lear i sat up and watched lear lead the blind man to his nest beneath the great boulders let the cruelties of the world slide off our bent backs friend lear put his arm around gloucester and held him while he spoke to the sky my king said gloucester i am safe in your mercy my king aye king but i have no soldiers no lands no subject quakes before me no servants wait and even your bastard son hath treated you better than my own daughters oh for fucks sake said i but i could see that the old blind man was smiling and for all his suffering he found comfort in his friend the king no doubt having been blinded to his scoundrel nature long before cornwall and regan took his eyes blinded by loyalty blinded by title blinded by shoddy patriotism and false righteousness he loved his mad murdering king i lay back down to listen let me kiss your hand said gloucester let me wipe it first said lear it smells of mortality i smell nothing and see nothing evermore i am not worthy art thou mad see with your ears gloucester have you never seen a farmers dog bark at a beggar and thus chase him off is that dog the voice of authority is he better than the many for denying the mans hunger is a sheriff righteous who whips the whore when it is for his own lust he punishes her see gloucester see who is worthy now we are stripped of finery see small vices show through tattered clothes when all is hidden beneath fur and fine robes plate sin with gold and the strong lance of justice breaks on decoration blessed are you that you cannot seefor you cannot see me for what i am wretched no said edgar your impertinence comes from madness do not weep good king do not weep we weep when we first smell the air when we are born we cry that we come to this great stage of fools no all shall be well again and and there was a thump followed by another and a yowl die thou blind mole came a familiar voice i sat up in time to see oswald standing over gloucester a bloodied stone in one hand his sword driven down through the old earls chest youll not poison my ladys cause further he twisted the blade and blood bubbled up out of the old man but no sound did he make he was quite dead oswald yanked his blade free and kicked gloucesters body across lears lap as the king cowered against the boulder edgar lay unconscious at oswalds feet the vermin drew back as if to drive his sword into edgars spine oswald i shouted i stood behind my boulders as i drew a throwing knife from the sheath at my back the worm turned to me and pulled his blade up he dropped the bloody stone hed used to brain edgar we have an arrangement said i and further slaughter of my cohorts will cause me to doubt your sincerity sod off fool weve no arrangement youre a lying cur moi said i in perfect fucking french i can give you your ladys heart and not in the unpleasant eviscerated noshaggingexceptthecorpse way you have no such power youve not bewitched regans heart neither tis she who sent me here to kill this blind traitor who turns minds against our forces and to deliver this he pulled a sealed letter from his jerkin a letter of mark giving you permission in the name of the duchess of cornwall to be a total twatgoblin your wit is dull fool it is a love letter to edmund of gloucester he set out for here with a scouting party to assess the french forces my wit is dull my wit is dull yes dull said oswald now en garde said he in barely passable fucking french yes said i with an exaggerated nod yes and with that oswald found himself seized by the throat and dashed several times against the boulders which relieved him of his sword his dagger the love letter and his coin purse drool then held the steward up and squeezed his throat slowly but sternly causing wet gurgling noises to bubble from his foul gullet i said while unscathed by my rapier wit youre choked to death by a giant git by this gentle jester is argument won ill leave you two to have your fun oswald seemed somewhat surprised by the turn of events so much so that both his eyes and tongue protruded from his face in a wholly unhealthy way he then began to surrender his various fluids and drool had to hold him away to keep from being fouled by them drop him said lear who still cowered by the boulders drool looked to me and i shook my head ever so slightly die thou badgershagging spunk monkey said i when oswald stopped kicking and simply hung limp and dripping i nodded to my apprentice who tossed the stewards body over the cliff as easily as if it were an apple core drool went down on one knee over gloucesters body i were going to teach him to be a fool aye lad i know you were i stood by my boulders resisting the urge to comfort the great murderous git with a pat on the shoulder there was a rustling from over the top of the hill and i thought i heard the sound of metal on metal through the wind now hes blind and dead said the natural bugger said i under my breath then to drool hide and dont fight and dont call for me i fell flat to the ground as the first soldier topped the hill bugger bugger bugger bloody bollocksing buggering bugger i reflected serenely then i heard the voice of the bastard edmund look my fool and whats this the king what good fortune youll make a fine hostage to stay the hand of the queen of france and her forces have you no heart said lear petting the head of his dead friend gloucester i peeked out between my rocks edmund was looking at his dead father with the expression of someone who has just encountered rat scat in his toast for tea yes well tragic i suppose but with succession of his title determined and his sight gone a timely exit was only polite whos this other deader edmund kicked his unconscious half brother in the shoulder a beggar said drool he were trying to protect the old man this is not the sword of a beggar neither is this purse edmund picked up oswalds purse these belong to gonerils man oswald aye milord said drool well where is he on the beach on the beach he climbed down and left his purse and sword here he was a tosser said drool so i tossed him over he kilt your old da oh quite right well done then edmund threw the purse to drool use it to bribe your jailer for a bread crust take them the bastard motioned for his men to seize drool and lear when the old man had trouble standing drool lifted him to his feet and steadied him what about the bodies asked edmunds captain let the french bury them quickly to the white tower ive seen enough lear coughed then a dry feeble cough like the creaking of deaths door hinges until i thought he might collapse into a pile of blue one of edmunds men gave the old man a sip of water which seemed to quell the coughing but he couldnt stand or support his weight drool hoisted him up on one shoulder and carried him up the hillthe old mans bony bottom bouncing on the great gits shoulder as if it was the cushion of a sedan chair when they were gone i scrambled out of my hiding place and over to edgars prostrate body the wound on his scalp wasnt deep but it had bled copiously as scalp wounds are wont to do the resulting puddle of gore had probably saved edgars life i got him propped against the boulder and brought him around with some gentle smacking and a stout splashing from his water skin what edgar looked around and shook his head to clear his vision a motion he clearly regretted immediately then he spotted his fathers corpse and wailed im sorry edgar said i twas gonerils steward oswald knocked you out and killed him drool strangled the scurvy dog and tossed him over the cliff where is drool and the king taken by your bastard brothers men listen edgar i need to follow them you go to the french camp take them a message edgars eyes rolled and i thought he might pass out again so i threw some more water in his face look at me edgar you must go to the french camp tell cordelia that she should attack the white tower directly tell her to send ships up the thames and bring a force through london over land as well kent will know the plan have her sound the trumpet three times before they attack the keep do you understand three times the white tower i tore the back off of the dead earls shirt wadded it up and gave it to edgar here hold this on your noggin to staunch the blood and tell cordelia not to hold for fear for her fathers life ill see to it that its not an issue aye said edgar shell not save the king by holding the attack twentytwo at the white tower tosser cried the raven no help was he in my stealthy entry to the white tower id packed my bells with clay and darkened my face with the same but no amount of camouflage would help if the raven raised an alarm i should have had a guard bring him down with a crossbow bolt long before i left the tower i lay in a shallow flatbottomed skiff id borrowed from a ferryman covered with rags and branches so i might appear just another mass of jetsam floating in the thames i paddled with my right hand and the cold water felt like needles until my arm went numb sheets of ice drifted in the water around me another good cold night and i might have walked into the traitors gate rather than paddled the river fed the moat and the moat led under a low arch and through the gate where english nobility had been bringing their family members for hundreds of years on the way to the chopping block two ironclad gates fit together at the center of the arch chained in the middle below the waterline and they moved eversoslightly in the current there was a gap there at the top where the gates met not so wide that a soldier with weapons could fit through but a cat a rat or a spry and nimble fool on the slim side might easily pass over and so i did there were no guards at the stone steps inside but twelve feet of water separated me from them and my skiff would not fit through the gap at the top of the gate where i was perched a fool was getting wet there was no way around it but it seemed to me that the water was shallow only a foot or two deep perhaps i could keep my shoes dry i took them off and tucked them into my jerkin then slid down the gate into the cold water great dogbuggering bollocks it was cold only to my knees but cold and i would have made it undiscovered methinks if i hadnt let slip a rather emphatic whisper of great dogbuggering bollocks thats cold i was met at the top of the stairs by the pointy part of a halberd leveled malevolently at my chest for fucks sake said i do your worst but get it done and drag my body inside where its warm pocket said the yeoman at the other end of the spear sir aye said i i havent seen you for months whats that all over your face its clay im in disguise oh right why dont you come in and warm up must be dreadful cold in your wet stocking feet there good thought lad said i it was the young spotfaced yeoman whom id chastised on the wall when regan and goneril were first arriving to gain their inheritance shouldnt you stay at your post though duty and all that he led me across the cobbled courtyard into a servants entrance to the main castle and down the stairs into the kitchen nah its the traitors gate innit lock on it as big as your head aint no one coming through there not all bad its out of the wind not like up on the wall yknow the duchess regan is living here at the tower now i took your advice about not talking about her boffnacity boffnacityan expression of shagnatiousness fit from the latin boffusnatious even with the duke dead and all cant be too careful although i caught sight of her in a dressing gown one day she was up on the parapet outside her solar fine flanks on that princess despite the danger of death and all for sayin so sir aye the lady is fair and her gadonk as fine as frog fur lad but even your steadfast silence will get you hung if you dont cease with the thinking aloud pocket you scroungy fleabitten plague rat bubble love said i thou dragonbreathed wart farm how art thou the oxbottomed cook tried to hide her joy by casting an onion at me but there was a grin there youve not eaten one full plate since you were last in my kitchen have you we heard you was dead said squeak a crescent of a smile for me beneath her freckles feed the pest said bubble and clean that mess off his face rutting with the pigs again were you pocket jealous not bloody likely said bubble squeak sat me down on a stool by the fire and while i warmed my feet she scrubbed the clay from my face and out of my hair mercilessly battering me with her bosoms as she worked ah home sweet home so has anyone seen drool in the dungeon with the king said squeak although the guard aint supposed to know it she eyed the young yeoman who stood by i knew that he said what of the kings men his knights and guards in the barracks nah said the yeoman castle guard was a dogs breakfast until captain curan came down from gloucester hes got a nobleborn knight as captain of every watch and the old guard man for man with any new ones crashing huge camps of soldiers outside the walls forces of cornwall to the west and albany on the north they say the duke of albany is staying with his men at camp wont come to the tower wise choice with so many vipers about the castle what of the princesses i asked bubble although she seemed never to leave her kitchen she knew what was going on in every corner of the fortress they aint talking said bubble taking meals in their old quarters they had when they was girls goneril in the east tower of the main keep regan in her solar on the outer wall on the south theyll come together for the midday meal but only if that bastard gloucester is there can you get me to them bubble unseen i could sew you up in a suckling pig and send it over yes lovely but i did hope to return undiscovered and trailing gravy might draw the attention of the castles cats and dogs regrettably ive had experience with such things we can dress you as one of the serving lads then said squeak regan had us bring in boys instead of our usual maids she likes to taunt and threaten them until they cry i regarded bubble with steely recrimination why didnt you suggest that i wanted to see you sewed up in a suckling pig you oily rascal bubble has struggled with her deep affection for me for years very well then said i a serving boy it is you know pocket said cordelia age sixteen goneril and regan say that my mother was a sorceress yes id heard that love if thats so then im proud of it it means she didnt need some mangy man for her power she had her own banished then wasnt she well yes that or drowned no one will really say father forbids me to ask about it but my point is that a woman should come to her power on her own did you know that the wizard merlin gave up his powers to vivian in exchange for her favors and she became a great sorceress and queen and put merlin to sleep in a cave for a hundred years for his trouble men are like that lamb you give them your favors and next thing you know theyre snoring away like a bear in a cave way of the world it is you didnt do that when my sisters gave you their favors they did no such thing they did too many times everyone in the castle knows it vicious rumors fine then when you have enjoyed the favors of women who shall remain nameless did you fall asleep afterward well no but neither did i give up my magical powers or my kingdom but you would have wouldnt you say enough talk of sorcerers and such what say we go down to the chapel and convert back to christianity drool drank all the communion wine and ate all the leftover host when the bishop was ousted so ill wager hes blessed enough to bring us into the fold without clergy burped the body of christ for a week he did youre trying to change the subject curses discovered exclaimed the puppet jones thatll teach you you sootysouled snake have him whipped princess cordelia laughed liberated jones from my grasp and clouted me on the chest with him even when she was grown she bore a weakness for puppety conspiracy and punchandjudy justice now fool speak truthif the truth in you hasnt died starving from your neglect would you give up your powers and your kingdom for a ladys favor that would depend on the lady wouldnt it say me for example vous said i my eyebrows raised in the manner of the perfectly fucking french oui said she in the language of love not a chance said i id be snoring before you had time to declare me your personal deity which you would of course its a burden i bear deep sleep of the innocent id have or you know the deep sleep of the deeply shagged innocent i suspect come morning youd have to remind me of your name you didnt sleep after my sisters had you i know it well threat of violent postcoital death will keep you on the alert wont it she crawled across the rug until she was close then you are a dreadful liar what was your name she clouted me on the head with jones and kissed mequickly but with feeling that was the only time id have your power and your kingdom fool give me back my puppet thou nameless tart regans solar was bigger than i remembered it a fairly grand round room with a fireplace and a dining table six of us brought in her supper and set it out on the table she was all in red as usual snowy shoulders and raven hair warmed to the eye by orange firelight wouldnt you rather lurk behind the tapestry pocket she waved the others out of the room and closed the door i kept my head down how did you know it was me you didnt cry when i shouted at you blast i should have known and you were the only serving boy wearing a codpiece cant hide ones light under a bushel can one she was infuriating did nothing surprise her she spoke as if id been sent for and shed been expecting me at any moment rather took the joy out of all the stealth and disguise i was tempted to tell her shed been duped and droolshagged just to see her reaction but alas there were still guards who were loyal to her and i wasnt sure she wouldnt have me killed as it was id left my knives with bubble in the kitchen not that theyd help against a platoon of yeomen so lady how goes the mourning surprisingly well grief suits me i think grief or war im not sure which but ive had good appetite and my complexions been rosy she picked up a hand mirror and regarded herself then caught my reflection and turned but pocket what are you doing here oh loyalty to the cause and all with the french at our bloody doors thought id come back to help defend home and hearth it was probably best we not pursue the reasons why i was there so i pressed on how goes the war then complicated affairs of state are complicated pocket i wouldnt expect a fool to understand but im a royal now kitten didnt you know she put down her mirror and looked as if she might burst out laughing silly fool if you could catch nobility by touch youd have been a knight years ago wouldnt you but alas youre still common as cat shit ha yes once but now cousin blue blood runs in my veins in fact ive a mind to start a war and shag some relatives which i believe are the prime pastimes of royalty nonsense and dont call me cousin shag the country and kill some relatives then ive been noble less than a week i dont have all the protocol memorized yet oh and we are cousins kitten our fathers were brothers impossible regan nibbled at some dried fruit bubble had laid out on the tray lears brother canus raped my mother on a bridge in yorkshire while lear held her down i am the issue of that unpleasant union your cousin i bowed at your bloody service a bastard i might have known oh but bastards are vessels of promise are they not or didnt i watch you slay your lord the duke to run to the arms of a bastardwho is i believe now the earl of gloucester by the way how goes the romance torrid and unsavory i trust she sat down then and ran her fingernails through her jet hair as if raking thoughts out of her scalp oh i fancy him finealthough hes been a bit disappointing since that first time but the intrigue is bloody exhausting what with goneril trying to bed edmund and he not being able to show me deference for fear of losing albanys support and bloody france invading in the midst of it all if id known all that my husband had to tend to id have waited a while before killing him there there kitten i moved around behind her and rubbed her shoulders your complexion is rosy and your appetite good and you are as always a veritable feast of shagability once youre queen you can have everyone beheaded and take a long nap thats just it its not like i can just put on the crown and go sovereigning merrily alonggod st george and the whole rotting mess into history i have to defeat the fucking french then ive got to kill albany goneril and i suppose ill have to find father and have something heavy fall on him or the people will never accept me good news on that love lears in the dungeon mad as a hatter but alive he is aye edmund just returned from dover with him you didnt know edmund is back not three hours ago i followed him back bastard he hasnt even sent word that hes returned i sent a letter to him in dover this letter i took the letter that oswald had dropped id broken the seal of course but she recognized it and snatched it out of my hand how did you get that i sent that with gonerils man oswald to give to edmund personally yes well i sent oswald to vermin valhalla before delivery was secured you killed him i told you kitten im nobility nowa murderous little cunt like the rest of you just as well too that letters a flitty bit o butterfly toss innit dont you have any advisers to help you with that sort of thing a chancellor or a chamberlain a bloody bishop or someone ive no one everyone is at the castle in cornwall oh love let your cousin pocket help would you of course first lets see to sister i took two of the vials from the purse at my belt this red one is deadly poison but the blue one is only like a poison giving the same signs as if one is dead but they will but sleep one day for each drop they drink you could put two drops of this in your sisters winesay when you are ready to attack the frenchand for two days she would sleep the sleep of the dead while you and edmund did your will and without losing the support of albany in the war and the poison well kitten the poison may not be needed you could defeat france take edmund for your own and come to an agreement with your sister and albany i have an agreement with them now the kingdom is divided as father decreed im only saying that you may fight the french have edmund and not have to slay your sister and what if we dont defeat france well then you have the poison dont you well thats bollocks counseling said regan wait cousin i havent told you the part where you make me duke of buckingham yet id like that dodgy old palace hyde park st jamess park and a monkey youre daft named jeff get out i palmed the love letter from the table as i exited quickly through the corridors across the courtyard and back to the kitchen where i traded my codpiece for a pair of waiters breeches it was one thing to leave jones and my coxcomb with the ferryman another to secret my blades away with bubble but giving up my codpiece was like losing my spirit i was nearly undone by its enormity said i to squeak to whom i handed the portable den of my manly inequity aye a family of squirrels could nest in the extra space squeak observed dropping a handful of the walnuts shed been shelling into the empty prick pouch wonder you didnt rattle like a dried gourd when you walked said bubble fine cast aspersions on my manhood if you will but ill not protect you when the french arrive theyre unnaturally fond of public snogging and they smell of snails and cheese i will laughha as you both are mercilessly cheesesnogged by froggy marauders dont really sound that bad to me said squeak pocket youd better be off lad said bubble gonerils supper is going up now adieu said i a preview of the frenchy future of my former friends and soon to be frogsnogged traitorous tarts adieu i bowed i feigned fainting with a great wristtobrow flourish and i left i admit it one does like to lubricate his recurrent entrances and exits with a bit of melodrama performance is all to the fool gonerils quarters were less spacious than regans but luxurious and there was a fire going i hadnt set foot here since shed left the castle to marry albany but upon returning i found i was simultaneously aroused and filled with dreadmemories simmering under the lid of consciousness i suppose she wore cobalt with gold trim daringly cut she must have known edmund was back pumpkin pocket what are you doing here she waved the other servers and a young lady who had been braiding her hair out of the room and why are you dressed in that absurd outfit i know said i poncy breeches without my codpiece i feel defenseless i think they make you look taller she said a dilemma taller in breeches or stunningly virile in a cod both illusions each with its advantage which do you think makes a better impression on the fairer sex love tall or hung isnt your apprentice both but hesoh yes she bit into a winter plum i see said i so what is it with edmund all the black kit what it was was she was bewitched was what it was edmund she sighed i dont think edmund loves me and i sat down with all of gonerils luncheon repast set before me and considered cooling my forehead in the tureen of broth love sodding bloody tossing bloody sodding bloody love irrelevant superfluous bloody ruddy rotten sodding love what ho wherefore what the fuck love love said i no one has ever loved me said goneril what about your mother surely your mother i dont remember her lear had her executed when we were little i didnt know it was not to be spoken of jesus then comfort in christ what comfort im a duchess pocket a princess perhaps a queen you cant rule in christ are you daft you have to ask christ to leave the room your very first war or execution and youre right fucked for forgiveness arent you theres jesusy disapproval and scowling at least and you have to act like you dont see it hes infinite in his forgiveness said i it says so somewhere as should we all be it also says but i dont believe it ive never forgiven our father for killing our mother and i never shall i dont believe pocket theres no comfort or love there i dont believe me either lady so sod jesus surely edmund will fall in love with you when you become closer and hes had a chance to murder your husband love needs room to grow like a rose or a tumor hes passionate enough although never so enthusiastic as that first night in the tower have you introduced him to yourwellspecial tastes those will not win his heart nonsense love a blackhearted prince like edmund verily starves to have his bum smacked by a fair damsel like yourself probably what hes craving just too shy to ask i think another has caught his eye i think he fancies my sister no thats his fathers eye she caught well speared really i thought but then i thought better perhaps i can help you resolve the conflict pumpkin and at that i produced the red and blue vials from my purse i explained how one was for deathlike sleep and the other afforded more permanent rest and as i did so i cradled the silk purse that still held the last puffball the witches had given me what if i were to use it on goneril bewitch her to love her own husband surely albany would forgive her he was a noble chap despite being a noble and with that regan could have that villain edmund for herself the conflict between the sisters would be settled edmund would be satisfied with his new role as duke of cornwall and earl of gloucester and all would be well of course there were the issues of france attacking lear in the dungeon and a wise and comely fool whose fate was uncertain pumpkin said i perhaps if you and regan came to an understanding perhaps if she were put to sleep until her army had done its duty against france perhaps mercy and that was as far as i got as the bastard edmund came through the door at that moment what is this demanded the bastard dont you fucking knock said i bloody common bastard youd have thought now that i too was a halfnoble bastard that my disdain for edmund might have diminished strangely no guard take this worm to the dungeon until i have time to deal with him four guards not of the old tower force came in and chased me around the solar several times before i was tripped up by the constrained step of my waiter breeches the lad theyd been made for must have been smaller even than i they pinned my arms behind me and dragged me out of the room as i went backward through the door i called goneril she held up her hand and they stopped there and held me you have been loved said i oh take him out and beat him said goneril she jests said i the lady jests twentythree deep in the dungeon my fool said lear as the guards dragged me into the dungeon bring him here and unhand him the old man looked stronger more alert aware barking orders again but with the command he commenced a coughing fit that ended with a spot of blood on his white beard drool held a water skin for the old man while he drank weve a beating to deliver first said one of the guards then youll have your fool well striped as well as checkered not if you want any of these buns and ale said bubble shed come down another stairway and was carrying a basket covered with cloth and steaming the most delectable aroma of freshly baked bread a flask of ale was slung over her shoulder and a bundle of clothes tucked under her free arm or well beat the fool and take your buns as well said the younger of the two guards one of edmunds men and obviously not aware of the pecking order at the white tower bugger god st george and the whitebearded king if you must but woe unto you if you crossed the cantankerous cook called bubble for thered be grit and grubs baked into all youd ever eat until the poison finally took you youll not want to press that bargain mate said i the fools wearing the kit of one of my servers said bubble and the boys shivering naked in my kitchen bubble threw a bundle of black clothing through the bars into the cell with drool and lear heres the fools motley now strip you rascal and let me get back to my business the guards were laughing now well go on little one get your kit off said the older guard weve hot buns and ale waiting i undressed in front of the lot of them old lear protesting from time to time like anyone gave a hot bootful of piss what he had to say anymore when i was radiant naked the guards unlocked the door and i crept over to the bundle yes my knives where there secreted in with the rest with a bit of sleight o hand and a distraction from bubble handing out buns and ale i was able to secure them inside my jerkin when i dressed two other guards joined the two outside of our cell and shared the bread and ale bubble waddled back up the stairs shooting me a wink as she went the king are melancholy pocket said drool we should sing him a song and cheer him up sod the sodding king said i looking directly into lears hawk eye watch yourself boy said lear or what youll hold my mother down while shes raped then throw her in the river have my father killed later then oh wait those threats are no longer valid are they uncle youve carried them out already what are you on about boy the old man looked fearsome as if hed forgotten hed been treated like so much chattel and thrown in a cage full of clowns but instead faced a fresh affront you lear do you remember a stone bridge in yorkshire some twentyseven years ago you called a farm girl up from the riverbank a pretty little thing and held her down while you commanded your brother to rape her do you remember lear or have you done so much evil that it all blends into a great black swath in your memory his eyes went wide then i could tell he remembered canus aye your poxy brother sired me then lear and when no one would believe my mother that her son was the bastard of a prince she drowned herself in that same river where you threw her that day all this time i have called you nunclewho would have thought it true it is not true he said his voice quivering it is true and you know it you decrepit old poke pokea sack bag a pig in a poke was usually a cat which is why you dont buy one being as cats are not good eating of bones a warp of villainy and a woof of greed are all that hold you together thou desiccated dragon the four guards had gathered at the bars and peered in as if they were the ones who were imprisoned blimey said one of the guards cheeky little tosser said another no song then asked drool lear shook his finger at me then so angry was he that i could see blood moving in the veins of his forehead you shall not speak to me in this way you are less than nothing i plucked you from the gutter and your blood will run in the gutter on my word before sundown will it nuncle my blood may run but it will not be on your word on your word your brother may have died on your word your father may have died on your word your queens may have died but not this princely bastard lear your word is but wind to me my daughters will your daughters are upstairs fighting over the bones of your kingdom they are your captors you ancient nutter no they you sealed this cell when you killed their mother theyve both just told me as much youve seen them he seemed strangely hopeful as if i might have forgotten to bring the good news from his traitorous daughters seen them ive shagged them silly really that it should matter after all his dark deeds all his slights and cruelties that a fool should shag his daughters but it did matter and it was a way to unleash a little of the fury i felt toward him you have not said lear you have asked one of the guards i stood then and strutted a bit for my audience plus it was a better position for grinding my heel into lears soul all i could see was the water closing over my mothers head all i could hear was her screams as lear held her i shagged them both repeatedly and with relish until they screamed and begged and whimpered i shagged them on the parapets overlooking the thames in the towers under the table in the great hall and once i shagged regan on a platter of pork in front of muslims i shagged goneril in your own bed in the chapel and on your thronewhich was her idea by the way i shagged them while servants watched and in case you were wondering because they asked and as any princess should be shagged for the pure sweet nasty of it and theythey did it because they hate you lear had been wailing while i ranted trying to drown me out now he growled they do not they love me all they have said you murdered their mother you decrepit loony theyve put you in a cell in your own dungeon what do you need a written decree i tried to shag the hate out of them nuncle but some cures lie beyond a jesters talents i wanted a son their mother would give me none im sure if they had known that they wouldnt have despised you so deeply and done me so well my daughters wouldnt have you you didnt have them oh i did on my black hearts blood i did and when it first started each of them would shout father when she came i wonder why oh yes nuncle i did indeed and they wanted you to knowthats why they accused me before you oh yes i bonked them both no wailed lear me too said drool with a great juicy grin beggin your pardon he quickly added but not today asked one of the guards right no not today you bloody nitwit today i killed them the french marched overland from the southeast and sailed ships up the thames from the east the lords of surrey on the south showed no resistance and since dover lay in the county of kent the forces of the banished earl not only offered no resistance but joined the french in the assault on london theyd marched and sailed across england without firing a single bolt or losing a single man from the white tower the guards could see the fires of the french drawing a great orange crescent in the night that illuminated the sky to the east and south when the captain made the call to arms at the castle one of lears old knights or squires under the command of captain curan put a blade to the throat of any of edmunds or regans men demanding they yield or die the personal guard forces within the castle had all been drugged by the kitchen staff with some mysterious nonlethal poison that mimicked the symptoms of death captain curan sent a message to the duke of albany from the french queen that if he stood down in fact stood with her that he could return to albany with his forces his lands and his title intact gonerils forces from cornwall and edmunds from gloucester camped on the west side of the tower found they were flanked on the south and east by the french and on the north by albany archers and crossbowmen were dispatched to the tower walls above the cornwall army and a herald fought his way through the panicked forces to a commander carrying the message that the forces of cornwall were to lay down their weapons on the spot or death would rain down upon them such as they could not imagine no one was willing to die for the cause of edmund bastard of gloucester or the dead duke of cornwall they laid down their weapons and marched three leagues to the west as instructed in two hours it was all over out of nearly thirty thousand men who took the field at the white tower barely a dozen were killedall of those edmunds castle guards who refused to yield the four guards lay spread about the dungeon in various awkward positions looking quite dead dodgy sodding poison said i drool see if you can reach the one with the keys the natural stretched through the bars but the guard was too far away i hope curan knows were down here lear looked around wildeyed again as if his madness had returned what is this captain curan is here my knights of course curan is here from the sound of the trumpets id say hes taken the castle as was the plan all your theater was misdirection then said the king youre not angry burning you old twat but i was growing weary with keeping the tirade up while the bloody poison took hold youre no less a turd in the milk of human kindness than i have said no said the old man as if my anger actually mattered to him he began coughing again and caught a handful of blood for his effort drool propped him up and wiped his face i am king i will not be judged by you fool not just a fool nuncle your brothers son did you have kent murder him the only decent bloke in your service and you turned him into an assassin eh no not kent it was another not even a knight a cutpurse who had come before the magistrate it was he who kent killed i sent kent after the assassin he is vexed by it still lear did you have a cutpurse kill your father as well my father was a leper and necromancer i could not bear his misshapen form ruling britain in your place you mean yes in my place yes but i did not send an assassin he was in a cell at the temple at bath out of the way where no one might ever see him but i could not take the throne until his death i did not kill him though the priests there simply walled him up was time that killed my father you walled him up alive i was shaking now i thought i might have forgiven the old man seeing him suffer but now i could hear my blood in my ears the sound of boots on stone echoed in the dungeon and i looked up to see the bastard edmund walk into the torchlight he kicked one of the unconscious guards and looked at them like hed just discovered monkey come in his weetabix weetabixa british cereal biscuit whose taste and texture are generally thought to be improved by the addition of monkey come well thats a spot of bother isnt it he said i suppose ill have to kill you myself then he stooped and took a crossbow from one of the guards back fit his foot in the stirrup and cocked the string intermission backstage with the players pocket you rascal youve trapped me in a comedy well for some it is yes when i saw the ghost i thought tragedy was assured aye theres always a bloody ghost in a tragedy but the mistaken identity the vulgarity the lightness of theme and paucity of ideas surely its a comedy im not dressed for comedy im all in black as am i yet here we are so it is a comedy a black comedy i knew it for me anyway tragedy then bloody ghost is foreshadowing innit but all the gratuitous shagging and tossing brilliant misdirection youre having me on sorry no its pikemans surprise for you in the next scene im slain then to the great satisfaction of the audience oh bugger but theres good news too yes it remains a comedy for me god youre an annoying little git hate the play not the player mate here let me hold the curtain for you do you have any plans for that silver dagger after youre gone i mean a bloody comedy tragedies always end with tragedy edmund but life goes on doesnt it the winter of our discontent turns inevitably to the spring of a new adventure again not for you ive never killed a king said edmund do you think ill be famous because of it youll not garner favor with your duchesses by killing their father said i oh those two like these guards quite dead im afraid they were sharing some wine over maps as they planned strategy for the battle and fell down foaming pity these guards arent dead merely drugged theyll come around in a day or so he lowered the crossbow then my ladies are only sleeping oh no theyre quite dead i gave them each two vials one with poison the other with brandy bubble used the knockout poison on the guards so brandy was our nonlethal substitute if either of them had decided to show mercy for the other at least one would be alive but as you said pity oh well played fool but that said ill have to throw myself on queen cordelias mercy let her know that i was brought into this horrid conspiracy against my will perhaps ill retain the gloucester title and lands my daughters dead said lear oh shut up old man said edmund they was fit said drool sadly but when cordelia hears of what youve really done i asked which brings us to our apex doesnt it you wont be able to tell cordelia what has transpired cordelia my one true daughter wailed lear shut the fuck up said edmund he raised the crossbow sighted through the bars at lear then stepped back and seemed to lose his aim as one of my throwing daggers sprouted out of his chest with a thud he lowered the crossbow and looked at the hilt of the knife but you said pikemans surprise surprise said i bastard snarled the bastard he pulled the crossbow up to fire this time at me and i sent the second dagger into his right eye the crossbow twanged and the heavy bolt rattled off the stone ceiling as edmund spun and fell onto the pile of guards that were smashing said drool youll be rewarded fool said lear his voice rattling with blood he coughed nothing lear said i nothing then there was a womans voice in the chamber ravens cry pork from the battlements theres dead edmund on the wind and bird beaks water at his scoundrel scent the ghost she stood over edmunds body outside our cell rather more ethereal and less solid than shed been when last id seen her she looked up from the dead bastard and grinned drool whimpered and tried to hide his head behind lears white mane lear tried to wave her away but the ghost floated to the bars in front of him ah lear walled up your father did you and go away spirit do not vex me walled up your daughters mother didnt you said the ghost she was unfaithful cried the old man no said the ghost she was not i sat down on the cell floor feeling lightheaded now killing edmund had made me queasy but this the anchoress at dog snogging was your queen i asked my voice sounding faraway in my own ears she was a sorceress said lear and she consorted with my brother i did not kill her i could not bear it i had her imprisoned at the abbey in yorkshire well you damn well killed her when you had her walled up i shouted lear cowered at my veracity she was unfaithful having dalliance with one of the local boys i could not bear the thought of her with another so you ordered her walled up yes yes and the boy was hanged yes you heinous monster she did not give me a son either i wanted a son she gave you cordelia your favorite and she was true to you said the ghost up to the time you sent her away no the old king tried to wave the ghost away again oh yes and you had your son lear for years you had your son i had no son another farm girl you took near another battlefield this one in iberia a bastard i have a bastard son i saw hope rise in lears cold hawk eye and i wanted to strike it out the way that regan had taken gloucesters i unsheathed the last of my throwing daggers yes said the ghost you had a son these many years and you lie in his arms now what the natural is your son said the ghost drool said i drool said lear drool said the ghost da said drool and he gave his newfound father a great armrippling hug oh da there was a cracking of bones and the sickly sound of air escaping wet crushed lungs lears eyes bulged out of his head and his parchmentdry skin began to go blue as drool gave him a lifetime of sons love all in a moment when the whistling sounds stopped coming out of the old man i went to drool and pried his arms off then lowered lears head to the floor let loose lad let him go da said drool i closed the old mans crystalblue eyes hes dead drool tosser said the ghost she spat a tiny gob of ghost spit that came out as a moth and fluttered away i stood then and spun on the ghost who are you what injustice has been done that can be undone so your spirit may rest or will at least make you go away thou etherlimbed irritation the injustice has been undone said the ghost at last who are you who am i who am i your answer is in a knock good pocket knock upon your coxcomb and ask that trifling machine of thought wherefrom comes his art knock upon your cod and ask the small occupant who wakes him in the night knock upon your heart and ask the spirit there who woke it to the warmth of its home fireask that tender ghost who is this ghost before you thalia said i for i could at last see her i fell to my knees before her aye lad aye she put her hand on my head arise sir pocket of dog snogging but why why did you never say you were a queen why he had my daughter my sweet cordelia and you always knew of my mother i heard stories but i didnt know who your father was not while i lived why didnt you tell me of my mother you were a little boy thats not the sort of story for a little boy not so little you wouldnt have me off through an arrow loop that was later i was going to tell you but he had me walled up because we were caught the ghost nodded he always had a problem with the purity of others never his own was it horrible i had tried not to think of her alone in the dark dying of hunger and thirst it was lonely i was always lonely except for you pocket im sorry youre a love pocket goodbye she reached through the bars and touched my cheek like the slightest brush of silk it was care for her what she started to float toward the far wall where the body of edmund lay she said after grave offense to daughters three soon the king a fool shall be nooooooo wailed drool my old da is dead no he isnt said thalia lear wasnt your father i was having you on she faded away and i started to laugh and she was gone dont laugh pocket said drool i are an orphan and she didnt even hand us the bloody keys said i heavy footsteps fell on the stairs and captain curan appeared in the passage with two knights pocket weve been looking for you the day is ours and queen cordelia approaches from the south what of the king dead said i the king is dead twentyfour boudicca rising all my years as an orphan only to find that i had a mother but she killed herself over cruelty from the king the only father i had ever known to find i had a father but he too was murdered by order of the king to find the best friend id ever known was the mother of the woman i adored and she was murdered horribly by order of the king because of what i had done to go from being an orphan clown to a bastard prince to a cutthroat avenger for ghosts and witches in less than a week and from upstart crow to strategist general in a matter of months to go from telling bawdy stories for the pleasure of an imprisoned holy woman to planning the overthrow of a kingdom it was bloody disorienting and not a little tiring and id built quite an appetite a snack was in orderperhaps even a full meal with wine i watched from the arrow loops in my old apartment in the barbican as cordelia entered the castle she rode a great white warhorse and both she and the horse were fitted with full plate armor fashioned in black with gold trim the golden lion of england was emblazoned on her shield a golden fleurdelis of france on her breastplate two columns of knights rode behind her carrying lances with the banners of wales scotland ireland normandy france belgium and spain spain shed conquered bloody spain in her spare time she was rubbish at chess before she left real war must be easier she reined up her horse in the middle of the drawbridge stood in the stirrups pulled off her helmet and shook out her long golden hair then she smiled up at the gatehouse i ducked out of sightim not sure why mine she barked then she laughed and led the column into the castle yes i know love but bad form isnt it to march about with your own bloody army laying claim to random property innit unladylike she was bloody glorious yes a snack would do nicely i laughed a bit myself and danced my way to the great hall indulging in the odd somersault along the way perhaps going to the great hall in search of food wasnt the best idea and perhaps it wasnt my real intention which was just as well since instead of a repast the bodies of lear and his two daughters were laid out on three high tables lear on the dais where his throne sat regan and goneril below on either side on the main floor cordelia stood over her father still in her armor her helmet tucked under her arm her long hair hung in her face so i couldnt tell if she was crying hes a good deal more pleasant now said i quieter although he moves about the same speed she looked up and smiled a great dazzling smile then seemed to remember she was grieving and bowed her head again thank you for your condolences pocket i see you have managed to fend off pleasantness in my absence only by keeping you constantly in my thoughts child ive missed you pocket and i you lamb she stroked her fathers hair he wore the heavy crown that hed thrown on the table before cornwall and albany what seemed so long ago did he suffer cordelia asked i considered my answer which i almost never do i could have vented my ire cursed the old man made testament to his life of cruelty and wickedness but that would serve cordelia not a bit and me very little still i needed to temper my tale with some truth yes at the end he suffered greatly in his heart at the hands of your sisters and under the weight of regret for doing wrong to you he suffered but not in his body the pain was in his soul child she nodded and turned from the old man you shouldnt call me child pocket im a queen now i see that smashing armor by the way very st george come with a dragon did it no an army as it turns out and an empire evidently no i had to take that myself i told you your disagreeable nature would serve you in france that you did right after you told me that princesses were only good forwhat was itdragon food and ransom markers there it was that smile again sunshine on my frozen heart it felt and like a frostbitten limb there were pins and needles as the feeling returned suddenly i felt the small purse with the witchs puffball heavy on my belt yes well one cant be right all the time it would undermine ones credibility as a fool your credibility is already in question in that regard kent tells me that the kingdom fell before me so easily because of your doing i didnt know it was you i thought it was bloody jeff where is jeff anyway in burgundy with the dukewell the queen of burgundy they both insist on being referred to as the queen of burgundy turns out you were right about them which again counts against your standing as a fool i caught them together at the palace in paris they confessed that theyd fancied each other since they were boys jeff and i came to an arrangement aye theres usually an arrangement in those situationsthe arrangement of the queens head and body at different addresses nothing like that pocket jeff is a decent chap i didnt love him but he was a good fellow saved me when father threw me out didnt he and by the time this happened id won the guard and most of the court to my sympathiesif anyone was going to lose his head it wasnt me france took some territories toulouse provence and some bits of the pyrenees with him but considering the territories ive taken overall its more than fair the boys have a crashingly large palace in burgundy that they perpetually redecorate theyre quite happy the boys bloody burgundy buggering froggy france by the dangling ovaries of odin theres a song in there somewhere she grinned ive purchased a divorce from the pope bloody dear dearbritish colloquialism expensive costly it was too if id known jeff was going to insist on sanction of the church id have pushed to reinstate the old discount pope the sound of the great doors opening echoed through the hall and cordelia turned fierce fire in her eyes i said i was to be left alone but then drool who had lumbered through pulled up as if hed seen a ghost and started to back away sorry beggin your pardons pocket i got jones and your hat he held up the puppet stick and my coxcomb forgot for a second that hed been shouted at then resumed backing out the doors no come drool said cordelia she waved him in and the guards closed the door behind him i wondered what the knights and other nobles might think that the warrior queen would admit no one to the hall except two fools probably that she was merely another in a long line of family nutters drool paused as he passed regans body and lost his sense of purpose he lay jones and my hat on the table next to her then pinched the hem of her gown and began to raise it for a peek drool i barked sorry said the natural then he spotted gonerils body and moved to her side he stood there looking down in a moment his shoulders began to shake and soon he broke into great ribwrenching sobs and proceeded to drip tears upon gonerils bosom cordelia looked at me with pleading in her eyes and i at her with something that must have seemed similar we were shits together we were that we didnt grieve for these people this family they was fit said drool soon he was petting gonerils cheek then her shoulder then both her shoulders then her breasts then he climbed on the table on top of her and commenced a rhythmic and unseemly sobbing that approximated in timbre and volume a bear being shaken in a wine cask i retrieved jones from regans side and clouted the oaf about the head and shoulders until he climbed off the erstwhile duchess of albany and slipped through the drape and hid under the table i loved them drool said cordelia stayed my hand and bent down and lifted the drapery drool mate she said pocket doesnt mean to be cruel he doesnt understand how you feel still we have to keep it to ourselves its not proper to dryhump the deceased love it aint no the duke will be here soon and hed be offended what bout the other one her duke is dead just the same its not proper sorry he hid his head under the drape she stood and looked at me turning away from drool and rolling her eyes and smiling there was so much to tell her that id shagged her mother and we technically were cousins and well things might get awkward it was my instinct as a performer to keep the moment light so i said i killed your sisters more or less she stopped smiling captain curan said they poisoned each other aye i gave them the poison did they know it was poison they did couldnt be helped then could it they were right vicious bitches anyway tortured me through my childhood you saved me the effort they just wanted someone to love them i said dont make the case with me fool youre the one that killed them i was just going to take their lands and property maybe humiliate them in public but you just said i loved them said drool shut up i chorused with cordelia the doors cracked open then and captain curan peeked his head through lady the duke of albany has arrived said he give me a moment then send him in said cordelia very well curan closed the doors cordelia stepped up to me then she was only a little taller than me but in armor somewhat more intimidating than id remembered herbut no less beautiful pocket ive taken quarters in my old solar id like you to visit after supper tonight i bowed does my lady require a story and a jest before bedtime to clear her head of the days tribulations no fool queen cordelia of france britain belgium and spain is going to shag the bloody bells off you pardon said i somewhat nonplussed but then she kissed me the second time with great feeling and she pushed me away i invaded a country for you you nitwit ive loved you since i was a little girl i came back for you well and for revenge on my sisters but mostly for you i knew you would be waiting for me how how did you know a ghost came to me at the palace in paris months ago scared the béarnaise out of jeff shes been advising the strategy since enough talk of ghosts i thought let her rest i bowed again at your bloody beckoning service love a humble fool at your service act v how i would make him fawn and beg and seek and wait the season and observe the times and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes and shape his service wholly to my hests and make him proud to make me proud that jests so perttauntlike would i oersway his state that he should be my fool and i his fate loves labours lost act v scene rosaline twentyfive the king shall be a fool alas your humble fool is the king of france actually france britain normandy belgium brittany and spain perhaps more i havent seen cordelia since breakfast she can be a terror when left to her own devices but she keeps the empire in working order and i adore her of course as has always been the case good kent had his lands and title restored and was also given the title duke of cornwall and the attendant lands and properties hes retained the black beard and glamour given him by the witches and seems to have convinced himself that he is younger and more vibrant than the multitude of years he carries on his back albany retained his title and lands and signed an oath of fealty to cordelia and me and i trust he will be true to it hes a decent if dull chap and without goneril in his ear his will be the way of virtue weve given curan the title of duke of buckingham and he acts as regent of britain when we are not on the islands edgar took his title as earl of gloucester and returned to his home where he buried his father in the walls of the castle temple built to his many gods hes started his own family and will no doubt have many sons who will grow up to betray him or simply be dolts in the image of their father cordelia and i live in a number of palaces around the empire traveling with an embarrassingly large entourage that includes bubble and squeak as well as shanker mary and other loyal staff from the white tower i have a crashingly large throne on which i hold court with drool on one side who has been given the title of royal minister of wank and my monkey jeff on the other we hear cases of the local farmers and merchants and i pronounce judgments damages and sentences for a while i allowed monkey jeff to pronounce sentences while i was off having lunch with the queen giving him a little plaque with various penalties to which he could point but that had to stop when i returned one afternoon from a protracted cordelia bonking to find that the cheeky little bloke had hanged the entire village of beauvois for cheese violations awkward that but the french understand they are very serious about their cheese most of the time justice can be satisfied with a bit of verbal humiliation namecalling and pointed sarcasm at which it turns out i excel so i am viewed as a fair and just king and much beloved by my people even the fucking french we are at our palace in gascony now near northern spain lovely but very dry i was just saying to froggy queen jeff today he and queen burgundy are visiting its lovely jeff but bloody dry im english i require dampness i feel as if im drying out and becoming all crackly as we speak its true cordelia said hes always gravitated toward the moist yes well darling we shant speak of that in front of jeff shall we oh look drool has sprouted an erection lets ask him what hes thinking about had his way with a knotted oak on the way here a right spectacular treeshagging it was too knocked down enough acorns to feed the village for a week they wanted to have a special feast day in honor of the gitdeclare him god of the treeshagmore fertility symbols there than you can shake a stick at innit cest la vie cest la viefucking french for thats life said jeff in perfectly incomprehensible fucking french later as i was holding audiences with the public there entered the great hall three ancient bent figures the witches of great birnam wood i suppose id always known theyd show up at some time or another drool ran and hid in the kitchen jeff jumped on my shoulder and screeched at them jeff the monkey not the queen a year has passed for witches three and we are here to collect our fee said rosemary the green cattoed witch oh for fucks sake youre on with the rhyming again a need was filled a promise made for service done we must be paid the witches chanted in unison just stop the rhyming said i and those rags are entirely too heavy for this climate youll get a rash on your warts and carbuncles if youre not careful youve been made a king and enchanted your true love to be yours forevermore fool we only want what is our due said sage the most warty of the three rightly so rightly so said i but cordelia is not enchanted to

authors note i know what youre thinking why are you an american comic novelist thrashing around in the deep end of genius with the greatest artist of the english language who ever lived what did you think you might possibly achieve besides peeing in the pool and drowning in your own shallow aspirations youre thinking shakespeare writes a perfectly elegant tragedy that functions perfectly well and you cant leave it in peace you have to put your greasy hands all over it befoul it with badger shagging and monkey spunk i suppose we just cant have nice things okay first good point and second i cant believe you think like that but youre right ive made a dogs breakfast of english history geography king lear and the english language in general but in my defensewelli dont really have a defense but let me give you an idea from whence one begins when trying to retell the story of king lear if you work with the english language particularly if you work with it as dogfuckingly long as i have you are going to run across wills work at nearly every turn no matter what you have to say it turns out that will said it more elegantly more succinctly and more lyricallyand he probably did it in iambic pentameterfour hundred years ago you cant really do what will did but you can recognize the genius that he had to do it but i didnt begin fool as a tribute to shakespeare i wrote it because of my great admiration for british comedy i began with the idea of writing a story about a fool an english fool because i like writing rascals i fired the first shot across the bow several years ago over breakfast in new york with my american editor jennifer brehl on a morning after i had taken entirely too much sleep medication new york kind of freaks me out i always feel like im a sponge mopping the anxiety from new yorks brow jen i want to do a book about a fool but i dont know whether i should just do a generic fool or lears fool oh you have to do lears fool she said lears fool it is then said i as if that entailed no more effort than saying it then she slowly melted in her chair and was replaced by a hookahsmoking caterpillar that said nothing but wah wah wah wah wah but did pay for breakfast ive blacked out the rest of the morning business travelers tip if youre still not asleep after a second sleeping pill do not take a third so into the deep end i dove spending nearly two years immersed in shakespeares work performed live in written form and on dvd i must have watched thirty different performances of king lear and frankly about halfway into my research after listening to a dozen different lears rage at the storm and lament what complete nitwits they had been i wanted to leap onstage and kill the old man myself for while i respect and admire the talent and stamina it takes for an actor to play lear as well as the eloquence of the speeches a person can take only so much whining before he wants to sign up for the committee to make elder abuse an olympic sport amid all the attractions at stratforduponavon i think they should add one where participants are allowed to push king lears off a high precipice you know like bungee jumping only no bungee just rage wind blow crack your cheeks ahhhhhhhhhhh splat sweet sweet silence okay perhaps not they have a shakespeare hospice at stratford by the way for those who ticked the not to be box once one decides to retell lear time and place become problems that must be addressed according to a history of british monarchs the kings of britain compiled in by the welsh cleric geoffrey of monmouth the real king leir if indeed he existed lived in bc or about the time between plato and aristotle at the height of the greek empire when there were no great castles in england the counties that shakespeare refers to in his play were long from being established and at best leir would have been some sort of a tribal leader not the sovereign of a vast kingdom with authority over a complex sociopolitical system of dukes earls and knights a mud fortress would have been his castle in the play shakespeare makes references to greek gods and indeed legend says that leirs father bladud who was a swineherd a leper and king of the britons journeyed to athens looking for spiritual guidance and returned to build a temple to the goddess athena at bath where he worshipped and practiced necromancy leir became king rather by default when bladuds essential bits dropped off the battle for souls between the christians and the pagans that i portray in fool probably took place closer to around ad to rather than during pockets imagined thirteenth century time then becomes a bit of a problem not just in relation to history but to language as well the time frame of the play seemed to bollocks up even shakespeare for at one point he has the fool rattle off a long list of prophecies after which he says this prophecy merlin shall make for i live before his time act iii scene its as if will threw his quill in the air and said i know not what the hell is going on therefore i shall cast this beefy bit of bull toss to the groundlings and see if it slides by no one appears to know what kind of language they were speaking in bc but it certainly wasnt english and while shakespeares english is elegant and in many ways revolutionary much of it is foreign to the modern english reader so in the tradition of will throwing his quill into the air i decided to set the story in a more or less mythical middle ages but with the linguistic vestiges of elizabethan times modern british slang cockney slang although rhyming slang remains a complete mystery to me and my own innate american balderdash thus pocket refers to the quality of regans gadonkage and thalia refers to st cinnamon driving the mazdas out of swindenwith full historical immunity and for those sticklers who will want to point out the anachronisms in fool rest easy the whole book is an anachronism obviously there are even references to the mericans as a long extinct race which places our own time somewhere in the distant past long ago in a galaxy far away if you get my meaning it was designed thus in dealing with the geography of the play i looked for the modern locations that are mentioned in its text gloucester cornwall dover etc the only albany i could find is now more or less within the london metropolitan area so i set gonerils albany in scotland mainly to facilitate easy access to great birnam wood and the witches from macbeth dog snogging bongwater crash and bonking ewe on worms head and other towns are located in my imagination except that there really is a spot called worms head in wales the plot for shakespeares play king lear was lifted from a play that was produced in london perhaps ten years earlier called the tragedy of king leir the printed version of which has been lost king leir was performed in shakespeares time and there is no way of knowing what the text was but the story line was similar to the bards play and its fairly safe to say he was aware of it this was not unusual for shakespeare in fact of his thirtyeight plays its thought that only three sprang from ideas original to shakespeare even the text of king lear that we know was pieced together by alexander pope in from bits and pieces of previously printed versions interestingly enough in contrast to the tragedy englands first poet laureate nathan tate rewrote king lear with a happy ending wherein lear and cordelia are reunited and cordelia marries edgar and lives happily ever after tates happy ending version was performed for nearly two hundred years before popes version was revived for the stage and monmouths kings of britain indeed shows cordelia as becoming queen after leir and reigning for five years although again there is no historical record to support this a few who have read fool have expressed a desire to go back and read lear to perhaps compare the source material with my version of the story i dont remember the treeshagging parts in lear but it has been a long time while you could certainly find worse ways to spend your time i suspect that way madness lies fool quotes or paraphrases lines from no fewer than a dozen of the plays and im not even sure what came from which at this point ive done this largely to throw off reviewers who will be reluctant to cite and criticize passages of my writing lest they were penned by the bard hisownself i once had a reviewer take me to task for writing awkward prose and the passage he cited was one of my characters quoting thoreaus on civil disobedience you dont get many moments in life pointing that out to the reviewer was one of mine a note on one of pockets prejudices i know that the term fucking french seems to crop up quite a bit in pockets speech but that should in no way be interpreted as indicative of my own feelings about france or the french i love both but the alliteration was very seductive and i wanted to convey the sort of surface resentment the english seem to have for the french and to be fair the french for the english as one english friend explained to me oh yes we hate the french but we dont want anyone else to hate them they are ours we will fight to the death to preserve them so we can continue to hate them i dont care if thats true or not i thought it was funny or as one french acquaintance put it all englishmen are gay some simply dont know it and sleep with women im pretty sure thats not true but i thought it was funny the fucking french are great arent they finally i want to thank all the people who helped me in the research of fool the players and crew of the many shakespeare festivals i attended in northern california who keep the bards work alive for those of us in the hinterland of the colonies all of the great and gracious people in great britain and france who helped me find medieval sites and artifacts so i could completely ignore authenticity when writing fool and finally great writers of british comedy who inspired my plunge into the deep end of their art shakespeare oscar wilde g b shaw p g wodehouse h h munro saki evelyn waugh the goons tom stoppard the pythons douglas adams nick hornby ben elton jennifer saunders dawn french richard curtis eddie izzard and mil millington who assured me that while it was virtuous that i was writing a book wherein i aspired to call characters gits wankers and tossers i would be remiss and inauthentic if i neglected to call a few twats as well also thanks to charlee rodgers for her patient handling of logistic and travel arrangements for research nick ellison and his minions for handling business jennifer brehl for clean hands and composure in her editing jack womack for getting me in front of my readers as well as mike spradlin lisa gallagher debbie stier lynn grady and michael morrison for doing the dirty business of publishing oh yes and to my friends who put up with my obsessive nature and excessive whining
