gallows thief by bernard cornwell for antonia and jef prologue sir henry forrest banker and alderman of the city of london almost gagged when he entered the press yard for the smell was terrible worse than the reek of the sewer outflows where the fleet ditch oozed into the thames it was a stink from the cesspits of hell an eyewatering stench that took a mans breath away and made sir henry take an involuntary step backwards clap a handkerchief to his nose and hold his breath for fear that he was about to vomit sir henrys guide chuckled i dont notice the smell no more sir he said but i suppose its mortal bad in its way mortal bad mind the steps here sir do mind em sir henry gingerly took the handkerchief away and forced himself to speak why is it called the press yard in days gone by sir this is where the prisoners was pressed they was squashed sir weighed down by stones sir to persuade them to tell the truth we dont do it any longer sir mores the pity and as a consequence they lies like india rugs sir like india rugs the guide one of the prisons turnkeys was a fat man with leather breeches a stained coat and a stout billy club he laughed there aint a guilty man or woman in here sir not if you asks them sir henry tried to keep his breathing shallow so he would not have to inhale the noxious miasma of ordure sweat and rot there is sanitation here he asked very up to date sir henry very up to date proper drains in newgate sir we spoils them we do but theyre filthy animals sir filthy they fouls their own nest sir thats what they do they fouls their own nest the turnkey closed and bolted the barred gate by which they had entered the yard the condemned have the freedom of the press yard sir during daylight he said except on high days and holidays like today he grinned letting sir henry know that this was a jest they has to wait till were done sir and if you turn to your left you can join mister brown and the other gentlemen in the association room the association room sir henry enquired where the condemned associate sir during the daylight hours sir the turnkey explained except on high days and holidays like this one is today sir and those windows to your left sir those are the salt boxes sir henry saw at the end of the yard which was very narrow and long fifteen barred windows the windows were small darkshadowed and on three floors and the cells behind those windows were called the salt boxes he had no idea why they were called that and he did not like to ask in case he encouraged more of the turnkeys coarse humour but sir henry knew that the fifteen salt boxes were also known as the devils waiting rooms and the antechambers of hell they were newgates condemned cells a doomed man his eyes a mere glitter behind the thick bars stared back at sir henry who turned away as the turnkey hauled open the heavy door of the association room obliged to you sir henry obliged im sure the turnkey knuckled his forehead as sir henry offered him a shilling in thanks for his guidance through the prisons labyrinthine passages sir henry stepped into the association room where he was greeted by the keeper william brown a lugubrious man with a bald head and heavy jowls a stout priest wearing an oldfashioned wig a cassock stained surplice and geneva bands stood smiling unctuously beside the keeper pray allow me to name the ordinary the keeper said the reverend doctor horace cotton sir henry forrest sir henry took off his hat your servant doctor cotton at your service sir henry doctor cotton responded fulsomely after offering sir henry a deep bow the ordinarys oldfashioned wig was three plump billows of white fleece that framed his wheycoloured face there was a weeping boil on his left cheek while as a specific against the prisons smell a nosegay was tied around his neck just above the geneva bands sir henry the keeper confided to the prison chaplain is here on official duty ah doctor cottons eyes opened wide suggesting sir henry was in for a rare treat and is this your first such visit my first sir henry admitted i am persuaded you will find it edifying sir henry the priest said edifying the choice of word struck sir henry as inappropriate souls have been won for christ by this experience doctor cotton said sternly won for christ indeed he smiled then bowed obsequiously as the keeper ushered sir henry away to meet the other six guests who had come for the traditional newgate breakfast the last of the guests was called matthew logan and he needed no introduction for he and sir henry were old friends and because both were city aldermen they were considered very distinguished visitors this morning for the court of aldermen were the official governors of newgate prison the keeper and the ordinary whose salaries were fixed by the aldermen pressed coffee on the two men but both declined and logan took sir henrys arm and led him to the hearth where they could talk privately beside the smouldering embers and smoking ashes youre sure you want to see this through logan asked his friend solicitously you look damned pale sir henry was a goodlooking man lean tall and straightbacked with a clever and fastidious face he was a banker rich and successful his hair prematurely silver for he was only a few days past his fiftieth birthday gave him a distinguished appearance yet at that moment standing in front of the prisoners fireplace in the association room he looked old frail emaciated and sickly its the early morning logan he explained and im never at my shining best this close to dawn quite logan said pretending to believe his friends explanation but this aint an experience for everyone though i must say the breakfast afterwards is very good devilled kidneys this is probably my tenth or eleventh visit and the breakfast has yet to disappoint me how is lady forrest florence keeps well thank you for asking and your daughter eleanor will doubtless survive her troubles sir henry said drily a broken heart has yet to prove fatal except in poets damn poets logan sir henry said with a smile he held his hands towards the remnants of the fire that was waiting to be blown back into life the prisoners had left their cooking pots and cauldrons stacked about its edges and a pile of blackened potato peelings was curled in the ashes poor eleanor sir henry said if it was up to me logan id let her marry but florence wont hear of it and i suppose shes right mothers usually know best about such things logan said airily and then the rooms low murmur of conversation died as the guests turned towards a barred door that had opened with a sudden and harsh squeal for a heartbeat no one appeared in the doorway and it seemed all the guests held their breath but then to an audible gasp a man carrying a stout leather bag stumped into sight there was nothing about his appearance to explain the gasp he was burly redfaced and dressed in brown gaiters black breeches and a black coat that was buttoned too tightly over his protuberant belly he respectfully pulled off a shabby brown hat when he saw the waiting gentry but he offered no greeting and no one in the association room acknowledged his arrival that logan told sir henry under his breath is mister james botting more familiarly known as jemmy the petitioner sir henry asked softly the very same sir henry suppressed a shudder and reminded himself that men should not be judged by their outward appearance though it was hard not to disapprove of a being as ugly as james botting whose rawbeef slab of a face was disfigured by warts wens and scars his bald pate was surrounded by a fringe of lank brown hair that fell over his frayed collar and when he grimaced which he did every few seconds in a nervous habit he displayed yellow teeth and shrunken gums he had big hands which heaved a bench away from a table onto which he slung his leather bag he unbuckled the bag and conscious of being watched by the silent visitors brought out eight coils of thin white cord he placed the coils on the table where he fussily arranged them so that they were in a neat row and equidistant from each other next and with the air of a conjuror he took out four white cotton sacks each about a foot square that he placed by the coiled lines and last of all after glancing up to make sure he was still being observed he produced four heavy ropes made of threestranded hemp each rope looked to be about ten or twelve feet long and each had a noose tied into one end and an eye spliced in the other james botting laid the ropes on the table and then stepped back good morning gentlemen he said smartly oh botting william brown the keeper spoke in a tone which suggested he had only just noticed bottings presence a very good morning to you and a nice one it is too sir botting said i feared it might rain there was such a pain in my elbow joints but there aint a cloud in sight sir still just the four customers today sir just the four botting theyve drawn a good crowd sir they have a very good crowd good very good the keeper said vaguely then returned to his conversation with one of the breakfast guests sir henry looked back to his friend logan does botting know why were here i do hope not logan a banker like sir henry grimaced he might botch things if he did botch things how better to prove he needs an assistant logan suggested with a smile remind me what we pay him ten shillings and sixpence a week but there are emoluments the hand of glory for one and also the clothes and the ropes emoluments sir henry was puzzled logan smiled we watch the proceedings up to a point sir henry but then we retire for devilled kidneys and as soon as were gone mister botting will invite folk onto the scaffold for a touch of the dead mans hand its supposed to cure warts and i believe he charges one shilling and sixpence for each treatment and as for the prisoners clothes and the killing ropes he sells the clothes to madame tussaud if she wants them and if not then the clothes are sold as keepsakes and the rope is cut into fragments that are usually hawked about the streets believe me mister botting does not suffer from penury ive often thought we ought to offer the job of hangman to the highest bidder instead of paying the wretch a salary sir henry turned to look at bottings ravaged face the hand of glory doesnt seem to work on the hangman though does it not a pretty sight is he logan agreed with a smile then he held up his hand hear it sir henry could hear a clanking sound the room had fallen silent again and he felt a kind of chill dread he also despised himself for the prurience that had persuaded him to come to this breakfast then he shuddered as the door from the press yard opened another turnkey came into the room he knuckled his forehead to the keeper then stood beside a low slab of timber that squatted on the floor the turnkey held a stout hammer and sir henry wondered what its purpose was but he did not like to ask and then the guests closest to the door hauled off their hats because the sheriff and undersheriff had appeared in the doorway and were ushering the prisoners into the association room there were four of them three men and a young woman the latter was scarce more than a girl and had a pinched pale and frightened face brandy sir one of the keepers servants appeared beside matthew logan and sir henry thank you logan said and took two of the beakers he handed one to sir henry its bad brandy he said under his breath but a good precaution settles the stomach eh the prison bell suddenly began to toll the girl twitched at the sound then the turnkey with the hammer ordered her to put a foot onto the wooden anvil so her leg irons could be struck off sir henry who had long ceased to notice the prisons stench sipped the brandy and feared it would not stay down his head felt light unreal the turnkey hammered the rivets from the first manacle and sir henry saw that the girls ankle was a welt of sores other foot girl the turnkey said the bell tolled on and it would not stop now until all four bodies were cut down sir henry was aware that his hand was shaking i hear corn was fetching sixtythree shillings a quarter in norwich last week he said his voice too loud logan was gazing at the quivering girl she stole her mistresss necklace she did pearls she must have sold it for the necklace was never found then the tall fellow next in line is a highwayman pity he isnt hood eh still well see hood swing one day the other two murdered a grocer in southwark sixtythree a quarter eh its a wonder anyone can eat the girl moving awkwardly because she was unaccustomed to walking without leg irons shuffled away from the makeshift anvil she began crying and sir henry turned his back on her devilled kidneys you say the keeper always serves devilled kidneys on hanging days logan said its a tradition the hammer struck at the highwaymans leg irons the bell tolled and james botting snapped at the girl to come to him stand still girl he said drink that if you want it drink it all he pointed to a beaker of brandy that had been placed on the table next to the neatly coiled ropes the girl spilt some because her hands were shaking but she gulped the rest down and then dropped the tin mug which clattered on the flagstones she began to apologise for her clumsiness but botting interrupted her arms by your side girl he ordered her arms by your side i didnt steal anything she wailed quiet my child quiet the reverend cotton had moved to her side and put a hand on her shoulder god is our refuge and strength child and you must put your faith in him he kneaded her shoulder she was wearing a paleblue cotton dress with a drooping neckline and the priests fingers pressed and caressed her exposed white flesh the lord is a very present help in times of trouble the ordinary said his fingers leaving pinkish marks on her white skin and he will be thy comfort and guide do you repent your foul sins child i stole nothing sir henry forced himself to draw long breaths did you escape those brazilian loans he asked logan sold them on to drummonds logan said so im damned grateful to you henry damned grateful its eleanor you must thank sir henry said she saw a report in a paris newspaper and drew the right conclusions clever girl my daughter such a pity about the engagement logan said he was watching the doomed girl who cried aloud as botting pinioned her elbows with a length of cord he fastened them behind her back drawing the line so tight that she gasped with pain botting grinned at her cry then yanked the cord even tighter forcing the girl to throw her breasts forward so that they strained against the thin material of her cheap dress the reverend cotton leant close so that his breath was warm on her face you must repent child you must repent i didnt do it her breath was coming in gasps and tears were streaming down her distorted face hands in front girl botting snapped and when she awkwardly lifted her hands he seized one wrist encircling it with a second length of cord which he then looped about her other wrist her elbows were secured behind her body her wrists in front and because botting had pulled her elbows so tightly together he could not join her wrists with the cord but had to be content with linking them youre hurting me she wailed botting the keeper intervened shouldnt be my job to do the pinioning botting snarled but he loosened some of the tension from the cord holding her elbows and the girl nodded in pathetic thanks shed be a pretty thing logan said if she was cleaned up sir henry was counting the pots in the hearth everything seemed unreal god help me he thought god help me jemmy the highwayman his leg irons struck off greeted the hangman with a sneer come here lad botting ignored the familiarity drink that then put your arms by your side the highwayman put a coin on the table beside the brandy beaker for you jemmy good lad the hangman said quietly the coin would ensure that the highwaymans arms would not be pinioned too tightly and that his death would be as swift as botting could make it eleanor tells me shes recovered from the engagement sir henry said his back still to the prisoners but i dont believe her shes very unhappy i can tell mind you i sometimes wonder if shes being perverse perverse it occurs to me logan that her attraction to sandman has only increased since the engagement was broken he was a very decent young man logan said he is a very decent young man sir henry agreed but scrupulous logan said to a fault to a fault indeed sir henry said he was staring down at the floor now trying to ignore the girls soft sobbing young sandman is a good man a very good man but quite without prospects now utterly without prospects and eleanor cannot marry into a disgraced family indeed she cannot logan agreed she says she can but then eleanor would sir henry said then shook his head and none of it is rider sandmans fault but hes penniless now quite penniless logan frowned hes on halfpay surely sir henry shook his head he sold his commission gave the money towards the keep of his mother and sister he keeps his mother that dreadful woman poor sandman logan laughed softly but eleanor surely is not without suitors far from it sir henry sounded gloomy they queue up in the street logan but eleanor finds fault shes good at that logan said softly though without malice for he was fond of his friends daughter though he thought her overindulged it was true that eleanor was clever and too well read but that was no reason to spare her the bridle whip and spur still he said doubtless shell marry soon doubtless she will sir henry said drily for his daughter was not only attractive but it was also well known that sir henry would settle a generous income on her future husband which was why sir henry was sometimes tempted to let her marry rider sandman but her mother would not hear of it florence wanted eleanor to have a title and rider sandman had none and now he had no fortune either and so the marriage between captain sandman and miss forrest would not now take place sir henrys thoughts about his daughters prospects were driven away by a shriek from the doomed girl a wailing shriek so pitiful that sir henry turned in shocked enquiry to see that james botting had hung one of the heavy noosed ropes about her shoulders and the girl was shrinking from its touch as though the bridport hemp was soaked in acid quiet my dear the reverend cotton said then he opened his prayer book and took a step back from the four prisoners who were all now pinioned this was never the hangmans job james botting complained before the ordinary could begin reading the service for the burial of the dead the irons was struck and the pinioning was done in the yard in the yard by the yeoman of the halter by the yeoman of the halter it was never the hangmans job to do the pinioning he means it was done by his assistant logan muttered so he does know why were here sir henry commented as the sheriff and undersheriff both in floorlength robes and wearing chains of office and both carrying silvertipped staves and both evidently satisfied that the prisoners were properly prepared went to the keeper who formally bowed to them before presenting the sheriff with a sheet of paper i am the resurrection and the life the reverend cotton intoned in a loud voice he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live the sheriff glanced at the paper nodded in satisfaction and thrust it into a pocket of his furtrimmed robe until now the four prisoners had been in the care of the keeper of newgate but now they belonged to the sheriff of the city of london who formalities over crossed to sir henry with an outstretched hand and a welcoming smile youve come for the breakfast sir henry ive come as a matter of duty sir henry said sternly but its very good to see you rothwell you must certainly stay for the breakfast the sheriff said as the ordinary recited the prayers for the burial of the dead theyre very good devilled kidneys i could get a good breakfast at home sir henry said no i came because botting has petitioned for an assistant and we thought before justifying the expenditure that we should judge for ourselves whether or not one was needed you know mister logan the alderman and i are old acquaintances the sheriff said shaking logans hand the advantage of giving the man an assistant he added to sir henry in a low voice is that his replacement is already trained and if there is trouble on the scaffold well two men are better than one its good to see you sir henry and you mister logan he composed his face and turned to botting are you ready botting quite ready sir quite ready botting said scooping up the four white bags and thrusting them into a pocket we can talk at breakfast the sheriff said to sir henry devilled kidneys i smelt them cooking as i came through he hauled a turnip watch from a fob pocket and clicked open its lid time to go i think time to go the sheriff led the procession out of the association room and across the narrow press yard the reverend cotton had a hand on the girls neck guiding her as he read the burial service aloud the same service that he had intoned to the condemned prisoners in the chapel the day before the four prisoners had been in the famous black pew grouped about the coffin on the table and the ordinary had read them their burial service and then preached that they were being punished for their sin as god had decreed men and women should be punished he had described the waiting flames of hell told them of the devilish torments that were even then being prepared for them and he had reduced the girl and one of the two murderers to tears the chapels gallery had been filled with folk who had paid one shilling and sixpence apiece to witness the four doomed souls at their last church service the prisoners in the cells overlooking the press yard shouted protests and farewells as the procession passed sir henry was alarmed by the noise and surprised to hear a womans voice calling insults surely men and women dont share the cells he asked not any longer logan said then saw where his friend was looking and i assume shes no prisoner but a lady of the night sir henry they pay whats called bad money to the turnkeys so they can come and earn their living here bad money good lord sir henry looked pained and we allow that we ignore it logan said quietly on the understanding that its better to have whores in the prison than prisoners rioting the sheriff had led the procession down a flight of stone stairs into a tunnel that ran beneath the main prison to emerge at the lodge and the gloomy passage passed an empty cell with an open door thats where they spent their last night logan pointed into the cell the doomed girl was swaying and a turnkey took her elbow and hurried her along we brought nothing into this world the reverend cottons voice echoed from the tunnels damp granite walls and it is certain we can carry nothing out the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord i didnt steal anything the girl suddenly screamed quiet lass quiet the keeper growled all the men were nervous they wanted the prisoners to cooperate and the girl was very close to hysteria lord let me know mine end the ordinary prayed and the number of my days please the girl wailed no no please a second turnkey closed on her in case she collapsed and had to be carried the rest of the way but she stumbled on if they struggle too much logan told sir henry then theyre tied to a chair and hung that way but i confess i havent seen that happen in many many years though i do remember that langley had to do it once langley bottings predecessor youve seen a number of these things sir henry asked a good few logan admitted and you never i just conceived today as a duty sir henry watched the prisoners climb the steps at the end of the tunnel and wished he had not come he had never seen a violent death rider sandman who was to have been his soninlaw had seen much violent death because he had been a soldier and sir henry rather wished the younger man was here he had always liked sandman such a shame about his family at the top of the stairs was the lodge a cavernous entrance chamber that gave access to the street called the old bailey the door that led to the street was the debtors door and it stood open but no daylight showed for the scaffold had been built directly outside the noise of the crowd was loud now and the prison bell was muffled but the bell of saint sepulchres on the far side of newgate street was also tolling for the imminent deaths gentlemen the sheriff who was now in charge of the mornings proceedings turned to the breakfast guests if youll climb the steps to the scaffold gentlemen youll find chairs to right and left just leave two at the front for us if youd be so kind sir henry as he passed through the towering arch of the high debtors door saw in front of him the dark hollow underside of the scaffold and he thought how it was like being behind and underneath a stage supported by raw wooden beams black baize shrouded the planks at the front and side of the stage which meant that the only light came from the chinks between the timbers that formed the scaffolds elevated platform wooden stairs climbed to sir henrys right going up into the shadows before turning sharply left to emerge in a roofed pavilion that stood at the scaffolds rear the stairs and the platform all looked very substantial and it was hard to remember that the scaffold was only erected the day before an execution and dismantled immediately after the roofed pavilion was there to keep the honoured guests dry in inclement weather but today the morning sun shone on old bailey and was bright enough to make sir henry blink as he turned the corner of the stairs and emerged into the pavilion a huge cheer greeted the guests arrival no one cared who they were but their appearance presaged the coming of the prisoners old bailey was crowded every window that overlooked the street was crammed and there were even folk on the rooftops ten shillings logan said ten shillings sir henry was bemused again to rent a window logan explained unless its a celebrated crime being punished in which case the price goes up to two or even three guineas he pointed at a tavern that stood directly opposite the scaffold the magpie and stump has the most expensive windows because you can see right down into the pit where they drop he chuckled you can rent a telescope from the landlord and watch em die but we of course get the best view sir henry wanted to sit in the shadows at the back of the pavilion but logan had already taken one of the front chairs and sir henry just sat his head was ringing with the terrible noise that came from the street it was he decided just like being on a theatres stage he was overwhelmed and dazzled so many people everywhere faces looking up at the blackdraped platform the scaffold proper in front of the roofed pavilion was thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide and topped by a great beam that ran from the pavilions roof to the platforms end black iron butchers hooks were screwed into the beams underside and a ladder was propped against it a second ironic cheer greeted the sheriffs in their furtrimmed robes sir henry was sitting on a hard wooden chair that was slightly too small and desperately uncomfortable itll be the girl first logan said why shes the one theyve come to see logan said he was evidently enjoying himself and sir henry was surprised by that how little we know our friends he thought then he again wished that rider sandman was here because he suspected that the soldier would not approve of death made this easy or had sandman been hardened to violence i should let him marry her he said what logan had to raise his voice because the crowd was shouting for the prisoners to be brought on nothing sir henry said i will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle the reverend cottons voice grew louder as he climbed the stairs behind the girl while the ungodly is in my sight a turnkey came first then the girl and she was awkward on the steps because her legs were still not used to being without irons and the turnkey had to steady her when she half tripped on the top step then the crowd saw her hats off hats off the shout began at the front and echoed back it was not respect that caused the cry but rather because the taller hats of the folk in front obscured the view for those behind the roar of the crowd was massive crushing and then the people surged forward so that the city marshal and his men who protected the scaffold raised their staves and spears sir henry felt besieged by noise and by the thousands of people with open mouths shouting there were as many women as men in the crowd sir henry saw a respectablelooking matron stooping to a telescope in one of the windows of the magpie and stump beside her a man was eating bread and fried egg another woman had opera glasses a pieseller had set up his wares in a doorway pigeons red kites and sparrows circled the sky in panic because of the noise sir henry his mind swimming suddenly noticed the four open coffins that lay on the scaffolds edge they were made of rough pine and were unplaned and resinous the girls mouth was open and her face which had been pale was now red and distorted tears ran down her cheeks as botting took her by a pinioned elbow and led her onto the planks at the platforms centre that centre was a trapdoor and it creaked under their weight the girl was shaking and gasping as botting positioned her under the beam at the platforms far end once she was in place botting took a cotton bag from his pocket and pulled it over her hair so that it looked like a hat she screamed at his touch and tried to twist away from him but the reverend cotton put a hand on her arm as the hangman took the rope from her shoulders and clambered up the ladder he was heavy and the rungs creaked alarmingly he slotted the small spliced eye over one of the big black butchers hooks then climbed awkwardly back down redfaced and breathing hard i need an assistant dont i he grumbled aint fair man always has an assistant dont fidget missy go like a christian he looked the girl in the eyes as he pulled the noose down around her head he tightened the slip knot under her left ear then gave the rope a small jerk as if to satisfy himself that it would take her weight she gasped at the jerk then screamed because botting had his hands on her hair keep still girl he snarled then pulled down the white cotton bag so that it covered her face she screamed i want to see sir henry closed his eyes for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday the ordinary had raised his voice so he could be heard above the crowds seething din the second prisoner the highwayman was on the scaffold now and botting stood him beside the girl crammed the bag on his head and climbed the ladder to fix the rope o teach us to number our days the reverend cotton read in a singsong voice that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom amen sir henry said fervently too fervently here logan nudged sir henry whose eyes were still closed and held out a flask good brandy smuggled the highwayman had flowers in his buttonhole he bowed to the crowd that cheered him but his bravado was forced for sir henry could see the mans leg trembling and his bound hands twitching head up darling he told the girl beside him children were in the crowd one girl she could not have been a day over six years of age sat on her fathers shoulders and sucked her thumb the crowd cheered each arriving prisoner a group of sailors with long tarred pigtails shouted at botting to pull down the girls dress show us her bubbies jemmy go on flop em out be over soon the highwayman told the girl you and ill be with the angels girl i didnt steal anything the girl wailed admit your guilt confess your sins the reverend cotton urged the four prisoners who were all now lined up on the trapdoor the girl was furthest from sir henry and she was shaking all four had cotton bags over their faces and all had nooses about their necks go to god with a clean breast the ordinary urged them cleanse your conscience abase yourselves before god go on jemmy a sailor called strip the frows frock off the crowd shouted for silence hoping there would be some final words i did nothing the girl screamed go to hell you fat bastard one of the murderers snarled at the ordinary see you in hell cotton the highwayman called to the priest now botting the sheriff wanted it done quickly and botting scuttled to the back of the scaffold where he stooped and hauled a wooden bolt the size of a rolling pin from a plank sir henry tensed himself but nothing happened the bolt logan explained softly is merely a locking device he has to go below to release the trap sir henry said nothing he shrank aside as botting brushed past him to go down the stairs at the back of the pavilion only the four condemned and the ordinary were now out in the sunlight the reverend cotton stood between the coffins well clear of the trapdoor for when thou art angry all our days are gone he chanted we bring our years to an end as it were a tale that is told fat bastard cotton the highwayman shouted the girl was swaying and under the thin cotton that hid her face sir henry could see her mouth was opening and closing the hangman had vanished under the platform and was clambering through the beams that supported the scaffold to reach a rope that pulled out the baulk of timber that supported the trapdoor turn thee again o lord the reverend cotton had raised one hand to the heavens and his voice to the skies at the last and be gracious unto thy servants botting jerked the rope and the timber shifted but did not slide all the way sir henry unaware that he was holding his breath saw the trapdoor twitch the girl sobbed and her legs gave way so that she collapsed on the stillclosed trapdoor the crowd uttered a collective yelp that died away when they realised the bodies had not dropped then botting gave the rope an almighty heave and the timber shifted and the trapdoor swung down to let the four bodies fall it was a short drop only five or six feet and it killed none of them it was quicker when they used the cart at tyburn logan said leaning forward but we get more morris this way sir henry did not need to ask what logan meant the four were twitching jerking and twisting they were doing the morris dance of the scaffold the hempen measure the dying capers that came from the stifling killing throttling struggles of the doomed botting hidden down in the scaffolds well leapt aside as the girls bowels released themselves sir henry saw none of it for his eyes were closed and he did not even open them when the crowd cheered itself hoarse because botting using the highwaymans pinioned elbows as a stirrup climbed up to squat like a black toad on the mans shoulders to hasten his dying the highwayman had paid botting so he would die more quickly and botting was keeping faith with the bribe behold i show you a mystery the ordinary ignored the grinning botting who clung like a monstrous hump on the dying mans back we shall not all sleep cotton intoned but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye theres the first one gone logan said as botting clambered down from the corpses back and ive got a mortal appetite now by god i have an appetite three of the four still danced but ever more feebly the dead highwayman swung with canted head as botting hauled on the girls ankles sir henry smelt dung human dung and he could suddenly take no more of the spectacle and so he stumbled down the scaffold steps into the cool dark stone shelter of the lodge he vomited there then gasped for breath and waited listening to the crowd and to the creak of the scaffolds timbers until it was time to go for breakfast for devilled kidneys it was a tradition chapter one rider sandman was up late that monday morning because he had been paid seven guineas to play for sir john harts eleven against a sussex team the winners to share a bonus of a hundred guineas and sandman had scored sixtythree runs in the first innings and thirtytwo in the second and those were respectable scores by any standards but sir johns eleven had still lost that had been on the saturday and sandman watching the other batsmen swing wildly at illbowled balls had realised that the game was being thrown the bookmakers were being fleeced because sir johns team had been expected to win handily not least because the famed rider sandman was playing for it but someone must have bet heavily on the sussex eleven which in the event won the game by an innings and fortyeight runs rumour said that sir john himself had bet against his own side and sir john would not meet sandmans eyes which made the rumour believable so captain rider sandman walked back to london he walked because he refused to share a carriage with men who had accepted bribes to lose a match he loved cricket he was good at it he had once famously scored a hundred and fourteen runs for an england eleven playing against the marquess of canfields picked men and lovers of the game would travel many miles to see captain rider sandman late of his majestys nd regiment of foot perform at the batting crease but he hated bribery and he detested corruption and he possessed a temper and that was why he fell into a furious argument with his treacherous teammates and when they slept that night in sir johns comfortable house and rode back to london in comfort next morning sandman did neither he was too proud proud and poor he could not afford the stagecoach fare nor even a common carriers fare because in his anger he had thrown his match fee back into sir john harts face and that sandman conceded had been a stupid thing to do for he had earnt that money honestly yet even so it had felt dirty so he walked home spending the saturday night in a hayrick somewhere near hickstead and trudging all that sunday until the right sole was almost clean off his boot he reached drury lane very late that night and he dropped his cricket gear on the floor of his rented attic room and stripped himself naked and fell into the narrow bed and slept just slept and was still sleeping when the trapdoor dropped in old bailey and the crowds cheer sent a thousand wings startling up into the smoky london sky sandman was still dreaming at half past eight he was dreaming twitching and sweating he called out in incoherent alarm his ears filled with the thump of hooves and the crash of muskets and cannon his eyes astonished by the hook of sabres and slashes of straightbladed swords and this time the dream was going to end with the cavalry smashing through the thin redcoated ranks but then the rattle of hooves melded into a rush of feet on the stairs and a sketchy knock on his flimsy attic door he opened his eyes realised he was no longer a soldier and then before he could call out any response sally hood was in the room for a second sandman thought the flurry of bright eyes calico dress and golden hair was a dream then sally laughed i bleeding woke you gawd im sorry she turned to go its all right miss hood sandman fumbled for his watch he was sweating whats the time saint giles just struck half after eight she told him oh my lord sandman could not believe he had slept so late he had nothing to get up for but the habit of waking early had long taken hold he sat up in bed remembered he was naked and snatched the thin blanket up to his chest theres a gown hanging on the door miss hood would you be so kind sally found the dressing gown its just that im late she explained her sudden appearance in his room and my brothers brushed off and ive got work and the dress has to be hooked up see she turned her back showing a length of bare spine id have asked mrs gunn to do it sally went on only theres a hanging today so shes off watching gawd knows what she can see considering shes half blind and all drunk but she does like a good hanging and she aint got many pleasures left at her age its all right you can get up now ive got me peepers shut sandman climbed out of bed warily for there was only a limited area in his tiny attic room where he could stand without banging his head on the beams he was a tall man an inch over six foot with palegold hair blue eyes and a long rawboned face he was not conventionally handsome his face was too rugged for that but there was a capability and a kindness in his expression that made him memorable he pulled on the dressing gown and tied its belt you say youve got work he asked sally a good job i hope aint what i wanted sally said because it aint on deck deck stage captain she said she called herself an actress and perhaps she was though sandman had seen little evidence that the stage had much use for sally who like sandman clung to the very edge of respectability and was held there it seemed by her brother a very mysterious young man who worked strange hours but it aint bad work she went on and it is respectable im sure it is sandman said sensing that sally did not really want to talk about it and he wondered why she sounded so defensive about a respectable job and sally wondered why sandman who was palpably a gentleman was renting an attic room in the wheatsheaf tavern in londons drury lane down on his luck that was for sure but even so the wheatsheaf perhaps he knew no better the wheatsheaf was famously a flash tavern a home for every kind of thief from pickpockets to petermen from burglars to shopbreakers and it seemed to sally that captain rider sandman was as straight as a ramrod but he was a nice man sally thought he treated her like a lady and though she had only spoken to him a couple of times as they edged past each other in the inns corridors she had detected a kindness in him enough kindness to let her presume on his privacy this monday morning and what about you captain she asked you working im looking for employment miss hood sandman said and that was true but he was not finding any he was too old to be an apprentice clerk not qualified to work in the law or with money and too squeamish to accept a job driving slaves in the sugar islands i heard you was a cricketer sally said i am yes a famous one my brother says im not sure about that sandman said modestly but you can earn money at that cant you not as much as i need sandman said and then only in summer and if he was willing to endure the bribes and corruption of the game and i have a small problem here some of the hooks are missing thats cos i never get round to mending them sally said so just do what you can she was staring at his mantel on which was a pile of letters their edges frayed suggesting they had all been sent a long time in the past she swayed forward slightly and managed to see that the topmost envelope was addressed to a miss someone or other she could not make out the name but the one word revealed that captain sandman had been jilted and had his letters returned poor captain sandman sally thought and sometimes sandman went on where there are hooks there are no eyes which is why i brought this sally said dangling a frayed silk handkerchief over her shoulder thread it through the gaps captain make me decent so today i shall call on some acquaintances sandman reverted to her earlier question and see if they can offer me employment and then this afternoon i shall yield to temptation ooh sally smiled over her shoulder all blue eyes and sparkle temptation i shall watch some cricket at the artillery ground wouldnt tempt me sally said and by the by captain if youre going down to breakfast then do it quick cos you wont get a bite after nine oclock i wont sandman asked though in truth he had no intention of paying the tavern for a breakfast he could not afford the sheafs always crowded when theres a hanging at newgate sally explained cos the folk want their breakfasts on their way back see makes em hungry thats where my brother went he always goes down old bailey when theres a scragging they like him to be there who does his friends he usually knows one of the poor bastards being twisted see twisted hanged captain hanged twisted crapped nubbed scragged or jack ketched doing the newgate morris dancing on jemmy bottings stage rope gargling youll have to learn the flash language if you live here captain i can see i will sandman said and had just begun to thread the handkerchief through the dresss gaping back when dodds the inns errand boy pushed through the halfopen door and grinned to discover sally hood in captain sandmans room and captain sandman doing up her frock and him with tousled hair and dressed in nothing but a frayed old dressing gown youll catch flies if you dont close your bloody gob sally told dodds and he aint my boman you spoony little bastard hes just hooking me up cos my brother and mother gunn have gone to the crap which is where youll end up if theres any bleeding justice dodds ignored this tirade and held a sealed paper towards sandman letter for you captain youre very kind sandman said and stooped to his folded clothes to find a penny wait a moment he told the boy who in truth had shown no inclination to leave until he was tipped dont you bug him nothing sally protested she pushed sandmans hand away and snatched the letter from dodds the little toerag forgot it didnt he no bleeding letter arrived this morning how longs it been dodds looked at her sullenly came on friday he finally admitted if a bleeding letter comes on friday then you bleeding deliver it on friday now on your trotters and fake away off she slammed the door on the boy lazy little bleeder they should take him down bleeding newgate and make him do the scaffold hornpipe that would stretch his lazy bloody neck sandman finished threading the silk handkerchief through the gaps in the dresss fastenings then stepped back and nodded you look very fetching miss hood you think so i do indeed sandman said the dress was pale green printed with cornflowers and the colours suited sallys honeycoloured skin and curly hair that was as gold as sandmans own she was a pretty girl with clear blue eyes a skin unscarred by pox and a contagious smile the dress really does become you he said its the only half good one ive got she said so it had better suit thank you she held out his letter close your eyes turn round three times then say your loved ones name aloud before you open it sandman smiled and what will that achieve it will mean good news captain she said earnestly good news she smiled and was gone sandman listened to her footsteps on the stairs then looked at the letter perhaps it was an answer to one of his enquiries about a job it was certainly a very high class of paper and the handwriting was educated and stylish he put a finger under the flap ready to break the seal then paused he felt like a fool but he closed his eyes turned three times then spoke his loved ones name aloud eleanor forrest he said then opened his eyes tore off the letters red wax seal and unfolded the paper he read the letter read it again and tried to work out whether or not it really was good news the right honourable the viscount sidmouth presented his compliments to captain rider sandman and requested the honour of a call at captain sandmans earliest convenience preferably in the forenoon at lord sidmouths office a prompt reply to lord sidmouths private secretary mister sebastian witherspoon would be appreciated sandmans first instinct was that the letter must be bad news that his father had dunned the viscount sidmouth as he had dunned so many others and that his lordship was writing to make a claim on the pathetic shreds of the sandman estate yet that was nonsense his father so far as rider sandman knew had never encountered lord sidmouth and he would surely have boasted if he had for sandmans father had liked the company of important men and there were few men more important than the right honourable henry addington first viscount sidmouth erstwhile prime minister of great britain and now his majestys principal secretary of state in the home department so why did the home secretary want to see rider sandman there was only one way to find out so sandman put on his cleanest shirt buffed his fraying boots with his dirtiest shirt brushed his coat and thus belying his poverty by dressing as the gentleman he was went to see lord sidmouth ooooooo the viscount sidmouth was a thin man he was thinlipped and thinhaired had a thin nose and a thin jaw that narrowed to a weaselthin chin and his eyes had all the warmth of thinly knapped flint and his thin voice was precise dry and unfriendly his nickname was the doctor a nickname without warmth or affection but apt for he was clinical disapproving and cold he had made sandman wait for two and a quarter hours though as sandman had come to the office without an appointment he could scarce blame the home secretary for that now as a bluebottle buzzed against one of the high windows lord sidmouth frowned across the desk at his visitor you were recommended by sir john colborne sandman bowed his head in acknowledgement but said nothing there was nothing to say a grandfather clock ticked loud in a corner of the office you were in sir johns battalion at waterloo sidmouth said is that not so i was my lord yes sidmouth grunted as though he did not entirely approve of men who had been at waterloo and that sandman reflected might well have been the case for britain now seemed divided between those who had fought against the french and those who had stayed at home the latter sandman suspected were jealous and liked to suggest oh so delicately that they had sacrificed an opportunity to gallivant abroad because of the need to keep britain prosperous the wars against napoleon were two years in the past now yet still the divide remained though sir john colborne must possess some influence with the government if his recommendation had brought sandman to this office sir john tells me you seek employment the home secretary asked i must my lord must sidmouth pounced on the word must but you are on half pay surely and half pay is not an ungenerous emolument i would have thought the question was asked very sourly as though his lordship utterly disapproved of paying pensions to men who were capable of earning their own livings im not eligible for half pay my lord sandman said he had sold his commission and because it was peacetime he had received less than he had hoped though it had been enough to secure a lease on a house for his mother you have no income sebastian witherspoon the home secretarys private secretary asked from his chair beside his masters desk some sandman said and decided it was probably best not to say that the small income came from playing cricket the viscount sidmouth did not look like a man who would approve of such a thing not enough sandman amended his answer and much of what i do earn goes towards settling my fathers smaller debts the tradesmens debts he added in case the home secretary thought he was trying to pay off the massive sums owing to the wealthy investors witherspoon frowned in law sandman he said you are not responsible for any of your fathers debts i am responsible for my familys good name sandman responded lord sidmouth gave a snort of derision that could have been in mockery of sandmans good name or an ironic response to his evident scruples or more likely was a comment on sandmans father who faced with the threat of imprisonment or exile because of his massive debts had taken his own life and thus left his name disgraced and his wife and family ruined the home secretary gave sandman a long sour inspection then turned to look at the bluebottle thumping against the window the grandfather clock ticked hollow the room was hot and sandman was uncomfortably aware of the sweat soaking his shirt the silence stretched and sandman suspected the home secretary was weighing the wisdom of offering employment to ludovic sandmans son wagons rumbled in the street beneath the windows hooves sounded sharp and then at last lord sidmouth made up his mind i need a man to undertake a job he said still gazing at the window though i should warn you that it is not a permanent position in no way is it permanent it is anything but permanent witherspoon put in sidmouth scowled at his secretarys contribution the position is entirely temporary he said then gestured towards a great basket that stood waist high on the carpeted floor and was crammed with papers some were scrolls some were folded and sealed with wax while a few showed legal pretensions by being wrapped in scraps of red ribbon those captain he said are petitions lord sidmouths tone made it plain that he loathed petitions a condemned felon may petition the king in council for clemency or indeed for a full pardon that is their prerogative captain and all such petitions from england and wales come to this office we receive close to two thousand a year it seems that every person condemned to death manages to have a petition sent on their behalf and they must all be read are they not all read witherspoon sidmouths secretary a young man with plump cheeks sharp eyes and elegant manners nodded they are certainly examined my lord it would be remiss of us to ignore such pleas remiss indeed sidmouth said piously and if the crime is not too heinous captain and if persons of quality are willing to speak for the condemned then we might show clemency we might commute a sentence of death to say one of transportation you my lord sandman asked struck by sidmouths use of the word we the petitions are addressed to the king the home secretary explained but the responsibility for deciding on the response is properly left to this office and my decisions are then ratified by the privy council and i can assure you captain that i mean ratified they are not questioned indeed not witherspoon sounded amused i decide sidmouth declared truculently it is one of the responsibilities of this high office captain to decide which felons will hang and which will be spared there are hundreds of souls in australia captain who owe their lives to this office and i am certain my lord witherspoon put in smoothly that their gratitude is unbounded sidmouth ignored his secretary instead he tossed a scrolled and ribboned petition to sandman and once in a while he went on once in a very rare while a petition will persuade us to investigate the facts of the matter on those rare occasions captain we appoint an investigator but it is not something we like to do he paused obviously inviting sandman to enquire why the home office was so reluctant to appoint an investigator but sandman seemed oblivious to the question as he slid the ribbon from the scroll a person condemned to death the home secretary offered the explanation anyway has already been tried he or she has been judged and found guilty by a court of law and it is not the business of his majestys government to revisit facts that have been considered by the proper courts it is not our policy captain to undermine the judiciary but once in a while very infrequently we do investigate that petition is just such a rare case sandman unrolled the petition which was written in brownish ink on cheap yellow paper as god is my wittness he read hee is a good boy and could never have killd the lady avebury as god knows hee could not hert even a flie there was much more in the same manner but sandman could not read on because the home secretary had started to talk again the matter lord sidmouth explained concerns charles corday that is not his real name the petition as you can see for yourself comes from cordays mother who subscribes herself as cruttwell but the boy seems to have adopted a french name god knows why he stands convicted of murdering the countess of avebury you doubtless recollect the case i fear not my lord sandman said he had never taken much interest in crime had never bought the newgate calendars nor read the broadsheets that celebrated notorious felons and their savage deeds theres no mystery about it the home secretary said the wretched man raped and stabbed the countess of avebury and he thoroughly deserves to hang he is due on the scaffold when he turned to witherspoon a week from today my lord witherspoon said if theres no mystery my lord sandman said then why investigate the facts because the petitioner maisie cruttwell sidmouth spoke the name as though it tasted sour on his tongue is a seamstress to her majesty queen charlotte and her majesty has graciously taken an interest lord sidmouths voice made it plain that he could have gladly strangled king george iiis wife for being so gracious it is my responsibility captain and my loyal duty to reassure her majesty that every possible enquiry has been made and that there is not the slightest doubt about the wretched mans guilt i have therefore written to her majesty to inform her that i am appointing an investigator who will examine the facts and thus offer an assurance that justice is indeed being done sidmouth had explained all this in a bored voice but now pointed a bony forefinger at sandman i am asking whether you will be that investigator captain and whether you comprehend what is needed sandman nodded you wish to reassure the queen my lord and to do that you must be entirely satisfied of the prisoners guilt no sidmouth snapped and sounded genuinely angry i am already entirely satisfied of the mans guilt corday or whatever he chooses to call himself was convicted after the due process of the law it is the queen who needs reassurance i understand sandman said witherspoon leant forward forgive the question captain but youre not of a radical disposition radical you do not have objections to the gallows for a man who rapes and kills sandman sounded indignant of course not the answer was honest enough though in truth sandman had not thought much about the gallows it was not something he had ever seen though he knew there was a scaffold at newgate a second south of the river at the horsemonger lane prison and another in every assize town of england and wales once in a while he would hear an argument that the scaffold was being used too widely or that it was a nonsense to hang a hungry villager for stealing a fiveshilling lamb but few folk wanted to do away with the noose altogether the scaffold was a deterrent a punishment and an example it was a necessity it was civilisations machine and it protected all lawabiding citizens from their predators witherspoon satisfied with sandmans indignant answer smiled i did not think you were a radical he said emolliently but one must be sure so lord sidmouth glanced at the grandfather clock will you undertake to be our investigator he expected an immediate answer but sandman hesitated that hesitation was not because he did not want the job but because he doubted he possessed the qualifications to be an investigator of crime but then he wondered who did lord sidmouth mistook the hesitation for reluctance the job will hardly tax you captain he said testily the wretch is plainly guilty and one merely wishes to satisfy the queens womanly concerns a months pay for a days work he paused and sneered or do you fear the appointment will interfere with your cricket sandman needed a months pay and so he ignored the insults of course i shall do it my lord he said i shall be honoured witherspoon stood the signal that the audience was over and the home secretary nodded his farewell witherspoon will provide you with a letter of authorisation he said and i shall look forward to receiving your report good day to you sir your servant my lord sandman bowed but the home secretary was already attending to other business sandman followed the secretary into an anteroom where a clerk was busy at a table it will take a moment to seal your letter witherspoon said so please sit sandman had brought the corday petition with him and now read it all the way through though he gleaned little more information from the illwritten words the condemned mans mother who had signed the petition with a cross had merely dictated an incoherent plea for mercy her son was a good boy she claimed a harmless soul and a christian but beneath her pleas were two damning comments preposterous the first read he is guilty of a heinous crime while the second comment in a crabbed handwriting stated let the law take its course sandman showed the petition to witherspoon who wrote the comments the second is the home secretarys decision witherspoon said and was written before we knew her majesty was involved and the first thats from the judge who passed sentence it is customary to refer all petitions to the relevant judge before a decision is made in this case it was sir john silvester you know him i fear not hes the recorder of london and as you may deduce from that a most experienced judge certainly not a man to allow a gross miscarriage of justice in his courtroom he handed a letter to the clerk your name must be on the letter of authorisation of course are there any pitfalls in its spelling no sandman said and then as the clerk wrote his name on the letter he read the petition again but it presented no arguments against the facts of the case maisie cruttwell claimed her son was innocent but could adduce no proof of that assertion instead she was appealing to the king for mercy why did you ask me sandman asked witherspoon i mean you must have used someone else as an investigator in the past were they unsatisfactory mister talbot was entirely satisfactory witherspoon said he was now searching for the seal that would authenticate the letter but he died ah a seizure witherspoon said very tragic and why you because as the home secretary informed you you were recommended he was scrabbling through the contents of a drawer looking for the seal i had a cousin at waterloo he went on a captain witherspoon a hussar he was on the dukes staff did you know him no alas he died i am sorry to hear it it was perhaps for the best witherspoon said he had at last found the seal he always said that he feared the wars ending what excitement he wondered could peace bring it was a common enough fear in the army sandman said this letter the secretary was now heating a stick of wax over a candle flame confirms that you are making enquiries on behalf of the home office and it requests all persons to offer you their cooperation though it does not require them to do so note that distinction captain note it well we have no legal right to demand cooperation he said as he dripped the wax onto the letter then carefully pushed the seal into the scarlet blob so we can only request it i would be grateful if you would return this letter to me upon the conclusion of your enquiries and as to the nature of those enquiries captain i suggest they need not be laborious there is no doubt of the mans guilt corday is a rapist a murderer and a liar and all we need of him is a confession you will find him in newgate and if you are sufficiently forceful then i have no doubt he will confess to his brutal crime and your work will then be done he held out the letter i expect to hear from you very soon we shall require a written report but please keep it brief he suddenly withheld the letter to give his next words an added force what we do not want captain is to complicate matters provide us with a succinct report that will allow my master to reassure the queen that there are no possible grounds for a pardon and then let us forget the wretched matter suppose he doesnt confess sandman asked make him witherspoon said forcefully he will hang anyway captain whether you have submitted your report or not it would simply be more convenient if we could reassure her majesty of the mans guilt before the wretch is executed and if hes innocent sandman asked witherspoon looked appalled at the suggestion how can he be hes already been found guilty of course he has sandman said then took the letter and slipped it into the tail pocket of his coat his lordship he spoke awkwardly mentioned an emolument he hated talking of money it was so ungentlemanly but so was his poverty indeed he did witherspoon said we usually paid twenty guineas to mister talbot but i would find it hard to recommend the same fee in this case it really is too trivial a matter so i shall authorise a draft for fifteen guineas i shall send it to you where he glanced down at his notebook then looked shocked really the wheatsheaf in drury lane indeed sandman said stiffly he knew witherspoon deserved an explanation for the wheatsheaf was notorious as a haunt of criminals but sandman had not known of that reputation when he asked for a room and he did not think he needed to justify himself to witherspoon im sure you know best witherspoon said dubiously sandman hesitated he was no coward indeed he had the reputation of being a brave man but that reputation had been earnt in the smoke of battle and what he did now took all his courage you mentioned a draft mister witherspoon he said and i wondered whether i might persuade you to cash there will be inevitable expenses his voice tailed away because for the life of him he could not think what those expenses might be both witherspoon and the clerk stared at sandman as though he had just dropped his breeches cash witherspoon asked in a small voice sandman knew he was blushing you want the matter resolved swiftly he said and there could be contingencies that will require expenditure i cannot foresee the nature of those contingencies but he shrugged and again his voice tailed away prendergast witherspoon looked at sandman even as he spoke to the clerk pray go to mister hodges office present him with my compliments and ask him to advance us fifteen guineas he paused still looking at sandman in cash the money was found it was given and sandman left the home office with pockets heavy with gold damn poverty he thought but the rent was due at the wheatsheaf and it had been three days since he had eaten a proper meal but fifteen guineas he could afford a meal now a meal some wine and an afternoon of cricket it was a tempting vision but sandman was not a man to shirk duty the job of being the home offices investigator might be temporary but if he finished this first enquiry swiftly then he might look for other and more lucrative assignments from lord sidmouth and that was an outcome devoutly to be wished and so he would forgo the meal forget the wine and postpone the cricket for there was a murderer to see and a confession to obtain and sandman went to fetch it ooooooo in old bailey a funnelshaped thoroughfare that narrowed as it ran from newgate street to ludgate hill the scaffold was being taken down the black baize that had draped the platform was already folded onto a small cart and two men were now handing down the heavy beam from which the four victims had been hanged the first broadsheets describing the executions and the crimes that had caused them were being hawked for a penny apiece to the vestiges of the mornings crowd who had waited to see jemmy botting haul the four dead bodies up from the hanging pit sit them on the edge of the drop while he removed the nooses and then heave them into their coffins then a handful of spectators had climbed to the scaffold to have one of the dead mens hands touched to their warts boils or tumours the coffins had at last been carried into the prison but some folk still lingered just to watch the scaffolds dismemberment two hawkers were selling what they claimed were portions of the fatal ropes bewigged and blackrobed lawyers hurried between the lamb inn the magpie and stump and the courts of the session house that had been built next to the prison traffic had been allowed back into the street so sandman had to dodge between wagons carriages and carts to reach the prison gate where he expected warders and locks but instead he found a uniformed porter at the top of the steps and dozens of folk coming and going women were carrying parcels of food babies and bottles of gin beer or rum children ran and screamed while two aproned tapmen from the magpie and stump across the street delivered cooked meals on wooden trays to prisoners who could afford their services your honour is looking for someone the porter seeing sandmans confusion had pushed through the crowd to intercept him i am looking for charles corday sandman said and when the porter looked bemused added that he had come from the home office my name is sandman he explained captain sandman and im lord sidmouths official investigator he drew out the letter with its impressive home office seal ah the porter was quite uninterested in the letter youve replaced mister talbot god rest his soul a proper gentleman he was sir sandman put the letter away i should perhaps pay my respects to the governor he suggested the keeper sir mister brown is the keeper sir and he wont thank you for any respects sir on account that they aint needful you just goes in sir and sees the prisoner mister talbot now god rest him he took them to one of the empty salt boxes and had a little chat the porter grinned and mimed a punching action a great one for the truth was mister talbot a big man he was but so are you what was your fellow called corday hes condemned is he then youll find him in the press yard your honour are you carrying a stick sir a stick a pistol sir no some gentlemen do but weapons aint advisable sir on account that the bastards might overpower you and a word of advice captain the porter his breath reeking of rum turned and took hold of sandmans lapel to add emphasis to his next words hell tell you he didnt do it sir there aint a guilty man in here not one not if you ask them theyll all swear on their mothers lives they didnt do it but they did they all did he grinned and released his grip on sandmans coat do you have a watch sir you do sir best not take anything in that might be stolen itll be in the cupboard here sir under lock key and my eye round that corner sir youll find some stairs go down sir follow the tunnel and dont mind the smell mind your backs this last call was to all the folk in the lobby because four workmen accompanied by three watchmen armed with truncheons were carrying a plain wooden coffin out through the prison door its the girl what was stretched this morning sir the porter confided in sandman shes going to the surgeons the gentlemen do like a young lady to dissect they do down the stairs sir and follow your nose the smell of unwashed bodies reminded sandman of spanish billets crowded with tired redcoats and the stench became even more noxious as he followed the stoneflagged tunnel to where more stairs climbed to a guardroom beside a massive barred gate that led into the press yard two turnkeys both armed with cudgels guarded the gate charles corday one responded when sandman enquired where the prisoner might be found you cant miss him if he aint in the yard then hell be in the association room he pointed to an open door across the yard he looks like a bleeding mort thats why you cant mistake him a mort the man unbolted the gate he looks like a bloody girl sir he said scornfully pal of his are you the man grinned then the grin faded as sandman turned and stared at him i dont see him in the yard sir the turnkey had been a soldier and he instinctively straightened his back and became respectful under sandmans gaze so hell be in the association room sir that door over there sir the press yard was a narrow space compressed between high dank buildings what little light came into the yard arrived over a thicket of spikes that crowned the newgate street wall beside which a score of prisoners easily identifiable because of their leg irons sat with their visitors children played round an open drain a blind man sat by the steps leading to the cells muttering to himself and scratching at the open sores on his manacled ankles a drunk also in chains lay sleeping while a woman evidently his wife wept silently beside him she mistook sandman for a wealthy man and held out a begging hand have pity on a poor woman your honour have pity sandman went into the association room which was a large space filled with tables and benches a coal fire burnt in a big grate where stew pots hung from a crane the pots were being stirred by two women who were evidently cooking for a dozen folk seated round one of the long tables the only turnkey in the room a youngish man armed with a truncheon was also at the table sharing a gin bottle and the laughter which died abruptly when sandman appeared then the other tables fell silent as forty or fifty folk turned to look at the newcomer someone spat something about sandman maybe his height spoke of authority and this was not a place where authority was welcome corday sandman called his voice taking on the familiar officers tone im looking for charles corday no one answered corday sandman called again sir the answering voice was tremulous and came from the rooms furthest and darkest corner sandman threaded his way through the tables to see a pathetic figure curled against the wall there charles corday was very young he looked scarce more than seventeen and he was thin to the point of frailty with a deathly pale face framed by long fair hair that did indeed look girlish he had long eyelashes a trembling lip and a dark bruise on one cheek youre charles corday sandman felt an instinctive dislike of the young man who looked too delicate and selfpitying yes sir cordays right arm was shaking stand up sandman ordered corday blinked in surprise at the tone of command but obeyed flinching because the leg irons bit into his ankles ive been sent by the home secretary sandman said and i need somewhere private where we can talk we can use the cells perhaps do we reach them from here or from the yard the yard sir corday said though he scarcely seemed to have understood the rest of sandmans words sandman led corday towards the door is he your boman charlie a man in leg shackles enquired come for a farewell cuddle has he the other prisoners laughed but sandman had the experienced officers ability to know when to ignore insubordination and he just kept walking but then he heard corday squeal and he turned to see that a greasyhaired and unshaven man was holding cordays hair like a leash i was talking to you charlie the man said he yanked cordays hair making the boy squeal again give us a kiss charlie the man demanded give us a kiss the women at the table by the fire laughed at cordays predicament let him go sandman said you dont give orders here culley the unshaven man growled no one gives orders in here there arent any orders any more not till jemmy comes to fetch us away so you can fake away off culley you can the man stopped suddenly then gave a curious scream no he shouted no rider sandman had ever suffered from a temper he knew it and he fought against it in his everyday life he adopted a tone of gentle deliberation he used courtesy far beyond necessity he elevated reason and he reinforced it with prayer and he did all that because he feared his own temper but not all the prayer and reason and courtesy had eliminated the foul moods his soldiers had known there was a devil in captain sandman it was a real devil and they knew he was not a man to cross because he had that temper as sudden and as fierce as a summer storm of lightning and thunder and he was a tall and strong man strong enough to lift the unshaven prisoner and slam him against the wall so hard that the mans head bounced off the stones then the man screamed because sandman had driven a hard fist into his lower belly i said let him go sandman snapped did you not hear what i said are you deaf or are you just a bloody goddamned idiot he slapped the man once twice and his eyes were blazing and his voice was seething with a promise of even more terrible violence damn it what kind of fool do you take me for he jerked the man answer me sir the unshaven man managed to say answer me god damn it sandmans right hand was about the prisoners throat and he was throttling the man who was incapable of saying anything now there was utter silence in the association room the man gazing into sandmans pale eyes was choking the turnkey as appalled by the force of sandmans anger as any of the prisoners nervously crossed the room sir youre throttling him sir im damn well killing him sandman snarled sir please sir sandman suddenly came to his senses then let the prisoner go if you cannot be courteous he told the halfchoked man then you should be silent he wont give you any more lip sir the turnkey said anxiously i warrant he wont sir come corday sandman ordered and stalked out of the room there was a sigh of relief when he left who the hell was that the bruised prisoner managed to ask through the pain in his throat never laid peepers on him got no right to hit me the prisoner said and his friends growled their assent though none cared to follow sandman and debate the assertion sandman led a terrified corday across the press yard to the steps which led to the fifteen salt boxes the five cells on the ground floor were all being used by prostitutes and sandman the temper still seething in him did not apologise for interrupting them but just slammed the doors then climbed the stairs to find an empty cell on the first floor in there he told corday and the frightened youth scuttled past him sandman shuddered at the stink in this ancient part of the jail that had survived the fires of the gordon riots the rest of the prison had burnt to ash during the riots but these floors had merely been scorched and the salt boxes looked more like mediaeval dungeons than modern cells a rope mat lay on the floor evidently to serve as a mattress blankets for five or six men were tossed in an untidy pile under the highbarred window while an unemptied night bucket stank in a corner im captain rider sandman he introduced himself again to corday and the home secretary has asked me to enquire into your case why corday who had sunk onto the pile of blankets nerved himself to ask your mother has connections sandman said shortly the temper still hot in him the queen has spoken for me corday looked hopeful her majesty has requested an assurance of your guilt sandman said stuffily but im not guilty corday protested youve already been condemned sandman said so your guilt is not at issue he knew he sounded unbearably pompous but he wanted to get this distasteful meeting over so he could go to the cricket it would he thought be the swiftest fifteen guineas he had ever earnt for he could not imagine this despicable creature resisting his demands for a confession corday looked pathetic effeminate and close to tears he was wearing dishevelled but fashionably elegant clothes black breeches white stockings a frilled white shirt and a blue silk waistcoat but he had neither cravat nor a topcoat the clothes sandman suspected were all a good deal more expensive than anything he himself possessed and they only increased his dislike of corday whose voice had a flat and nasal quality with an accent that betrayed social pretensions a snivelling little upstart was sandmans instinctive judgement a boy scarce grown and already aping the manners and fashion of his betters i didnt do it corday protested again then began to cry his thin shoulders heaved his voice grizzled and the tears ran down his pale cheeks sandman stood in the cell doorway his predecessor had evidently beaten confessions out of prisoners but sandman could not imagine himself doing the same it was not honourable and could not be done which meant the wretched boy would have to be persuaded into telling the truth but the first necessity was to stop him weeping why do you call yourself corday he asked hoping to distract him when your mothers name is cruttwell corday sniffed theres no law against it did i say there was im a portrait painter corday said petulantly as if he needed to reassure himself of that fact and clients prefer their painters to have french names cruttwell doesnt sound distinguished would you have your portrait painted by charlie cruttwell when you could engage monsieur charles corday youre a painter sandman could not hide his surprise yes corday his eyes reddened from crying looked belligerently at sandman then he collapsed into misery again i was apprenticed to sir george phillips hes very successful sandman said scornfully despite possessing a prosaically english name and sir thomas lawrence doesnt sound very french to me i thought changing my name would help corday said sulkily does it matter your guilt matters sandman said sternly and if nothing else you might face the judgement of your maker with a clear conscience if you were to confess it corday stared at sandman as though his visitor were mad you know what im guilty of he finally asked im guilty of aspiring to be above my station im guilty of being a decent painter im guilty of being a much better damned painter than sir george bloody phillips and im guilty my god how im guilty of being stupid but i did not kill the countess of avebury i did not sandman did not like the boy but he felt in danger of being convinced by him and so he steeled himself by remembering the warning words of the porter at the prison gate how old are you he asked eighteen corday answered eighteen sandman echoed god will have pity on your youth he said we all do stupid things when were young and you have done terrible things but god will weigh your soul and there is still hope you arent doomed to hells fires not if you confess and if you beg god for forgiveness forgiveness for what corday asked defiantly sandman was so taken aback that he said nothing corday redeyed and palefaced stared up at the tall sandman look at me he said do i look like a man who has the strength to rape and kill a woman even if i wanted to do i look like that he did not sandman had to admit it at least to himself for corday was a limp and unimpressive creature weedy and thin who now began to weep again youre all the same he whined no one listens no one cares so long as someone hangs no one cares stop crying for gods sake sandman snarled and immediately chided himself for giving way to his temper im sorry he muttered those last two words made corday frown in puzzlement he stopped weeping looked at sandman and frowned i didnt do it he said softly i didnt do it so what happened sandman asked despising himself for having lost control of the interview i was painting her corday said the earl of avebury wanted a portrait of his wife and he asked sir george to do it he asked sir george yet you were painting her sandman sounded sceptical corday after all was a mere eighteen years old while sir george phillips was celebrated as the only rival to sir thomas lawrence corday sighed as though sandman was being deliberately obtuse sir george drinks he said scornfully he starts on blackstrap at breakfast and bowzes till night which means his hand shakes so he drinks and i paint sandman backed into the corridor to escape the smell of the unemptied night bucket in the cell he wondered if he was being naïve for he found corday curiously believable you painted in sir georges studio he asked not because he cared but because he wanted to fill the silence no corday said her husband wanted the portrait set in her bedroom so i did it there have you any idea how much bother that is you have to take an easel and canvas and chalk and oils and rags and pencils and dropcloths and mixing bowls and more rags still the earl of avebury was paying for it how much whatever sir george could get away with eight hundred guineas nine he offered me a hundred corday sounded bitter at that fee though it seemed like a fortune to sandman is it usual to paint a portrait in a ladys bedroom sandman asked in genuine puzzlement he could imagine a woman wanting herself depicted in a drawing room or under a tree in a great sunlit garden but the bedroom seemed a very perverse choice to him it was to be a boudoir portrait corday said and though the term was new to sandman he understood what it meant theyre very fashionable corday went on because these days all the women want to look like canovas pauline bonaparte sandman frowned you confuse me corday raised suppliant eyes to heaven in the face of such ignorance the sculptor canova he explained did a likeness of the emperors sister that is much celebrated and every beauty in europe wishes to be depicted in the same pose the woman reclines on a chaise longue an apple in her left hand and her head supported by her right corday rather to sandmans embarrassment demonstrated the pose the salient feature the boy went on is that the woman is naked from the waist up and a good deal below the waist too so the countess was naked when you painted her sandman asked no corday hesitated then shrugged she wasnt to know she was being painted naked so she was in a morning gown and robe we would have used a model in the studio to do the tits she didnt know sandman was incredulous her husband wanted a portrait corday said impatiently and he wanted her naked and she would have refused him so he lied to her she didnt mind doing a boudoir portrait but she wasnt going to unpeel for anyone so we were going to fake it and i was just doing the preliminary work the drawing and tints charcoal on canvas with a few colours touched in the colours of the bed covers the wallpaper her ladyships skin and hair bitch that she was sandman felt a surge of hope for the last four words had been malevolent just as he expected a murderer would speak of his victim you didnt like her like her i despised her corday spat she was a trumped up demirep he meant she was a courtesan a high class whore a buttock corday downgraded her savagely nothing else but just because i didnt like her doesnt make me a rapist and murderer besides do you really think a woman like the countess of avebury would allow a painters apprentice to be alone with her she was chaperoned by a maid all the time i was there how could i have raped or murdered her there was a maid sandman asked of course there was corday insisted scornfully an ugly bitch called meg sandman was totally confused now and presumably meg spoke at your trial meg has disappeared corday said tiredly which is why i am going to hang he glared at sandman you dont believe me do you you think im making it up but there was a maid and her name was meg and she was there and when it came to the trial she couldnt be found he had spoken defiantly but his demeanour suddenly changed as he began to weep again does it hurt he asked i know it does it must sandman stared down at the flagstones where was the house mount street corday was hunched and sobbing its just off i know where mount street is sandman interrupted a little too sharply he was embarrassed by cordays tears but persevered with questions that were now actuated by a genuine curiosity and you admit to being in the countesss house on the day she was murdered i was there just before she was murdered corday said there were back stairs servants stairs and there was a knock on the door there a deliberate knock a signal and the countess became agitated and insisted i leave at once so meg took me down the front stairs and showed me the door i had to leave everything the paints canvas everything and that convinced the constables i was guilty so within an hour they came and arrested me at sir georges studio who sent for the constables corday shrugged to suggest he did not know meg another of the servants and the constables found you at sir georges studio which is where sackville street above grays the jewellers corday stared redeyed at sandman do you have a knife no because if you do then i beg you give it me give it me i would rather cut my wrists than stay here i did nothing nothing yet i am beaten and abused all day and in a week i hang why wait a week i am already in hell i am in hell sandman cleared his throat why not stay up here in the cells youd be alone here alone id be alone for two minutes its safer downstairs where at least there are witnesses corday wiped his eyes with his sleeve what do you do now now sandman was nonplussed he had expected to listen to a confession and then go back to the wheatsheaf and write a respectful report instead he was confused you said the home secretary wanted you to make enquiries so will you cordays gaze was challenging then he crumpled you dont care no one cares i shall make enquiries sandman said gruffly and suddenly he could not take the stench and the tears and the misery any more and so he turned and ran down the stairs he came into the fresher air of the press yard then had a moments panic that the turnkeys would not unbolt the gate that would let him into the tunnel but of course they did the porter unlocked his cupboard and took out sandmans watch a goldcased breguet that had been a gift from eleanor sandman had tried to return the watch with her letters but she had refused to accept them find your man sir the porter asked i found him and he spun you a yarn ive no doubt the porter chuckled spun you a yarn eh they can gammon you sir like a right patterer but theres an easy way to know when a felons telling lies sir an easy way i should be obliged to hear it sandman said theyre speaking sir thats how you can tell theyre telling lies theyre speaking the porter thought this a fine joke and wheezed with laughter as sandman went down the steps into old bailey he stood on the pavement oblivious of the crowd surging up and down he felt soiled by the prison he clicked open the breguets case and saw it was just after half past two in the afternoon he wondered where his day had gone to rider eleanors inscription inside the watch case read in aeternam and that palpably false promise did not improve his mood he clicked the lid shut just as a workman shouted at him to mind himself the trapdoor pavilion and stairs of the scaffold had all been dismantled and now the tongueandgroove cladding that had screened the platform was being thrown down and the planks were falling perilously near sandman a carter hauling a vast wagon of bricks whipped blood from the flanks of his horses even though the beasts could make no headway against the tangle of vehicles that blocked the street sandman finally thrust the watch into his fob pocket and walked northwards he was torn corday had been found guilty and yet though sandman could not find a scrap of liking for the young man his story was believable doubtless the porter was right and every man in newgate was convinced of his own innocence yet sandman was not entirely naive he had led a company of soldiers with consummate skill and he reckoned he could distinguish when a man was telling the truth and if corday was innocent then the fifteen guineas that weighed down sandmans pockets would be neither swiftly nor easily earnt he decided he needed advice so he went to watch some cricket chapter two sandman reached bunhill row just before the city clocks struck three the jangling of the bells momentarily drowning the crack of bat on ball the deep shouts and applause of the spectators it sounded like a large crowd and judging by the shouts a good match the gatekeeper waved him through i aint taking your sixpence captain you should joe aye and you should be playing captain joe mallock gatekeeper at the artillery ground had once bowled for the finest clubs in london before painful joints had laid him low and he well remembered one of his last games when a young army officer scarce out of school had thrashed him all over the new road outfield in marylebone been too long since we seen you bat captain im past my prime joe past your prime boy past your prime you arent even thirty yet now go on in last i heard england was fiftysix runs up with only four in hand they need you a raucous jeer rewarded a passage of play as sandman walked towards the boundary the marquess of canfields eleven were playing an england eleven and one of the marquesss fielders had dropped an easy catch and now endured the crowds scorn butterfingers they roared fetch him a bucket sandman glanced at the blackboard and saw that england in their second innings were only sixty runs ahead and still had four wickets in hand most of the crowd were cheering the england eleven and a roar greeted a smart hit that sent the ball scorching towards the fields far side the marquesss bowler a bearded giant spat on the grass then stared up at the blue sky as if he was deaf to the crowds noise sandman watched the batsman budd it was walk down the wicket and pat down an already smooth piece of turf sandman strolled past the carriages parked by the boundary the marquess of canfield whitehaired whitebearded and ensconced with a telescope in a landau offered sandman a curt nod then pointedly looked away a year ago before the disgrace of sandmans father the marquess would have called out a greeting insisted on sharing a few moments of gossip and begged sandman to play for his team but now the sandman name was dirt and the marquess had pointedly cut him but then from further about the boundary and as if in recompense a hand waved vigorously from another open carriage and an eager voice shouted a greeting rider here rider the hand and voice belonged to a tall ragged young man who was painfully thin very bony and lanky dressed in shabby black and smoking a clay pipe that trickled a drift of ash down his waistcoat and jacket his red hair was in need of a pair of scissors for it collapsed across his longnosed face and flared above his wide and oldfashioned collar drop the carriage steps he instructed sandman come on in youre monstrous late heydell scored thirtyfour in the first innings and very well scored they were too how are you my dear fellow fowkes is bowling creditably well but is a bit errant on the off side budd is carrying his bat and the creature who has just come in is called fellowes and i know nothing about him you should be playing you also look pale are you eating properly i eat sandman said and you god preserves me in his effable wisdom he preserves me the reverend lord alexander pleydell settled back on his seat i see my father ignored you he nodded to me he nodded ah what graciousness is it true you played for sir john hart played and lost sandman said bitterly they were bribed dear rider i warned you of sir john mans nothing but greed he only wanted you to play so that everyone would assume his team was incorruptible and it worked didnt it i just hope he paid you well for he must have made a great deal of money from your gullibility would you like some tea of course you would i shall have hughes bring us tea and cake from mrs hillmans stall i think dont you budd looks good as ever dont he what a hitter he is have you ever lifted his bat its a club a cudgel oh well done sir well struck go hard sir go hard he was cheering on england and doing it in a very loud voice so that his father whose team was playing against england would hear him capital sir well done hughes my dear fellow where are you hughes lord alexanders manservant approached the side of the carriage my lord say hello to captain sandman hughes and i think we might venture a pot of mrs hillmans tea dont you and perhaps some of her apricot cake his lordship put money into his servants hand what are the bookies saying now hughes they strongly favour your fathers eleven my lord lord alexander pressed two more coins on his servant captain sandman and i will wager a guinea apiece on an england win i cant afford such a thing sandman protested and besides i detest gambling on cricket dont be pompous lord alexander said were not bribing the players merely risking cash on our appreciation of their skill you truly do look pale rider are you sickening cholera perhaps the plague consumption maybe prison fever my dear fellow lord alexander looked horrified prison fever and for gods sake sit down the carriage swayed as sandman sat opposite his friend they had attended the same school where they had become inseparable friends and where sandman who had always excelled at games and was thus one of the schools heroes had protected lord alexander from the bullies who believed his lordships clubbed foot made him an object of ridicule sandman on leaving school had purchased a commission in the infantry while lord alexander who was the marquis of canfields second son had gone to oxford where in the first year that such things were awarded he had taken a double first dont tell me youve been imprisoned lord alexander now chided sandman sandman smiled and showed his friend the letter from the home office and then described his afternoon though the telling of his tale was constantly interrupted by lord alexanders exclamations of praise or scorn for the cricket many of them uttered through a mouthful of mrs hillmans apricot cake which his lordship reduced to a spattering of crumbs that joined the ashes on his waistcoat beside his chair he kept a bag filled with clay pipes and as soon as one became plugged he would take out another and strike flint on steel the sparks chipped from the flint smouldered on his coat and on the carriages leather seat where they were either beaten out or faded on their own as his lordship puffed more smoke i must say he said when he had considered sandmans story that i should deem it most unlikely that young corday is guilty but hes been tried my dear rider my dear dear rider rider rider rider rider have you ever been to the old bailey sessions of course you havent youve been far too busy smiting the french you wretch but i dare say that inside of a week those four judges get through a hundred cases five a day apiece they often do more these folk dont get trials rider they get dragged through the tunnel from newgate come blinking into the session house are knocked down like bullocks and hustled off in manacles it aint justice they are defended surely lord alexander turned a shocked face on his friend the sessions aint your courts martial rider this is england what barrister will defend some penniless youth accused of sheep stealing corday isnt penniless but ill wager he isnt rich good lord rider the woman was found naked smothered in blood with his palette knife in her throat sandman watching the batsmen steal a quick single after an inelegant poke had trickled the ball down to square leg was amused that his friend knew the details of cordays crime suggesting that lord alexander when he was not deep in volumes of philosophy theology and literature was dipping into the vulgar broadsheets that described englands more violent crimes so youre suggesting corday is guilty sandman said no rider i am suggesting that he looks guilty there is a difference and in any respectable system of justice we would devise ways of distinguishing between the appearance and the reality of guilt but not in sir john silvesters courtroom the mans a brute a conscienceless brute oh well struck budd well struck run man run dont dawdle his lordship took up a new pipe and began setting fire to himself the whole system he said between puffs is pernicious pernicious theyll sentence a hundred folk to hang then only kill ten of them because the rest have commuted sentences and how do you obtain a commutation why by having the squire or the parson or his lordship sign the petition but what if you dont know such elevated folk then youll hang hang you fool you fool did you see that fellowes is bowled by god middle stump closed his eyes and swung he should be hanged you see rider what is happening society thats the respectable folk you and me well you at least have devised a way to keep the lower orders under our control we make them depend upon our mercy and our loving kindness we condemn them to the gallows then spare them and they are supposed to be grateful grateful it is pernicious lord alexander was thoroughly worked up now his long hands were wringing together and his hair already hopelessly tousled was being shaken into a worse disorder those damned tories he glared at sandman including him in this condemnation utterly pernicious he frowned for a second then a happy idea struck him you and i rider we shall go to a hanging no its your duty my dear fellow now that you are a functionary of this oppressive state you should understand just what brutality awaits these innocent souls i shall write to the keeper of newgate and demand that you and i are given privileged access to the next execution oh a change of bowler this fellows said to twist it very cannily you will have supper with me tonight in hampstead of course in hampstead lord alexander said it is where i live and dine rider then i wont lord alexander sighed he had tried hard to persuade sandman to move into his house and sandman had been tempted for lord alexanders father despite disagreeing with all his sons radical beliefs lavished an allowance on him that permitted the radical to enjoy a carriage stables servants and a rare library but sandman had learnt that to spend more than a few hours in his friends company was to end up arguing bitterly it was better far better to be independent i saw eleanor last saturday lord alexander said with his usual tactlessness i trust she was well im sure she was but i rather think i forgot to ask but then why should one ask it seems so redundant she was obviously not dying she looked well so why should i ask you recall paleys principles is that a book sandman asked and was rewarded with an incredulous look ive not read it he added hastily what have you been doing with your life lord alexander asked testily i shall lend it to you but only so that you can understand the vile arguments that are advanced on the scaffolds behalf do you know lord alexander emphasised his next point by stabbing sandman with the mouthpiece of his pipe that paley actually condoned hanging the innocent on the specious grounds that capital punishment is a necessity that errors cannot be avoided in an imperfect world and that the guiltless suffer therefore so that general society might be safer the innocent who are executed thus form an inevitable if regrettable sacrifice can you credit such an argument they should have hanged paley for it he was a clergyman i believe sandman said applauding a subtle snick that sent a fielder running towards the chiswell street boundary of course he was a clergyman but what does that have to do with the matter i am a clergyman does that give my arguments divine force you are absurd at times lord alexander had broken the stem of his pipe while prodding his friend and now needed to light another i confess that thomas jefferson makes the exact same point of course but i find his reasoning more elegant than paleys meaning sandman said that jefferson is a hero of yours and can do no wrong i hope i am more discerning than that lord alexander replied huffily and even you must allow that jefferson has political reasons for his beliefs which makes them all the more reprehensible sandman said and youre on fire so i am lord alexander beat at his coat eleanor asked after you as i recall she did did i not just say so and i said i had no doubt you were in fine fettle oh well struck sir well struck budd hits almost as hard as you she and i met at the egyptian hall there was a lecture about he paused frowning as he stared at the batsmen bless me ive quite forgotten why i went but eleanor was there with doctor vaux and his wife my god that man is a fool vaux no the new batsman no point in waving the bat idly strike man strike its what the bat is for eleanor had a message for you she did sandmans heart quickened his engagement to eleanor might be broken off but he was still in love with her what what indeed lord alexander frowned slipped my mind rider slipped it altogether dear me but it cant have been important wasnt important at all and as for the countess of avebury he shuddered evidently unable to express any kind of opinion on the murdered woman what of her ladyship sandman asked knowing it would be pointless to pursue eleanors forgotten message ladyship ha lord alexanders exclamation was loud enough to draw the gaze of a hundred spectators that baggage he said then remembered his calling poor woman but translated to a warmer place no doubt if anyone wanted her dead i should think it would be her husband the wretched man must be weighted down with horns you think the earl killed her sandman asked theyre estranged rider is that not an indication estranged you sound surprised may one ask why half englands husbands seem to be estranged from their wives it is hardly an uncommon situation sandman was surprised because he could have sworn corday had said the earl had commissioned his wifes portrait but why would he do that if they were estranged are you certain theyre estranged he asked i have it on the highest authority lord alexander said defensively i am a friend of the earls son christopher his name is and hes a most cordial man he was at brasenose when i was at trinity cordial sandman asked it seemed an odd word oh very alexander said energetically he took an extremely respectable degree i remember then went off to study with lasalle at the sorbonne his field is etymology bugs words rider words lord alexander rolled his eyes at sandmans ignorance the study of the origins of words not a serious field i always think but christopher seemed to think there was work to be done there the dead woman of course was his stepmother he talked to you of her we talked of serious things alexander said reprovingly but naturally in the course of any acquaintanceship one learns trivia there was little love lost in that family i can tell you father despising the son father hating the wife wife detesting the husband and the son bitterly disposed towards both i must say the earl and countess of avebury form an object lesson in the perils of family life oh well struck well struck good man capital work scamper scamper sandman applauded the batsman then sipped the last of his tea im surprised to learn that earl and countess were estranged he said because corday claimed that the earl commissioned the portrait why would he do that if theyre estranged you must ask him lord alexander said though my guess for what it is worth is that avebury though jealous was still enamoured of her she was a noted beauty and he is a noted fool mind you rider i make no accusations i merely assert that if anyone wanted the lady dead then it could well have been her husband though i doubt he would have struck the fatal blow himself even avebury is sensible enough to hire someone else to do his dirty work besides which he is a martyr to gout oh well hit well hit go hard go hard is the son still in paris he came back i see him from time to time though were not as close as when we were at oxford look at that fiddling with the bat its no good poking at balls could you introduce me to aveburys son i suppose so the game ended at shortly past eight when the marquesss side needing only ninetythree runs to win collapsed their defeat pleased lord alexander but made sandman suspect that bribery had once again ruined a game he could not prove it and lord alexander scoffed at the suspicion and would not hear of it when sandman tried to refuse his gambling winnings of course you must take it lord alexander insisted are you still lodging in the wheatsheaf you do know its a flash tavern i know now sandman admitted why dont we have supper there i can learn some demotic flash but i suppose all flash is demotic hughes summon the carriage horses and tell williams were going to drury lane flash was the slang name for londons criminal life and the label attached to its language no one stole a purse they filed a bit or boned the cole or clicked the ready bag prison was a sheep walk or the quod newgate was the kings head inn and its turnkeys were gaggers a good man was flash scamp and his victim a mum scull lord alexander was reckoned a mum scull but a genial one he learnt the flash vocabulary and paid for the words by buying ale and gin and he did not leave till well past midnight and it was then that sally hood came home on her brothers arm both of them worse for drink and they passed lord alexander who was standing by his carriage which he had been delighted to learn was really a rattler while its lamps were a pair of glims he was holding himself upright by gripping a wheel when sally hurried past he stared after her openmouthed i am in love rider he declared too loudly sally glanced back over her shoulder and gave sandman a dazzling smile you are not in love alexander sandman said firmly lord alexander kept staring after sally until she had vanished through the wheatsheafs front door i am in love lord alexander insisted i have been smitten by cupids arrow i am enamoured i am fatally in love youre a very drunken clergyman alexander i am a very drunken clergyman in love do you know the lady you can arrange an introduction he lurched after sally but his club foot slipped on the cobbles and he fell full length i insist rider he said from the ground i insist upon paying the lady my respects i wish to marry her in truth he was so drunk he could not stand but sandman hughes and the coachman managed to get his lordship into his carriage and then glims glimmering it rattled north ooooooo it was raining next morning and all london seemed in a bad mood sandman had a headache a sore belly and the memory of lord alexander singing the gallows song that he had been taught in the taproom and now im going to hell going to hell and wouldnt we do well we do well if you go there to dwell there to dwell damn your eyes the tune was lodged in sandmans mind and he could not rid himself of it as he shaved then made tea over the back room fire where the tenants were allowed to boil their water sally hurried in her hair in disarray but with her dress already hooked up she ladled herself a cup of water and lifted it in a mock toast breakfast she told sandman then grinned i hear you was jolly last night good morning miss hood sandman groaned she laughed who was that cripple cove you was with he is my particular friend sandman said the reverend lord alexander pleydell ma is second son of the marquess and marchioness of canfield sally stared at sandman youre gammoning me i promise i am not he said he was in love with me sandman had hoped she had not heard and doubtless this morning miss hood he said when he is sober he will still be in love with you sally laughed at sandmans tact is he really a reverend he dont dress like one he took orders when he left oxford sandman explained but i rather think he did it to annoy his father or perhaps at the time he wanted to become a fellow of his college but hes never looked for a living he doesnt need a parish or any other kind of job because hes rather rich he claims hes writing a book but ive seen no evidence of it sally drank her water then grimaced at the taste a reverend rich cripple she thought for a moment then smiled mischievously is he married no sandman said and did not add that alexander regularly fell in love with every pretty shopgirl he saw well i could do a hell of a lot worse than a crocked parson couldnt i sally said then gasped as a clock struck nine lord above im late this bugger im working for likes to start early she ran sandman pulled on his greatcoat and set off for mount street investigate alexander had urged him so he would he had six days to discover the truth and he decided he would begin with the missing maid meg if she existed and on this wet morning sandman was dubious of cordays story then she could end sandmans confusion by confirming or denying the painters tale he hurried up new bond street then realised with a start that he would have to walk past eleanors house in davies street and because he did not want anyone there to think he was being importunate he avoided it by taking the long way round and so was soaked to the skin by the time he reached the house in mount street where the murder had taken place it was easy enough to tell which was the earl of aveburys town house for even in this weather and despite a paucity of pedestrians a broadsheet seller was crouching beneath a tarpaulin in an effort to hawk her wares just outside the murder house tale of a murder sir she greeted sandman just a penny orrible murder sir give me one sandman waited as she extricated a sheet from her tarpaulin bag then he climbed the steps and rapped on the front door the windows of the house were shuttered but that meant little many folk stuck in london outside of the season closed their shutters to suggest they had gone to the country but it seemed the house really was empty for sandmans knocking achieved nothing theres no one home the woman selling the broadsheets said not been anyone home since the murder sir a crossing sweeper attracted by sandmans hammering had come to the house and he also confirmed that it was empty but this is the earl of aveburys house sandman asked it is sir yes sir the crossing sweeper a boy of about ten was hoping for a tip and its empty your lordship there was a maid here sandman said called meg did you know her the crossing sweeper shook his head dont know no one your honour two more boys both paid to sweep horse manure off the streets had joined the crossing sweeper gorn away one of them commented a charlie carrying his watchmans staff came to gawp at sandman but did not interfere and just then the front door of the next house along opened and a middleaged woman in dowdy clothes appeared on the step she shuddered at the rain glanced nervously at the small crowd outside her neighbours door then put up an umbrella madam sandman called madam sir the womans clothes suggested she was a servant perhaps a housekeeper sandman pushed past his small audience and took off his hat forgive me madam but viscount sidmouth has charged me with investigating the sad events that occurred here he paused and the woman just gaped at him as the rain dripped off the edges of her umbrella though she seemed impressed by the mention of a viscount which was why sandman had introduced it is it true maam sandman went on that there was a maid called meg in the house the woman looked back at her closed front door as if seeking an escape but then nodded there was sir there was do you know where she is theyve gone sir gone all gone sir but where they went to the country sir i think she dropped sandman a curtsey evidently hoping that would persuade him to go away the country they went away sir and the earl sir he has a house in the country sir near marlborough sir she knew nothing more sandman pressed her but the more he questioned her the less certain she was of what she had already told him indeed she was sure of only one thing that the countesss cooks footmen coachmen and maids were all gone and she thought she did not know that they must have gone to the earls country house that lay close to marlborough thats what i told you one of the sweeping boys said theyve gorn her ladyships gorn the watchman said then laughed torn and gorn read all about it the broadsheet seller called optimistically it seemed evident that there was little more to learn in mount street so sandman walked away meg existed that confirmed part of cordays tale but only part for the painters apprentice could still have done the murder when the maid was out of the room sandman thought of the newgate porters assurance that all felons lied and he wondered if he was being unforgivably naive in doubting cordays guilt the wretched boy had after all been tried and convicted and though lord alexander might scorn british justice sandman found it hard to be so dismissive he had spent most of the last decade fighting for his country against a tyranny that lord alexander celebrated a portrait of napoleon hung on his friends wall together with george washington and thomas paine nothing english it seemed to sandman ever pleased lord alexander while anything foreign was preferable and not all the blood that had dripped from the guillotines blade would ever convince lord alexander that liberty and equality were incompatible a point of view which seemed glaringly obvious to sandman thus it seemed were they doomed to disagree lord alexander pleydell would fight for equality while sandman believed in liberty and it was unthinkable to sandman that a freeborn englishman would not get a fair trial yet that was precisely what his appointment as investigator was encouraging him to think it was more comforting to believe corday was a liar yet meg undoubtedly existed and her existence cast doubt on sandmans stout belief in british justice he was walking east on burlington gardens thinking these wild thoughts and only half aware of the rattle of carriages splashing through the rain when he saw that the end of the street was plugged by a stonemasons wagons and scaffolding so he turned down sackville street where he had to step into the gutter because a small crowd was standing under the awning of grays jewellery shop they were mostly sheltering from the rain but a few were admiring the rubies and sapphires of a magnificent necklace that was on display inside a gilded cage in the jewellers window grays the name reminded sandman of something so that he stopped in the street and stared up past the awning you tired of bleeding life a carter snarled at sandman and hauled on his reins sandman ignored the man corday had said that sir george phillipss studio was here but sandman could see nothing in the windows above the shop he stepped back to the pavement to find a doorway to one side of the shop plainly separate from the jewellery business but no plate announced who lived or traded behind the door that was painted a shining green and furnished with a wellpolished brass knocker a onelegged beggar sat in the doorway his face disfigured by ulcers spare a coin for an old soldier sir where did you serve sandman asked portugal sir spain sir and waterloo sir the beggar patted his stump lost the gam at waterloo sir been through it all sir i have what regiment artillery sir gunner sir he sounded more nervous now which battalion and company eighth battalion sir the beggar was now plainly uncomfortable and his answer was unconvincing company sandman demanded and company commanders name why dont you brush off the man snarled i wasnt long in portugal sandman told the man but i did fight through spain and i was at waterloo he lifted the brass knocker and rapped it hard we had some difficult times in spain he went on but waterloo was by far the worst and i have great sympathy for all who fought there he knocked again but i can get angry bloody angry his temper was rising with men who claim to have fought there and did not it bloody annoys me the beggar scrambled away from sandmans temper and just then the green door opened and a black pageboy of thirteen or fourteen recoiled from sandmans savage face he must have thought the face meant trouble for he tried to close the door but sandman managed to put his boot in the way behind the boy was a short elegant hallway then a narrow staircase is this sir george phillipss studio sandman asked the pageboy who was wearing a shabby livery and a wig in desperate need of powdering heaved on the door but could not prevail against sandmans much greater strength if you aint got an appointment the boy said then you aint welcome i have got an appointment you have the surprised boy let go of the door making sandman stumble as it suddenly swung open you have the boy asked again i have an appointment sandman said grandly from viscount sidmouth who is it sammy a voice boomed from upstairs he says hes from viscount sidmouth then let him up let him up we are not too proud to paint politicians we just charge the bastards more take your coat sir sammy asked giving sandman a perfunctory bow ill keep it sandman edged into the hallway which was tiny but nevertheless decorated in a fashionable striped wallpaper and hung with a small chandelier sir georges rich patrons were to be welcomed by a liveried page and a carpeted entrance but as sandman climbed the stairs the elegance was tainted by the reek of turpentine and the room at the top which was supposed to be as elegant as the hallway had been conquered by untidiness the room was a salon where sir george could show his finished paintings and entice wouldbe subjects to pay for their portraits but it had become a dumping place for halffinished work for palettes of crusted paint for an abandoned game pie that had mould on its pastry for old brushes rags and a pile of mens and womens clothes a second flight of stairs went to the top floor and sammy indicated that sandman should go on up you want coffee sir he asked going to a curtained doorway that evidently hid a kitchen or tea tea would be kind the ceiling had been knocked out of the top floor to open the long room to the rafters of the attic then skylights had been put in the roof so that sandman seemed to be climbing into the light rain pattered on the tiles and enough dripped through to need catchment buckets that had been placed all about the studio a black potbellied stove dominated the rooms centre though now it did nothing except serve as a table for a bottle of wine and a glass next to the stove an easel supported a massive canvas while a naval officer posed with a sailor and a woman on a platform at the farther end the woman screamed when sandman appeared then snatched up a drab cloth that covered a tea chest on which the naval officer was sitting it was sally hood sandman his wet hat in his right hand bowed to her she was holding a trident and wearing a brass helmet and very little else actually sandman realised she was wearing nothing else though her hips and thighs were mostly screened by an oval wooden shield on which a union flag had been hastily drawn in charcoal she was sandman realised britannia you are feasting your eyes the man beside the easel said on miss hoods tits and why not as tits go they are splendid quintessence of bubby captain sally acknowledged sandman in a small voice your servant miss hood sandman said bowing again good lord almighty the painter said have you come to see me or sally he was an enormous man fat as a hogshead with great jowls a bloated nose and a belly that distended a paintsmeared shirt decorated with ruffles his white hair was bound by a tight cap of the kind that used to be worn beneath wigs sir george sandman asked at your service sir sir george attempted a bow but was so fat he could only manage a slight bend at what passed for his waist but he made a pretty gesture with the brush in his hand sweeping it as though it were a folded fan you are welcome he said so long as you seek a commission i charge eight hundred guineas for a full length six hundred from the waist up and i dont do heads unless im starving and i aint been starving since ninetynine viscount sidmouth sent you he doesnt wish to be painted sir george then you can bugger off the painter said sandman ignored the suggestion instead looking about the studio which was a riot of plaster statues curtains discarded rags and halffinished canvasses oh make yourself a home here do sir george snarled then shouted down the stairs sammy you black bastard wheres the tea brewing sammy called back hurry it sir george threw down his palette and brush two youths were flanking him both painting waves on the canvas and sandman guessed they were his apprentices the canvas itself was vast at least ten feet wide and it showed a solitary rock in a sunlit sea on which a halfpainted fleet was afloat an admiral was seated on the rocks summit where he was flanked by a goodlooking young man dressed as a sailor and by sally hood undressed as britannia quite why the admiral the sailor and the goddess should have been so marooned on their isolated rock was not clear and sandman did not like to ask but then he noticed that the officer who was posing as the admiral could not have been a day over eighteen yet he was wearing a goldencrusted uniform on which shone two jewelled stars that puzzled sandman for a heartbeat then he saw that the boys empty right sleeve was pinned to his coats breast the real nelson is dead sir george had been following sandmans eyes and thus deducing his train of thought so we make do as best we can with young master corbett there and do you know what is the tragedy of young master corbetts life it is that his back is turned to britannia thus he must sit there for hours every day in the knowledge that one of the ripest pairs of naked tits in all london are just two feet behind his left ear and he cant see them ha and for gods sake sally stop hiding you aint painting sally said so i can cover up she had dropped the grey cloth that turned the tea chest into a rock and was instead wearing her street coat sir george picked up his brush im painting now he snarled im cold sally complained too grand suddenly to show us your bubbies are you sir george snarled then looked at sandman has she told you about her lord the one whos sweet on her well soon all be bowing and scraping to her wont we yes your ladyship show us your tits your ladyship he laughed and the apprentices all grinned she hasnt lied to you sandman said his lordship exists i know him he is indeed enamoured of miss hood and he is very rich more than rich enough to commission a dozen portraits from you sir george sally gave him a look of pure gratitude while sir george discomfited dabbed the brush into the paint on his palette so who the devil are you he demanded of sandman besides being an envoy of sidmouths my name is captain rider sandman navy army fencibles yeomanry or is the captaincy a fiction most ranks are these days i was in the army sandman said you can uncover sir george explained to sally because the captain was a soldier which means hes seen more tits than i have he aint seen mine sally said clutching the coat to her bosom how do you know her sir george asked sandman in a suspicious tone we lodge in the same tavern sir george sir george snorted then either she lives higher in the world than she deserves or you live lower drop the coat you stupid bitch im embarrassed sally confessed reddening hes seen worse than you naked sir george commented sourly then stepped back to survey his painting the apotheosis of lord nelson would you believe and you are wondering are you not why i dont have the little bugger in an eyepatch are you not wondering that no sandman said because he never wore an eyepatch thats why never i painted him twice from life he sometimes wore a green eyeshade but never a patch so he wont have one in this masterpiece commissioned by their lordships of the admiralty they couldnt stand the little bugger when he was alive now they want him up on their wall but what they really want to suspend on their panelling captain sandman is sally hoods tits sammy you black bastard what in gods name are you bloody doing down there growing the bloody tea leaves bring me some brandy he glared at sandman so what do you want of me captain to talk about charles corday oh good christ alive sir george blasphemed and stared belligerently at sandman charles corday he said the name very portentously you mean grubby little charlie cruttwell who now calls himself corday yes doesnt bloody matter what he calls himself sir george said theyre still going to stretch his skinny neck next monday i thought i might go and watch it aint every day a man sees one of his own apprentices hanged mores the pity he cuffed one of the youths who was laboriously painting in the whiteflecked waves then scowled at his three models sally for gods sake your tits are my money now pose as youre paid to sandman courteously turned his back as she dropped the coat the home secretary he said has asked me to investigate cordays case sir george laughed his mothers been bleating to the queen is that it yes lucky little charlie that he has such a mother you want to know whether he did it he tells me he didnt of course he tells you that sir george said scornfully hes hardly likely to offer you a confession is he but oddly enough hes probably telling the truth at least about the rape he didnt rape her he might have done sir george was making delicate little dabs with the brush which were magically bringing sallys face alive under the helmet he might have done but it would have been against his nature sir george gave sandman a sly glance our monsieur corday captain is a sodomite he laughed at sandmans expression theyll hang you for being one of those so it dont make much difference to charlie whether hes guilty or innocent of murder do it hes certainly guilty of sodomy so he thoroughly deserves to hang they all do nasty little buggers id hang them all and not by the neck either sammy minus his livery coat and wig brought up a tray on which were some ill assorted cups a pot of tea and a bottle of brandy the boy poured tea for sir george and sandman but only sir george received a glass of brandy youll get your tea in a minute sir george told his three models when im ready are you sure sandman asked him about them getting their tea or about charlie being a sodomite of course im bloody sure you could unpeel sally and a dozen like her right down to the raw and he wouldnt bother to look but he was always trying to get his paws on young sammy here wasnt he sammy i told him to fake away off sammy said good for you samuel sir george said he put down his brush and gulped the brandy and you are wondering captain are you not why i would allow a filthy sodomite into this temple of art i shall tell you because charlie was good oh he was good he poured more brandy drank half of it then returned to the canvas he drew beautifully captain drew like the young raphael he was a joy to watch he had the gift which is more than i can say for this pair of butcher boys he cuffed the second apprentice no charlie was good he could paint as well as draw which meant i could trust him with flesh not just draperies in another year or two hed have been off on his own the picture of the countess its there if you want to see how good he was he gestured to some unframed canvasses that were stacked against a table that was littered with jars paste knives pestles and oil flasks find it barney sir george ordered one of his apprentices its all his work captain sir george went on because it aint got to the point where it needs my talent he couldnt have finished it himself sandman asked he sipped the tea which was an excellent blend of gunpowder and green sir george laughed what did he tell you captain no let me guess charlie told you that i wasnt up to it didnt he he said i was drunk so he had to paint her ladyship is that what he told you yes sandman admitted sir george was amused the lying little bastard he deserves to hang for that so why did you let him paint the countess think about it sir george said sally shoulders back head up nipples out thats my girl youre britannia you rule the bleeding waves youre not some bloody brighton whore drooping on a boulder why sandman persisted because captain sir george paused to make a stroke with the brush because we were gammoning the lady we were painting her in a frock but once the canvas got back here we were going to make her naked thats what the earl wanted and thats what charlie would have done but when a man asks a painter to depict his wife naked and a remarkable number do then you can be certain that the resulting portrait will not be displayed does a man hang such a painting in his morning room for the titillation of his friends he does not does he show it in his london house for the edification of society he does not he hangs it in his dressing room or in his study where none but himself can see it and what use is that to me if i paint a picture captain i want all london gaping at it i want them queueing up those stairs begging me to paint one just like it for themselves and that means there aint no money in society tits i paint the profitable pictures charlie was taking care of the boudoir portraits he stepped back and frowned at the young man posing as a sailor youre holding that oar all wrong johnny maybe i should have you naked as neptune he turned and leered at sandman why didnt i think of that before youd make a good neptune captain fine figure youve got you could oblige me by stripping naked and standing opposite sally well give you a triton shell to hold erect ive got a triton shell somewhere i used it for the apotheosis of the earl st vincent what do you pay sandman asked five shillings a day sir george had been surprised by the response you dont pay me that sally protested because youre a bloody woman sir george snapped then looked at sandman well no sandman said then went very still the apprentice had been turning over the canvasses and sandman now stopped him let me see that one he said pointing to a fulllength portrait the apprentice pulled it from the stack and propped it on a chair so that the light from a skylight fell on the canvas which showed a young woman sitting at a table with her head cocked in what was almost but not quite a belligerent fashion her right hand was resting on a pile of books while her left held an hourglass her red hair was piled high to reveal a long and slender neck that was circled by sapphires she was wearing a dress of silver and blue with white lace at the neck and wrists her eyes stared boldly out of the canvas and added to the suggestion of belligerence which was softened by the mere suspicion that she was about to smile now that sir george said reverently is a very clever young lady and be careful with it barney its going for varnishing this afternoon you like it captain its sandman paused wanting a word that would flatter sir george its wonderful he said lamely it is indeed sir george said enthusiastically stepping away from nelsons halffinished apotheosis to admire the young woman whose red hair was brushed away from a forehead that was high and broad whose nose was straight and long and whose mouth was generous and wide and who had been painted in a lavish sitting room beneath a wall of ancestral portraits which suggested she came from a family of great antiquity though in truth her father was the son of an apothecary and her mother a parsons daughter who was considered to have married beneath herself miss eleanor forrest sir george said her nose is too long her chin too sharp her eyes more widely spaced than convention would allow to be beautiful her hair is lamentably red and her mouth is too lavish yet the effect is extraordinary is it not it is sandman said fervently yet of all the young womans attributes sir george had entirely dropped his bantering manner and was speaking with real warmth it is her intelligence i most admire i fear she is to be wasted in marriage she is sandman had to struggle to keep his voice from betraying his feelings the last i heard sir george returned to nelson she was spoken of as the future lady eagleton indeed i believe the portrait is a gift for him yet miss eleanor is much too clever to be married to a fool like eagleton sir george snorted wasted eagleton sandman felt as though a cold hand had gripped his heart had that been the import of the message lord alexander had forgotten that eleanor was engaged to lord eagleton lord eagleton heir to the earl of bridport and a bore a bore captain a bore and i detest bores is sally hood really to be a lady good god incarnate england has gone to the weasels stick em out darling they aint noble yet and theyre what the admiralty is paying for barney find the countess the apprentice hunted on through the canvasses the wind gusted making the rafters creak sammy emptied two of the buckets into which rain was leaking chucking them out of the back window and provoking a roar of protest from below sandman stared out of the front windows looking past the awning of grays jewellery shop into sackville street was eleanor really to marry he had not seen her in over six months and it was very possible her mother at least was in a hurry to have eleanor walk to an altar preferably an aristocratic altar for eleanor was twentyfive now and would soon be reckoned a shelved spinster damn it sandman thought but forget her this is it sir barney the apprentice interrupted his thoughts he propped an unfinished portrait over eleanors picture the countess of avebury sir another beauty sandman thought the painting was hardly begun yet it was strangely effective the canvas had been sized then a charcoal drawing made of a woman reclining on a bed that was surmounted by a tent of peaked material corday had then painted in patches of the wallpaper the material of the beds tent the bedspread the carpet and the womans face he had lightly painted the hair making it seem wild as though the countess was in a country wind rather than her london bedroom and though the rest of the canvas was hardly touched by any other colour yet somehow it was still breathtaking and full of life oh he could paint our charlie he could paint sir george wiping his hands with a rag had come to look at the picture his voice was reverent and his eyes betrayed a mixture of admiration and jealousy hes a clever little devil aint he is it a good likeness oh yes sir george nodded indeed yes she was a beauty captain a woman who could make heads turn but thats all she was she was out of the gutter captain she was what our sally is she was an opera dancer im an actress sally insisted hotly an actress an opera dancer a whore theyre all the same sir george growled and avebury was a fool to have married her he should have kept her as his mistress but never married her this teas bloody cold sally complained she had left the dais and discarded her helmet go and have some dinner child sir george said grandly but be back here by two of the clock have you finished captain sandman nodded he was staring at the countesss picture her dress had been very lightly sketched presumably because it was doomed to be obliterated but her face as striking as it was alluring was almost completed you said did you not he asked that the earl of avebury commissioned the portrait i did say so sir george agreed and he did yet i heard that he and his wife were estranged sandman said so i understand sir george said airily then gave a wicked laugh he was certainly cuckolded her ladyship had a reputation captain and it didnt involve feeding the poor and comforting the afflicted he was pulling on an old fashioned coat all wide cuffs broad collars and gilt buttons sammy he shouted down the stairs ill eat the game pie up here and some of that salmagundi if it aint mouldy and you can open another of the nine clarets he lumbered to the window and scowled at the rain fighting against the smoke of a thousand chimneys why would a man estranged from his wife spend a fortune on her portrait sandman asked the ways of the world captain sir george said portentously are a mystery even unto me how the hell would i know sir george turned from the window youd have to ask his cuckolded lordship i believe he lives near marlborough though hes reputed to be a recluse so i suspect youd be wasting your journey on the other hand perhaps it isnt a mystery maybe he wanted revenge on her hanging her naked tits on his wall would be a kind of revenge would it not would it sir george chuckled there is none so conscious of their high estate as an ennobled whore captain so why not remind the bitch of what brought her the title tits sir tits if it had not been for her good tits and long legs shed still be charging ten shillings a night but did little charlie the sodomite kill her i doubt it captain i doubt it very much but nor do i care very much little charlie was getting too big for his boots so i wont mourn to see him twitching at the end of a rope ah he rubbed his hands as his servant climbed the stairs with a heavy tray dinner good day to you captain i trust i have been of service sandman was not sure sir george had been of any service unless increasing sandmans confusion was of use but sir george was done with him now and sandman was dismissed so he left and the rain fell harder ooooooo that fat bastard never offers us dinner sally hood complained she was sitting opposite sandman in a tavern on piccadilly where inspired by sir george phillipss dinner they shared a bowl of salmagundi a cold mixture of cooked meats anchovies hard boiled eggs and onions he guzzles himself he does sally went on and were supposed to bleeding starve she tore a piece of bread from the loaf poured more oil into the bowl then smiled shyly at sandman i was so embarrassed when you walked in no need to be sandman said on his way out of sir georges studio he had invited sally to join him and they had run through the rain and taken shelter in the three ships where he had paid for the salmagundi and a big jug of ale with some of the money advanced to him by the home office sally shook salt into the bowl then stirred the mixture vigorously you wont tell anyone she asked very earnestly of course not i know it aint actressing she said and i dont like that fat bastard staring at me all day but its rhino isnt it rhino money its rhino sandman agreed and i shouldnt have said anything about your friend sally said because i felt such a fool you mean lord alexander i am a fool arent i she grinned at him of course not i am she said fervently but i dont want to be doing this forever im twentytwo now and ill have to find something soon wont i and i wouldnt mind meeting a real lord you want to marry she nodded shrugged then speared half a boiled egg i dont know she admitted i mean when lifes good its very good two years ago i never seemed not to be working i was a witchs servant girl in a play about some scottish king she wrinkled her face trying to think of the name then shook her head bastard he was then i was a dancing girl in a pageant about some black king what got himself killed in india and he was another bastard but these last two or three months nothing theres not even work at vauxhall gardens what did you do there sally closed her eyes as she thought tabbel she said tabbler tableau vivants thats it i was a goddess for three months last summer i was up a tree playing a harp and the rhino wasnt bad then i got a turn in astleys with the dancing horses and that kept me through the winter but theres nothing now not even down the strand she meant the newer theatres that offered more music and dancing than the two older theatres in drury lane and covent garden but ive got a private show coming up she added sniffing at the prospect private sandman asked a rich cove wants his girl to be an actress see so he hires the theatre when its out of season and he pays us to sing and dance and he pays an audience to cheer and he pays the scribblers to write her up in the papers as the next vestris you want to come its thursday night at covent garden and its only the one night so it aint going to pay any bills is it if i can ill come sandman promised what i need sally said is to join a company and i could if i was willing to be a frow you know what that is of course you do and that fat bastard she jerked her head meaning sir george phillips he thinks im a frow but im not i never supposed you were then youre the only bloody man who didnt she grinned at him well you and my brother jack would kill anyone who said i was a frow good for jack sandman said i rather like your brother everyone likes jack sally said not that i really know him of course sandman said but he seems friendly sallys brother on the few occasions sandman had encountered him had seemed a confident easymannered man he was popular presiding over a generous table in the wheatsheafs taproom and he was strikingly handsome attracting a succession of young women he was also mysterious for no one in the tavern would say exactly what he did for a living though undoubtedly the living was reasonably good for he and sally rented two large rooms on the wheatsheafs first floor what does your brother do sandman asked sally now and in return received a very strange look no really he said what does he do its just that he keeps odd hours you dont know who he is sally asked should i hes robin hood sally said then laughed when she saw sandmans face thats my jack captain she said robin hood good lord sandman said robin hood was the nickname of a highwayman who was wanted by every magistrate in london the reward for him was well over a hundred pounds and it was constantly rising sally shrugged hes a daft one really i keep telling him hell end up doing jemmy bottings hornpipe but he wont listen and he looks after me well up to a point he does but its always feast or famine with jack and when hes in cash he gives it to his ladies but hes good to me he is and he wouldnt let no one touch me she frowned you wont tell anyone of course i wont i mean everyone in the sheaf knows who he is but none of them would tell on him nor would i sandman assured her of course you wouldnt sally said then grinned so what about you what do you want out of life sandman surprised to be asked thought for a moment i suppose i want my old life back war being a soldier she sounded disapproving no just the luxury of not worrying about where the next shilling comes from sally laughed we all want that she poured more oil and vinegar into the bowl and stirred it so you had money did you my father did he was a very rich man but then he made some bad investments he borrowed too much money he gambled and he failed so he forged some notes and presented them at the bank of notes sally did not understand instructions to pay money sandman explained and of course it was a stupid thing to do but i suppose he was desperate he wanted to raise some money then flee to france but the forgeries were detected and he faced arrest they would have hanged him except that he blew his brains out before the constables arrived gawd sally said staring at him so my mother lost everything she now lives in winchester with my younger sister and i try to keep them alive i pay the rent look after the bills that sort of thing he shrugged why dont they work sally asked truculently theyre not used to the idea sandman said and sally echoed the words though not quite aloud she just mouthed it and sandman laughed this all happened just over a year ago he went on and id already left the army by then i was going to get married wed chosen a house in oxfordshire but of course she couldnt marry me when i became penniless why not sally demanded because her mother wouldnt let her marry a pauper because she was poor as well sally asked on the contrary sandman said her father had promised to settle six thousand a year on her my father had promised me more but once he went bankrupt of course sandman shrugged not bothering to finish the sentence sally was staring at him wideeyed six thousand she asked pounds she merely breathed the last word unable to comprehend such wealth pounds sandman confirmed bloody hell it was sufficient to persuade her to stop eating for a while then she remembered her hunger and dug in again go on she encouraged him so i stayed with my mother and sister for a while but that really wasnt practicable there was no work for me in winchester so i came to london last month sally thought this was amusing never really worked in your life before eh i was a good soldier sandman said mildly i suppose that is work sally allowed grudgingly of a sort she chased a chicken leg round the bowl but what do you want to do sandman gazed up at the smokestained ceiling just work he said vaguely im not trained for anything im not a lawyer not a priest i taught in winchester college for two terms he paused shuddering at the memory so i thought id try the london merchants they hire men to supervise estates you see tobacco estates and sugar plantations abroad sally asked yes sandman said gently and he had indeed been offered such work on a sugar estate in barbados but the knowledge that the appointment would necessitate the supervision of slaves had forced him to refuse his mother had scoffed at his refusal calling him weakwilled but sandman was content with his choice but you dont need to go abroad now sally said not if youre working for the home secretary i fear it is very temporary employment thieving people off the gallows that aint temporary full bloody time if you ask me she stripped the meat from the chicken bone with her teeth but are you going to get charlie out of the kings head inn do you know him met him once she said her mouth full of chicken and fat sir george is right hes a pixie a pixie never mind i think i know and you think hes innocent of course hes bloody innocent she said forcefully he was found guilty sandman pointed out gently in the old bailey sessions who was the judge sir john silvester sandman said bloody hell black jack sally was scathing hes a bastard i tell you captain there are dozens of innocent souls in their graves because of black jack and charlie is innocent has to be hes a pixie isnt he he wouldnt know what to do with a woman let alone rape one and whoever killed her gave her a right walloping and charlie aint got the meat on his bones to do that kind of damage well youve seen him aint you does he look like he could have slit her throat what does it say there she pointed to the penny broadsheet that sandman had taken from his pocket and smoothed on the table at the top of the sheet was an illprinted picture of a hanging which purported to be the imminent execution of charles corday and showed a hooded man standing in a cart beneath the gallows they always use that picture sally said i wish theyd find a new one they dont even use a cart any more fake off culley the last three words were snapped at a welldressed man who had approached her bowed and was about to speak he backed away with alarm on his face i know what he wants sally explained to sandman sandman had looked alarmed at her outburst but now laughed and then looked back at the broadsheet according to this he said the countess was naked when she was found naked and bloody she were stabbed werent she it says cordays knife was in her throat he couldnt have stabbed her with that sally said dismissively it aint sharp its a i dont know what do you call it its for mixing paint up it aint for chivving chivving cutting so its a palette knife sandman said but it says here she was stabbed twelve times in the he hesitated in the tits sally said they always say that if its a woman never get stabbed anywhere else always in the bubbies she shook her head that dont sound like a pixie to me why would he strip her let alone kill her you want any more of this she pushed the bowl towards him no please you have it i could eat a bloody horse she pushed her plate aside and simply put the bowl in front of her no she said after a moments reflection he didnt do it did he she stopped again frowning and sandman sensed she was debating whether to tell him something and he had the sense to keep quiet she looked up at him as if judging whether she really liked him or not then she shrugged he bleeding lied to you she said quietly corday no sir george he lied i heard him tell you the earl wanted the painting but he didnt he didnt they was talking about it yesterday sally said earnestly him and a friend only he thinks i dont listen i just stand there catching cold and he talks like i wasnt anything except a pair of tits she poured herself more ale it wasnt the earl who ordered the painting sir george told his friend he did then he looked at me and he said youre not hearing this sally hood he actually said that did he say who did commission the painting sally nodded it was a club what ordered the painting only hed be mad if he knew id told you cos hes scared to death of the bastards a club commissioned it like a gentlemens club like boodles or whites only it aint them its got a funny name the semaphore club no that aint right sema serra i dont know something to do with angels angels angels sally confirmed semaphore something like that seraphim thats it she was hugely impressed that sandman had found the name the seraphim club ive never heard of it its meant to be real private sally said i mean really private it aint far in st jamess square so theyve got to have money too rich for me though you know about it not much she said but i was asked to go there once only i wouldnt cos im not that sort of actress but why would the seraphim club want the countesss portrait sandman asked god knows sally said i shall have to ask them she looked alarmed dont tell them i told you sir george will kill me and i need the work dont i i wont say you told me he promised her and anyway i dont suppose they killed her so how do you find out who did sally asked it was a good question sandman thought and he gave it an honest answer i dont know he admitted ruefully i thought when the home secretary asked me to investigate that all i had to do was go to newgate and ask some questions rather like questioning one of my soldiers but it isnt like that i have to find the truth and im not even sure where to begin ive never done anything like it before in fact i dont know anyone who has so i suppose i ask questions dont i i talk to everyone ask them whatever i can think of and hope i can find the servant girl what servant girl so sandman told her about meg and how he had gone to the house on mount street and been told that all the servants had been discharged they might have gone to the earls house in the country he said or maybe they were just discharged ask the servants sally said ask the other servants in the street and all the other streets nearby one of them will know servants gossip tells you everything oh my gawd is that the time a clock in the tavern had just chimed twice sally snatched up her coat grabbed the last of the bread and ran and sandman sat and read the broadsheet again it told him very little but it gave him time to think and time to wonder why a private club a very private club with an angelic name wanted a lady painted naked it was time he thought to find out it was time to visit the seraphim chapter three it had stopped raining though the air felt greasy and the stones of st jamess street glistened as though they had been given a coat of varnish smoke from countless chimneys gusted low on the chill wind whirling smuts and ash like dark snow two smart carriages rattled up the hill past a third that had lost a wheel a score of men were offering advice about the canted vehicle while the horses a lively team of matching bays were walked up and down by a coachman two drunks fashionably dressed supported each other as they bowed to a woman who as elegantly dressed as her admirers sauntered down the pavement with a furled parasol she ignored the drunks just as she took no note of the obscene suggestions shouted at her from the windows of the gentlemens clubs she was no lady sandman guessed for no respectable woman would ever walk in st jamess street she gave him a bold stare as he neared her and sandman politely touched a hand to his hat but gave her the wall and walked on too hot for you is she a man shouted at sandman from a window sandman ignored the jibe think straight he told himself think straight and to help himself do that he stopped on the corner of king street and gazed towards st jamess palace as though its ancient bricks could give him inspiration why he asked himself was he going to the seraphim club because if sally was right they had commissioned the portrait of the murdered countess but so what sandman was beginning to suspect that the painting had nothing whatever to do with the murder if corday was telling the truth then the murderer was almost certainly the person who had interrupted the painter when they knocked on the door from the back stairs but who that had been sandman had not the slightest idea so why was he going to the seraphim club because he decided the mysterious club had evidently known the dead woman and they had lavished money on a portrait of her and the portrait unknown to her ladyship was to show her naked which suggested that a member of the club had either been her lover or that she had refused to be his lover and love like rejection was a route to hatred and hatred led to murder and that chain of thought spurred sandman to wonder whether the painting was connected with the murder after all it was all confusing so very confusing and he was getting nowhere by trying to think straight about it and so he began walking again nothing marked the seraphim clubs premises but a crossing sweeper pointed sandman to a house with shuttered windows on the squares eastern side sandman walked across the square and as he came close saw a carriage drawn by four horses standing at the kerb outside the club the carriage was painted dark blue and on its doors were red shields blazoned with goldenrobed angels in full flight the carriage had evidently just collected a passenger for it pulled away as sandman went to the door that was painted a glossy blue and bore no brass plate a gilded chain hung in the shallow porch and when it was pulled a bell sounded deep within the building sandman was about to tug the chain a second time when he noticed a wink of light in the doors centre and he saw that a spyhole had been drilled through the bluepainted timber someone he reckoned was peering at him and so he stared back until he heard a bolt being drawn a second bolt scraped then a lock turned and at last the door was reluctantly swung open by a servant dressed in a waspish livery of black and yellow the servant inspected sandman are you sure sir he asked after a pause that you have the right house the sir had no respect in it but was a mere formality this is the seraphim club the servant hesitated he was a tall man probably within a year or two of sandmans own age and had a face darkened by the sun scarred by violence and hardened by experience a brutal but goodlooking man sandman thought with an air of competence this is a private house sir the servant said firmly belonging i believe to the seraphim club sandman said brusquely with whom i have business he waved the home secretarys letter government business he added and without waiting for any answer he stepped past the servant into a hall that was high elegant and expensive the floor was a chess board of gleaming black and white marble squares and more marble framed the hearth in which a small fire burnt and above which an overmantel was framed with a gilded riot of cherubs flower sprays and acanthus leaves a chandelier hung in the well of a staircase and its branches must have held at least a hundred unlit candles dark paintings hung on white walls a cursory glance showed sandman they were landscapes and seascapes with not a single naked lady in view the government sir has no business here no business at all the tall servant said he seemed surprised that sandman had dared to walk past him and as if in reproof was pointedly holding the front door open as an invitation for sandman to leave two more servants both big and both in the same black and yellow livery had come from a side room to encourage the unwanted visitors departure sandman looked from the two newcomers to the taller servant holding the door and he noticed the mans good looks were marred by tiny black scars on his right cheek most people would hardly have noticed the scars which were little more than dark flecks under the skin but sandman had acquired the habit of looking for the powder burns which regiment he asked the man the servants face twitched in a halfsmile first foot guards sir i fought beside you at waterloo sandman said he pushed the letter into his jacket pocket then stripped off his wet greatcoat which with his hat he tossed onto a gilded chair youre probably right he told the man the government almost certainly doesnt have any business here but i suspect i need to be told that by an officer of the club there is a secretary a presiding officer a committee sandman shrugged i apologise but the government is like french dragoons if you dont beat the hell out of them the first time then they only come back twice as strong the next the tall servant was trapped between his duty to the club and his fellowfeeling for another soldier but his loyalty to the seraphim won he let go of the front door and flexed his hands as if readying for a fight im sorry sir he insisted but theyll only tell you to make an appointment then ill wait here till they do tell me that sandman said he went to the small fire and stretched his hands towards its warmth my names sandman by the way and im here on behalf of lord sidmouth sir they dont permit waiting the servant said but if youd like to leave a card sir in the bowl on the table dont have a card sandman said cheerfully time to go the servant said and this time he did not call sandman sir but instead approached the visitor with a chilling confidence its all right sergeant berrigan a smooth voice cut in from behind sandman mister sandman will be tolerated captain sandman sandman said turning an exquisite a fop a beau faced him he was a tall and extraordinarily handsome young man in a brassbuttoned black coat white breeches so tight that they could have been shrunk onto his thighs and glistening black top boots a stiff white cravat billowed from a plain white shirt which was framed by his coat collar that stood so high that it half covered the mans ears his hair was black and cut very short framing a pale face that had been shaved so close that the white skin seemed to gleam it was an amused and clever face and the man was carrying a quizzingglass a slender gold wand supporting a single lens through which he gave sandman a brief inspection before offering a slight and courteous bow captain sandman he said putting a gentle stress on the first word i do apologise and i should have recognised you i saw you knock fifty runs off martingale and bennett last year such a pity that your prowess has not entertained us at any london ground this season my name by the way is skavadale lord skavadale do come into the library please he gestured to the room behind him sergeant would you be so kind as to hang up the captains coat by the porters fire i think dont you and what would you like as a warming collation captain coffee tea mulled wine smuggled brandy coffee sandman said he smelt lavender water as he went past lord skavadale its a perfectly horrid day is it not skavadale asked as he followed sandman into the library and yesterday was so very fine i ordered fires as you can see not so much for warmth as to drive out the damp the library was a large wellproportioned room where a generous fire burnt in a wide hearth between the high bookshelves a dozen armchairs were scattered across the floor but skavadale and sandman were the only occupants most of the members are in the country at this time of year skavadale explained the rooms emptiness but i had to drive up to town on business rather dull business i fear he smiled and what is your business captain an odd name sandman ignored the question the seraphim club he looked about the library but there was nothing untoward about it the only painting was a lifesize fulllength portrait that hung above the mantel it showed a thin man with a rakish goodlooking face and lavishly curled hair that hung past his shoulders he was wearing a tightwaisted coat made of floral silk with lace at its cuffs and neck while across his chest was a broad sash from which hung a baskethilted sword john wilmot second earl of rochester lord skavadale identified the man you know his work i know he was a poet sandman said and a libertine lucky man to be either skavadale said with a smile he was indeed a poet a poet of the highest wit and rarest talent and we think of him captain as our exemplar the seraphim are higher beings the highest indeed of all the angels it is a small conceit of ours higher than mere mortals like the rest of us sandman asked sourly lord skavadale was so courteous so perfect and so poised that it annoyed sandman we merely try to excel skavadale said pleasantly as i am sure you do captain in cricket and whatever else it is that you do and i am being remiss in not giving you an opportunity to tell me what that might be that opportunity had to wait a few moments for a servant came with a silver tray on which were porcelain cups and a silver pot of coffee neither lord skavadale nor sandman spoke as the coffee was poured and in the silence sandman heard a strange intermittent squeaking that sounded from a nearby room then he detected the clash of metal and realised that men were fencing and the squeaks were the sound of their shoes on a chalked floor sit please skavadale said when the servant had fed the fire and gone from the room and tell me what you think of our coffee charles corday sandman said taking a chair lord skavadale looked bemused then smiled you had me confused for a second captain charles corday of course the young man convicted of the countess of aveburys murder you are indeed a man of mystery please do tell me why you raise his name sandman sipped the coffee the saucer was blazoned with a badge showing a golden angel flying on a red shield it was just like the escutcheon sandman had seen painted on the carriage door except that this angel was quite naked the home secretary sandman said has charged me with investigating the facts of cordays conviction skavadale raised an eyebrow why because there are doubts about his guilt sandman said careful not to say that the home secretary did not share those doubts it is reassuring to know that our government goes to such lengths to protect its subjects skavadale said piously but why would that bring you to our door captain because we know that the portrait of the countess of avebury was commissioned by the seraphim club sandman said was it now skavadale asked mildly i do find that remarkable he lowered himself to perch on the leathertopped fender taking exquisite care not to crease his coat or breeches the coffee comes from java he said and is we think rather good dont you what makes the matter more interesting sandman went on is that the commission for the portrait demanded that the lady be depicted naked skavadale half smiled that sounds very sporting of the countess dont you think though she was not to know sandman said well i never skavadale mouthed the vulgarity with careful articulation but despite the mockery his dark eyes were very shrewd and he did not look surprised at all he lay the quizzingglass down on a table then sipped his coffee might i ask captain how you learnt all these remarkable facts a man facing the gallows can be very forthcoming sandman said evading the question youre informing me that corday told you this i saw him yesterday let us hope that the imminence of death makes him truthful skavadale said he smiled i confess i know nothing of this it is possible that one of our members commissioned the portrait but alas they did not confide in me but i am forced to wonder does it matter how does it affect the young mans guilt you speak for the seraphim club do you sandman asked again evading the question are you the secretary or an officer we have nothing so vulgar as officers captain we members are few in number and count ourselves as friends we do employ a man to keep the books but he makes no decisions those are made by all of us together as friends and as equals so if the seraphim club were to commission a portrait sandman persisted then you would know i would indeed skavadale said forcefully and no such portrait was commissioned by the club but as i say it is possible that one of the members commissioned it privately is the earl of avebury a member sandman asked skavadale hesitated i really cannot divulge who our members are captain this is a private club but i think it is safe for me to tell you that we do not have the honour of the earls company did you know the countess sandman asked skavadale smiled indeed i did captain many of us worshipped at her shrine for she was a lady of divine beauty and we regret her death exceedingly exceedingly he put his halfdrunk coffee on a table and stood up i fear your visit to us has been wasted captain the seraphim club i do assure you commissioned no portraits and mister corday i fear has misinformed you can i see you to the front door sandman stood he had learnt nothing and been made to feel foolish but just then a door crashed open behind him and he turned to see that one of the bookcases had a false front of leather spines glued to a door and a young man in breeches and shirt was standing there with a fencing foil in his hand and an antagonistic expression on his face i thought youd seen the culley off johnny he said to skavadale but you aint skavadale smooth as honey smiled allow me to name captain sandman the celebrated cricketer this is lord robin holloway cricketer lord robin holloway was momentarily confused i thought he was sidmouths lackey im that too sandman said lord robin heard the belligerence in sandmans voice and the foil in his hand twitched he had none of skavadales courtesy he was in his early twenties sandman judged and was as tall and handsome as his friend but where skavadale was dark holloway was golden his hair was gold there was gold on his fingers and a gold chain about his neck he licked his lips and half raised the sword so what does sidmouth want of us he demanded captain sandman was finished with us skavadale said firmly i came to ask about the countess of avebury sandman said in her grave culley in her grave holloway said a second man appeared behind him also holding a foil though sandman suspected from the mans plain shirt and trousers that he was a club servant perhaps their masteratarms the room beyond the false door was a fencing room for it had racks of foils and sabres and a plain hardwood floor what did you say your name was holloway demanded of sandman i didnt sandman said but my name is sandman rider sandman ludovic sandmans son sandman inclined his head i am bloody man cheated me lord robin holloway said his eyes slightly protuberant challenged sandman owes me money a matter for your lawyers robin lord skavadale was emollient six thousand bloody guineas lord robin holloway said and because your bloody father put a bullet between his eyes we dont get payment so what are you going to do about that culley captain sandman is leaving lord skavadale said firmly and took sandmans elbow sandman shook him off ive undertaken to pay some of my fathers debts he told lord robin sandmans temper was brewing but it did not show on his face and his voice was still respectful i am paying the debts to the tradesmen who were left embarrassed by my fathers suicide as to your debt he paused i plan to do nothing whatsoever about it damn you culley lord robin said and he drew back the foil as if to slash it across sandmans cheek lord skavadale stepped between them enough the captain is going you should never have let him in lord robin said hes nothing but a slimy little spy for bloody sidmouth next time sandman use the tradesmans entrance at the back the front door is for gentlemen sandman had been controlling his temper and was moving towards the front hall but now very suddenly he turned and walked back past both skavadale and holloway where the devil are you going holloway demanded the back door of course sandman said and then stopped by the masteratarms and held out his hand the man hesitated glanced at skavadale then frowned as sandman just snatched the foil from him sandman turned to holloway again ive changed my mind he said i think ill use the front door after all i feel like a gentleman today or does your lordship have a mind to stop me robin lord skavadale cautioned his friend damn you holloway said and he twitched up the foil swatted sandmans blade aside and lunged sandman parried to drive holloways blade high and wide then slashed his foil across his lordships face the blades tip was buttoned so it could not pierce or slash but it still left a red welt on holloways right cheek sandmans blade came back fast to mark the left cheek then he stepped three paces back and lowered the sword so what am i he asked tradesman or gentleman to hell with you holloway was in a fury now and did not recognise that his opponent had also lost his temper but sandmans temper was cold and cruel while holloways was all heat and foolishness holloway slashed the foil like a sabre hoping to open sandmans face with the sheer force of the steels whiplike strike but sandman swayed back let the blade pass an inch from his nose and then stepped forward and lunged his weapon into holloways belly the button stopped the blade from piercing cloth or skin and the weapon bent like a bow and sandman used the spring of the blade to throw himself backwards as lord robin holloway slashed again sandman stepped another pace back holloway mistook the move for nervousness and lunged his blade at sandmans neck puppy sandman said and there was an utter disdain in his voice you feeble little puppy he said and began to fight only now his rage was released an incandescent and killing rage an anger that he fought against that he hated that he prayed would leave him and he was no longer fencing but trying to kill he stamped forward his blade a hissing terror and the button raked lord holloways face almost taking an eye then the blade slashed across lord holloways nose opening it so that blood ran and the steel whipped back fast as a snakes strike and lord holloway cringed away from the pain and then suddenly a pair of very strong arms was wrapped about sandmans chest sergeant berrigan was holding him and the masteratarms was standing in front of lord robin holloway while lord skavadale wrenched the foil from his friends hand enough skavadale said enough he threw holloways foil to the far end of the room then took sandmans blade and tossed it after the first you will leave captain he insisted you will leave now sandman shook berrigans arms away he could see the fear in lord robins eyes i was fighting real men he told lord robin when you were pissing your childhood breeches go skavadale snapped sir berrigan as tall as sandman jerked his head towards the front hall i think its best if you go captain if you discover the person who commissioned the portrait sandman spoke to skavadale then i would be grateful if you would inform me he had no realistic hope that lord skavadale would do any such thing but asking the question allowed him to leave with a measure of dignity a message can be left for me at the wheatsheaf in drury lane good day captain skavadale said coldly lord robin glared at sandman but said nothing he had been whipped and he knew it the masteratarms looked respectful but he understood swordsmanship sandmans hat and greatcoat both of them half dried and wholly brushed clean were brought to him in the hallway where sergeant berrigan opened the front door the sergeant nodded bleakly at sandman who stepped past him onto the front step best not to come back sir berrigan said quietly then slammed the door it started to rain again ooooooo sandman walked slowly northwards he was truly nervous now so nervous that he wondered whether he had gone to the seraphim club merely to delay this next duty was it a duty he told himself it was though he suspected it was an indulgence and was certain it was foolishness yet sally had been right find the girl meg find her and so discover the truth and the best way of finding a servant was to ask other servants which was why he was walking to davies street a place he had assiduously avoided for the last six months yet when he knocked on the door it all seemed so familiar and hammond the butler did not even blink an eyelid captain rider he said what a pleasure sir may i take your coat you should carry an umbrella sir you know the duke never approved of umbrellas hammond the duke of wellington might order the fashion of soldiers sir but his grace has no authority over london pedestrians might i enquire how your mother is sir she doesnt change hammond the world suits her ill i am sorry to hear it sir hammond hung sandmans coat and hat on a rack that was already heavy with other garments have you an invitation card he asked lady forrest is giving a musical entertainment im afraid i wasnt invited i was hoping sir henry was at home but if not i can leave a note he is home sir and i am sure he will want to receive you why dont you wait in the small parlour the small parlour was twice the size of the drawing room in the house sandman rented for his mother and sister in winchester a fact his mother mentioned frequently but which did not bear thinking of now and so he gazed at a painting of sheep in a meadow and listened to a tenor singing a flamboyant piece beyond the double doors that led to the larger rooms at the back of the house the man finished with a flourish there was a patter of applause and then the door from the hall opened and sir henry forrest came in my dear rider sir henry a new french tenor sir henry said dolefully who should have been stopped at dover sir henry had never much appreciated his wifes musical entertainments and usually took good care to avoid them i forgot there was an entertainment this afternoon he explained otherwise i might have stayed at the bank he gave sandman a sly smile how are you rider im well thank you and you sir keeping busy rider keeping busy the court of aldermen demands time and europe needs money and we supply it or at least we scrape up the business that rothschild and baring dont want have you seen the price of corn sixtythree shillings a quarter in norwich last week can you credit it sir henry had given sandmans clothes a swift inspection to determine if his fortunes had improved and decided they had not how is your mother querulous sandman said sir henry grimaced querulous yes poor woman he shuddered still has the dogs does she i fear so sir sandmans mother lavished affection on two lap dogs noisy illmannered and smelly sir henry opened the drawer of a sideboard and took out two cigars cant smoke in the conservatory today he said so we might as well be hanged for fumigating the parlour eh he paused to light a tinder box then the cigar his height slight stoop silver hair and doleful face had always reminded sandman of don quixote yet the resemblance was misleading as dozens of business rivals had discovered too late sir henry son of an apothecary had an instinctive understanding of money how to make it how to use it and how to multiply it those skills had helped build the ships and feed the armies and cast the guns that had defeated napoleon and they had brought henry forrest his knighthood for which his wife was more than grateful he was in brief a man of talent though hesitant in dealing with people its good to see you rider he said now and he meant it for sandman was one of the few people sir henry felt comfortable with its been too long it has sir henry so what are you doing these days a rather unusual job sir which has persuaded me to seek a favour from you a favour eh sir henry still sounded friendly but there was caution in his eyes i really need to ask it of hammond sir of hammond eh sir henry peered at sandman as if he was unsure whether he had heard correctly my butler i should explain sandman said i imagine you should sir henry said and then still frowning in perplexity went back to the sideboard where he poured two brandies you will have a glass with me wont you it still seems odd to see you out of uniform so what is it you want of hammond but before sandman could explain the double doors to the drawing room opened and eleanor was standing there and the light from the large drawing room was behind her so that it seemed as if her hair was a red halo about her face she looked at sandman then took a very long breath before smiling at her father mother was concerned that you would miss the duet papa the duet eh the pearman sisters papa have been practising for weeks eleanor explained then looked back again to sandman rider she said softly miss eleanor he said very formally then bowed she gazed at him behind her in the drawing room a score of guests were perched on gilt chairs that faced the open doors of the conservatory where two young women were seating themselves on the piano bench eleanor glanced at them then firmly closed the doors i think the pearman sisters can manage without me how are you rider i am well thank you well he had thought for a second that he would not be able to speak for the breath had caught in his throat and he could feel tears in his eyes eleanor was wearing a dress of palegreen silk with yellow lace at the breast and cuffs she had a necklace of gold and amber that sandman had not seen before and he felt a strange jealousy of the life she had led in the last six months she was he remembered engaged to be married and that cut deep though he took care to betray nothing i am well he said again and you i am distraught that you are well eleanor said with mock severity to think you can be well without me this is misery rider eleanor her father chided her i tease papa it is permitted and so few things are she turned on sandman have you just come to town for the day i live here sandman said i didnt know her grey eyes seemed huge what had sir george phillips said of her that her nose was too long her chin too sharp her eyes too far apart her hair too red and her mouth too lavish and it was all true yet just by looking at her sandman felt almost lightheaded as though he had drunk a whole bottle of brandy and not just two sips he stared at her and she stared back and neither spoke here in london sir henry broke the silence sir sandman forced himself to look at sir henry you live here rider in london in drury lane sir sir henry frowned thats a trifle he paused dangerous its a tavern sandman explained that was recommended to me by a rifle officer in winchester and i was settled in before i discovered it was perhaps a less than desirable address but it suits me have you been here long eleanor asked three weeks he admitted a little over she looked sandman thought as though he had struck her in the face and you didnt call she protested sandman felt himself reddening i was not sure he said to what end i should call i thought you would appreciate it if i did not if you thought at all eleanor said tartly her eyes were grey almost smoky with flecks of green in them sir henry gestured feebly towards the doors youre missing the duet my dear he said and rider came here to see hammond of all people isnt that right rider its not really a social call at all hammond yes sandman confirmed what on earth do you want with hammond eleanor asked her eyes suddenly bright with inquisitiveness im sure thats for the two of them to discuss sir henry said stiffly and me of course he added hastily eleanor ignored her father what she demanded of sandman rather a long story i fear sandman said apologetically better that than listening to the pearman sisters murder their music teachers setting of mozart eleanor said then took a chair and put on an expectant face my dear her father began and was immediately interrupted papa eleanor said sternly i am sure that nothing rider wants with hammond is unsuitable for a young womans ears and that is more than i can say for the effusions of the pearman girls rider sandman suppressed a smile and told his tale and that gave rise to astonishment for neither eleanor nor her father had connected charles corday with sir george phillips it was bad enough that the countess of avebury had been murdered in the next street now it seemed that the convicted murderer had spent time in eleanors company im sure its the same young man eleanor said though i only ever heard him referred to as charlie but he seemed to do a great deal of the work that probably was him sandman said best not to tell your mother sir henry observed gently shell think i came within an inch of being murdered eleanor said i doubt he is a murderer sandman put in and besides you were chaperoned surely her father enquired of eleanor of course i was chaperoned papa this is she looked at sandman and raised an eyebrow a respectable family the countess was also chaperoned sandman said and he explained about the missing girl meg and how he needed servants to retail the local gossip about the fate of the staff from aveburys house he apologised profusely for even thinking of involving hammond servants tittletattle isnt something id encourage sir he said and was interrupted by eleanor dont be so stuffy rider she said it doesnt require encouraging or discouraging it just happens but the truth is sandman went on that the servants all talk to each other and if hammond can ask the maids what theyve heard then youll learn nothing eleanor interrupted again my dear her father protested nothing eleanor reiterated firmly hammond is a very good butler and an admirable christian indeed ive often thought he would make a quite outstanding bishop but the maidservants are all quite terrified of him no the person to ask is my maid lizzie you cant involve lizzie sir henry objected why ever not because you cant her father said unable to find a cogent reason it simply isnt right it isnt right that corday should hang not if hes innocent and you papa should know that ive never seen you so shocked sandman looked enquiringly at sir henry who shrugged duty took me to newgate he admitted we city aldermen i discovered are the legal employers of the hangman and the wretch has petitioned us for an assistant one never likes to disburse funds unnecessarily so two of us undertook to discover the demands of his work and have you made a decision yet eleanor asked were taking the sheriffs advice sir henry said my own inclination was to refuse the request but i confess that might have been mere prejudice against the hangman he struck me as a vile wretch vile not an employment that would attract persons of quality eleanor remarked drily botting hes called james botting sir henry shuddered hangings not a pretty thing rider have you ever seen one ive seen men after theyve been hanged sandman said thinking of badajoz with its ditch streaming with blood and its streets filled with screams the british army breaking into the spanish city despite a grim french defence had inflicted a terrible revenge on the inhabitants and wellington had ordered the hangmen to cool the redcoats anger we used to hang plunderers he explained to sir henry i suppose you had to sir henry said its a terrible death terrible but necessary of course no one disputes that they do his daughter put in no one of sound mind disputes it her father amended his statement firmly but i trust i shall never have to witness another i should like to see one eleanor said dont be ridiculous her father snapped i should eleanor insisted we are constantly told that the purpose of execution is twofold to punish the guilty and to deter others from crime to which intent it is presented as a public spectacle so my immortal soul would undoubtedly be safer if i was to witness a hanging and thus be prejudiced against whatever crime i might one day be tempted to commit she looked from her bemused father to sandman then back to her father again youre thinking im an unlikely felon papa thats kind of you but im sure the girl who was hanged last monday was an unlikely felon sandman looked at sir henry who nodded unwilling confirmation they hanged a girl im afraid he said then stared at the rug and only a young thing rider only a young thing perhaps eleanor persisted if her father had taken her to witness a hanging then she would have been deterred from her crime you could even say papa that you are failing in your christian and paternal duty if you do not take me to newgate sir henry stared at her not certain that she was talking in jest then he looked at sandman and shrugged as if to suggest that his daughter was not to be taken seriously so you think rider that my servants might have heard of this girl megs fate i was hoping so sir or that they could ask questions of the servants who live in mount street the avebury house isnt a stones throw away and im sure all the servants in the area know each other im sure lizzie knows everyone eleanor said pointedly my dear her father spoke sternly these are delicate matters not a game eleanor gave her father an exasperated look it is servants gossip papa and hammond is above such things lizzie on the other hand thrives on it sir henry shifted uncomfortably theres no danger is there he asked sandman i cant think so sir as eleanor says we only want to know where the girl meg went and thats merely gossip lizzie can explain her interest by saying one of our coachmen was sweet on her eleanor said enthusiastically her father was unhappy at the thought of involving eleanor but he was almost incapable of refusing his daughter she was his only child and such was his affection for her that he might even have permitted her to marry sandman despite sandmans poverty and despite the disgrace attendant on his family but lady forrest had other ideas eleanors mother had always seen rider sandman as second best it was true that when the original engagement took place sandman had the prospect of considerable wealth enough to have persuaded lady forrest that he would just about make an acceptable soninlaw but he did not have the one thing lady forrest wanted above all else for her daughter he had no title and lady forrest dreamt that eleanor would one day be a duchess a marchioness a countess or at the very least a lady sandmans impoverishment had given lady forrest the excuse to pounce and her husband for all his indulgence of eleanor could not prevail against his wifes determination that her child should be the titled mistress of marble stairways vast acres and ballrooms large enough to manoeuvre whole brigades so though eleanor might not marry where she wanted she would be allowed to ask her maidservant to delve the gossip from mount street i shall write to you eleanor said to sandman if you tell me where care of the wheatsheaf sandman told her in drury lane eleanor stood and rising onto tiptoe kissed her fathers cheek thank you papa she said whatever for for letting me do something useful even if it is only encouraging lizzies propensity for gossip and thank you rider she took his hand im proud of you i hope you always were of course i was but this is a good thing youre doing she held onto his hand as the door opened lady forrest came in she had the same red hair and the same beauty and the same force of character as her daughter though eleanors grey eyes and intelligence had come from her father lady forrests eyes widened when she saw her daughter holding sandman by the hand but she forced a smile captain sandman she greeted him in a voice that could have cut glass this is a surprise lady forrest sandman managed a bow despite his trapped hand just what are you doing eleanor lady forrests voice was now only a few degrees above freezing reading riders palm mama ah lady forrest was immediately intrigued she feared her daughters unsuitable attachment to a pauper but was thoroughly attracted to the idea of supernatural forces she will never read mine captain lady forrest said she refuses so what do you see there eleanor pretended to scrutinise sandmans palm i scry she said portentously a journey somewhere pleasant i hope lady forrest said to scotland eleanor said it can be very pleasant at this time of year lady forrest remarked sir henry wiser than his wife saw a reference to gretna green looming enough eleanor he said quietly yes papa eleanor let go of sandmans hand and dropped her father a curtsey so what brings you here rid lady forrest almost forgot herself but managed a timely correction captain rider very kindly brought me news of a rumour that the portuguese might be defaulting on their shortterm loans sir henry answered for sandman which doesnt surprise me i must say we advised against the conversion as youll remember my dear you did dear im sure lady forrest was not sure at all but she was nevertheless satisfied with the explanation now come eleanor she said tea is being served and you are ignoring our guests we have lord eagleton here she told sandman proudly lord eagleton was the man whom eleanor was supposed to be marrying and sandman flinched im not acquainted with his lordship he said stiffly hardly surprising lady forrest said for he only moves in the best of circles henry must you smoke in here yes sir henry said i must i do hope you enjoy your visit to scotland captain lady forrest said then led her daughter away and closed the door on the cigar smoke scotland sir henry said gloomily then shook his head they dont hang nearly as many in scotland as we do in england and wales yet i believe the murder rate is no higher he stared at sandman strange that wouldnt you say very strange sir still i suppose the home office knows its business he turned and gazed moodily into the hearth it isnt a quick death rider not quick at all yet the keeper was inordinately proud of the whole process wanted our approbation and insisted on showing us the rest of the prison sir henry fell silent frowning you know he went on after a while theres a corridor from the prison to the sessions house so the prisoners dont need to walk in the street when they go to trial birdcage walk they call it and its where they bury the hanged men and women i suppose though the girl i saw hanged was taken to the surgeons for dissection he had been looking into the empty fireplace as he spoke but now looked up at sandman the flagstones of birdcage walk were wobbling rider wobbling thats because the graves are always settling underneath them they had casks of lime there to hasten the decomposition it was vile indescribably vile im sorry you had to experience it sandman said i thought it my duty sir henry replied with a shudder i was with a friend and he took an indecent delight in it all the gallows is a necessary thing of course it is but not to be enjoyed surely or am i being too scrupulous youre being very helpful sir henry and im grateful sir henry nodded itll be a day or two before you get your answer im sure but lets hope it helps are you going you must come again rider you must come again he took sandman through to the hall and helped him with his coat and sandman walked away not even noticing whether it was raining or not he was thinking of lord eagleton eleanor had not behaved as though she were in love with his lordship indeed she had made a face expressing distaste when his lordships name was mentioned and that gave sandman hope but then he asked himself what did love have to do with marriage marriage was about money and land and respectability about staying above financial ruin about reputation and love god damn it sandman thought but he was in love ooooooo it was not raining now indeed it was a beautiful late afternoon with a rare clear sky above london everything looked cleancut newly washed pristine the rain clouds had flown westwards and fashionable london was spilling onto the streets open carriages pulled by matching teams with polished coats and ribboned manes clipped smartly towards hyde park for the daily parade street bands vied with each other trumpets shrilling drums banging and collectors shaking their money boxes sandman was oblivious he was thinking of eleanor and when he could no longer wring any clue as to her intentions from every remembered glance and nuance he wondered what he had achieved in the day he had learnt he thought that corday had mostly told him the truth and he had confirmed to himself that bored young aristocrats were among the least courteous of all men and he had usefully started eleanors maid on her search for gossip but in truth he had not learnt much he could not report anything to viscount sidmouth so what to do he thought about that when he returned to the wheatsheaf and took his laundry down to the woman who charged a penny for each shirt and he had to stand talking for twenty minutes or else she took offence then he stitched up his boots using a sailmakers needle and palm leather which he borrowed from the landlord and when his boots were crudely mended he brushed his coat trying to get a stain out of the tail he reflected that of all the inconveniences of poverty the lack of a servant to keep clothes clean was the most timeconsuming time it was what he needed most and he tried to decide what he should do next go to wiltshire he told himself he did not want to go because it was far it would be expensive and he had no assurance that he would find the girl meg if he went but if he waited to hear from eleanor then it might already be too late there was a chance even a good chance that the servants from the london house had all been taken down to the earls country estate so go there he told himself catch the mail coach in the morning and he would be there by early afternoon and he could catch the mail coach back in the next days dawn but he cringed at the expense he thought of using a stage coach and guessed that would cost no more than a pound each way but the stage coach would not get him to wiltshire before the evening it would probably take him at least two or three hours to find the earl of aveburys house and so he was unlikely to reach it before dark and that meant he would have to wait until next morning to approach the household while if he used the mail coach he would be at the earls estate by midafternoon at the latest it would cost him at least twice as much but corday only had five days left and sandman counted his change and wished he had not been so generous as to buy sally hood her dinner then chided himself for that ungallant thought and walked down to the mail office on charing cross where he paid two pounds and seven shillings for the last of the four seats on the next mornings mail to marlborough he went back to the wheatsheaf where in the inns back room among the beer barrels and the broken furniture waiting for repair he blacked and polished his newly mended boots it was a dark and malodorous space haunted by rats and by dodds the inns errand boy and sandman seated on a barrel in a dark corner heard doddss tuneless whistle and was about to call out a greeting when he heard a strangers voice sandman aint upstairs i saw him come in dodds said in his usual truculent manner sandman very quietly pulled on his boots the strangers voice had been harsh not one inviting sandman to call out and identify himself but rather to persuade him to look for a weapon the only thing to hand was a barrel stave it was not much but he held it like a sword as he edged towards the door you find anything the stranger asked this tail and a cricket bat another man answered and sandman still in the shadows swayed forward and saw a young man holding his bat and his army sword the two men must have gone upstairs and found sandman absent so the one had come down to look for him while the other had stayed to search his room and found the only two things of any value sandman could ill afford to lose either and his task now was to retrieve the bat and sword and to discover who the two men were ill look in the taproom the first man said bring him back here the second said and so delivered himself into sandmans mercy because all sandman needed to do was wait the first man followed dodds through the service door and left the second man in the passage where he half drew sandmans sword and peered at the inscription on the blade he was still peering when sandman stepped from the back room and rammed the stave like a truncheon into the mans kidneys the wood splintered with the impact and the man lurched forward gasping and sandman let go of the stave seized the mans hair and pulled him backwards the man flailed for balance but sandman tripped him so that he crashed back onto the floor where sandman stamped hard on his groin the man shrieked and curled around his agony sandman retrieved the bat and sword that had fallen in the passageway the fight had not taken more than a few seconds and the man was moaning and twitching incapacitated by sheer pain but that did not mean he would not recover quickly sandman feared he might be carrying a pistol so he used the sword scabbard to tweak the mans coat aside and saw yellow and black livery youre from the seraphim club sandman asked and the man gasped through his pain but the answer was not informative and sandman was not minded to obey the injunction he stooped by the man felt in his coat pockets and found a pistol which he tugged out though in his haste he ripped the pockets lining with the pistols doghead is it loaded he asked the man repeated his injunction so sandman put the barrel by his head and cocked the gun ill ask again he said is it loaded yes so why are you here they wanted you fetched back to the club why i dont know they just sent us it made sense that the man knew little more than that so sandman stepped back just get out he said collect your friend in the taproom and tell him that if he wants to make trouble for a soldier then he should bring an army the man twisted on the floor and looked up incredulously i can go get out sandman said and he watched the man climb to his feet and limp out of the passage so why he wondered would the seraphim club want him and why send two bullies to fetch him why not just send an invitation he followed the limping man into the taproom where a score of customers were seated at the tables a blind fiddler was tuning his instrument in the chimney corner and he looked up sharply white eyes blank as sally hood uttered a squeak of alarm she was staring at the gun in sandmans hand he raised it pointing the blackened muzzle at the ceiling and the two men took the hint and fled sandman carefully lowered the flint and pushed the weapon into his belt as sally ran across the room whats happening she asked and in her anxiety she clutched sandmans arm its all right sally sandman said oh bleeding hell its not she said and now she was looking past him her eyes huge and sandman heard the sound of a gun being cocked he eased his arm from sallys grip and turned to see a longbarrelled pistol pointing between his eyes the seraphim club had not sent two men to fetch him but three and the third sandman suspected was the most dangerous of all for it was sergeant berrigan once of his majestys first foot guards he was sitting in a booth grinning and sally took hold of sandmans arm again and uttered a small moan of fear its like french dragoons captain sergeant berrigan said if you dont see the bastards off properly the first time then sure as eggs theyll be back to trap you and sandman was trapped chapter four sergeant berrigan kept the pistol pointed at sandman for a heartbeat then he lowered the flint put the weapon on the table and nodded at the bench opposite you just won me a pound captain you bastard sally spat at berrigan sally sally sandman calmed her hes got no bleeding right to point a stick at you she protested then turned on berrigan who do you bleeding think you are sandman eased her onto the bench then sat beside her allow me to name sergeant berrigan he told her once of his majestys first foot guards this is miss sally hood sam berrigan the sergeant said plainly amused by sallys fury and im honoured miss im bleeding not honoured she glared at him a pound sandman asked berrigan i said those two dozy bastards wouldnt take you sir not captain sandman of the nd sandman half smiled lord skavadale seemed to know me as a cricketer not as a soldier i was the one what knew the regiment you served in berrigan said then snapped his fingers and one of the serving girls came running sandman was not particularly impressed that berrigan knew his old regiment but he was very impressed by a stranger who could command such instant service in the wheatsheaf there was something very competent about sam berrigan ill have an ale miss the sergeant told the girl then he looked at sally your pleasure miss hood sally debated with herself for a second deciding whether her pleasure was to reject sam berrigans offer then she decided life was too short to turn down a drink ill have a gin punch molly she said sulkily ale sandman said berrigan put a coin in mollys palm folded her fingers over it and then held on to her hand a jug of ale molly he said and make sure the gin punch is as fine as any wed get at limmers molly entranced by the sergeant dropped a curtsey to him mister jenks sir she whispered he dont like sticks on his tables berrigan smiled let go of her hand and put the pistol in a deep pocket of his jacket he looked at sandman lord robin holloway sent those two he said dismissively and the marquess sent me marquess skavadale captain he didnt want you to come to any harm his lordship is very generous suddenly no sir berrigan said the marquess doesnt want to stir up trouble but lord robin he dont care hes a halfwit is what he is he sent those two to persuade you back to the club where he planned to challenge you to a duel sandman was amused pistols i imagine berrigan was equally amused i cant see him wanting to take you on with a blade again but i told the marquess those two would never force you you were too good a soldier sandman smiled how do you know what kind of a soldier i was sergeant i know exactly what sort of swoddy you was berrigan said he had a good face sandman thought broad tough and with confident eyes sandman shrugged i dont believe i had any particular reputation berrigan looked at sally it was the end of the day at waterloo miss and we was beaten i knew it ive been in enough fights to know when youre beaten and we was just standing there and dying we hadnt given in dont get me wrong miss but the bloody crapauds had us beat there was simply too many of the bastards wed been killing them all day and still they kept coming and it was days end and the last of them was coming up the hill and there were four times as many of them as there were of us i watched him he jerked his head at sandman and he was walking up and down in front of the line like he didnt have a care in the world youd lost your hat hadnt you sir sandman laughed at that memory i had youre right his bicorne hat had been blasted off by a french musket ball and it had vanished he had immediately searched the fireblackened ground where he was standing but the hat had gone he never did find it it was his fair hair berrigan explained to sally stood out in a dark day up and down he walked and the crapauds had a swarm of skirmishers not fifty paces off and they was all shooting at him and he didnt blink an eyelid just walked sandman was embarrassed i was only doing my duty sergeant like you were and i was terrified i can tell you but youre the one we noticed doing the duty berrigan said then looked back to sally who was listening open mouthed hes walking up and down and the emperors own guard are coming up the hill at us and i thought to myself thats it thats it sam a short life and a shallow grave cos there were precious few of us left but the captain here he was still strolling like it was sunday in hyde park and then he stopped walking and he watched the frenchies as cool as you like and then he laughed i dont remember that sandman said you did berrigan insisted theres death in bluecoats coming up the hill and you were laughing i had a colour sergeant who made very bad jokes at inappropriate moments sandman said so i imagine he said something rather indecent then i watched him take his men round the flank of the bastards berrigan continued telling sally his story and he beat them into hell that wasnt me sandman said reprovingly it was johnny colborne who marched us round the flank it was his regiment but you led them berrigan insisted you led no no no sandman countered i was just closest to you sergeant and we certainly didnt beat the french guards alone as i recall your regiment was in the thick of it we was good that day berrigan allowed we was very good and we bloody well had to be cos the crapauds were fierce as buggery he poured two pots of ale then raised his own tankard your very good health captain ill drink to that sandman said though i doubt your employers would share the sentiment lord robin dont like you berrigan said on account that you made him look a bloody idiot but that aint difficult seeing as he is a bloody idiot maybe they dont like me sandman observed because they dont want the countesss murder investigated dont suppose they care one way or another berrigan said i hear they commissioned the portrait and the marquess admitted knowing the dead woman sandman tallied the points that counted against berrigans employers and they refuse to answer questions i suspect them berrigan drank from his tankard then refilled it from the jug he stared at sandman for a few seconds then shrugged theyre the seraphim club captain so yes theyve done murder and theyve thieved theyve bribed theyve even tried highway robbery they call them pranks but killing the countess ive heard nothing would you have heard sandman asked maybe not berrigan allowed but we servants know most of what they do because we clean up after them because theyre being flash sally sounded indignant it was one thing for her friends at the wheatsheaf to be criminals but they had been born poor why the hell do they want to be flash she asked theyre rich already aint they berrigan looked at her evidently liking what he saw thats exactly why they do it miss because they are rich he said rich titled and privileged and on account of that they reckon theyre better than the rest of us and theyre bored what they want they take and what gets in their way they destroy or get you to destroy it sandman guessed berrigan gave sandman a very level look there are thirtyeight seraphims he said and twenty servants and that dont count the kitchens or the girls and it takes all twenty of us to clean up their messes theyre rich enough so they dont have to care his tone suggested he was warning sandman and theyre bastards captain real bastards yet you work for them sandman spoke very gently im no saint captain berrigan said and they pay me well because they need your silence sandman guessed and when there was no reply he pushed a little harder what do they need your silence about berrigan glanced at sally then looked back to sandman you dont want to know he growled sandman understood the implications of that quick glance at sally rape he asked berrigan nodded but said nothing is that the purpose of the club sandman asked the purpose berrigan said is for them to do whatever they want theyre all lords or baronets or rich as hell and the rest of the world are peasants and they reckon they have the right to do whatever they fancy theres not a man there who shouldnt be hanged you included sandman asked and when the sergeant did not answer he asked another question why are you telling me all this lord robin holloway berrigan said wants you dead because you humiliated him but i wont stand for it captain not after waterloo that was a he paused frowning as he tried and failed to find the right word i didnt think id live through it he confessed instead and nothing beens the same since we went to the gates of hell miss he looked at sally and we got deep scorched but we marched out again the sergeants voice had been hoarse with emotion and sandman understood that he had met many soldiers who could begin crying just thinking about their years of service about the battles they had endured and the friends they had lost sam berrigan looked as hard as a cobblestone and undoubtedly he was but he was also a very sentimental man theres been hardly a day that i havent seen you in my mind berrigan went on out on that ridge in that bloody smoke its what i remember about the battle just that and i dont know why so i dont want you harmed by some spavined halfwit like lord robin holloway sandman smiled i think youre here sergeant because you want to leave the seraphim club berrigan leant back and contemplated sandman and then more appreciatively sally she blushed under his scrutiny and he took a cigar from his inside pocket and struck a light with a tinder box i dont intend to be any mans servant for long he said when the cigar was drawing but when i leave captain ill set up in business doing what sandman asked these berrigan tapped the cigar a lot of gentlemen acquired a taste for these in the spanish war but theyre curious hard to come by i find them for the club members and i make almost as much tin that way as i do from wages you understand me captain im not sure i do i dont need your advice i dont need your preaching and i dont need your help sam berrigan can look after himself i just came to warn you nothing else get out of town captain joy shall be in heaven sandman said over one sinner that repenteth oh no no no no berrigan shook his head i just done you a favour captain and thats it he stood up and thats all i came to do sandman smiled i could do with some help sergeant so when you decide to leave the club come and find me im leaving london tomorrow but ill be back here on thursday afternoon youd better bloody be sally put in sandman amused raised an eyebrow its that private performance sally explained youre coming to covent garden to cheer me arent you its aladdin aladdin eh a half bloody rehearsed aladdin got to be in there tomorrow morning to learn the steps you are coming arent you captain of course i am sandman said and looked back to berrigan so ill be back here on thursday and thank you for the ale and when you decide to help me then you know where to find me berrigan stared at him for a heartbeat said nothing then nodded at sally and walked away after putting a handful of coins on the table sandman watched him leave a very troubled young man sally he said dont look troubled to me goodlooking though aint he is he course he is sally said forcefully but hes still troubled sandman said he wants to be good and finds it easy to be bad welcome to life sally said so were going to have to help make him good arent we we she sounded alarmed ive decided i cant put the world to rights all on my own sandman said i need allies my dear and youre elected so far theres you someone i saw this afternoon maybe sergeant berrigan and sandman turned as a newcomer to the taproom knocked down a chair apologised profusely fumbled his walking stick and then struck his head on a beam the reverend lord alexander pleydell had arrived and your admirer makes four sandman finished and maybe five for lord alexander had a young man with him a young man with an open face and a troubled expression youre captain sandman the young man did not wait for an introduction but just hurried across the room and held out his hand at your service sandman said cautiously thank god ive found you the young man said my name is carne christopher carne im pleased to meet you sandman said politely though the name meant nothing to him and the young mans face was quite unfamiliar the countess of avebury was my stepmother carne explained i am my fathers only son only child indeed and thus heir to the earldom ah sandman said we must talk carne said please we must talk lord alexander was bowing to sally and at the same time blushing deep scarlet sandman knew his friend would be content for a while so he led carne to the back of the taproom where a booth offered some privacy we must talk carne said again dear god sandman you can prevent a great injustice and god knows you must so they talked ooooooo he was of course the lord christopher carne call me kit he said please sandman was no radical he had never shared lord alexanders passion to pull down a society based on wealth and privilege but nor did he like calling men my lord unless he truly found them or their office worthy of respect he had no doubt that the marquess of skavadale had noted that reluctance just as sandman had noted that the marquess was gentleman enough not to remark on it but though sandman was unwilling to address lord christopher carne as my lord he was equally unwilling to call him kit so it was better to call him nothing sandman just listened lord christopher carne was a nervous hesitant young man with thicklensed spectacles he was very short had thin hair and the faintest suggestion of a stammer in all he was not a prepossessing man though he did possess an intensity of manner that compensated for his apparent weakness my father he told sandman is a dreadful man just ddreadful dreadful it is as though the ten commandments sandman were quite ddeliberately compiled as a challenge to him especially the seventh adultery of course he ignores it sandman ignores it behind the magnifying lenses of his glasses lord christophers eyes widened as though the very thought of adultery was horrid then his lordship blushed as if to mention it was shameful he was dressed sandman noted respectably enough in a wellcut coat and a fine shirt but the cuffs of both were stained with ink betraying a bookish disposition my ppoint lord christopher seemed uncomfortable under sandmans scrutiny is that like many habitual sinners my father takes umbrage when he is sinned against i dont understand lord christopher blinked several times he has sinned with many mens wives captain sandman he said uncomfortably but he was furious when his own wife was unfaithful your stepmother just so he threatened to kill her i heard him to threaten to kill someone sandman observed is not the same as killing them i am apprised of the difference lord christopher answered with a surprising asperity but i have talked with alexander and he tells me you have a duty to the painter cordell corday just so and i cannot believe cannot believe he did it what cause did he have but my father sandman my father had cause lord christopher spoke with a savage vehemence even leaning forward and gripping sandmans wrist as he made the accusation then realising what he had done he blushed and let go you will perhaps understand he went on more mildly if i tell you a little of my fathers story the tale was briefly told the earls first wife lord christophers mother had been the daughter of a noble family and lord christopher averred a living saint he treated her wretchedly sandman he said shaming her abusing her and insulting her but she endured it with a christian forbearance until she died that was in nine god rest her dear soul amen sandman said piously he hardly mourned her lord christopher said indignantly but just went on taking women to his bed and among them was celia collett she was scarce a child sandman a mere third his age but he was besotted celia collett my stepmother and she was clever sandman she was clever the savagery was back in his voice she was an opera dancer at the sans pareil do you know it i know of it sandman said mildly the sans pareil on the strand was one of the new unlicensed theatres that put on entertainments that were lavish with dance and song and if celia countess of avebury had graced its stage then she must have been beautiful she refused his advances lord christopher took up his tale again she turned him down flat kept him from her bbed till he married her and then she led him a dance sandman a dance i wont say he didnt deserve it for he did but she took what money she could and used it to buy horns for his head you obviously didnt like her sandman observed lord christopher blushed again i hardly knew her he said uncomfortably but what was there to like the woman had no religion few manners and scarce any education did your father does your father sandman amended himself care for such things as religion manners or education lord christopher frowned as though he did not understand the question then nodded you have understood him precisely he said my father cares nothing for god for letters or for courtesy he hates me sandman and do you know why because the estate is entailed onto me his own father did that his very own father lord christopher tapped the table to emphasise his point sandman said nothing but he understood that an entailed estate implied a great insult to the present earl of avebury for it meant that his father lord christophers grandfather had so mistrusted his own son that he had made certain he could not inherit the family fortune instead it was placed in the hands of trustees and though the present earl could live off the estates income the capital and the land and investments would all be held in trust until he died when they would pass to lord christopher he hates me lord christopher went on not only because of the entail but because i have expressed a wish to take holy orders a wish sandman asked it is not a step to bbe taken lightly lord christopher said sternly indeed not sandman said and my father knows that when he dies and the family fortune passes to me that it will be used in gods service that annoys him the conversation sandman thought had passed a long way from lord christophers assertion that his father had committed the murder it is i understand he said carefully a considerable fortune very considerable lord christopher said evenly sandman leant back gales of laughter gusted about the taproom which was crowded now though folk instinctively avoided the booth where sandman and lord christopher talked so earnestly lord alexander was staring with doglike devotion at sally oblivious of the other men trying to catch her attention sandman looked back to the diminutive lord christopher your stepmother he said had a considerable household in mount street what happened to those servants lord christopher blinked rapidly as if the question surprised him i have no conception would they have gone to your fathers estate they might lord christopher sounded dubious why do you ask sandman shrugged as if the questions he was asking were of no great importance though the truth was that he disliked lord christopher and he also knew that dislike was as irrational and unfair as his distaste for charles corday lord christopher like corday lacked what for want of a better word sandman thought of as manliness he doubted that lord christopher was a pixie as sally would put it indeed the glances he kept throwing towards sally suggested the opposite but there was a petulant weakness in him sandman could imagine this small learned man as a clergyman obsessed with his congregations pettiest sins and his distaste for lord christopher meant he had no wish to prolong this conversation so instead of admitting to megs existence he just said that he would like to discover from the servants what had happened on the day of the countesss murder if theyre loyal to my father lord christopher said they will tell you nothing why should that loyalty make them dumb because he killed her lord christopher cried too loudly and immediately blushed when he saw he had attracted the attention of folk at other tables or at least he ccaused her to be killed he has gout he no longer walks far but he has men who are loyal to him men who do his bidding evil men he shuddered you must tell the home secretary that corday is innocent i doubt it will make any difference if i do sandman said no why in gods name why lord sidmouth takes the view that corday has already been found guilty sandman explained so to change that verdict i need either to produce the true murderer with a confession or else adduce proof of cordays innocence that is incontrovertible opinion alas does not suffice lord christopher gazed at sandman in silence for a few heartbeats you must of course i must dear god lord christopher seemed astonished and leant back looking faint so you have five days to find the real killer indeed so the boy is doomed is he not sandman feared corday was doomed but he would not admit it not yet for there were still five days left to find the truth and thus to steal a soul from newgates scaffold ooooooo at half past four in the morning a pair of lamps glimmered feebly from the windows of the yard of the george inn dawn was touching the roofs with a wan gleam a caped coachman yawned hugely then flicked his whip at a snarling terrier that slunk out of the way of the massive coachhouse doors that were dragged open to reveal a gleaming darkblue mail coach the vehicle bright with new varnish and with its doors windows harness pole and splinter bar picked out in scarlet was manhandled onto the yards cobbles where a boy lit its two oil lanterns and a halfdozen men heaved the mail bags into its boot the eight horses highstepping and frisky their breath misting the night air were led from the stables the two coachmen both in the royal mails blue and red livery and both armed with blunderbusses and pistols locked the boot and then watched as the team was harnessed one minute a voice shouted and sandman drank the scalding coffee that the inn had provided for the mails passengers the lead coachman yawned again then clambered up to the box all aboard there were four passengers sandman and a middleaged clergyman took the front seat with their backs to the horses while an elderly couple sat opposite them and so close that their knees could not help touching sandmans mail coaches were light and cramped but twice as fast as the larger stage coaches there was a squeal of hinges as the inn yards gates were dragged open then the carriage swayed as the coachmen whipped the team out into tothill street the sound of the thirtytwo hooves echoed sharp from houses and the wheels cracked and rumbled as the coach gathered speed but sandman was fast asleep again by the time it reached knightsbridge he woke at about six oclock to find the coach was rattling along at a fine pace swaying and lurching through a landscape of small fields and scattered coverts the clergyman had a notebook on his lap halfmoon spectacles on his nose and a watch in his hand he was peering through the windows on either side searching for milestones and saw that sandman had woken a fraction over nine miles an hour he exclaimed really indeed another milestone passed and the clergyman began working out sums on the page of his notebook ten and carry three thats half again minus sixteen carry two well i never certainly nine and a quarter i once travelled at an average velocity of eleven miles an hour but that was in eighteenofour and it was a very dry summer very dry and the roads were smooth the coach hit a rut and lurched violently throwing the clergyman against sandmans shoulder very smooth indeed he said then peered through the window again the elderly man clutched a valise to his chest and looked terrified as though sandman or the clergyman might prove to be a thief though in truth highwaymen like sallys brother were a much greater danger not this morning though for sandman saw that two robin redbreasts were riding escort the redbreasts were the horse patrol all retired cavalrymen who uniformed in blue coats over red waistcoats and armed with pistols and sabres guarded the roads close to london the two patrolmen kept the coach company until it clattered through a village and there the pair peeled away towards a tavern where despite the early hour a couple of men in long smocks were already sitting in the porch and drinking ale sandman gazed fixedly out of the window revelling in being out of london the air seemed so remarkably clean there was no pervading stench of coal smoke and horse dung just the morning sunlight on summer leaves and the sparkle of a stream twisting beneath willows and alders beside a field of grazing cattle who looked up as the coachman sounded the horn they were still close to london and the landscape was flat but well drained good hunting country sandman thought and imagined pursuing a fox beside this road he felt his dream horse gather itself and leap a hedge heard the huntsmans horn and the hounds giving tongue going far the clergyman interrupted his reverie marlborough fine town fine town the clergyman an archdeacon had abandoned his computations about the coachs speed and now rambled on about visiting his sister in hungerford sandman made polite responses but still kept looking out of the window the fields were near harvest and the heads of rye barley and wheat were heavy the land was becoming hillier now but the rattling swaying and jolting coach kept up its fine pace and spewed a tail of dust that whitened the hedgerows the horn warned folk of its approach and children waved as the eight horses thundered past a blacksmith leather apron blackened by fire stood in his doorway a woman shook her fist when her flock of geese scattered from the coachs noise a child whirled a rattle in a vain attempt to drive predatory jays from rows of pea plants then the sound of the trace chains and hooves and clattering wheels was echoing back from the seemingly endless wall of a great estate the earl of avebury sandman decided would probably live in just such a walled estate a great swathe of aristocratic country cut off by bricks gamekeepers and watchmen suppose the earl refused to see him his lordship was said to be a recluse and the further west sandman went the more he feared he would be summarily ejected from the estate but that was a risk he would have to take he forgot his fears as the coach lurched into a street of modern brick houses the horn sounded urgently and sandman realised they had come to the village of reading where the coach swung into an inn yard to find the new horses waiting less than two minutes gentlemen the two coachmen swung down from their box and because the day was getting warmer took off their triplecaped coats less than two minutes and we dont wait for laggards milords sandman and the archdeacon had a companionable piss in the corner of the inn yard then they each gulped down a cup of lukewarm tea as the new horses were harnessed and the old team white with sweat were led to the water trough a sack of mail had been pulled from the boot and another took its place before the two coachmen scrambled up to their leathercushioned perch time gentlemen time one minute and fortyfive seconds a man called from the inn door well done josh well done tim the horn sounded the fresh horses pricked back their ears and sandman slammed the coach door and was thrown into the rear seat as the vehicle lurched forward the elderly couple had left the coach their place taken by a middleaged woman who within a mile was vomiting from the offside window you must forgive me she gasped it is a motion mighty like a ship maam the archdeacon observed and took a silver flask from his pocket brandy might help oh lord above the woman wailed in horrified refusal then craned and retched through the window again the springs are soft the archdeacon pointed out and the roads very bumpy sandman added especially at eight and a half miles an hour the archdeacon was busy with watch and pencil again struggling gainfully to make legible figures despite the jolting it always takes time to settle a new team and speed which we lack smooths a road sandmans spirits rose as each mile passed he was happy he suddenly realised but quite why he was not sure perhaps he thought it was because his life had purpose again a serious purpose or perhaps it was because he had seen eleanor and nothing about her demeanour he had decided betrayed an imminent marriage to lord eagleton lord alexander pleydell had hinted as much the previous evening most of which he had spent worshipping at sally hoods shrine though sally herself had seemed distracted by her memories of sergeant berrigan not that lord alexander had noticed he like lord christopher carne was struck dumb by sally so dumb that for most of the evening the two aristocrats had merely gaped at her sometimes stammering a commonplace until at last sandman had taken lord alexander into the back parlour i want to talk to you he had said i want to continue my conversation with miss hood lord alexander had complained pettishly worried that his friend kit was being given untrammelled access to sally and so you shall sandman assured him but talk to me first what do you know about the marquess of skavadale heir to the dukedom of ripon lord alexander had said immediately from one of the old catholic families of england not a clever man and its rumoured the family has monetary troubles they were once very rich exceedingly so with estates in cumberland yorkshire cheshire hertfordshire kent and sussex but father and son are both gamblers so the rumours may well be true he was a reasonable bat at eton but cant bowl why do you ask lord robin holloway youngest son of the marquess of bleasby and a thoroughly nasty boy who takes after his father has plenty of money no brains and he killed a man in a duel last year no cricketer i fear did he fight the duel with swords or pistols swords as it happened it was fought in france are you going to make enquiries about the whole of the aristocracy lord eagleton a fop but a useful left hand batsman who sometimes plays for viscount barchesters team but is otherwise utterly undistinguished a bore indeed despite being a passable cricketer the sort of man who might appeal to eleanor alexander stared at sandman in astonishment dont be absurd rider he said lighting another pipe she wouldnt stand him for two minutes he frowned as if trying to remember something but whatever it was did not come to mind your friend lord christopher sandman had said is convinced his father committed the murder or had someone else commit it alexander said it seems likely kit sought me out when he heard you were investigating the matter and i applaud him for doing so he like me is avid that no injustice should occur next monday now do you think i might go back to my conversation with miss hood tell me what you know about the seraphim club first i have never heard of it but it sounds like an association of highminded clergymen it isnt believe me is there any significance in the word seraphim lord alexander had sighed the seraphim rider are reckoned to be the highest order of angels the credulous believe there to be nine such orders seraphim cherubim thrones dominions virtues powers principalities archangels and at the very bottom mere common angels this is not i hasten to assure you the creed of the church of england the word seraphim is thought to derive from a hebrew word meaning serpent the association is obscure yet suggestive in the singular it is a seraph a glorious creature that has a bite like fire it is also believed that the seraphim are the patrons of love why they should be such i have no idea but so it is said just as it is claimed that the cherubim are patrons of knowledge i momentarily forget what the other orders do have i satisfied your curiosity or do you wish this lecture to continue the seraphim are angels of love and poison a crude but apt summary lord alexander had said grandly then insisted they go back to the taproom where he had again been struck dumb by sallys presence he stayed till past midnight became drunk and verbose then left with lord christopher who had drunk little and had to support his friend who staggered from the wheatsheaf declaring his undying love for sally in a voice slurred by brandy sally had frowned as lord alexanders coach had left why did he call me stupid he didnt sandman had said he just said you were the stupor mundi the wonder of the world bloody hell whats the matter with him hes frightened of your beauty sandman had said and she had liked that and sandman had gone to bed wondering how he would ever wake in time to catch the mail coach yet here he was rattling through as glorious a summers day as any a man could dream of the road ran alongside a canal and sandman admired the narrow painted barges that were hauled by great horses with ribboned manes and brasshung harnesses a child bowled a hoop along the towpath ducks paddled god was in his heaven and it took a keen eye to see that all was not quite as well as it looked the thatch of many roofs was threadbare and in every village there were two or three cottages that had collapsed and were now overgrown with bindweed there were too many tramps on the roads too many beggars by the churchyards and sandman knew a good number of them had been redcoats riflemen or sailors there was hardship here hardship among plenty the hardship of rising prices and too few jobs and hidden behind the cottages and the ancient churches and the heavy elm trees were parish workhouses that were filled with refugees from the bread riots that had flared in englands bigger cities yet still it was all so heart breakingly beautiful the foxgloves made thickets of scarlet beneath the pink roses in the hedgerows sandman could not take his eyes from the view he had not been in london a full month yet already it seemed too long at noon the coach swung across a stone bridge and clattered up a brief hill into the great wide main street of marlborough with its twin churches and capacious inns a small crowd was waiting for the mail and sandman pushed through the folk and out under the taverns arch a carriers cart was plodding eastwards and sandman asked the man where he might find the earl of aveburys estate carne manor was not far the carrier said just over the river and up the hill and on the edge of savernake a halfhours walk he thought and sandman hunger gnawing at his belly walked south towards the deep trees of savernake forest he was hot he had been carrying his coat a garment that was not needed on this warm day though he had been grateful for it when he left the wheatsheaf at dawn he asked for more directions in a hamlet and was sent down a long lane that twisted between beech woods until he came to carne manors great brick wall which he followed until he reached a lodge and a pair of cast iron gates hung from stone pillars surmounted with carved griffins a gravel drive thick with weeds led from the locked gates a bell hung by the lodge but though sandman tolled it a dozen times no one answered nor could he see anyone inside the estate either side of the drive was parkland a sward of grass dotted by fine elms beeches and oaks but no cattle or deer grazed the grass that grew lank and was thick with cornflowers and poppies sandman gave the bell a last forlorn tug and when its sound had faded into the warm afternoon he stepped back and looked at the spikes on top of the gates they looked formidable so he went back up the lane until he came to a place where an elm growing too close to the wall had buckled the bricks the trees proximity to the wall made it easy to climb he paused a second on the mortared coping then dropped down into the park the grass was long enough to conceal a spring trap set against poachers and so he moved carefully until he reached the gravel drive and then turned towards the house that was hidden beyond some woods growing along the crest of a low hill he walked slowly half expecting a gamekeeper or some other servant to intercept him but he saw no one as he followed the drive though a fine stand of beeches in the centre of which was an overgrown glade surrounding a mossy statue of a naked woman hoisting a biblical water jar onto her shoulder sandman walked on and from the far side of the beeches he could at last see carne manor a halfmile away it was a fine stone building with a façade of three high gables on which ivy grew about mullioned windows stables coach houses and a brickwalled kitchen garden lay to the west while behind the house were terraced lawns dropping to a placid stream he walked on down the long drive it suddenly seemed a futile expedition futile and expensive for the earls reputation as a recluse suggested that sandman would most likely be greeted with a horsewhip the sound of his steps seemed extraordinarily loud as he crossed the great sweep of gravel where carriages could turn in front of the house though the weeds grass and moss growing so thick among the stones suggested that few coaches ever did sandman climbed the entrance steps two glazed lanterns were mounted either side of the porch though one had a glass pane missing and a birds nest was smothering its candle holder he hauled on the bell chain and when he heard no sound pulled again and waited the wooden door had gone grey with age and was stained with rust that had leaked from its decorative metal studs bees drifted into the shallow porch a young cuckoo looking uncannily like a hawk flew across the drive the afternoon was warm and sandman wished he could abandon this search for a reclusive earl and just go down by the stream and sleep in the shade of some great tree then a harsh banging to his right made sandman step back to see that a man was trying to open a leaded window in the room closest to the porch the window was evidently jammed for the man struck it so hard that sandman was certain the leaded lights would smash but then it jarred open and the man leant out he was in late middle age had a very pale face and unkempt hair which suggested he had just woken from a deep sleep the house he said testily is not open to visitors i hadnt supposed it was sandman said though it had occurred to him to ask the housekeeper if such a person had answered the door for a view of the public rooms most great houses allowed such visits but plainly the earl of avebury did not extend the courtesy are you his lordship he asked do i look like him the man answered in an irritated tone i have business with his lordship sandman explained business business the man spoke as though he had never heard of such a thing and then a look of alarm crossed his pale features are you a lawyer it is delicate business sandman said emphatically suggesting it was none of the servants and my name he added is captain sandman it was a mere courtesy to provide his name and a reproof because he had not been asked for it the man gazed at him for a heartbeat then retreated inside sandman waited the bees buzzed by the ivy and house martins swerved above the weedstrewn gravel but the servant did not return and sandman piqued hauled on the bellpull again a window on the other side of the porch was forced open and the same servant appeared there a captain of what he demanded peremptorily the nd foot sandman answered and the servant vanished for a second time his lordship wishes to know the servant reappeared at the first window whether you were with the nd at waterloo i was sandman said the servant went back inside there was another pause and then sandman heard bolts being shot on the far side of the door which eventually creaked open and the servant offered a sketchy bow we dont get visitors he said your coat and hat sir sandman you said captain sandman of the nd foot indeed sir this way sir the front door opened onto a hall panelled in a dark wood where a fine whitepainted stairway twisted upwards beneath portraits of heavily jowled men in ruffs the servant led sandman down a passageway into a long gallery lined by tall velvetcurtained windows on one side and great paintings on the other sandman had expected the house to be as dirty as the grounds were unkempt but it was all swept and the rooms smelt of wax polish the paintings so far as he could see in the curtained gloom were exceptionally fine italian he thought and showing gods and goddesses disporting in vineyards and on dizzying mountainsides satyrs pursued naked nymphs and it took sandman a moment or two to realise that all the paintings showed nudes a gallery of feminine abundant and generous flesh he had a sudden memory of some of his soldiers gaping at just such a painting that had been captured from the french at the battle of vitoria the canvas cut from its frame had been purloined by a spanish muleteer to use as a waterproof tarpaulin and the redcoats had bought it from him for tuppence hoping to use it as a groundsheet sandman had purchased it from its new owners for a pound and sent it to headquarters where it was identified as one of the many masterpieces looted from the escorial the king of spains palace this way sir the servant interrupted his reverie the man opened a door and announced sandman who was suddenly dazzled for the room into which he had been ushered was vast and its windows that faced south and west were uncurtained and the sun was streaming in to illuminate a huge table for a few seconds sandman could not understand the table for it was green and lumpy and smothered in scraps that he thought at first were flowers or petals then his eyes adjusted to the sunlight and he saw that the coloured scraps were model soldiers they were thousands of toy soldiers on a table covered in green baize that had been draped across some kind of blocks so that it resembled the valley in which the battle of waterloo had been fought he gaped at it astonished by the size of the model which was at least thirty feet long and twenty deep two girls sat at a side table with brushes and paint which they applied to lead soldiers then a squeaking noise made him look into the dazzle by a south window where he saw the earl his lordship was in a wheeled chair like those sandmans mother had liked to use in bath when she was feeling particularly poorly and the squeak had been the sound of the ungreased axles turning as a servant pushed the earl towards his visitor the earl was dressed in the old fashion that had prevailed before men had adopted sober black or dark blue his coat was of flowered silk red and blue with enormously wide cuffs and a lavish collar over which fell a cascade of lace he wore a fullbottomed wig that framed an ancient lined face that was incongruously powdered rouged and decorated with a velvet beauty spot on one sunken cheek he had not been properly shaved and patches of white stubble showed in the folds of his skin you are wondering he addressed sandman in a shrill voice how the models are inserted onto the centre of the table are you not the question had not even occurred to sandman but now he did find it puzzling for the table was far too big for its centre to be reached from the sides and if a person were to walk across the model then they would inevitably crush the little trees that were made from sponge or else they would disarrange the serried ranks of painted soldiers how is it done my lord sandman asked he did not mind calling the earl my lord for he was an old man and it was a mere courtesy that youth owed to age betty dearest show him the earl commanded and one of the two girls dropped her paintbrush and disappeared beneath the table there was a scuffling sound then a whole section of the valley rose into the air to become a wide hat for the grinning betty it is a model of waterloo the earl said proudly so i see my lord maddox tells me you were in the nd show me where they were positioned sandman walked about the tables edge and pointed to one of the redcoated battalions on the ridge above the chateau of hougoumont we were there my lord he said the model really was extraordinary it showed the two armies at the beginning of the fight before the ranks had been bloodied and thinned and before hougoumont had burnt to a black shell sandman could even make out his own company on the nds flank and assumed that the little mounted figure just ahead of the painted ranks was meant to be himself that was an odd thought why are you smiling the earl demanded no reason my lord sandman looked at the model again except that i wasnt on horseback that day which company grenadier the earl nodded i shall replace you with a foot soldier he said his chair squealed as he pursued sandman about the table his lordship had bluegartered silk stockings though one of his feet was heavily bandaged so tell me the earl demanded did bonaparte lose the battle by delaying the start no sandman said curtly the earl signalled the servant to stop pushing the chair he was close to sandman now and could stare up at him with redrimmed eyes that were dark and bitter the earl was much older than sandman had expected sandman knew the countess had still been young when she died and she had been beautiful enough to be painted naked yet her husband looked ancient despite the wig the cosmetics and the lace frills he stank too a reek of stale powder unwashed clothes and sweat who the devil are you the earl growled i have come from viscount sidmouth my lord and sidmouth the earl interrupted i dont know a viscount sidmouth who the devil is the viscount sidmouth the home secretary my lord that information prompted no reaction at all so sandman explained further he was henry addington my lord and was once the prime minister now he is home secretary not a real lord then eh the earl declared not an aristocrat have you noticed how the damned politicians make themselves into peers like turning a toilet into a fountain ha viscount sidmouth hes no gentleman a bloody politician is all he is a trumped up liar a cheat i assume he is first viscount i am sure he is my lord sandman said ha a backalley aristo eh a piece of goddamn slime a welldressed thief im the sixteenth earl your family amazes us all my lord sandman said with an irony that was utterly wasted on the earl but however new his ennoblement i still come with the viscounts authority he produced the home secretarys letter which was waved away i have heard my lord sandman went on that the servants from your town house in mount row are now here he had heard nothing of the sort but perhaps the bald statement would elicit agreement from the earl if thats so my lord then i would like to talk with one of them the earl shifted in the chair are you suggesting he asked in a dangerous voice that blucher might have come sooner had bonaparte attacked earlier no my lord then if hed attacked earlier hed have won the earl insisted sandman looked at the model it was impressive comprehensive and all wrong it was too clean for a start even in the morning before the french attacked everyone was filthy because on the previous day most of the army had slogged back from quatre bras through quagmires of mud and then they had spent the night in the open under successive cloudbursts sandman remembered the thunder and the lightning whiplashing the far ridge and the terror when some cavalry horses broke free in the night and galloped among the sodden troops so why did bonaparte lose the earl demanded querulously because he allowed his cavalry to fight unsupported by foot or artillery sandman said shortly and might i ask your lordship what happened to the servants from the house in mount street so why did he commit his cavalry when he did eh tell me that it was a mistake my lord even the best generals make them did the servants come back here the earl petulantly slapped the wicker arms of his chair bonaparte didnt make futile mistakes the man might be scum but hes clever scum so why sandman sighed our line had been thinned we were on the reverse slope of the hill and it must have seemed from their side of the valley that we were beaten beaten the earl leapt on that word i doubt we were even visible sandman said the duke had ordered the men to lie down so from the french viewpoint it must have looked as if we just vanished the french saw an empty ridge they doubtless saw our wounded retreating into the forest behind and they must have thought we were all retreating so they charged my lord tell me what happened to your wifes servants wife i dont have a wife maddox my lord the servant who had let sandman into the house stepped forward the cold chicken i think and some champagne the earl demanded then scowled at sandman were you wounded no my lord so you were there when the imperial guard attacked i was there my lord from the guns that signalled the first french assault to the very last shot of the day the earl seemed to shudder i hate the french he said suddenly i detest them a race of dancingmasters and we brought glory on ourselves at waterloo captain glory sandman wondered what glory came from defeating dancingmasters but said nothing he had met other men like the earl men who were obsessed by waterloo and who wanted to know every remembered minute of the battle men who could not hear enough tales from that awful day and all of those men sandman knew had one thing in common none had been there yet they revered that day thinking it the supreme moment of their lives and of britains history indeed for some it seemed as though history itself had come to its end on june th and that the world would never again see a rivalry to match that of britain and france that rivalry had given meaning to a whole generation it had burnt the globe matching fleets and armies in asia america and europe and now it was all gone and there was only dullness in its place and for the earl of avebury as for so many others that dullness could only be driven away by reliving the rivalry so tell me the earl said how many times the french cavalry charged did you bring the servants from mount street to this house sandman asked servants mount street youre drivelling were you at the battle all day my lord and all i wish to know from you my lord is whether a maid called meg came here from london how the devil would i know what happened to that bitchs servants eh and why would you ask a man is in prison my lord awaiting execution for the murder of your wife and there is good reason to believe him innocent that is why i am here the earl gazed up at sandman then began to laugh the laugh came from deep in his narrow chest and it racked him dredged up phlegm that half choked him brought tears to his eyes and left him gasping he fumbled a handkerchief from his lacefrilled sleeve and wiped his eyes then spat into it she wronged a man at the very end did she he asked in a hoarse voice oh she was good my celia she was so very good at being bad he hawked another gobbet of spittle into the handkerchief then glowered at sandman so how many battalions of napoleons guard climbed the hill not enough my lord what happened to your wifes servants the earl ignored sandman because the cold chicken and champagne had been placed on the edge of the model table he summoned betty to cut up the chicken and as she did so he put an arm round her waist she seemed to shudder slightly as he first touched her but then tolerated the caresses the earl a length of spittle hanging from his wattled jaw turned his red rheumy eyes on sandman i have always liked women young he said young and tender you this was to the other girl pour the champagne child the girl stood on his other side and the earl put a hand under her skirt while she poured the champagne he still stared defiantly at sandman young flesh he growled young and soft his servants gazed at the panelled walls and sandman turned away to look out of the window at two men scything the lawn while a third raked up the clippings two herons flew above the distant stream the earl released his grip on the two girls then gobbled his chicken and slurped his champagne i was told he dismissed the two girls back to their painting by slapping their rumps that the french cavalry charged at least twenty times was that so i didnt count sandman said still looking out of the window perhaps you were not there after all the earl suggested sandman did not rise to the bait he was still looking through the window but instead of seeing the long scythes hiss through the grass he was staring down a smoky slope in belgium he was seeing his recurring dream watching the french cavalry surge up the slope their horses labouring in the damp earth the air on the britishheld ridge had seemed heated as though the door of hells great oven had been left ajar and in that heat and smoke the french horsemen had never stopped coming sandman had not counted their charges for there were too many a succession of cavalrymen thumping about the british squares their horses bleeding and limping the smoke of the muskets and cannon drifting over the british standards the ground underfoot a matted tangle of trampled rye stalks thick as a woven rush mat but damp and rotten from the rain the frenchmen had been grimacing their eyes red from the smoke and their mouths open as they shouted for their doomed emperor all i remember clearly my lord sandman said turning from the window was feeling grateful to the french grateful why because so long as their horsemen milled so thick about our squares then their artillery could not fire on us but how many charges did they make someone must know the earl was petulant ten sandman suggested twenty they just kept coming and they were hard to count because of the smoke and i remember being very thirsty and we didnt just stand and watch them coming we were looking backwards too backwards why because once a charge had gone through the squares my lord they had to come back again so they were attacking from both sides from every side sandman said remembering the swirl of horsemen the mud and straw kicking up from the hooves and the screams of the dying horses how many cavalry the earl wanted to know i didnt count my lord how many servants did your wife have in mount street the earl grinned then turned from sandman bring me a horseman betty he ordered and the girl dutifully brought him a model french dragoon in his greencoat very pretty my dear the earl said then put the dragoon on the table and hauled betty onto his lap i am an old man captain he said and if you want something of me then you must oblige me betty knows that dont you child the girl nodded she flinched as the earl dug a skeletal hand into her dress to cradle one of her breasts she was perhaps fifteen or sixteen a country girl curly haired freckled and with a round healthy face how must i oblige you my lord sandman asked not as betty does no no the earl leered at sandman you will tell me all i want to know captain and perhaps when you are done i shall tell you a little of what you want to know rank has its privileges outside in the hall a clock struck six and the sound seemed melancholy in the great empty house sandman felt the despair of wasted time he needed to discover if meg was here and he needed to return to london and he sensed that the earl would play with him all evening and at the end send him away with his questions unanswered the earl sensing and enjoying sandmans disapproval pulled the girls breasts out of her dress let us begin at the beginning captain he said lowering his face to nuzzle the warm flesh let us begin at dawn eh it had been raining yes sandman walked round the table until he was behind the earl where he stooped so his face was close to the stiff hairs of the wig why not talk about the battles end my lord sandman asked in a low voice why not talk about the attack of the imperial guard because i was there when we wheeled out of line and took the bastards in the flank he crouched even lower he could smell his lordships reek and see a louse crawling along the wigs edge he lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper theyd won the battle my lord it was all over except the pursuit but we changed history in an eyeblink we marched out of line and we gave them volley fire my lord and then we fixed bayonets and i can tell you exactly how it happened i can tell you how we won my lord sandmans temper was rising now and there was a bitterness in his voice we won but youll never hear that story my lord never because ill make damn sure that not one officer of the nd will ever talk to you you understand that not one officer will ever talk to you good day my lord perhaps your servant will be kind enough to show me out he walked towards the door he would ask the servant if meg had come here and if not which he suspected would prove the case then this whole journey would have been a waste of time and money captain the earl had tipped the girl off his lap wait his rouged face twitched there was malevolence in it an old bitter hardhearted malevolence but he so badly wanted to know exactly how bonapartes vaunted guard had been beaten off so he snarled at the two girls and the servants to leave the room ill be alone with the captain he said it still took time to draw the tale from him time and a bottle of smuggled french brandy but eventually the earl spewed the bitter tale of his marriage confirming what lord christopher had already told sandman celia second wife to the sixteenth earl of avebury had been on stage when the earl first saw her legs the earl said dreamily such legs captain such legs that was the first thing about her i saw at the sans pareil sandman asked the earl shot sandman a very shrewd glance whove you been talking to he demanded who people talk in town sandman said my son the earl guessed then laughed that little fool that pasty little weakling good god captain i should have culled that one when he was an infant his mother was a holy damned fool and swiving her was like rogering a prayerful mouse and the bloody fool thinks hes taken after her but he hasnt theres me in him he might be forever on his knees captain but hes always thinking of tits and bum legs and tits again he might fool himself but he dont fool me says he wants to be a priest but he wont what he wants captain is for me to be dead and then the estate is his all of it its entailed onto him did he tell you that and hell spend it all on tits legs and bums just as i would have done only the difference between that stammering little fool and me is that i was never ashamed i enjoyed it captain i still do and he suffers from guilt guilt the earl spat the word whirling a length of spittle across the room so what did the pallid little halfwit tell you that i killed celia perhaps i did captain or perhaps maddox went up to town and did it for me but how will you prove it eh the earl waited for an answer but sandman did not speak did you know captain the earl asked that they hang an aristocrat with a silken rope i did not my lord so they say the earl declared so they do say the common folk get turned off with a yard or two of common hemp but we lords get a rope of silk and id gladly wear a silk rope in exchange for that bitchs death lord but she robbed me blind never knew a woman to spend money like it then when i came to my senses i tried to cut off her allowance i denied her debts and told the estates trustees to turn her out of the house but the bastards left her there maybe she was swiving one of them thats how she made her money captain by diligent swiving youre saying she was a whore my lord not a common whore the earl said she was no mere buttock ill say that for her she called herself a cantatrice an actress a dancer but in truth she was a clever bitch and i was a fool to exchange a marriage for a season of her swiving however good she was he grinned at himself then turned his rheumy eyes on sandman celia used blackmail captain shed take a young man about town as a lover commit the poor fool to write a letter or two begging her favours and then when he engaged to marry an heiress she threatened to reveal the letters made a pretty penny she did she told me as much told me to my face told me she didnt need my cash had her own do you know what men she treated thus my lord the earl shook his head he stared at the model battle unwilling to meet sandmans eyes i didnt want to know names he said softly and for the first time sandman felt some pity for the old man and the servants my lord the servants from your london house what happened to them how the devil would i know they aint here he scowled at sandman and why would i want that bitchs servants here i told faulkner to get rid of them just to get rid of them faulkner a lawyer one of the trustees and like all lawyers hes a bellycrawling piece of shit the earl looked up at sandman i dont know what happened to celias damned servants he said and i dont care now go to the door and find maddox and tell him you and i will sup on beef and then damn you tell me what happened when the emperors guard attacked so sandman did he had come to wiltshire he had not found meg but he had learnt something though whether it was enough he did not know and in the morning he went back to london chapter five sandman got back to london late on thursday afternoon he had taken the mail coach from marlborough justifying the expense by the time he was saving but just outside thatcham one of the horses had thrown a shoe and then near the village of hammersmith a haywain with a broken axle was blocking a bridge and sandman reckoned it would have been far quicker to have walked the last few miles rather than wait while the road was cleared but he was tired after sleeping fitfully on a pile of straw in the yard of the kings head in marlborough and so he stayed with the coach he was also irritated for he reckoned his journey to wiltshire had been largely wasted he doubted the earl of avebury had either killed or arranged the killing of his wife but he had never thought the man guilty in the first place the only advantage sandman had gained was to learn that the dead countess had kept herself by blackmailing her lovers but that did not help him to discover who those lovers had been he used the side door of the wheatsheaf that opened into the taverns stableyard where he pumped water into the tin cup chained to the handle he drank it down pumped again then turned as the click of hooves sounded in the stable entrance where he saw jack hood heaving a saddle onto a tall and handsome black horse the highwayman nodded a curt acknowledgement of sandmans presence then stooped to buckle the girth like his horse jack hood was tall and dark he wore black boots black breeches and a narrow waisted black coat and he wore his black hair long and tied with a ribbon of black silk at the nape of his neck he straightened and gave sandman a crooked grin you look tired captain tired poor hungry and thirsty sandman said and pumped a third cup of water thats what the square life does for you hood said cheerfully he slid two longbarrelled pistols into their saddle holsters you should be on the cross like me sandman drank down the water and let the cup drop and what will you do mister hood he asked when they catch you hood led the horse into the waning evening sunlight the beast was fine bred and nervous highstepping and skittish a horse sandman suspected that could fly like the night wind when escape was needed when im caught hood asked ill come to you for help captain sally says youre a crap prig a gallows thief sandman had learnt enough flash to be able to translate the phrase but i havent stolen one man from the scaffold yet and i doubt you ever will hood said grimly because that aint the way the world works they dont care how many they hang captain so long as the rest of us take note that they do hang they care sandman insisted why else did they appoint me hood offered sandman a sceptical look then put his right foot into the stirrup and hauled himself into the saddle and are you telling me captain he asked as he fiddled his left foot into its stirrup that they appointed you out of the goodness of their hearts did the home secretary discover a sudden doubt about the quality of justice in black jacks court no sandman allowed they appointed you captain because someone with influence wanted cordays case examined someone with influence am i right sandman nodded exactly right a cove can be as innocent as a freshborn babe hood said sourly but if he dont have a friend with influence then hell hang high aint that so jack hood flicked his coat tails out over his horses rump then gathered the reins and as like as not ill finish my days on jem bottings dancing floor and i dont lose sleep nor tears over it the gallows is there captain and we live with it till we die on it and we wont change it because the bastards dont want it changed its their world not ours and they fight to keep it the way they want they kill us they send us to australia or else they break us on the treadmill and you know why because they fear us they fear well become like the french mob they fear a guillotine in whitehall and to keep it from happening they build a scaffold in newgate they might let you save one man captain but dont think youll change anything he pulled on thin black leather gloves there are some coves to see you in the back slum captain he said meaning that there were some men waiting for sandman in the back parlour but before you talk with them hood went on you should know i took my dinner at the dog and duck in st georges fields sandman asked puzzled by the apparently irrelevant statement a lot of the high toby live and dine there hood said on account that its convenient for the western roads he meant that a number of highwaymen patronised the tavern and i heard a whisper there captain your life fifty quid he raised an eyebrow youve upset someone captain ive spread word in the sheaf that no ones to touch you because youve been kind to my sal and i look after those that look after her but i cant control every flash bowzing house in london sandman felt a lurch of his heart fifty guineas for his life was that a compliment or an insult you would not know i suppose he asked who has staked the money i asked but no one knew but its firm cash captain so watch yourself im obliged to you these last four words were because sandman had hauled open the yard gate sandman looked up at the horseman youre not going to see sally on stage tonight hood shook his head seen her often enough he said curtly and ive business of my own that she wont be watching he touched his spurs to his horses flanks and without a word of farewell rode northwards behind a wagon loaded with newly baked bricks sandman closed the gate viscount sidmouth when he had given sandman this job had hinted it would be easy a months pay for a days work but it was suddenly a life for a months pay sandman turned and gazed at the dirty windows of the back parlour but he could not see beyond the gloss of the evening light on the small panes whoever waited there could see him but he could not see them and so he did not go directly to the parlour but instead cut through the barrel room to the passage where there was a serving hatch he nudged the hatch open careful not to make a noise then stooped to peer through the crack he heard the footsteps behind him but before he could turn a pistol barrel was cold by his ear a good soldier always makes a reconnaissance eh captain sergeant berrigan said i thought youd come here first sandman straightened and turned to see that the sergeant was grinning pleased because he had outmanoeuvred sandman so what are you going to do sergeant he asked shoot me just making sure you aint got any sticks on you captain berrigan said then used his pistol barrel to push open the flaps of sandmans jacket and satisfied that the captain was not armed he jerked his head towards the parlour door after you captain sergeant sandman began planning to appeal to berrigans better nature but that nature was nowhere to be seen for the sergeant just cocked the pistol and aimed it at sandmans chest sandman thought about knocking the barrel aside and bringing his knee up into berrigans groin but the sergeant gave him a halfsmile and an almost imperceptible shake of his head as though inviting sandman to try through the door eh sandman asked and when berrigan nodded he turned the knob and went into the back parlour the marquess of skavadale and lord robin holloway were on the settle at the far side of the long table both were exquisitely dressed in superbly cut black coats blossoming cravats and skintight breeches holloway scowled to see sandman but skavadale courteously stood and offered a smile my dear captain sandman how very kind of you to join us been waiting long sandman asked truculently a halfhour skavadale replied pleasantly we did expect to find you here already but the wait has not been unduly tedious please sit sandman sat reluctantly first glancing at berrigan who came into the parlour closed the door and lowered the pistols flint though he did not put the weapon away instead the sergeant stood beside the door and watched sandman the marquess of skavadale took the cork from some wine and poured out a glassful a rather raw claret captain but probably welcome after your journey but how could we have expected the finest wine here eh this is the wheatsheaf flash but not flush eh thats rather good dont you think robin flash but not flush lord robin holloway neither smiled nor spoke but just stared at sandman there were still two raw scars across his cheeks and nose where sandman had whipped him with the fencing foil skavadale pushed the glass of wine across the table then looked pained when sandman shook his head in refusal oh come captain skavadale said with a frown were here to be friendly and im here because i was threatened with a pistol put it away sergeant skavadale ordered then he toasted sandman ive learnt a little about you in the last couple of days captain i already knew you were a formidable cricketer of course but you have another reputation besides for what sandman asked bleakly you were a good soldier skavadale said so but unfortunate in your father skavadale said gently now as i understand things captain you are supporting your mother and sister am i right he waited for a reply but sandman neither spoke nor moved its sad skavadale went on when folk of refinement are condemned to poverty if it were not for you captain your mother would long have been reduced to accepting charity and your sister would be what a governess a paid companion yet with a small dowry she could still marry perfectly well could she not sandman still kept silent yet lord skavadale had spoken nothing but the truth belle sandmans sister was nineteen years old and had only one hope of escaping poverty which was to marry well yet without a dowry she could not hope to find a respectable husband she would be lucky to find a tradesman willing to marry her and even if she did then sandman knew his sister would not accept such a husband for like her mother she had an exaggerated sense of her own high standing in society a year ago before her fathers death belle might have expected a dowry of several thousand pounds enough to attract an aristocrat and provide a healthy income and she still yearned for those prospects and in some obscure way she blamed sandman for their loss that was why sandman was in london because he could no longer bear the reproaches of his mother and sister who expected him to replace his father as a provider of endless luxuries now skavadale said your fathers gambling has reduced the family to penury is that not right captain yet you are trying to pay off some of his debts youve chosen a difficult path and its very honourable of you very honourable aint that honourable robin lord robin holloway said nothing he just shrugged keeping his cold eyes on sandman so what will you do captain skavadale asked do a mother and a sister to keep debts to pay and no employment other than an occasional game of cricket skavadale asked raising his eyebrows in mock surprise and as i understand it the home secretarys demands upon you are very temporary and are hardly likely to lead to a permanent fortune so what will you do what will you do sandman asked i beg your pardon as i understand it sandman said remembering lord alexanders description of the marquess of skavadale you are not unlike me your family once possessed a great fortune but it also possessed gamblers the marquess looked irritated for a second but let the insult pass i shall marry well he said lightly meaning i shall marry wealth and you maybe i shall marry well too sandman retorted really skavadale raised a sceptical eyebrow i shall succeed to a dukedom sandman and thats a great lure to a girl whats your attraction skill at cricket fascinating memories of waterloo his lordships voice was still polite but the scorn was obvious girls who possess money skavadale went on either marry more money or else they seek rank because money and rank captain are the only two things that matter in this world truth sandman suggested honour money skavadale repeated flatly and rank my family may be close to bankruptcy but we have rank by god we have rank and that will restore our fortune money and rank sandman said reflectively so how do you console a man like sergeant berrigan whose rank is lowly and whose fortune i surmise is paltry skavadale gave the sergeant a lazy glance i advise him captain to attach himself to a man of rank and fortune that is the way of the world he serves i reward and together we prosper and where do i fit into this divinely ordained scheme sandman enquired skavadale gave a ghost of a smile you are a gentleman captain so you possess rank but you have been denied your share of wealth if you will allow us he gestured to include the sallow lord robin holloway and by us i mean the whole membership of the seraphim club we should like to remedy that lack he took a piece of paper from his pocket placed it on the table and slid it towards sandman remedy sandman asked bleakly but skavadale said nothing just pointed at the paper that sandman picked up opened and saw first lord robin holloways extravagantly scrawled signature and then he saw the figure he stared at it then looked up at lord skavadale who smiled sandman looked at the paper again it was a money draft payable to rider sandman drawn on the account of lord robin holloway at courts bank to the value of twenty thousand guineas twenty thousand his hands shook slightly and he forced himself to take a deep breath it solved everything everything twenty thousand guineas could pay off his fathers small debts buy his mother and sister a fine house and there would still be enough left over to yield an income of six or seven hundred pounds a year which was small compared to the money sandmans mother had once been used to but six hundred pounds a year could keep a woman and her daughter in country gentility it was respectable they might not be able to afford a carriage and horses but they could keep a maid and a cook they could put a gold coin in the collection plate each sunday and they could receive their neighbours in sufficient style they could stop complaining to rider sandman of their poverty there was a great clatter of hooves and chains as a dray arrived in the yard but sandman was oblivious of the noise he was being tempted by the thought that he was not responsible for his fathers debts and if he ignored the tradesmen who had been taken close to ruin by ludovic sandmans suicide then he could get his mother an income of perhaps eight hundred a year best of all though and most tempting of all was the knowledge that twenty thousand guineas would be a fortune sufficient to overcome lady forrests objections to his marrying eleanor he stared at the money draft it made all things possible eleanor he thought eleanor and he thought of the money eleanor would bring him and he knew he would be wealthy again and he would have horses in his stables and he could play cricket all summer and hunt all winter he would be a proper gentleman again he would no longer need to scratch for pennies or spend time worrying about the laundry he looked up into lord robin holloways eyes the young man was a fool who had wanted to challenge sandman to a duel now he was giving him a fortune lord robin ignored sandmans gaze staring off at a cobweb high on the parlours panelling lord skavadale smiled at sandman it was the smile of a man enjoying anothers good fortune yet it filled sandman with shame shame because he had been tempted truly tempted you think we are trying to bribe you lord skavadale had seen sandmans change of expression and asked the question anxiously i did not expect such kindness from lord robin sandman said drily every member of the seraphim contributed the marquess said and my friend robin collated the funds it is of course a gift not a bribe a gift sandman repeated the words bitterly not a bribe of course its not a bribe skavadale said sternly indeed not he stood and went to the window where he watched the beerbarrels being rolled down planks from the drays bed then he turned and smiled i am offended captain sandman when i see a gentleman reduced to penury such a thing goes against the natural order wouldnt you say and when that gentleman is an officer who has fought gallantly for his country then the offense is all the greater i told you that the seraphim club is composed of men who attempt to excel who celebrate the higher achievements what else are angels but beings that do good so we should like to see you and your family restored to your proper place in society that is all he shrugged as though the gesture was really very small sandman wanted to believe him lord skavadale had sounded so reasonable and calm as though this transaction was something very ordinary yet sandman knew better youre offering me charity he said lord skavadale shook his head merely a correction of blind fate captain and if i allow my fate to be corrected sandman asked what would you want in return lord skavadale looked offended as though it had not even occurred to him that sandman might perform some small service in return for being given a small fortune i should only expect captain he spoke stiffly that you would behave like a gentleman sandman glanced at lord robin holloway who had not spoken i trust sandman said frostily that i always behave thus then you will know captain skavadale said pointedly that gentlemen do not perform paid employment sandman said nothing lord skavadale bridled slightly at sandmans silence so naturally captain in return for accepting that draft you will resign any paid offices that you might enjoy sandman looked down at the small fortune so i write to the home secretary and resign as his investigator it would surely be the gentlemanly thing to do skavadale observed how gentlemanly is it sandman asked to let an innocent man hang is he innocent lord skavadale enquired you told the sergeant you would bring proof from the countryside and did you he waited but it was plain from sandmans face that there was no proof lord skavadale shrugged as if to suggest that sandman might just as well abandon a hopeless hunt and accept the money and sandman was tempted he was so very tempted but he was also ashamed of that temptation and so he nerved himself and then tore the draft into shreds he saw lord skavadale blink with surprise when he made the first rip and then his lordship looked furious and sandman felt a pulse of fear it was not fear of lord skavadales anger but for his own future and for the enormity of the fortune he was rejecting he scattered the scraps on the table the marquess of skavadale and lord robin holloway stood neither spoke they looked at sergeant berrigan and it seemed that some kind of unspoken message was delivered before without even glancing at sandman they went their footsteps receded down the passage as cold metal touched the back of sandmans neck and he knew it was the pistol sandman tensed planning to throw himself backwards in hope of unbalancing berrigan but the sergeant ground the cold barrel hard into sandmans neck you had your chance captain you still have one sergeant sandman said but i aint a fool berrigan went on and i aint killing you here not here and now too many folk in the inn i kill you here captain and im dancing in newgate the pistols pressure vanished then the sergeant leant close to sandmans ear watch yourself captain watch yourself it was the exact same advice that jack hood had given sandman heard the door open and shut and the sergeants footsteps fade twenty thousand guineas he thought gone ooooooo the reverend lord alexander pleydell had secured one of the covent garden theatres stage boxes for the performance i cannot say i am expecting great artistry he declared as he followed sandman through the crowds except from miss hood i am sure she will be more than dazzling his lordship like sandman was clutching his pockets for theatre crowds were famous hunting grounds for clyfakers knucklers divers dummy hunters and buzzcoves all of them to lord alexanders delight different names for pickpockets do you realise he said in his shrill voice that there is a whole hierarchy of clyfakers i was listening to the conversation alexander sandman said lord alexander before they left the wheatsheaf had insisted on another tutorial in the flash language this one from the landlord jenks who rather liked having a reverend lord as a customer the reverend lord had taken notes delighted to discover that the lowest rank of clyfaker was the clouter a child who snitched handkerchiefs while the lords of the buzzing trade were the thimblecoves who stole watches it was not just the practitioners of the trade who had names the pockets themselves were all differentiated garret lord alexander chanted hoxter kickseys pit roughfammy salt box cly and slip did i miss one i wasnt paying attention sandman edged closer to the brightly lit awning of the theatre garret hoxter kickseys pit roughfammy salt box cly and slip lord alexander announced again to the bemusement of the crowd the garret was the fob pocket of a waistcoat while the lower pockets were roughfammies the kickseys were pockets in breeches the hoxter was a coats inside pocket an unflapped chest pocket was a pit an outside coat pocket protected by a flap was a salt box cly while a tail pocket the easiest of all to pick was a slip do you think lord alexander shouted over the noise of the crowd that miss hood will join us for supper after the performance im sure shell be more than happy to bask in the admiration of one of her admirers one of lord alexander asked anxiously youre not thinking of kit carne are you sandman was not thinking of lord christopher carne but he shrugged as though the earl of aveburys heir was indeed a rival for sallys hand lord alexander looked very disapproving kit is not a serious man rider i thought he was very serious i have decided he is weak lord alexander said loftily weak the other night lord alexander said he just stared at miss hood with a vacant look on his face ridiculous behaviour i was talking to her and he was just gaping lord knows what she thought of him i cant imagine sandman said he was gaping like a fish lord alexander said then turned in alarm as a child squealed the childs pain was met by a roar of laughter what happened lord alexander asked anxiously someone lined their pockets with fishhooks sandman guessed and a clouter just got torn fingers it was a common precaution against pickpockets a lesson the child will not forget lord alexander said piously but i mustnt be hard on kit he has little experience of women and i fear he has no defences against their charms that sandman said from a man who is eager to watch sally hood dance is rich lord alexander grinned even i am not perfect kit wanted to come tonight but i told him to buy his own ticket good lord he might even have wanted to come to supper with miss hood afterwards do you think she might like to visit newgate with us visit newgate for a hanging i told you i was requesting a privileged seat from the prison authorities so i wrote to them no answer yet but im sure theyll consent and im sure i dont want to go sandman shouted over the crowds noise and just then the throng gave an inexplicable lurch and sandman was able to make a lunge for the doorway if it was a paid crowd causing the crush he thought then it was costing mister spofforth a rare fortune mister spofforth was the man who had taken the theatre for the evening on behalf of his protégé a miss sacharissa lasorda who was billed as the new vestris the old vestris was only twenty years old and a dazzling italian actress who was reputed to add three hundred pounds a night to a theatres takings merely by baring her legs and mister spofforth was now trying to launch miss lasorda on a career of similar profitability do you know spofforth sandman asked his friend they were inside the theatre now and an old woman was leading them up musty stairs to their box of course i know william spofforth lord alexanders club foot banged against the risers as he struggled manfully up the dark stairs he was at marlborough hes a rather foolish young man whose father made a fortune in sugar young spofforth our host tonight kept wicket but had no idea how to place fielders i always think the captain or bowler should do that sandman observed mildly an absurd statement lord alexander snapped cricket will cease to be cricket when the keeper abandons his duties of field setting he sees as the batsman does so who else is better placed to set a field truly rider i am second to none in my admiration of your batting but when it comes to a theoretical understanding of the game then you really are a child it was an old argument and one that happily engaged them as they took their places above the stages apron lord alexander had his bag of pipes and lit his first of the evening the smoke wreathing past a large sign that prohibited smoking the house was full over three thousand spectators and it was rowdy because a good number of the audience were already drunk suggesting that mister spofforths servants must have dredged the taverns to find his supporters a group of newspaper writers was being plied with champagne brandy and oysters in a box opposite lord alexanders plush eyrie mister spofforth an aloof beau with a collar rising past his ears was in the neighbouring box from where he kept an anxious eye on the journalists who were costing him so much and whose verdict could make or break his lover but one critic was already asleep another was fondling a woman while the remaining two were loudly haranguing the boxs attendant for more champagne a dozen musicians filed into the pit and began tuning their instruments im putting together a gentlemens eleven to play against hampshire at the end of the month lord alexander said and i rather hoped youd want to play id like that yes would the game be in hampshire sandman asked the question anxiously for he did not particularly want to go near winchester and his mothers querulous demands here in london lord alexander said at thomas lords ground sandman grimaced that wretched hillside its a perfectly good ground lord alexander said huffily a slight slope maybe and ive already wagered fifty guineas on the game which is why id like you to play i shall go higher if youre in my team sandman groaned moneys ruining the game alexander which is why those of us who oppose corruption must be energetic in our patronage of the game lord alexander insisted so will you play im very out of practice sandman warned his friend then get into practice lord alexander said testily lighting another pipe he frowned at sandman you look depressingly glum dont you enjoy the theatre very much then look as if you do lord alexander polished the lens of his opera glasses on the tails of his coat do you think miss hood would enjoy cricket i cant imagine her playing it somehow dont be so grotesquely absurd rider i mean as a spectator you must ask her alexander sandman said he leant over the edge of the box to look down into the stalls where a claque from the wheatsheaf were readying themselves to cheer sally a pair of whores were working their way around the edge of the pit and one of them seeing him peer down mimed that she would come up to the box sandman hastily shook his head and pulled back out of sight suppose shes dead he asked suddenly miss hood dead why should she be lord alexander looked very worried was she ill you should have told me im talking about the maidservant meg oh her lord alexander said absently then frowned at his pipe do you recall those spanish cigars that were all the rage when you were fighting against the forces of enlightenment in spain of course i do you cant get them anywhere and i did like them try pettigrews in old bond street sandman said sounding annoyed that his friend had ignored his concerns about meg ive tried they have none and i did like them i know someone whos thinking of importing them sandman said remembering sergeant berrigan let me know if they do lord alexander blew smoke towards the gilded cherubs on the ceiling are your friends in the seraphim club aware that you are pursuing meg no so they have no cause to find and kill her and if they had wished to kill her at the time of the countesss murder supposing that they did indeed perform that wicked deed then they would have left her body with her mistresss corpse so that corday could be convicted of both murders which suggests does it not that the girl is alive it occurs to me rider that your duties as an investigator demand a great deal of logical deduction which is why you are such a poor choice for the post still you may always consult me youre very kind alexander i try to be dear boy lord alexander pleased with himself beamed i do try to be a cheer sounded as boys went round the theatre extinguishing the lamps the musicians gave a last tentative squeak then waited for the conductors baton to fall some of the audience in the pit began to whistle as a demand for the curtains to part most of the sceneshifting was done by sailors men accustomed to ropes and heights and just as at sea some of the signals were given by whistles and the audiences whistling betrayed their impatience but the curtain stayed obstinately shut more lamps were extinguished then the big reflective lanterns at the edges of the stage were unmasked the drummer gave a portentous roll and a player in a swathing cloak leapt from between the curtains to recite the prologue on the stages wide apron in africa so far from home a little lad was wont to roam aladdin was our heros name he got no further before the audience drowned him in a cacophony of shouting hissing and whistling show us the girls pins a man yelled from the box next to sandman show us her gams i think vestriss supporters are here lord alexander shouted in sandmans ear mister spofforth was looking ever more anxious the newspaper writers were beginning to pay attention now that the crowd was in full cry but the musicians who had heard it all before began to play and that slightly calmed the audience who gave a cheer as the prologue was abandoned and the heavy scarlet curtains parted to reveal a glade in africa oak trees and yellow roses framed an idol that guarded the entrance to a cave where a dozen whiteskinned natives were sleeping sally was one of the natives who were inexplicably dressed in white stockings black velvet jackets and very short tartan skirts lord alexander bellowed a cheer as the twelve girls got to their feet and began dancing the wheatsheafs customers in the pit also cheered loudly and vestriss supporters assuming that the cheers came from spofforths paid claque began to jeer bring on the girl the man in the next box demanded a plum arced onto the stage to splatter against the idol which looked suspiciously like a red indians totem pole mister spofforth was making helpless gestures to calm an audience that was determined to make mayhem or at least the half who had been rented by vestriss supporters were while the other half paid by mister spofforth were too cowed to fight back some of the crowd had rattles that filled the high gilded hall with a crackling and echoing din its going to be very nasty lord alexander said with relish oh this is splendid the theatres management must have believed that the sight of miss sacharissa lasorda would calm the tumult for the girl was pushed prematurely onto the stage mister spofforth stood and began to applaud as she staggered out of the wings and his claque took their cue and cheered so lustily that they actually drowned the catcalls for a while miss lasorda who played the sultan of africas daughter was darkhaired and certainly pretty but whether her legs deserved to be as famous as vestriss was still a mystery for she was wearing a long skirt embroidered with crescent moons camels and scimitars she seemed momentarily alarmed to find herself on stage but then bowed to her supporters before beginning to dance show us your gams the man in the next box shouted skirt off skirt off skirt off the crowd in the stalls began to chant and a shower of plums and apples hurtled onto the stage skirt off skirt off skirt off mister spofforth was still making calming gestures with his hands but that only made him a target and he ducked as a wellaimed volley of fruit spattered his box lord alexander had tears of joy running down his cheeks i do so like the theatre he said dear sweet god i do so love it this must have cost that young fool two thousand pounds at the very least sandman did not hear what his friend had said and so leant towards him what he asked he heard something smack into the wall at the back of the box and saw in the shadows there a puff of dust it was only then that he realised a shot had been fired in the theatre and astonished he gaped up to see a patch of smoke in the dim heights of an upper gallery box a rifle he thought it had a different sound from a musket he remembered the greenjackets at waterloo remembered the distinctive sound of their weapons and then he realised someone had just shot at him and he was so shocked that he did not move for a few seconds instead he stared up at the spreading smoke and realised that the audience was going silent some had heard the shot over the raucous din of rattles whistles and shouts while others could smell the reeking powder smoke then someone screamed in the upper gallery miss lasorda stared upwards mouth open sandman snatched open the door to the box and saw two men running up the stairs with pistols in their hands he slammed the door meet me in the wheatsheaf he told lord alexander and he swung his legs over the boxs balustrade paused a second then jumped he landed heavily turning his left ankle and almost falling the audience cheered thinking sandmans leap was part of the entertainment but then some in the stalls began to scream for they could see the two men in lord alexanders box and they could see the pistols captain sally shouted and pointed to the wings sandman stumbled there was a pain in his ankle a terrible pain that made him stagger towards the idol guarding the cave mouth he turned to see the two men in the box both pointing their pistols but neither dared fire onto the stage which was crowded with dancers then one of the men threw a leg over the boxs gilded lip and sandman limped into the wings where a man dressed as a harlequin and another with a blackened face a tall crown and a magic lamp waited sandman pushed between them staggered through a tangle of ropes then down some stairs and at the bottom turned into a passage he did not think his left ankle was broken but he must have twisted it and every step was an agony he stopped in the passage his heart beating and flattened himself against the wall he heard the screams from the dancers on stage then the pounding of feet down wooden stairs and a second later a man came round the corner and sandman tripped him then stamped hard on the back of his neck the man grunted and sandman took the pistol out of his suddenly feeble hand he turned the man over who are you he asked but the man merely spat up at sandman who struck him with the pistol barrel then fished in the mans pockets to find a handful of cartridges he stood wincing from the pain in his left leg then limped down the passage to the stage door more footsteps sounded behind him and he turned pistol raised but it was sally running towards him with her street clothes bundled in a cloak you all right she asked him twisted my ankle bleeding ruckus back there sally said theres more fruit on the bloody deck than there is in the market deck he asked stage she explained shortly then pulled open the door you should go back sandman said i should do a lot of bleeding things but i dont sally said so come on she tugged him out into the street a man whistled at the sight of her long legs in the white stockings and she snarled at him to fake away off then draped the cloak about her shoulders lean on me she told sandman who was limping and grunting from pain youre in a bad bleeding way aint you sprained ankle sandman said i dont think its broken how do you know because it isnt grating with every step bloody hell sally said what happened someone shot at me a rifle who i dont know sandman said the seraphim club that seemed most likely especially after sandman had turned down their vast bribe but that did not explain jack hoods assertion that there was a price on sandmans head why would the seraphim club pay criminals to do what they or their servants were more than capable of doing i really dont know he said puzzled and frightened they had come from the rear of the theatre and now walked or in sandmans case hobbled under the piazza of the covent garden market the summer evening meant it was still light though the shadows were long across the cobbles that were littered with the remnants of vegetables and squashed fruit a rat slithered across sandmans path he constantly glanced behind but he could see no obvious enemies no sign of sergeant berrigan or anyone in a black and yellow livery no sign of lord robin holloway or the marquess of skavadale theyll be expecting me to go back to the wheatsheaf he told sally they wont know which bleeding door youre going in though will they sally said and once youre inside youre bleeding safe captain because there aint a man there who wont protect you she turned in sudden alarm as hurried footsteps sounded behind but it was only a child running from an irate man accusing the boy of being a pickpocket flower sellers were arranging their baskets on the pavement ready for the crowds to come from the two nearby theatres whistles and rattles sounded bleeding charlies on their way to the spell sally said meaning that the constables from bow street were converging on the covent garden theatre she frowned at the pistol in sandmans hand hide that stick dont want a charlie scurfing you sandman pushed the gun into a pocket are you sure you shouldnt be at the theatre they aint ever going to get that bleeding circus started again not that it ever did get started did it dead before it was born no miss sacharissas little night of fame got the jump didnt it mind you her name aint sacharissa lasorda i never thought it was flossie shes called and she used to be the pal of a fireeater at astleys must be thirty if shes a day and last i heard she was earning her bunce in an academy she was a schoolteacher sandman asked sounding surprised for few women chose that profession and miss lasorda or whatever she was called did not look like a teacher sally laughed so much she had to support herself by leaning on sandman lord i love you captain she said still laughing an academy aint for learning at least not letters its a brothel oh sandman said not far now sally said as they approached the drury lane theatre from which a burst of applause sounded hows your ankle i think i can walk sandman said try sally encouraged him then watched as sandman hobbled a few steps you dont want to take that boot off tonight she said your ankles going to swell something horrible if you do she walked on ahead and opened the wheatsheafs front door sandman half expected to see a man waiting there with a pistol but the doorway was empty we dont want to be looking over our shoulders all night sandman said so im going to see if the back parlours free he led sally across the crowded taproom where the landlord was holding court at a table is the back parlour free sandman asked him jenks nodded the gentleman said youd be back captain and he kept it for you and theres a letter for you as well brought by a slavey a footman sally translated for sandman and what gentleman reserved the back slum it must be lord alexander sandman explained because he wanted you and me to have dinner with him he took the letter from mister jenks and smiled at sally you dont mind alexanders company mind lord alexander hell just gawp at me like a billingsgate cod wont he how fickle your affection is miss hood sandman said and received a blow on the shoulder as a reward well he does sally said and gave a cruelly accurate imitation of lord alexanders goggling devotion poor old cripple she said sympathetically then glanced down at her short tartan skirt under the cloak id better change into something decent or else his eyes will pop right out sandman pretended to be heartbroken i rather like that scottish skirt and i thought you was a gentleman captain sally said then laughed and ran up the stairs as sandman shouldered open the back parlour door and with great relief sank into a chair it was dark in the room because the shutters were closed and the candles extinguished so he leant forward and pulled the nearest shutter open and saw that it was not lord alexander who had reserved the back parlour but another gentleman altogether though perhaps sergeant berrigan was not truly a gentleman the sergeant was lounging on the settle but now raised his pistol and aimed it at sandmans forehead they want you dead captain he said they want you dead so they sent me because when you want a dirty job done neatly you send a soldier aint that the truth you send a soldier so they had sent sam berrigan ooooooo sandman knew he should do something fast throw himself forward but his ankle was throbbing and he knew he could never move quicker than berrigan who was fit tough and experienced he thought of pulling out the pistol he had taken from his attacker in the theatre but by the time he dragged it from his pocket berrigan would already have fired so instead sandman decided he would just keep the sergeant talking until sally arrived and could raise the alarm he lifted his left foot and rested it on a chair i sprained it he told berrigan jumping onto the stage stage at miss hoods performance someone tried to kill me not us captain berrigan said someone with a rifle lot of those left from the wars berrigan said you can pick up a used baker for seven or eight shillings so someone other than the seraphim club wants you dead eh sandman stared at the sergeant are you sure it wasnt the seraphim club they sent me captain only me berrigan said and i wasnt at the theatre sandman stared at him wondering who in gods name had put a price on his head it must be a great relief being dishonest he said berrigan grinned relief no one trying to kill you no scruples about accepting thousands of guineas id say it was a relief my problem sergeant is that i so feared being like my father that i set out to behave in an utterly dissimilar manner i set out to be consciously virtuous it was exceedingly tedious of me and it annoyed him hugely i suppose thats why i did it if berrigan was surprised or discomfited by this strange admission he did not show it instead he seemed interested your father was dishonest sandman nodded if there was any justice in this world sergeant then he would have been hanged at newgate he wasnt a felon like the folk who live here he didnt rob stage coaches or pick pockets or burgle houses instead he tied peoples money into crooked schemes and hed still be doing it if he hadnt met an even cleverer man who did it back to him and there was me claiming to be virtuous but i still took his money all my life didnt i sergeant berrigan lowered the pistols cock then put the weapon on the table my father was honest he was not is berrigan used a tinder box to light two candles then lifted a jug of ale that he had kept hidden on the floor my father died a couple of years ago he was a blacksmith in putney and he wanted me to learn the trade but of course i wouldnt i knew better didnt i he sounded rueful i wanted life to be easier than forever shoeing horses and banging up tracechains so you joined the army to escape the smithy berrigan laughed i joined the army to escape a hanging he poured the ale and pushed a tankard towards sandman i was peter hunting do you know what that is i live here remember sandman said peter hunting was the trade of cutting luggage off the backs of coaches and if it was well done the coachmen and passengers had no idea that their trunks had been slashed off the rack to prevent it many coaches used steel chains to secure the baggage but a good peter hunter carried a jemmy to prise the chains anchoring staples from the coachs chassis i got caught berrigan said and the beak said i could stand trial or join the army and nine years later i was a sergeant a good one eh i could keep order berrigan said bleakly so could i oddly enough sandman said and it was not such a strange claim as it sounded many officers relied on their sergeants to keep order but sandman had possessed a natural and easy authority he had been a good officer and he knew it and if he was honest with himself he missed it he missed the war missed the certainties of the army missed the excitements of campaigning and missed the companionship of his company spain was the best he said we had such happy times in spain some bloody awful times too of course but i dont remember those you were in spain twelve to fourteen berrigan said those were mostly good times sandman said but i hated waterloo the sergeant nodded it was bad ive never been so damned frightened in my life sandman said he had been shaking when the imperial guard came up the hill he remembered his right arm quivering and he had been ashamed to show such fear it had not occurred to him until much later that most of the men on the ridge and most of the men coming to attack them were just as frightened and just as ashamed of their fears the air was warm he said like an oven door had been opened remember warm berrigan agreed then frowned a lot of folk want you dead captain it puzzles me sandman admitted when skavadale offered me that money i was convinced that either he or lord robin had murdered the countess but now now theres someone else out there maybe theyre the real murderer and the strange thing is i havent a clue who it might be unless this has the answer he lifted the letter that the landlord had given him can you push a candle towards me the letter was written on palegreen paper and was in a handwriting he knew only too well it was from eleanor and he remembered how his heart would leap whenever her letters arrived in spain or france now he slit her green wax seal and unfolded the thin paper he had hoped the letter would reveal megs whereabouts but instead eleanor was asking sandman to meet her next morning at gunters confectionery store in berkeley square there was a postscript i think i might have news she had written but nothing else no he said i dont have the truth yet but i think ill have it soon he lay the letter down arent you supposed to shoot me in a tavern berrigan shook his head cut your throat more like its quieter but im trying to decide whether miss hood will ever talk to me again if i do i doubt she ever will sandman said with a smile and the last time i was on your side berrigan said things looked rough but we did win against the emperors own guard too sandman agreed so i reckon im on your side again captain the sergeant said sandman smiled and raised his tankard in a mock toast but if you dont kill me sergeant can you return to the seraphim club or will they regard your disobedience as cause for dismissal i cant go back berrigan said and gestured at a heavy bag a haversack and his old army knapsack that lay together on the floor sandman showed neither pleasure nor surprise he was pleased but he was not surprised because from the very first he had sensed that berrigan was looking for an escape from the seraphim do you expect wages he asked the sergeant well split the reward captain theres a reward forty pounds berrigan said is what the magistrates pay to anyone who brings in a proper felon forty he saw that the reward money was news to sandman and shook his head in disbelief how the hell else do you think the watchmen make a living sandman felt very foolish i didnt know berrigan filled up both ale tankards twenty for you captain and twenty for me he grinned so what are we doing tomorrow tomorrow sandman said we begin by going to newgate then i am meeting a lady and you will well i dont know what youll do but we shall see wont we he twisted in the chair as the door opened behind him bleeding hell sally frowned when she saw the pistol on the table then glared at berrigan what the hell are you doing here come to have supper with you of course berrigan said sally blushed and sandman looked out the window so as not to embarrass her and reflected that his allies now consisted of a clubfooted reverend aristocrat of radical views a sharptongued actress a felonious sergeant and he dared to hope eleanor and together they had just three days to catch a killer chapter six it was raining next morning when sandman and berrigan walked to newgate prison sandman was still limping badly grimacing every time he put weight on his left foot he had wrapped a bandage tight about the boot but the ankle still felt like jellied fire you shouldnt be walking berrigan told him i shouldnt have walked when i sprained the other ankle at burgos sandman said but it was either that or get captured by the frogs so i walked back to portugal you an officer berrigan was amused no geegee i loaned my geegee sandman said to someone who was really injured berrigan walked in silence for a few paces we had a lot of good officers really he said after a while and there i was sandman said thinking i was unique because the bad officers didnt last too long berrigan went on especially when there was a fight wonderful what a bullet in the back will do the sergeant had slept in the wheatsheafs back parlour after it became clear he was not to be invited to share sallys bed though sandman watching the two during the evening had thought it a damn closerun thing lord alexander oblivious that he was losing sally to a lowborn rival had stared at her in dumb admiration until he nerved himself to tell her a joke but as the jest depended for its humour on an understanding of the latin gerund it failed miserably when lord alexander finally fell asleep the sergeant carried him out to his carriage which took him home he can drink that cove berrigan had said in admiration he cant drink sandman had said and thats his problem lord alexander he thought was bored and boredom drove him to drink while sandman was anything but bored he had lain awake half the night trying to work out who beyond the seraphim club might want him dead and it had only been when the bell of st pauls church rang two oclock that the answer had come to him with a clarity and force that made him ashamed for not having thought of so obvious a solution before he shared it with berrigan as they walked down holborn beneath clouds so low they seemed to touch the belching chimneys i know whos paying to have me killed it aint the seraphim club berrigan insisted theyd have told me just to make sure i didnt get in the way of some other cove it isnt the club sandman agreed because they decided to buy me off but the only member with sufficient funds immediately available was lord robin holloway and he detests me he does berrigan agreed but they all contributed no they didnt sandman said most of the members are in the country and there wont have been time to solicit them skavadale doesnt have the funds maybe one or two members in london donated but ill wager the largest part of the twenty thousand came from lord robin holloway and he only did it because skavadale begged him or ordered him or persuaded him and i think he probably agreed to pay me but privately arranged to have me killed before i could accept or god forbid cash his note berrigan thought about it then reluctantly nodded hes capable of that nasty piece of work he is but maybe hell call off his dogs sandman said now that he knows im not taking his money except if he killed the countess berrigan suggested he might still want you nubbed what the hells happening here his question was caused because the only thing moving on newgate hill was a trickle of dirty water in the gutter the carts and carriages in the roadway were motionless all held up by a wagon that had shed its load of pear saplings at the corner of old bailey and newgate street men shouted whips cracked horses buried their faces in nosebags and nothing moved berrigan shook his head whod want half a ton of bloody pear trees someone who likes pears someone who needs their bloody brains reamed out the sergeant grumbled then stopped to gaze at the granite facade of newgate prison it squatted grim and gaunt sparsely supplied with windows solid and forbidding the rain was falling harder but the sergeant still stared in apparent fascination is this where they hang them right outside the debtors door whichever one that is ive never been to a hanging here berrigan admitted nor have i been to one at horsemonger lane prison but they hang them up on the roof of the gateway there and you dont see a lot from the street bit of jerking thats all my mum used to like going to tyburn your mother did it was a day out for her berrigan had heard the surprise in sandmans voice and sounded defensive she likes a day out my mum does but she says the old baileys too farone day ill hire a coach and bring her up he grinned as he climbed the prison steps i always reckoned id end up in here a turnkey accompanied them through the tunnel to the press yard and pointed out the large cell where those to be hanged spent their last night if you want to see a hanging he confided to sandman then you come on monday cos well be ridding england of two of the bastards but there wont be a crowd not a big one anyway on account that neither of em is what youd call notorious you want a big crowd hang someone notorious sir someone notorious or else string up a woman the magpie and stump got through a fortnights supply of ale last monday and that was only cos we scragged a woman folks do like to see a woman strangling did you hear how that one ended ended sandman asked puzzled by the question i assume she died died and went to the anatomists sir what do like a young un to slice apart but she was hanged for the theft of a pearl necklace and i do hear how the owner found the necklace last week the man chuckled fallen down the back of a sofa might be rumour of course might just be rumour he shook his head in wonderment at fates arbitrary ways but its a strange business life isnt it death is sandman said bitterly the turnkey fumbled with the press yards padlocked gate unaware that his callousness had provoked sandmans anger berrigan saw it and tried to divert the captain so why are we seeing this corday he asked sandman hesitated he had not yet told the sergeant about the missing maid meg and it had crossed his mind that perhaps berrigan had not really changed sides at all had the seraphim club sent him as a spy yet that seemed unlikely and the sergeants change of heart appeared to be sincere even if it was prompted more by an attraction to sally than any sincere repentance there was a witness he told berrigan and i need to know more about her and if i find her he left that thought unfinished and if you find her then someone will hang sandman said but not corday he nodded a curt acknowledgement to the turnkey who had unlocked the gate then led berrigan across the stinking yard and into the association room it was crowded because the rain had driven the prisoners and their visitors indoors and they stared resentfully at sandman and his companion as the two threaded their way through the tables to the shadowed back of the room where sandman expected to find corday the artist was evidently a changed man for instead of cowering from his persecutors he was now holding court at the table closest to the fire where with a thick pile of paper and a stick of charcoal he was drawing a portrait of a prisoners woman a small crowd surrounded him admiring his skill and they parted reluctantly to let sandman through corday gave a small start of recognition when he saw his visitors then quickly looked away i need a word with you sandman said hell talk to you when hes finished a huge man blackhaired longbearded and with a massive chest growled from the bench beside corday and he wont be finished for a while so wait my culleys wait and who are you berrigan asked im the cove telling you to wait the man said he had a west country accent greasy clothes and a thick matted beard he probed a finger into a capacious nostril as he stared belligerently at berrigan then withdrew it and gave the pickings a close inspection he cleaned his nail by running it through his beard then looked defiantly at sandman charlies time is valuable he explained and theres not much left of it its your life corday sandman said dont listen to him charlie the big man said youve got no friends in this wicked world except me and i know whats he stopped abruptly and uttered a gasping mewing noise as his eyes widened in shock sergeant berrigan had gone to stand behind him and now gave a jerk with his right hand that made the big man grunt in renewed pain sergeant sandman remonstrated with mock concern just teaching the culley manners berrigan said and thumped the man in the kidneys a second time when the captain wants a word you nosepicking piece of garbage you jump to attention you do eyes front mouth shut heels together and back straight you dont tell him to wait that aint polite corday looked anxiously at the bearded man are you all right hell be fine berrigan answered for his victim you just talk to the captain boy because hes trying to save your miserable bleeding life you want to play games culley the bearded man had stood and attempted to ram his elbow back into berrigans belly but the sergeant now thumped him across the ear tripped him and while he was still off balance ran him hard and fast until he slammed into a table berrigan thumped the mans face down hard you bleeding stay there culley till were done he tapped the back of the mans head as an encouragement then stalked back to cordays table everyone on parade captain he reported ready and willing sandman edged a woman aside so he could sit opposite corday i need to talk to you about the maid he said softly about meg i dont suppose you knew her surname no so what did meg look like your friend shouldnt have hit him corday still distracted by his companions pain complained to sandman what did she bloody look like son berrigan shouted in his best sergeants manner and corday twitched with sudden terror then set aside the halffinished portrait and without a word began to sketch on a clean sheet of paper he worked fast the charcoal making a small scratching noise in the silence of the big room shes young corday said maybe twentyfour orfive she has a pockmarked skin and mousecoloured hair her eyes have a greenish tint and she has a mole here he flicked a mark on the girls forehead her teeth arent good ive only drawn her face but you should know she had broad hips and a narrow chest small tits you mean berrigan growled corday blushed she was small above the waist he said but big beneath it he finished the drawing frowned at it for a moment then nodded in satisfaction and handed the sheet to sandman sandman stared at the picture the girl was ugly and then he thought she was more than ugly it was not just the poxscarred skin the narrow jaw the scrawny hair and small eyes but a suggestion of knowing hardness that sat strangely on such a young face if the portrait was accurate then meg was not just repulsive but evil why would the countess employ such a creature he asked they worked together in the theatre corday said worked together meg was an actress sandman sounded astonished no she was a dresser corday looked down at the portrait and seemed embarrassed she was more than a dresser i think more than a procuress corday said looking up at sandman how do you know the painter shrugged its strange how people will talk when youre making their portrait they forget youre even there you just become part of the furniture so the countess and meg talked i listened did you know sandman asked that the earl didnt commission the portrait he didnt that was plainly news to corday sir george said he did sandman shook his head it was commissioned by the seraphim club have you heard of it ive heard of it corday said but ive never been there so you wouldnt know why they commissioned the portrait how would i know that corday asked berrigan had come to stand at sandmans shoulder he grimaced at the sight of megs portrait and sandman turned the drawing so berrigan could get an even better look did you ever see her he asked wondering if the girl had ever been taken to the seraphim club but berrigan shook his head sandman looked back to corday there is a chance he said that we shall find her how great a chance cordays eyes were glistening i dont know sandman said he saw the hope fade in cordays eyes do you have ink here he asked a pen corday had both and sandman tore one of the big pieces of drawing paper in half dipped the steel nib in the ink let it drain and began to write dear witherspoon he began the bearer of this letter sergeant samuel berrigan is a companion of mine he served in the first foot guards and i trust him absolutely sandman was not certain those last four words were entirely true but he had little choice now but to assume berrigan was trustworthy he dipped the nib into the ink again conscious that corday was reading the words from across the table the regrettable possibility occurs that i might need to communicate with his lordship on sunday next and in the presumption that his lordship will not be at the home office on that day i beg you to tell me where he might be found i apologise for prevailing upon your time and assure you i do it only because i may have matters of the gravest urgency to report sandman read the letter over subscribed it and blew on the ink to dry it he wont like that he said to no one in particular then folded the letter and stood captain corday his eyes full of tears appealed to sandman sandman knew what the boy wanted to hear but he could not offer him any kind of assurance i am doing my best he said lamely but i can promise you nothing youre going to be all right charlie the bearded west countryman consoled corday and sandman who could add nothing more helpful thrust the portrait inside his coat and led berrigan back to the prison entrance the sergeant shook his head in apparent wonder when they reached the lodge you didnt tell me he was a bloody pixie does it matter it would be nice to think we was making an effort for a proper man berrigan growled hes a very good painter sos my brother he is hes a housepainter captain gutters doors and windows and he aint a pixie like that little worm sandman opened the prisons outer door and shuddered at the sight of the pelting rain i dont much like corday either he confessed but hes an innocent man sergeant and he doesnt deserve the rope most of those who hang dont maybe but cordays ours pixie or not he gave berrigan the folded letter home office you ask to see a man called sebastian witherspoon give him that then meet me at gunters in berkeley square and all for a bloody pixie eh berrigan asked then he thrust the letter into a pocket and with a grimace at the rain dashed out into the traffic sandman limping painfully followed more slowly he feared that the rain might have persuaded eleanor and her mother to abandon their expedition but he walked to berkeley square anyway and was soaked by the time he arrived at the door of gunters a footman stood under the shelter of the shops awning and looked askance at sandmans shabby coat then opened the door reluctantly as if to give sandman time to reflect on whether he really wanted to go inside the front of the shop was made of two wide windows behind which were gilded counters spindly chairs tall mirrors and spreading chandeliers that had been lit because the day was so gloomy a dozen women were shopping for gunters famous confections chocolates meringue sculptures and delicacies of spunsugar marzipan and crystallised fruit the conversation stopped as sandman entered and the women stared at him as he dripped on the tiled floor then they began talking again as he made his way to the large room at the back where a score of tables were set beneath the wide skylights of stained glass eleanor was not at any of the halfdozen occupied tables so sandman hung his coat and hat on a bentwood stand and took a chair at the back of the room where he was half hidden by a pillar he ordered coffee and a copy of the morning chronicle he idly read the newspaper there had been more rickburnings in sussex a bread riot in newcastle and three mills burnt and their machines broken in derbyshire the militia had been summoned to keep the peace in manchester where flour had been selling at four shillings and ninepence a stone the magistrates in lancashire were calling on the home secretary to suspend habeas corpus as a means of restoring order sandman looked at his watch and saw that eleanor was already ten minutes late he sipped the coffee and felt uncomfortable because the chair and table were too small making him feel as though he were perched in a school room he looked back to the newspaper a river had flooded in prussia and it was feared there were at least a hundred drowned the whale ship lydia out of whitehaven was reported lost with all hands off the grand banks the east indiaman calliope had arrived in the pool of london with a cargo of porcelain ginger indigo and nutmegs a riot at the covent garden theatre had left heads and bones broken but no serious casualties reports that a shot had been fired in the theatre were being denied by the managers there was the click of footsteps a wafting of perfume and a sudden shadow fell across his newspaper you look gloomy rider eleanors voice said there is no good news he said standing he looked at her and felt his heart miss a beat so that he could scarcely speak there is really no good news anywhere in all the world he managed to say then we must make some eleanor said you and i she handed an umbrella and her damp coat to one of the waitresses then stepped close to sandman and planted a kiss on his cheek i think i am yet angry with you she said softly still standing close with me for coming to london and not telling me our engagement is broken remember oh i had quite forgotten she said acidly then glanced at the other tables im causing scandal rider by being seen alone with a damp man she kissed him again then stood back so he could pull out a chair for her so let them have their scandal and i shall have one of gunters vanilla ices with the powdered chocolate and crushed almonds so will you im content with coffee nonsense you will have what is put in front of you you look too thin she sat and peeled off her gloves her red hair was drawn up into a small black hat decorated with tiny jet beads and a modest plume her dress was a muted dark brown with a barely distinguishable flower pattern worked in black threads and was high collared modest almost plain and decorated with only one small jet brooch yet somehow she looked more alluring than the scantily clad dancing girls who had scattered when sandman leapt down onto the stage the night before mother is being measured for a new corset eleanor said pretending to be oblivious of his inspection so she will be at least two hours she believes i am at massingberds choosing a hat my maid lizzie is chaperoning me but ive bribed her with two shillings and shes gone to see the pigheaded woman at the lyceum pigheaded as in obstinate dont be silly rider i trust all women are obstinate this one is pigheaded as in ugly she snuffles her food from a trough were told and has stiff pink whiskers it sounds a very unlikely beast but lizzie was enchanted at the prospect and i was quite tempted to go myself but im here instead did i see you limping i sprained an ankle yesterday he said then had to tell the whole story which of course enchanted eleanor im jealous she said when he had finished my life is so dull i dont jump onto stages pursued by footpads i am exceedingly jealous but you have news sandman asked i think so yes definitely eleanor turned to the waitress and ordered tea the vanilla confection with the chocolate and almonds and as an afterthought brandy snaps they have an ice house out the back she told sandman when the girl had gone and i asked to see it a few weeks ago its like a cellar with a dome and every winter they bring the ice down from scotland packed in sawdust and it stays solid all summer there was a frozen rat between two of the blocks and they were very embarrassed about it i should think they would be sandman was suddenly acutely aware of his own shabbiness of the frayed cuffs of his coat and the broken stitching at the top of his boots they had been good boots too from kennets of silver street but even the best boots needed care merely staying respectably dressed needed at least an hour a day and sandman did not have that hour i tried to persuade father to build an ice house eleanor said but he just went grumpy and complained about the expense hes having one of his economy drives at the moment so i told him id save him the cost of a society wedding sandman gazed into her greygreen eyes wondering what message was being sent by her apparent glibness was he pleased he just muttered to me how prudence was one of the virtues he was embarrassed by the offer i think how would you save him the expense by remaining a spinster by eloping eleanor said her gaze very steady with lord eagleton eleanors laugh filled the big space of gunters back room causing a momentary hush at the other tables eagletons such a bore eleanor said much too loudly mama was very keen i should marry him because then in due course i would be her ladyship and mama would be unbearable dont tell me you thought i was betrothed to him i heard that you were i was told your portrait was a gift for him mother said we should give it to him but father wants it for himself mother just wants me to marry a title she doesnt mind what or who it is and lord eagleton wants to marry me which is tedious because i cant abide him he sniffs before he talks she gave a small sniff dear eleanor sniff how charming you look sniff i can see the moon reflected in your eyes sniff sandman kept a straight face i never told you i saw the moon reflected in your eyes i fear that was remiss of me they looked at each other and burst out laughing they had always been able to laugh since the very first day they had met when sandman was newly home after being wounded at salamanca and eleanor was just twenty and determined not to be impressed by a soldier but the soldier had made her laugh and still could just as she could amuse him i think eleanor said that eagleton spent a week rehearsing the words about the moon but he spoilt it by sniffing really rider talking to eagleton is like conversing with an asthmatic lap dog mama and he seem to believe that if they wish it long enough then i will surrender to his sniffs and i gathered a rumour of our betrothal had been bruited about so i deliberately told alexander to inform you i was not going to marry the noble sniffer now i find alexander never told you i fear not but i told him distinctly eleanor said indignantly i met him at the egyptian hall he told me that much sandman said but he quite forgot any message you might have sent hed even forgotten why he had gone to the egyptian hall for a lecture by a man called professor popkin on the newly discovered location of the garden of eden he wants us to believe that paradise is to be found at the confluence of the ohio and the mississippi rivers he informed us that he once ate a very fine apple there that sounds like proof positive sandman said gravely and did he become wise after eating the fruit he became erudite learned sagacious and clever eleanor said and sandman saw there were tears in her eyes and she went on he encouraged us to uproot ourselves and follow him to this new world of milk honey and apples would you like to go there rider with you we could live naked by the rivers eleanor said as a tear escaped to trickle down her cheek innocent as babes and avoiding serpents she could not go on and lowered her face so he could not see her tears im so very sorry rider she said quietly about what i should never have let mama persuade me to break off the engagement she said your familys disgrace was too absolute but thats nonsense the disgrace is dire sandman admitted that was your father not you i sometimes think i am very like my father sandman said then he was a better man than i realised eleanor said fiercely then dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief the waitress brought their ices and brandy snaps and thinking that eleanor had been upset by something sandman had said gave him a reproachful look eleanor waited for the girl to move away i hate crying she said you do it rarely sandman said i have been weeping like a fountain these six months eleanor said then looked up at him last night i told mama i consider myself betrothed to you im honoured youre supposed to say it is mutual sandman half smiled i would like it to be truly father wont mind eleanor said at least i dont think he will mind but your mother will she does when i told her my feelings last night she insisted i ought to visit doctor harriman have you heard of him of course you havent he is an expert mama tells me in feminine hysteria and it is considered a great honour to be examined by him but i dont need him im not hysterical i am merely inconveniently in love with you and if your damned father had not killed himself then you and i would be married by now i do envy men why they can swear and no one lifts an eyebrow swear my dear sandman said eleanor did then laughed that felt very good oh dear one day we shall be married and i shall swear too much and you will get bored with me she sniffed then sighed as she tasted the ice that is real paradise she said prodding the ice with the long silver spoon and i swear nothing at the confluence of the ohio and mississippi rivers can rival it poor rider you shouldnt even think of marrying me you should tip your hat at caroline standish caroline standish ive not heard of her he tasted the ice and it was as eleanor had said pure paradise caroline standish is perhaps the richest heiress in england rider and a very pretty girl she is too but you should be warned that she is a methodist golden hair damn her a truly lovely face and probably thirty thousand a year but the drawback is that you cannot drink ardent spirits in her presence neither smoke nor blaspheme nor take snuff nor really enjoy yourself in any way her father made his money in the potteries but they now live in london and worship at that vulgar little chapel in spring gardens im sure you could attract her eye im sure i could sandman said with a smile and im confident she will approve of cricket eleanor said so long as you dont play it on the sabbath do you still indulge in cricket rider not as often as alexander would like they say that lord frederick beauclerk earns six hundred a year gambling on cricket could you do that im a better batsman than him sandman said truthfully enough lord frederick a friend of lord alexanders and like him an aristocrat in holy orders was the secretary of the marylebone cricket club that played at thomas lords ground but im a worse gambler sandman went on besides beauclerk wagers money he can afford to lose and i dont have such funds then marry the pious miss standish eleanor said mind you there is the small inconvenience that she is already betrothed but there are rumours that shes not altogether persuaded that the future duke of ripon is nearly as godly as he pretends he goes to the spring gardens chapel but only one suspects so that he can pluck her golden feathers once he has married her the future duke of ripon sandman asked he has his own title of course but i cant remember it mother would know it sandman went very still ripon a cathedral city in yorkshire rider the marquess of skavadale sandman said is the title carried by the heir to the dukedom of ripon thats him well done eleanor frowned at him have i said something wrong skavadale isnt godly at all sandman said and he remembered the earl of avebury describing how his wife had blackmailed young men about town had skavadale been blackmailed by the countess skavadale was famously short of money and his fathers estates were evidently mortgaged to the hilt yet skavadale had managed to become betrothed to the wealthiest heiress in england and if he had been ploughing the countess of aveburys furrow she would surely have found him a ripe target for blackmail his family might have lost most of its fortune but there would be some funds left and there would be porcelain silver and paintings that could be sold more than enough to keep the countess content youre mystifying me eleanor complained i think the marquess of skavadale is my murderer sandman said either him or one of his friends if sandman had been forced to put money on the murderers identity he would have chosen lord robin holloway rather than the marquess but he was quite certain it was one of them so you dont need to know what lizzie discovered eleanor asked disappointed your maid of course i want to know i need to know meg wasnt very popular with the other servants they thought she was a witch she looks like one sandman said youve already found her eleanor asked excited no i saw a portrait everyone seems to sit these days eleanor said this portrait sandman pulled the drawing from inside his coat and showed it to eleanor rider you dont think shes the pigfaced woman do you eleanor asked no she cant be she has no whiskers she sighed poor girl to be so ugly she stared at the drawing for a long while then rolled it up and pushed it back to sandman what was i saying oh yes lizzie discovered that meg was carried away from the countesss town house by a carriage a very smart carriage that was either black or dark blue and with a strange coatofarms painted on its door it wasnt a complete coatofarms just a shield showing a red field decorated with a golden angel eleanor crumbled a brandy snap i asked hammond if he knew of that shield and he became very refined a field gules miss forrest he insisted to me with an angel or but astonishingly he didnt know who it belonged to and consequently he was most upset sandman smiled at the thought of sir henry forrests butler being unable to identify a coatofarms he shouldnt feel upset sandman said because i doubt the college of arms issued that device its the badge of the seraphim club eleanor grimaced remembering what sandman had told her and her father earlier in the week though in truth sandman had not revealed all he knew about the seraphim and the marquess of skavadale she said quietly is a member of the seraphim club he is sandman confirmed she frowned so hes your murderer its that easy the members of the seraphim club sandman said consider themselves beyond the law they believe their rank their money and their privilege will keep them safe and quite possibly theyre right unless i can find meg if meg lives eleanor said quietly if meg lives sandman agreed eleanor stared at sandman and her eyes seemed bright and big i feel rather selfish now she said why worrying about my small problems when you have a murderer to find your problems are small sandman asked with a smile eleanor did not return the smile i am not willing rider she said to give you up i tried he knew how much effort it had taken for her to say those words and so he reached for her hand and kissed her fingers i have never given you up he said and next week i shall talk to your father again and if he says no she clutched his fingers then we shall go to scotland sandman said we shall go to scotland eleanor held tight to his hand she smiled rider my prudent wellbehaved honourable rider you would elope he returned the smile of late my dear he said i have been thinking about that afternoon and evening i spent on the ridge at waterloo and i remember making a decision there and its a decision i am constantly in danger of forgetting if i survived that day i promised myself then i would not die with regrets i would not die with wishes dreams and desires unfulfilled so yes if your father refuses to let us marry then i shall take you to scotland and let the devil take the hindmost because i am your wish dream and desire eleanor asked with tears in her eyes and a smile on her face because you are all of those things sandman said and i love you besides and sergeant berrigan dripping with rainwater and grinning with delight at discovering sandman at so delicate a moment was suddenly standing beside them ooooooo the sergeant began to whistle spanish ladies as they climbed hay hill towards old bond street it was a cheerful whistle one that proclaimed that he was not at all interested in what he had just seen and a welljudged whistle that in the army would have been recognised as entirely insubordinate but quite unpunishable sandman still limping laughed i was once engaged to miss forrest sergeant german coach there captain see it heavy bloody thing berrigan still pretended to be uninterested pointing instead at a massive carriage that was sliding dangerously on the hills rainslicked cobbles the coachman was hauling on the brake the horses were skittering nervously but then the wheels struck the kerb and steadied the vehicle shouldnt be allowed berrigan said foreign bloody coaches cracking up our roads they should tax the buggers blind or else send them back across the bloody channel where they belong and miss forrest broke off the engagement because her parents did not want her to marry a pauper sandman said so now sergeant you know all didnt look much like a broken bloody engagement to me sir staring into your eyes like the sun moon and sparkles were trapped there yes well life is complicated i hadnt noticed berrigan said sarcastically he grimaced at the weather though the rain was now spitting rather than cascading and talking of complications he went on mister sebastian witherspoon was not a happy man not a happy man at all in fact if i was to be accurate he was bloody annoyed ah he has adduced that i am not behaving as he expected he wanted to know what you were bloody up to captain so i said i didnt know he surely refused to accept that assurance he could do what he bloody liked captain but i told him yes sir no sir i dont know a blessed thing sir up your back alley sir and go to hell sir but all of it in a deeply respectful manner you behaved in other words like a sergeant sandman asked and laughed again he remembered that subservient insolence from his own sergeants an apparent cooperation masking a deep intransigence but did he tell you where the home secretary will be on sunday his lordship wont be at his home captain on account that the builders are putting in a new staircase in his house which they promised to have finished last may and which they aint even painted yet so his lordship is borrowing a house in great george street mister witherspoon said he hopes he dont see you any day soon and anyway his lordship wont thank you for disturbing him on sunday on account that his lordship is of the godly persuasion and anyway mister witherspoon like his holy lordship trusts that the bloody pixie is hanged by his bloody neck till hes bloody well dead like what he bloody deserves to be im sure he didnt say the last not quite berrigan admitted cheerfully but i did and mister witherspoon began to think well of me another few minutes and hed have given you the butt end and made me the investigator instead god help corday then eh the little bugger would go to the gallows so bleeding fast that his twinkle toes wouldnt touch the ground berrigan said happily so where are we going now were going to see sir george phillips because i want to know if he can tell me exactly who commissioned the countesss portrait know that mans name sergeant and we have our murderer you hope berrigan said dubiously miss hood is also at sir georges studio she models for him ah berrigan cheered up and even if sir george wont tell us then ive also learnt that my one witness was carried away in the seraphim clubs carriage one of their carriages berrigan corrected him they have two so i assume one of the clubs coachmen can tell us where they took her i imagine they might berrigan said though they might need some persuading a pleasing prospect sandman said arriving at the door beside the jewellers shop he knocked and as before the door was answered by sammy the black page who immediately tried to shut it sandman bulled his way through tell sir george he said imperiously that captain rider sandman and sergeant samuel berrigan have come to talk to him he dont want to talk to you sammy said go and tell him child sandman insisted instead sammy made an illjudged attempt to dodge past sandman into the street only to be caught by sergeant berrigan who lifted the lad and slammed him against the door post where were you going boy berrigan demanded why dont you fake off sammy said defiantly then yelped i wasnt going anywhere berrigan drew back his fist again he told me if you was to come again sammy said hastily i was to go and fetch help from the seraphim club sandman guessed and the boy nodded hold onto him sergeant sandman said then began climbing the stairs fee fi fo fum he chanted at the top of his voice i smell the blood of an englishman he was making the noise to warn sally so that sergeant berrigan would not see her naked sandman had no doubt that berrigan would be getting that treat very soon but sandman also had no doubt that sally would want to decide when that would be sir george he bellowed are you there who the devil is it sir george shouted sammy sammys a prisoner sandman shouted gods bollocks its you sir george for a fat man moved with remarkable speed going to a cupboard from which he took a longbarrelled pistol he ran with it to the head of the stairs and pointed it down at sandman no further captain on pain of your life he growled sandman glanced at the pistol and kept on climbing dont be such a bloody fool he said tiredly shoot me sir george and youll have to shoot sergeant berrigan then youll have to keep sally quiet and that means shooting her so then youll have three corpses on your hands he climbed the last few steps and without any fuss took the pistol from the painters hand its always best to cock weapons if you want to look really threatening he added then turned and nodded at berrigan allow me to introduce sergeant berrigan late of the first foot guards then of the seraphim club but now a volunteer in my army of righteousness sandman saw with relief that sally had received enough warning to pull on a coat he took off his hat and bowed to her miss hood my respects youre still limping then sally asked then blushed as sergeant berrigan arrived hes bleeding hurting me sammy complained ill bleeding kill you if you dont shut up berrigan growled then he nodded to sally miss hood he said then he saw the canvas and his eyes widened in admiration and sally blushed even deeper you can put sammy down sandman said to berrigan because he wont go for help hell do what i tell him sir george said belligerently sandman crossed to the painting and stared at the central figure of nelson and thought that since the admirals death the painters and engravers had been making the hero ever more frail so that he was now almost a spectral figure if you tell sammy to go for help sir george he said then i shall spread it abroad that your studio deceives women that you paint them clothed and when they are gone you turn them into nudes he turned and smiled at the painter what will that do to your prices double them sir george said defiantly then he saw that sandmans threat was real and he seemed to deflate like a pricked bladder he flapped a paintstained hand at sammy youre not going anywhere sammy berrigan put the boy down you can make some tea instead sandman said ill help you sammy sally said and followed the boy down the stairs sandman suspected she was going to get dressed sandman turned to sir george youre an old man sir george youre fat and youre a drunkard your hand shakes you can still paint but for how long youre living off your reputation now but i can ruin that i can make quite certain that men like sir henry forrest never hire you again to paint their wives or daughters for fear of you doing to them what you would have done to the countess of avebury i would never do that to sir george began be quiet sandman said and i can put in my report to the home secretary that you have deliberately hidden the truth that in reality was a much lesser threat but sir george did not know it he only feared prosecution the dock and jail or maybe he saw transportation to australia for he began to shudder in unfeigned terror i know you lied sandman said so now you will tell me the truth and if i do then sergeant berrigan and i will tell no one why should we care what happens to you i know you didnt murder the countess and thats the only person im interested in so tell us the truth sir george and we shall leave you in peace sir george sank onto a stool the apprentices and the two men portraying nelson and neptune gazed at him until he snarled at them to go downstairs only when they were gone did he look at sandman the seraphim club commissioned the painting i know that sandman walked to the back of the studio past the table heaped with rags brushes and jars he was looking for eleanors portrait but he could not see it he turned back what i want to know sir george is who in the club commissioned it i dont know really i dont know he was pleading his fear almost tangible there were ten or eleven of them i cant remember ten or eleven of them sitting at a table sir george said like the last supper only without christ they said they were having the painting done for their gallery and they promised me thered be others other paintings of titled women captain naked sir george snarled the last word she was their trophy they explained it to me if more than three members of the club had swived a woman then she could be hung in their gallery sandman glanced at berrigan who shrugged sounds likely the sergeant said they have a gallery corridor upstairs berrigan said but theyve only just started hanging paintings up there the marquess of skavadale was one of the eleven sandman asked sir george ten or eleven sir george sounded irritated that he had to correct sandman and yes skavadale was one lord pellmore was another i remember sir john lassiter but i didnt know most of them they didnt introduce themselves no sir george made the denial defiantly because it confirmed that he had been treated by the seraphim club as a tradesman not as a gentleman i think it likely sandman said quietly that one of those ten or eleven men is the murderer of the countess he looked at sir george quizzically as though expecting that statement to be confirmed i wouldnt know sir george said but you must have suspected that charles corday did not commit the murder little charlie for a moment sir george looked amused then he saw the anger on sandmans face and shrugged it seemed unlikely he admitted yet you did not appeal for him you did not sign his mothers petition you did nothing to help he was tried wasnt he sir george said he received justice i doubt that sandman said bitterly i doubt that very much sandman lifted the frizzen of the pistol he had taken from sir george and saw that it was not primed you have powder and bullets he asked and then when he saw the fear on the painters face he scowled im not going to shoot you you fool the powder and bullets are for other people not you in that cupboard sir george nodded across the room sandman opened the door and discovered a small arsenal most of it he supposed for use in paintings there were naval and army swords pistols muskets and a cartridge box he tossed a cavalry pistol to berrigan then took a handful of the cartridges and pushed them into a pocket before stooping to pick up a knife youve wasted my time he told sir george youve lied to me youve inconvenienced me he carried the knife back across the room and saw the terror on sir georges face sally sandman shouted im here she called up the stairs how much does sir george owe you two pounds and five shillings pay her sandman said you cant expect me to carry cash on pay her sandman shouted and sir george almost fell off the stool i only have three guineas on me he whined i think miss hood is worth that sandman said give the three guineas to the sergeant sir george handed over the money as sandman turned to the painting britannia was virtually finished sitting barebreasted and proudeyed on her rock in a sunlit sea the goddess was unmistakeably sally though sir george had changed her usually cheerful expression into one of calm superiority you really have inconvenienced me sandman said to sir george and worse you were ready to let an innocent boy die ive told you everything i can now you have yes but you lied and i think you need to be inconvenienced too you need to learn sir george that for every sin there is a payment extracted in short you must be punished you insolent sir george began then lurched to his feet and called out a protest no berrigan held sir george down while sandman took the knife to the apotheosis of lord nelson sammy had just brought his tray of tea to the stairhead and the boy watched appalled as sandman cut down the canvas then across a friend of mine sandman explained as he mutilated the painting is probably going to get married soon he doesnt know it and nor does his intended bride but they plainly like each other and ill want to give them a present when it happens he slashed again slicing across the top of the painting the canvas split with a sharp sizzling sound leaving small threads he slid the knife downwards again and so excised from the big picture a lifesize and halflength portrait of sally he tossed the knife onto the floor rolled up the picture of britannia and smiled at sir george this will make a splendid gift so i shall have it varnished and framed thank you so very much for your help sergeant i believe were finished here im coming with you sally said from the stairs only someone has to hook me frock up duty summons you sandman said to berrigan your servant sir george sir george glared at him but seemed incapable of speaking sandman began to smile as he ran down the stairs and he was laughing by the time he reached the street where he waited for berrigan and sally they joined him when sallys dress was fastened who do you know getting married soon berrigan demanded just two friends sandman said airily and if they dont well i might keep the picture for myself captain sally chided him married berrigan sounded shocked i am very oldfashioned sandman said and a staunch believer in christian morality speaking of which the sergeant said why have we got pistols because our next call sergeant must be the seraphim club and i do not like to go there unarmed id also prefer it if they did not know we were on the premises so when is the best time to make our visit why are we going there berrigan wanted to know to talk to the coachmen of course the sergeant thought for a second then nodded then go after dark he said because itll be easier for us to sneak in and at least one jervis will be there let us hope its the right coachman sandman said and snapped open his watch not till dark which means i have an afternoon to while away he thought for a moment i shall go and talk to a friend shall we meet at nine oclock say behind the club meet me at the carriage house entrance the sergeant suggested which is in an alley off charles ii street unless you want to stay with me sandman suggested im only going to pass the time with a friend no berrigan reddened i feel like a rest then be kind enough to place that in my room sandman said giving the sergeant the rolled portrait of sally and you miss hood i cant think how you might want to pass the afternoon would you want to accompany me to see a friend sally put her arm into the sergeants elbow smiled sweetly at sandman so very sweetly and spoke gently fake away off captain sandman laughed and did what he was told he faked away off chapter seven bunny barnwell was reckoned to be the best bowler in the marylebone cricket club despite having a strange loping run that ended with a double hop before he launched the ball sidearm the double hop had provided his nickname and he now bowled at rider sandman on one of the netted practice wickets at the downhill side of thomas lords new cricket ground in st johns wood a pretty suburb to the north of london lord alexander pleydell stood beside the net peering anxiously at every ball is bunny moving it off the grass he asked not at all hes supposed to twist the ball so it moves into your legs sharply in crossley said the motion was extremely confusing crossleys easily confused sandman said and thumped the ball hard into the net driving lord alexander back in fright barnwell was taking turns with hughes lord alexanders servant to bowl to sandman hughes reckoned himself a useful underarm bowler but he was becoming frustrated at being unable to get anything past sandmans bat and so he tried too hard and launched a ball that did not bounce at all and sandman cracked it fast out of the net and over the damp grass so that the ball flicked up a fine silver spray as it shot up the hill where three men were scything the turf making a cricket field on such a pronounced slope made no sense to sandman but alexander had a curious attachment to thomas lords new field even though from one boundary to another there must have been a fall of at least six or seven feet barnwell tried bowling underarm and was forced to watch his ball follow hughess last delivery up the slope one of the boys who were fielding for the nets tried a fast ball at sandmans legs and was rewarded with a blow that almost took his head off youre in a savage mood lord alexander observed not really damp day balls slow sandman lied in truth he was in a savage mood wondering how he was to keep his promise to eleanor and why he had even made the promise to elope if her father refused his blessing no he understood the answer to the second question he had made the promise because as ever he had been overwhelmed by eleanor by the look of her by the nearness of her and by his own desire for her but could the promise be kept he slashed a ball into the net behind with such force that the ball drove the tarred mesh into the back fence rattling the palings and startling a dozen sparrows into the air how could he elope sandman asked himself how could he marry a woman when he had no means to support her and where was the honour in some holeinthewall scottish wedding that needed neither licence nor banns the anger surged in him so he skipped down the pitch and drove a ball hard towards the stables where the club members kept their horses during games an exceedingly savage mood lord alexander said thoughtfully then took a pencil from the tangled hair behind his ear and a much creased piece of paper from a pocket i thought hammond could keep wicket do you agree this is your team to play hampshire no rider its my proposal for a new dean and canons of st pauls cathedral what do you think it is hammond would be an excellent choice sandman said going onto his back leg and blocking a sharply rising ball good one he called to hughes edward budd said hell play for us lord alexander said wonderful sandman spoke with genuine warmth for edward budd was the one batsman he acknowledged as his superior and was also thoroughly good company and simmons is available then i wont be sandman said he collected the last ball with the tip of his bat and knocked it back to hughes simmons is an excellent batsman lord alexander insisted so he is sandman said but he took cash to throw a game in sussex two years ago it wont happen again not while im on the same team it wont make your choice alexander him or me lord alexander sighed he really is very good then pick him sandman said taking his stance i shall think about it lord alexander said in his most lordly manner the next delivery came hurtling at sandmans ankles and he rewarded it with a blow that sent the ball all the way to the tavern by the lower boundary fence where a dozen men watched the nets from the beer garden were any of those men lord robin holloways footpads sandman glanced at his coat folded onto the damp grass and was reassured by the sight of the pistols hilt just protruding from a pocket maybe you can talk to simmons lord alexander suggested including him will give our side an immense batting force rider a positively immense force you budd and him we shall set new records ill talk to him sandman said i just wont play with him for gods sake man sandman stepped away from the wicket alexander i love the game of cricket but if its to be bent out of shape by bribery then there will be no sport left the only way to treat bribery is to punish it absolutely he spoke angrily is it any wonder that the games dying this club here used to have a decent field now they play on a hillside the games in decline alexander because its being corrupted by money its all very well for you to say that lord alexander said huffily but simmons has a wife and two children dont you understand temptation i think i do yes sandman said i was offered twenty thousand guineas yesterday he stepped back to the crease and nodded at the next bowler twenty thousand lord alexander sounded faint to lose a game of cricket to let an innocent man hang sandman said playing a demure defensive stroke its too easy he complained what is this intellectual bowling the side arm delivery when the ball was bowled from a straight arm held at shoulder height was curiously known as the intellectual style it has no accuracy sandman complained but it has force lord alexander declared energetically far more so than balls bowled under arm we should bowl over arm never never ruin the game an utterly ridiculous suggestion offensive in the extreme lord alexander paused to suck on his pipe the club isnt certain it will even allow side arm let alone over arm no if we wish to redress the balance between batsman and bowler then the answer is obvious four stumps are you serious i just think that over arm bowling will combine force with accuracy sandman suggested and might even present a challenge to the batsman serious i mean about being offered twenty thousand pounds guineas alexander guineas the men who made the offer consider themselves to be gentlemen sandman stepped back and cracked the ball hard into the netting close to where lord alexander was standing why would they offer you so much its cheaper than death on the gallows isnt it the only trouble is i dont know for certain which member of the seraphim club is the murderer but i hope to discover that this evening you wouldnt like to lend me your carriage would you lord alexander looked puzzled my carriage the thing with four wheels alexander and the horses up front sandman sent another ball scorching up the hill its in a good cause rescuing the innocent well of course lord alexander said with admirable enthusiasm i shall be honoured to help you shall i wait at your lodgings keeping miss hood company sandman asked why not he laughed at alexanders blushes then backed away from the stumps as a young man walked towards the practice wickets from the tavern there was something purposeful in the mans approach and sandman was about to fetch his pistol when he recognised lord christopher carne the heir to the earl of avebury your friends coming he told lord alexander my friend oh kit lord christopher waved in response to lord alexanders enthusiastic greeting then noticed sandman he blanched stopped and looked annoyed for a heartbeat sandman thought lord christopher was about to turn on his heel and walk away but instead the bespectacled young man strode purposefully towards sandman you never told me he said accusingly that you were visiting my father did i need to tell you a ball kicked up and sandman swayed aside to let it thump into the net behind it would have been ccourteous lord christopher complained if i need lessons in courtesy sandman said sharply then i shall go to those who treat me politely lord christopher bridled but lacked the courage to demand an apology for sandmans truculence i spoke to you in cconfidence he protested and had no idea you would ppass anything on to my father i passed on nothing to your father sandman said mildly i did not repeat one word you said indeed i did not even tell him i had seen you he wrote to me lord christopher said saying youd visited and that i wasnt to speak with you again so its plain youre lying you ddid tell him you spoke with me the letter sandman thought must have travelled on the same mail coach that brought him back to london your father deduced it sandman explained and you should have a care whom you accuse of telling lies unless youre quite confident you are both a better shot and a better swordsman than the man you accuse he did not look to see the effect of his words but instead danced two quicksteps down the pitch and drove at a delivery with all his strength he knew the stroke was good even before the bat struck the ball and then it shot away and the three men scything the playing wicket stared in awe as the ball streaked between them to take its first bounce just short of the uphill boundary and it still seemed to be travelling at the same speed with which it had left the bat when it vanished in the bushes at the top of the hill it had gone like a sixpounder shot sandman thought and then he heard it crack against the fence and heard a cow mooing in protest from the neighbouring meadow good god lord alexander said faintly staring up the hill good god alive i spoke hastily lord christopher said in scant apology but i still dont understand why you should even need to go near carne manor did you see how hard he struck that lord alexander asked why lord christopher insisted angrily i told you why sandman said to discover whether any of your stepmothers servants had gone there of course they wouldnt lord christopher said last time you thought it possible thats because i hadnt thought about it pproperly those servants must have known precisely what vile things my stepmother was doing in london and my father would hardly want them spreading such ttales in wiltshire true sandman conceded so i wasted a journey but the good news rider lord alexander intervened is that mister william brown has agreed that you and i should attend on monday he beamed at sandman isnt that splendid mister brown sandman asked the keeper of newgate i would have expected a man in your position to have known that lord alexander turned to a bemused lord christopher it occurred to me kit that so long as rider was the home secretarys official investigator then he should certainly investigate the gallows he should know exactly what awful brutality awaits people like corday so i wrote to the keeper and he has very decently invited rider and myself to breakfast devilled kidneys he promises ive always rather liked a properly devilled kidney sandman stepped away from the stumps i have no wish to witness a hanging he said it doesnt matter what you wish lord alexander said airily it is a matter of duty i have no duty to witness a hanging sandman insisted of course you do lord alexander said i confess i am apprehensive i do not approve of the gallows but at the same time i discover a curiosity within me if nothing else rider it will be an educational experience educational rubbish sandman stepped back to the wicket and played a straight bat to a wellbowled ball im not going alexander and thats that no the answer is no id like to go lord christopher said in a small voice rider lord alexander expostulated no sandman said i shall happily send the real killer to the gallows but im not witnessing a newgate circus he waved hughes away ive batted long enough he explained then ran a hand down the face of his bat you have any linseed oil alexander the real killer lord christopher asked do you know who that is i hope to know by this evening sandman said if i send for your carriage alexander then youll know ive discovered my witness if i dont alas witness lord christopher asked if riders going to be obdurate lord alexander said to lord christopher then perhaps you should join me for the keepers devilled kidneys on monday he fumbled with his tinder box as he tried to light a new pipe i was thinking that you really ought to join the club here rider we need members i can imagine you do whod join a club that plays on an imitation of an alpine meadow a perfectly good pitch lord alexander said querulously witness lord christopher broke in to ask again i trust youll send for the carriage lord alexander boomed i want to see that bloody man sidmouth confounded make him grant a pardon rider i shall await your summons at the wheatsheaf ill wait with you lord christopher said and was rewarded by a flicker of annoyance on lord alexanders face sandman who saw the same flicker knew that lord alexander did not want a rival for sallys attention but lord christopher must have taken it as an insult for his face fell lord alexander gazed at the three groundsmen who were still leaning on their scythes and discussing sandmans ball that had blasted through them like a roundshot i have always thought lord alexander said that there is a fortune to be made by a man who can invent a device for the cutting of grass its called a sheep sandman said vulgarly known as a woolly bird a device that does not leave dung lord alexander said acidly then smiled at lord christopher carne of course you must spend the evening with me my dear fellow perhaps you can explain this man kant to me someone sent me his last book have you seen it i thought you would have he seems very sound but he was a prussian wasnt he i suppose that wasnt his fault come and have some tea first rider youll have some tea of course you will and i want you to meet lord frederick you know hes our club secretary now you really should join us and you wanted some linseed oil for the bat they do a very acceptable tea here so sandman went for a lordly tea ooooooo it was a cloudy evening and the sky over london was made even darker because there was no wind and the coal smoke hung thick and still above the roofs and spires the streets near st jamess square were quiet for there were no businesses in these quiet houses and many of their owners were in the country sandman saw a watchman noting him and so he crossed to the man and said good evening and asked what regiment he had served in and the two passed the time exchanging memories of salamanca which sandman thought was perhaps the most beautiful town he had ever seen a lamplighter came round with his ladder and the new gas lights popped on one after the other burning blue for a time and then turning whiter some of the houses here are getting gas the watchman said indoors indoors no goodll come of it sir it aint natural is it the watchman looked up at the nearest hissing lamp therell be fire and pillars of smoke sir like it says in the good book sir fire and pillars of smoke burning like a fiery furnace sir sandman was saved more apocalyptic prophecies when a hackney turned into the street the sound of its horses hooves echoing sharply from the shadowed white house fronts it stopped close to sandman the door opened and sergeant berrigan stepped down he tossed a coin up to the driver then held the door open for sally you cant sandman began i told you hed say that berrigan boasted to sally didnt i tell you hed say you shouldnt come sergeant sandman insisted we cannot youre going for meg right sally intervened and she aint going to take kindly to two old swoddies doing her up is she she needs a womans touch im sure two old soldiers can gain her confidence sandman said sal wont take no for an answer the sergeant warned him besides sandman continued meg isnt in the seraphim club were only going there to find the coachman so he can tell us where he took her maybe hell tell me what he wont tell you sally said to sandman with a dazzling smile then she turned on the watchman you got nothing better to do than listen to other folks chatting the man looked startled but followed the lamplighter down the street while sergeant berrigan fished in his coat pocket to bring out a key which he showed to sandman back way in captain he said then looked at sally listen my love i know stow it sam im coming with you berrigan led the way shaking his head i dont know what it is he grumbled the ladies tell you that life aint fair because men get all the privileges but the mollishers dont half get their own way you notice that captain its bitch about this and bitch about that but who gets to wear the silk gold and pearls eh you talking about me sam berrigan sally asked true love sandman murmured then berrigan put a finger to his lips as they approached a wide carriage gate set in a white wall at the end of a short street what it is berrigan said softly is that its a quiet time of day in the club we should be able to sneak in he approached a small door set to one side of the gates tried it found it locked and so used his key he pushed the door open looked into the yard and evidently saw nothing to alarm him for he stepped over the threshold and beckoned sandman and sally to follow the yard was empty except for a coach its blue paint trimmed with gold that had evidently just been washed for it stood gleaming in the dusk with water dripping from its flanks and buckets standing by the wheels the badge of the golden angel was painted on the door over here quick berrigan said and sandman and sally followed the sergeant to the shadow of the stables one of the lads will be washing it berrigan said but the coachmen will be in the back kitchen there he nodded to a lit window in the carriage house then turned in alarm as a door in the main house was thrown open in here berrigan hissed and the three of them filed into an alley that led beside the stables footsteps sounded in the yard here a voice asked sandman did not recognise it a hole twelve feet deep another voice answered stonelined and with a masonry dome over the top not much damn room how wides the hole ten feet christ man its where we turn the carriages do it in the street berrigan swayed close to sandman theyre talking about building an ice house he breathed in sandmans ear been discussing it for a year now what about behind the stables the first man asked no room the other man answered i mean between the stables and the back wall the first man said and sandman heard his footsteps getting closer and knew it was only a matter of seconds before they were discovered but then berrigan peered out of the alleys far end saw no one and dashed across a smaller yard to a door that opened into the rear of the house this way he hissed sandman and sally ran after him and found themselves on a servants stairway that evidently ran from the kitchens in the basement to the upper floors well hide upstairs berrigan whispered till the coasts clear why not hide here sandman asked cos the bastards could come back in through this bleeding door berrigan said then led them up the unlit stairway halfway up he edged open a door that led into a corridor that was deeply carpeted and had walls covered in a deep scarlet paper though it was too dark to see the pattern of the paper or the details of the pictures that hung between the polished doors berrigan chose a door at random opened it and found an empty room well be all right in here he said it was a bedroom large lavish and comfortable the bed itself was high and huge plumpmattressed and covered with a thick scarlet covering on which the seraphims naked angel took flight a fireplace was there to warm the room in winter berrigan crossed to the window and pulled back the curtain so he could gaze down into the yard sandmans eyes slowly adjusted to the dim light then he heard sally laugh and he turned to see her gazing at a picture above the bedhead good god sandman said theres a lot of those berrigan commented drily the picture showed a happy group of men and women in a circular arcade of white marble pillars in the foreground a child played a flute and another plucked a harp both ignoring their naked elders who coupled under the moon that lit the pillared arcade with an unearthly glow bloody hell sally said respectfully you wouldnt think a girl could do that with her legs sandman decided no answer was necessary he moved to the window and stared down but the yard seemed empty again i think theyve gone back inside berrigan said another one sally said standing on tiptoe to examine the painting above the empty fireplace dyou think theyll come in here sandman asked berrigan shook his head they only use these back slums in the winter sally giggled at the picture then turned on berrigan you worked in an academy sam berrigan its a club bleeding academy is what it is sally said scornfully i left it didnt i berrigan protested besides it werent an academy for us servants only for the members what members sally asked and laughed at her own jest berrigan hushed her not because she was being coarse but because there were footsteps in the corridor outside they came close to the door passed on faded it doesnt really help us being up here sandman said well wait for things to quiet down berrigan said and then well slip back down to the yard the door handle rattled berrigan quickly stepped behind a folding screen that hid a chamberpot and sandman froze the footsteps had seemed to pass on down the passage but the person now trying the handle must have heard the voices and crept back and suddenly the door was pushed open and a girl walked in she was tall slender and her black hair was prettily piled on her head and held in place with long pins with mother of pearl heads her shoes had mother of pearl heels she sported pearl earrings and had a string of pearls strung twice about her elegant swanlike neck but otherwise she was quite naked she took no notice of sandman who had half drawn his pistol but smiled at sally i didnt know you worked here sal im not really working flossie sally said sandman recognised the girl then it was the opera dancer who had called herself sacharissa lasorda and who now turned and stared at sandman and somehow though she was stark naked and he was fully dressed she made him feel out of place she looked him up and down then smiled at sally you got the goodlooking one didnt you but hes taking his time aint he then her eyes widened as berrigan stepped from behind the screen you having a threesome she asked then recognised the sergeant i aint here flossie berrigan growled so close the door when you leave and you aint seen me i thought youd left for higher things didnt work out sam she said closing the door but staying inside the room what happened to spofforth sally asked faked off this morning didnt he she sniffed the bastard and i need the bleeding rhino dont i and this place is always worth a few quid she sat on the bed so what the hell are you doing here she asked berrigan what the hell are you doing he demanded in return we sneak in here for a rest flossie said on account that no one looks in here in summer well just you remember that we aint here berrigan said fiercely we aint here you aint seen us and dont ask us no questions bloody hell flossie gave berrigan a very level look pardon me for bloody breathing and who are you supposed to be with berrigan asked tollemere only hes drunk and snoring she sniffed again and looked at sally you working here no rhinos good flossie said she eased off a shoe and massaged her foot so what happens if i go downstairs and tell them youre here she asked berrigan next time i see you berrigan said you get a thorough bloody kicking sergeant sandman remonstrated though he noticed that flossie seemed remarkably unmoved by the threat she bloody well will get a kicking berrigan said its all bulge and no bang with you sam flossie said grinning we aint going to hurt no one sally said earnestly and were only trying to help someone i wont tell anyone youre here flossie promised why should i so whos here tonight berrigan asked she rattled off a list of names none of which was of interest to sandman for neither the marquess of skavadale nor lord robin holloway were included flossie was certain neither man was in the club i dont mind the marquess she said cos hes a proper gentlemen but lord bleeding robin hes a bastard she pulled her shoe back on yawned and stood up id better go and make sure his lordship aint missing me hell want his supper soon she frowned i dont mind working here she went on the rhinos good its comfortable but i bloody hate sitting down to supper naked makes you feel queer it does all the men dressed bang up and us skinned to nothing she opened the door and shook her head and i always spill the bloody soup you will keep mum flossie berrigan asked anxiously she blew him a kiss for you sam anything she said and was gone for you sam anything sally asked she dont mean nothing berrigan said hastily mister spofforth was right sandman interrupted them right about what sally wanted to know she does have good legs captain sally was shocked ive seen better sergeant berrigan said gallantly and sandman was pleased to see sally blush out of interest sandman asked as he went to the door what does it cost to be a member here he opened the door a crack and peered out but the corridor was empty two thousand to join thats if youre invited and a hundred a year berrigan said the privileges of wealth sandman thought and if the countess of avebury had been blackmailing one of the members or even two or three of the members then would they not kill her to preserve their place in this hedonistic mansion he glanced back at the window it was dark outside now but it was the luminous dark of a summer night in a gaslit town shall we find our coachman he asked berrigan they went back down the servants stairs and crossed the yard the coach still glistened wetly on the cobbles though the buckets were gone horses stamped in the stables as berrigan went to the side door of the carriage house he listened there for a few seconds then raised two fingers to indicate that he thought there were two men on the doors far side sandman pulled the pistol from his coat pocket he decided not to cock it for he did not want the gun to fire accidentally but he checked it was primed then he edged berrigan aside opened the door and walked inside the room was a kitchen tack room and store a pot of water bubbled over a fire and a pair of candles burnt on the mantel and more stood on the table where two men one young and one middleaged sat with tankards of ale and plates of bread cheese and cold beef they turned and stared when sandman came in and the older man opening his mouth in astonishment let his clay pipe drop so that its stem broke on the tables edge sally followed sandman into the room then berrigan came in and closed the door introduce me sandman said he was not pointing the pistol at either man but it was very obvious and the two could not take their eyes from it the youngsters a stable hand berrigan said and hes called billy while the one with the jaw in his lap is mister michael mackeson hes one of the clubs two coachmen wheres percy mack sam mackeson said faintly he was a burly man redfaced with a fine waxed moustache and a shock of black hair that was turning grey at the temples he was dressed well and could doubtless afford to be for good drivers were paid extravagantly sandman had heard of a driver earning over two hundred pounds a year and all of them were considered the possessors of an enviable skill so enviable that every young gentleman wanted to be like them lordlings wore the same caped coats as the professionals and learnt to carry the whip in one hand and the bunched reins in the other and there were so many aristocrats aspiring to be coachmen that no one could be sure whether any particular carriage was driven by a duke or a paid driver now despite his elevated status mackeson just gaped at berrigan who like sandman had a pistol wheres percy berrigan asked again hes taken lord lucy to weybridge mackeson said lets hope youre the one we want berrigan said and youre not going anywhere billy he snapped at the stable hand who was dressed in a shabby set of the seraphim clubs yellow and black livery not unless you want a broken skull the stable hand who had been rising from the bench subsided again sandman was not aware of it but he was angry suddenly it was possible that the moustached coachman might have the answer sandman had been searching for and the notion that he might get this close and still not discover the truth had sparked his rage it was a controlled rage but it was in his voice harsh and clipped and mackeson jumped with alarm when sandman spoke some weeks ago sandman said a coachman from this club collected a maid from the countess of aveburys house in mount street was that you mackeson swallowed but seemed unable to speak was that you sandman asked again louder mackeson nodded very slowly then glanced at berrigan as if he did not believe what was happening to him where did you take her sandman asked mackeson swallowed again then jumped as sandman rapped the pistol on the table where did you take her sandman demanded again mackeson turned from sandman and frowned at berrigan theyll kill you sam berrigan he said kill you stone dead if they find you here then theyd better not find me mack berrigan said the coachman gave another start of alarm when he heard the ratcheting sound of sandmans pistol being cocked his eyes widened as he stared into the muzzle and uttered a pathetic moan im only going to ask you politely once more sandman said and after that mister mackeson i shall nether cross mackeson said hurriedly wheres nether cross fair old ways the coachman said guardedly seven hours eight hours where sandman asked harshly down near the coast sir down kent way so who lives there sandman asked in nether cross lord john de sully pearcetarrant berrigan answered for the coachman the viscount hurstwood earl of keymer baron highbrook lord of this and lord of god knows what else heir to the dukedom of ripon and also known captain as the marquess of skavadale and sandman felt a great surge of relief because he had his answer at last ooooooo the carriage rattled through the streets south of the thames its two lamps were lit but cast a feeble glow that did nothing to light the way so that once they reached the summit of shooters hill where there were few lights and the road across blackheath stretched impenetrably black before them they stopped the horses were unharnessed and picketed on the green and the two prisoners were locked inside the carriage by the simple expedient of fastening the coach doors by looping their handles with the reins that were then strapped tight around the whole vehicle the windows were jammed shut with slivers of wood and either sandman or berrigan would stand guard all night the prisoners were the driver mackeson and billy the stable hand it had been berrigans idea to take the seraphim clubs newly washed carriage sandman had refused at first saying he had already arranged to borrow lord alexanders coach and team and he doubted he had the legal right to commandeer one of the seraphim clubs carriages but berrigan had scoffed at the thought of such scruples you reckon lord alexanders coachman knows the way to nether cross he asked which means youve got to take mackeson anyway so you might as well take a vehicle he knows how to handle and considering what evils the bastards have done i dont suppose god or man will worry about you borrowing their coach and if the coach and driver were taken then billy the stable hand had to be kept from betraying that sandman had been asking about meg so he too must be taken prisoner he put up no resistance but instead helped mackeson harness the team and then with his hands and feet tied he was put into the carriage while mackeson accompanied by berrigan sat up on the box the few members of the club ensconced in their dining room had no idea that their coach was being commandeered now stranded on blackheath sandman and his companions had to wait through the dark hours berrigan took sally to a tavern and paid for a room and he stayed with her while sandman guarded the coach it was not till after the clocks had struck two that berrigan loomed out of the dark quiet night captain quiet enough sandman said then smiled long time since i did picquet duty those two behaving themselves berrigan asked glancing at the carriage quiet as lambs sandman said you can go to sleep berrigan suggested and ill stand sentry in a while sandman said he was sitting on the grass his back against a wheel and he tilted his head to look at the stars that were drifting out from behind ragged clouds remember the spanish night marches he asked the stars were so bright it was as though you could reach up and snuff them out i remember the camp fires berrigan said hills and valleys of fire he twisted and looked west a bit like that sandman turned his head to see london spread beneath them like a quilt of fire that was blurred by the redtouched smoke the air up on the heath was clean and chill yet he could just smell the coal smoke from the great city that spread its hazed lights to the western horizon i do miss spain he admitted it were strange at first berrigan said but i liked it did you speak the language yes berrigan laughed and ill bet you were good at it i was fluent enough yes the sergeant handed sandman a stone bottle brandy he explained and i was thinking he went on that if i go and buy those cigars ill need someone who speaks the language you and me we could go there together work together id like that sandman said theres got to be money in it berrigan said we paid pennies for those cigars in spain and here they cost a fortune if you can get them at all i think youre right sandman said and smiled at the thought that maybe he did have a job after all berrigan and sandman purveyors of fine cigars eleanors father liked a good cigar and paid well for them so well that there might even be enough money in the idea to persuade sir henry that his daughter was not marrying a pauper lady forrest might never be convinced that sandman was a proper husband for eleanor but sandman suspected that eleanor and her father would prevail he and berrigan would need money and who better than sir henry to lend it they would have to travel around spain hire shipping space and rent premises in a fashionable part of london but it could work he was sure of it its a brilliant idea sergeant he said so shall we do it when this is over why not yes he put out his hand and berrigan shook it we old soldiers should stick together berrigan said because we were good we were damned good captain we chased the bloody crapauds halfway across bloody europe and then we came home and none of the bastards here cared did they he paused thinking they had a rule in the seraphim club no one was ever to talk about the wars no one none of the members served sandman guessed not one they wouldnt even let you in if youd been a swoddy or a sailor they were jealous probably sandman drank from the bottle yet they employed you they liked having a guardsman in the hall i made the bastards feel safe and they could order me around which they also liked do this berrigan do that the sergeant grunted thanks when sandman passed him the bottle most of the time it werent nothing bad run errands for the bastards but then once in a while theyd want something else he fell silent and sandman also kept quiet the night was extraordinarily quiet after a time as sandman hoped berrigan began talking again once there was a fellow who was taking one of the seraphim to court so we gave him a lesson they sent a wagonload of flowers to his grave they did and the girls of course we paid them off not the ones like flossie they can look after themselves but the others we gave em ten pounds perhaps twelve what sort of girls common girls captain girls that had caught their eye on the street they were kidnapped they were kidnapped berrigan said kidnapped raped and paid off and all the members did that some were worse than others theres always a handful that are ready for any mischief just like in a company of soldiers and then there are the followers and one or two of them are more sensible thats why i was surprised it was skavadale that scragged the countess he aint a bad one hes got a ramrod up his arse and he thinks he smells of violets but he aint an unkind man i rather hoped it would be lord robin sandman admitted hes just a mad bastard berrigan said bloody rich mad bastard he added but skavadale has more to lose sandman explained lost most of it already berrigan said hes probably the poorest man there his fathers lost a fortune but the son sandman explained is betrothed to a very rich girl perhaps the wealthiest bride in britain i suspect he was ploughing the countess of avebury and she had a nasty habit of blackmail sandman thought for a moment skavadale might be relatively poor but ill bet he could still scratch together a thousand pounds if he had to thats probably the sort of money the countess asked for if she was not to write a letter to the wealthy and religious bride to be so he killed her berrigan asked so he killed her sandman said berrigan thought for a moment so why did they commission her portrait in one way sandman said that had nothing to do with the murder its simply that several of the seraphim had rogered the countess and they wanted her picture as a trophy so poor corday was painting away when skavadale comes to visit we know he came up the back stairs the private way and corday was hurried off when the countess realised one of her lovers had arrived sandman was sure that was how it had happened he imagined the silent awkwardness in the bedroom as corday painted and the countess lounged on the bed and made idle conversation with the maid the charcoal would have scratched on the paper then there would have been the sound of footsteps on the back service stairs and cordays ordeal had begun berrigan drank again then passed the bottle to sandman so the girl meg takes the pixie downstairs he said and throws him out then she goes back upstairs and finds what the countess dead probably or dying and she finds the marquess of skavadale there would the countess have been pleased to see the marquess sandman wondered or was their adulterous tangle already at an end perhaps skavadale had come to plead with her to withdraw her demands and the countess desperate for money had probably laughed at him perhaps she hinted that he would have to pay even more but somehow she drove him into a black rage in which he drew a knife what knife a man like skavadale did not wear a knife but perhaps there had been a knife in the room meg would know perhaps the countess had been eating fruit and had had a paring knife which skavadale seized and plunged into her and afterwards when she lay pale and dying on a bed of blood he had the whimsy to put cordays palette knife into one of her wounds and then or just about then meg had returned or perhaps meg had overheard the fight and was waiting outside the room when skavadale emerged so why didnt he kill meg as well the sergeant asked because meg isnt a threat to him sandman guessed the countess threatened his betrothal to a girl who could probably pay off the mortgages on all his familys estates all of them and the countess would have ended that engagement and theres no greater tragedy to an aristocrat than to lose his money for with his money goes his status they reckon theyre born better than the rest of us but theyre not theyre just a lot richer and they have to stay rich if theyre to keep their illusions of superiority the countess could have put skavadale in the gutter so he hates her and he kills her but he didnt kill the maid because she wasnt a threat berrigan thought about that for a moment so he takes the maid off to one of the mortgaged estates instead that seems to be the size of it sandman said so why is lord robin holloway trying to kill you because im a danger to his friend of course sandman replied forcefully the last thing they want is for the truth to be told so they tried to bribe me and now theyll try to kill me a big bribe it was berrigan said nothing compared to the wealth that skavadales bride will bring him sandman said and the countess put that at risk so she had to die and now corday must die because then everyone will forget the crime aye berrigan allowed but i still dont understand why they didnt just scrag this maid meg if they thought she was a danger they wouldnt let her live perhaps they have killed her sandman said then this is a right waste of time berrigan said gloomily but i dont think theyd have taken meg all the way to nether cross just to kill her sandman said so what are they doing with her maybe theyve given her somewhere to live sandman suggested somewhere comfortable so she doesnt reveal what she knows so now shes the blackmailer i dont know sandman said yet as he thought about it the sergeants notion that meg was now blackmailing skavadale made sense perhaps she is he said and if shes sensible shes not asking too much which is why theyre content to let her live but if she is blackmailing him berrigan suggested then shell hardly tell us the truth will she shes got skavadale strapped down tight dont she shes got the whip on him why should she give all that up to save some bloody pixies life because we shall appeal sandman said to her better nature berrigan laughed sourly ah well then he said its all solved it worked with you sergeant sandman pointed out gently that were sally that were berrigan paused then sounded embarrassed at first you know in the wheatsheaf that night i thought it was you and her alas no sandman said i am well spoken for and sally is all yours sergeant and i think you are a most fortunate man as am i but i am also a tired one he crawled under the carriage bumping his head painfully on the forward axle after waterloo he said i thought id never again sleep in the open the grass was dry under the carriage the springs creaked as one of the prisoners shifted inside the picketed horses stamped and the wind sighed in a nearby stand of trees sandman thought of the hundreds of other nights he had slept under the stars and then just as he decided that sleep would never come in this night it did and he slept chapter eight early next morning sally brought them a basket with bacon hard boiled eggs bread and a stone jar of cold tea a breakfast they shared with the two prisoners mackeson the coachman was phlegmatic about his fate you didnt have much choice did you he said to berrigan you had to keep us quiet but it wont do you no good sam why not you ever seen a lord hang earl ferrers was hanged sandman intervened for murdering his servant no sally said in disbelief they hanged an earl really he went to the scaffold in his own carriage sandman told her wearing his wedding suit bleeding hell she was obviously pleased by this news a lord eh but that were a long time ago mackeson said dismissively a very long time ago his moustache which had been waxed so jauntily when sandman had first seen him was now fallen and straggling so what happens to us he asked gloomily we go to nether cross sandman said we fetch the girl and you take us back to london where i shall write a letter to your employers saying your absence from duties was forced much bleeding good that will do mackeson grumbled youre a jervis mack berrigan said youll get a job the rest of the world could be starving but theres always work for a jervis time to get ready sandman said glancing up at the lightening sky a small mist drifted over the heath as the four horses were watered at a stone trough then led back to the carriage where it took a long time to put on the four sets of bridles belly bands back bands martingales hames traces cruppers driving pads and fillet straps after mackeson and billy had finished harnessing the horses sandman made the younger man strip off his shoes and belt the stable hand had pleaded to be left without bonds on his ankles and wrists and sandman had agreed but without shoes and with his breeches falling round his knees the boy would find it hard to escape sandman and sally sat inside with the embarrassed billy mackeson and berrigan climbed onto the box and then with a jangle and clanging and a lurching roll they bounced over the grass and onto the road they were travelling again they went south and east past hop fields orchards and great estates by midday sandman had unwittingly fallen asleep then woke with a start when the carriage lurched in a rut he blinked then saw that sally had taken the pistol from him and was gazing at a thoroughly cowed billy you can sleep on captain she said im sorry sally he didnt dare try nothing sally said derisively not once i told him who my brother is sandman peered through the window to see they were climbing through a beech wood i thought we might meet him last night he dont like crossing the river sally said so he only works the north and west roads she saw he was properly awake and gave him back his pistol do you think a man can be on the cross and then go straight she asked sandman suspected the question was not about her brother but about berrigan not that the sergeant was exactly in the cross life not as the wheatsheaf understood it but as a servant of the seraphim club he had certainly known his share of crime of course he can sandman said confidently not many do sally averred but not in argument rather she wanted reassurance we all have to make a living sally sandman said and if were honest we none of us want to work too hard thats the appeal of the cross life isnt it your brother can work one night in three and make a living thats jack though isnt it she sounded bleak and rather than meet sandmans eye she gazed through the dusty window at an orchard and maybe your brother will settle down when he meets the right woman sandman suggested a lot of men do that they start off by being rogues but then find honest work and as often as not its after theyve met a woman i cant tell you how many of my soldiers were utter nuisances complete damn fools more use to the enemy than to us and then theyd meet some spanish girl half their weight and within a week theyd be model soldiers she turned to look at him and he smiled at her i dont think youve anything to worry about sally she returned his smile are you a good judge of men captain yes sally i am she laughed then looked at billy close your bleeding trap before you catch flies she said and stop listening to private conversation he blushed and stared at a hedge that crawled past the window they could not change horses and so mackeson was pacing the team which meant they travelled slowly and the journey was made even slower because the road was in bad condition and they had to pull over whenever a horn announced that a stage or mail coach was behind them the mail coaches were the most dramatic their approach heralded by an urgent blast of a horn then the lightly built and highsprung vehicles would fly past in a flurry of hooves rocking like a galloper gun sandman envied their speed and worried about time then told himself it was only saturday and so long as meg really was hiding at nether cross then they should be back in london by sunday evening and that left plenty of time to find lord sidmouth and secure cordays reprieve the home secretary had said he did not want to be disturbed by official business on the lords day but sandman did not give a damn about his lordships prayers sandman would keep the whole government from its devotions if that meant justice in midmorning sandman changed places with berrigan sandman now guarded mackeson and he lifted his coat to let the driver see the pistol but mackeson was cowed and docile he was taking the carriage down ever narrower roads beneath trees heavy with summer leaves so that both he and sandman were constantly ducking beneath boughs they stopped at a ford to let the horses drink and sandman watched the bluegreen dragonflies flitting between the tall rushes then mackeson clicked his tongue and the horses hauled on and the coach splashed through the water and climbed between warm fields where men and women cut the harvest with sickles near midday they stopped close to a tavern and sandman bought ale bread and cheese which they ate and drank as the carriage creaked the last few miles they passed a church that had a lych gate wreathed with bridal flowers and then clopped through a village where men played cricket on the green sandman watched the game as the coach rattled along the greens edge this was rural cricket a long way from the sophistication of the london game these players still used only two stumps and a wide bail and they bowled strictly under arm yet the batsman had a good stance and a better eye and sandman heard the shouts of approbation as the man punished a bad ball by striking it into a duck pond a small boy splashed in to retrieve the ball and then mackeson with a careless skill wheeled the horses between two brick walls and clicked them on past a pair of oast houses and down into a narrow lane that ran steep between thick woods of oak not far now mackeson said youve done well to remember the way sandman said his compliment was genuine because the route had been tortuous and he had wondered whether mackeson was misleading them by trying to get lost in the tangle of small lanes but at the last turn beside the oast houses sandman had seen a fingerpost pointing to nether cross i done this journey a halfdozen times with his lordship mackeson said then hesitated before glancing at sandman so what happens if you dont find the woman we will find her sandman said you brought her here didnt you he added long time back master mackeson said long time back how long seven weeks near enough the coachman said and sandman realised that meg must have been brought down to the country just after the murder and a full month before cordays trial all of seven weeks ago mackeson went on and anything can happen in seven weeks cant it he gave sandman a sly look and maybe his lordships here thatll cool your porridge wont it sandman had fretted that skavadale might indeed be at his estate in nether cross but there had been little point in worrying over much he was either there or not and he would have to be dealt with or not and sandman was far more worried that meg might have vanished perhaps she was dead or perhaps if she was blackmailing skavadale then she was living in country luxury and would not want to abandon her new life what sort of house is it he asked the coachman it aint like their big ones up north mackeson said they got this one through a marriage in the old days thats what i heard comfortable better than anything you or i will ever live in mackeson said then he clicked his tongue and the horses ears twitched back as he flicked the leaders reins and they turned smartly towards a tall pair of gates hung between high flint pillars sandman opened the gates that were latched but not locked then closed them after the carriage had passed he climbed back onto the box and mackeson walked the horses down the long drive that twisted through a deer park and between fine copper beeches until it crossed a small bridge and there amidst the overgrown box hedges of an untended garden lay a small and exquisitely beautiful elizabethan house with black timbers white plasterwork and red brick chimneys cross hall its called mackeson said some marriage portion sandman said jealously for the house looked so perfect under the afternoon sun all mortgaged now mackeson said or thats what they say needs a fortune this place and i need to look after these horses they want water proper feed a rubdown and a good rest all in good time sandman said he was watching the windows but could see no movement in any of them none was open either and that was a bad sign for it was a warm summers day but then he saw there was a smear of smoke coming from one of the tall chimneys at the rear of the house and that restored his optimism the carriage stopped and he dropped down from the box wincing as his weight went onto his damaged ankle berrigan opened the carriage door and kicked down the steps but sandman told him to wait and make sure that mackeson did not simply whip the horses back down the drive sandman limped to the front door and hammered on its old dark panels he had no right to be here he thought he was probably trespassing and he felt in his tail pocket for the letter of authorisation from the home office he had not used it once yet but perhaps it would help him now he knocked on the door again and stepped back to see if anyone was peering from a window ivy grew round the porch and under the leaves above the door he could just see a shield carved into the plasterwork five scallop shells were set into the shield no one showed at any of the windows so he stepped back into the porch and raised his fist to knock again and just then the door was pulled open and a gaunt old man stared at him then looked at the carriage with its badge of the seraphim club we werent expecting any visitors today the man said in evident puzzlement we have come to fetch meg sandman replied on an impulse the man a servant judging by his clothes had plainly recognised the carriage and did not think its presence strange untimely perhaps but not strange and sandman hoped the servant would assume it had been sent by the marquess no one said she was to go anywhere the man was suspicious london sandman said so who be you the man was tall and had a deeply lined face surrounded by unkempt white hair i told you we came to fetch meg sergeant berrigan and i sergeant the man did not recognise the name but sounded alarmed you brought a lawyer hes from the club sandman said feeling the conversation slide into mutual incomprehensibility his lordship said nothing about her going the man said cautiously he wants her in london sandman repeated then ill fetch the lass the man said and then before sandman could react he slammed the door and shot the bolts and did it so quickly that sandman was left gaping he was still staring at the door when he heard a bell ring inside the house and he knew that urgent sound had to be a signal to meg he swore thats a good bloody start berrigan said sarcastically but the woman is here sandman answered as he walked back to the carriage and he says hes fetching her is he sandman shook his head hiding her more like which means weve got to look for her but what do we do with these two he gestured at mackeson shoot the buggers then bury them berrigan growled and was rewarded by two of mackesons fingers in the end they took the carriage round to the stables where they found the stalls and feed racks empty except for a score of broody hens but they also discovered a brickbuilt tack room that had a solid door and no windows and mackeson and the stable boy were imprisoned inside while the horses were left in the yard harnessed to the carriage well deal with them later sandman declared collect some eggs later too berrigan said with a smile for the stable yard had been given over to chickens seemingly hundreds of them some looking down from the roof ridge others on the window ledges and most hunting for grain that had been scattered among the weedstrewn droppingwhite cobbles a cockerel stared sideways at them from the mounting block then twitched his comb and crowed lustily as sandman led berrigan and sally to the back door of cross hall the door was locked every door was locked but the house was no fortress and sandman found a window that was inadequately latched and shook it hard until it came open and he could climb into a small parlour with panelled walls an empty stone fireplace and furniture shrouded in dust sheets berrigan followed stay outside sandman said to sally and she nodded agreement but a moment later clambered through the window there could be a fight sandman warned her im coming in she insisted i hate bloody chickens the girl could have left the house by now berrigan said she could sandman agreed yet his first instinct had been that she would hide somewhere inside and he still thought the same but well search for her anyway he said and opened the door that led into a long panelled passage the house was silent no pictures hung on the walls and no rugs lay on the darkened floorboards that creaked underfoot sandman threw open doors to see dust sheets draped over what little furniture remained a fine staircase with an elaborately carved newel post stood in the hall and sandman glanced into the upstairs gloom as he passed then went on towards the back of the house no one lives here sally said as they discovered yet more empty rooms except the chickens sandman opened a door to see a long dining table draped with sheets lord alexander tells me that his father once completely forgot about a house he owned he told sally it was a big house too it just mouldered away until they remembered they owned it a dozy lot sally said scornfully are you talking about your admirer berrigan asked amused you watch it sam berrigan sally said ive only got to lift my little finger and ill be lady whatsername and youll be bowing and scraping to me ill scrape you girl berrigan said be a pleasure children children sandman chided his companions then turned sharply as a door opened suddenly at the end of the passage the tall gaunt man with the wild white hair stood in the doorway a cudgel in his right hand the girl youre looking for he said is not here he raised the cudgel halfheartedly as sandman approached him then let it drop and shuffled aside sandman pushed past him into a kitchen that had a big black range a dresser and a long table a woman perhaps the gaunt mans wife sat mixing pastry in a large china bowl at the tables head who are you sandman asked the man the steward here the man said then nodded at the woman and my wife is the housekeeper when did the girl leave sandman asked none of your business the woman snapped and youve no business here either youre trespassing so make yourselves scarce before they arrest you sandman noticed a fowling piece above the mantel wholl arrest me he asked weve sent for aid the woman answered defiantly she had white hair pulled hard back into a bun and a harsh face with a hooked nose curving towards a sharp chin a nutcracker face sandman thought and one utterly bereft of any signs of human kindness youve sent for help sandman said but i come from the home secretary from the government i have authority he spoke forcefully and if you want to stay out of trouble i suggest you tell me where the girl is the man looked worriedly at his wife but she was unmoved by sandmans words you aint got no right to be in here mister she said so i suggests you leave before i has you locked up for the night sandman ignored her he opened a scullery door and looked in a larder but meg was not hidden here yet still he was sure she was in the house you finish searching down here sergeant he told berrigan and ill look upstairs you really think shes here berrigan sounded dubious sandman nodded shes here he said with a confidence he could not justify yet he sensed that the steward and his wife were being untruthful the steward at least was fearful his wife was not but the tall man was much too nervous he should have shared his wifes defiance insisting that sandman was trespassing but instead he behaved like a man with something to hide and sandman hurried up the stairs to find it the rooms on the upper floor seemed as deserted and empty as those below but then right at the end of the corridor next to a narrow stairway that climbed to the attics sandman found himself in a large bedroom that was clearly inhabited there were faded oriental rugs on the dark floorboards while the bed a fine four poster with threadbare tapestry hangings had a sheet and rumpled blankets a womans clothes were draped over a chair and more were carelessly heaped on the two seats below the open windows that looked across a lawn to a brick wall beyond which surprisingly close was a church a ginger cat slept on one of the window seats its bed a pile of petticoats megs room sandman thought and he sensed she had only just left he went back to the door and looked down the passage but he saw nothing except dust motes drifting in the shafts of late afternoon sunlight where he had left doors ajar then where the sun struck the uneven floorboards he saw his own footprints in the dust and he walked slowly back down the passage looking into each room again and in the biggest bedroom the one that lay at the head of the fine staircase and had a wide stone fireplace carved with an escutcheon showing six martlets he saw more scuff marks in the dust someone had been in the room recently and their foot prints led to the stone hearth then to the window nearest the fireplace but did not return to the door and the room was empty and the two windows were shut sandman frowned at the marks wondering if he was seeing nothing more than the errant effects of light and shadows but he could have sworn they really were footprints that ended at the window yet when he went over he could not open it because the iron frame had rusted itself shut so meg had not escaped through the window even though her footsteps now obliterated by sandmans own ended there damn it he thought but she was here he lifted the dust sheet from the bed and opened a cupboard but no one was hiding in the room he sat on the end of the bed another four poster and stared into the fireplace where a pair of blackened dogs stood on the stone hearth on a whim he crossed to the fireplace stooped and stared up the chimney but the blackened shaft narrowed swiftly and hid no one yet meg had been in here he was certain of it the sounds of footsteps on the stairs made him stand and put a hand on the pistols hilt but it was berrigan and sally who appeared in the doorway she aint here berrigan said in disgust must be a hundred places to hide in the house sandman said shes run off sally suggested sandman sat on the bed again and stared at the fireplace six martlets on a shield three in the top row two in the second and one underneath and why would the house display that badge inside and five scallop shells on a shield outside five shells he stared at the martlets and then a tune came to him a tune and some halfremembered words that he had last heard sung by a camp fire in spain ill give you one o he said youll what berrigan asked while sally stared at sandman as though he had gone quite mad seven for the seven stars in the sky sandman said six for the six proud walkers five for the symbols at your door berrigan supplied the next line and there are five scallop shells carved over the front door here sandman said softly suddenly aware he could be overheard the songs words were mostly a mystery four for the gospel makers was obvious enough but what the significance of the seven stars was sandman did not know any more than he knew who the six proud walkers were but he did know what five symbols at the door meant he had learnt that years before when he and lord alexander had been at school together and lord alexander had excitedly discovered that when five seashells were set above a door or were displayed on the gable of a house it was a sign that catholics lived within the shells had been placed during the persecutions in elizabeths reign when to be a catholic priest in england meant risking imprisonment torture and death yet some folk could not live without the consolations of their faith and they had marked their houses so that their coreligionists might know a refuge was to be found within yet elizabeths men knew the meaning of the five shells as well as any catholic did so if a priest was in the house there had to be a place where he could be hidden and so the householder would make a priests hole a hiding place so cunningly disguised that it could cheat the protestant searchers for days you look as if youre thinking berrigan said i want kindling sandman said softly kindling firewood a tinder box and see if theres a big cauldron in the kitchen berrigan hesitated wanting to ask what sandman planned then decided he would find out soon enough so he and sally went back downstairs sandman crossed the room and ran his fingers along the joints of the linenfold panelling that covered the walls on either side of the fireplace but so far as he could determine there was no seam in the carvings he knocked on the panels but nothing sounded hollow yet that was the point of priests holes they were almost impossible to detect the window wall and the wall by the passage looked too thin so it had to be the fireplace wall or its opposite where the deep cupboard was yet sandman could discover nothing yet nor did he expect to find it easily elizabeths searchers had been good ruthless and wellrewarded for finding priests yet some hiding places had eluded them despite days of looking weighs a bloody ton berrigan complained as he staggered into the bedroom and dropped an enormous cauldron onto the floor sally was a few steps behind with a bundle of firewood wheres the steward sandman asked sitting in the kitchen looking if hes sucking gunpowder berrigan said his wife gone didnt he want to know what you were doing with that i told him id put a hole in his face if he dared ask berrigan said happily tact sandman said it always works so what are you doing sally asked were going to burn the damn house down sandman said loudly he shifted the cauldron onto the hearths apron no ones using the house he still spoke loudly enough for someone two rooms away to hear him and the roof needs mending cheaper to burn it down than clean it up dont you think he put the kindling in the bottom of the cauldron struck a spark in the tinder box and blew on the charred linen till he had a flame that he transferred to the kindling he nursed the flame for a few seconds then it was crackling and spreading and he put some smaller pieces of firewood on top it took a few minutes before the larger pieces caught the flames but by then the cauldron was belching a thick bluewhite smoke and because the cauldron was on the hearths apron rather than in the fireplace almost none of the smoke was being sucked into the chimney sandman planned to smoke meg out and in case the priests hole opened to the passage he had put berrigan to stand guard outside the bedroom while he and sally stayed inside with the door shut the smoke was choking them so that sally was crouching by the bed but she was reluctant to leave in case the ruse worked sandmans eyes were streaming and his throat was raw but he fed another piece of wood onto the flames and he saw the belly of the cauldron begin to glow a dull red he opened the door a fraction to let some smoke out and fresh air in you want to leave he hissed at sally and she shook her head sandman stooped down to where the smoke was thinner and he thought of meg in the priests hole a space so dark and black and tight and frightening he hoped the smell of burning was already adding to her fears and that the smoke was infiltrating the cunning traps and hatches and secret doors that concealed her ancient hiding place a log crackled split and a puff of smoke shot out of the cauldron on a lance of flame sally had the dust sheet over her mouth and sandman knew they could not last much longer but just then there was a creaking sound a scream and a crash like the impact of a cannon ball and he saw a whole section of the panelling open like a door only it was not by the fireplace but along the outer wall between the windows where he had thought the wall too thin for a priests hole sandman pulled his sleeves over his hands and so protected shoved the cauldron under the chimney as sally snatched the wrist of the screaming terrified woman who had thought herself trapped in a burning house and now tried to extricate herself from the narrow laddered shaft that led down from the dislodged panels its all right its all right sally was saying as she led meg over to the door and sandman his coat scorched and blackened followed the two women onto the wide landing where he gasped cool clean air and stared into megs redrimmed eyes he thought how good an artist charles corday was for the young woman was truly monstrously ugly even malevolent looking and then he laughed because he had found her and with her he would discover the truth and she mistook his laughter as mockery and stepping forward slapped his face hard and just then a gun fired from the hallway sally screamed as sandman pushed her down and out of the way meg sensing escape ran towards the stairs but berrigan tripped her sandman stepped over her as he limped to the balustrade where he saw that it was the sourlooking housekeeper much braver than her husband who had fired the fowling piece up the staircase but like many raw recruits she had shut her eyes when she pulled the trigger and she had fired too high so that the duck shot had whipped over sandmans hair a halfdozen men were behind her one with a musket and sandman slapped down berrigans pistol no shooting he shouted no killing youve no business here the housekeeper screamed up at him she had gone pale for she had not meant to fire the gun but when she had snatched it from her husband and aimed it up the stairway as a threat she had inadvertently jerked the trigger the men behind her were led by a tall fairhaired giant armed with a musket the rest had cudgels and sickles to sandman they looked like the peasants come to burn down the big house whereas in truth they were probably tenants who had come to protect the duke of ripons property we have every right to be here sandman lied he kept his voice calm as he drew out the home secretarys letter which in truth granted him no rights whatsoever we have been asked by the government to investigate a murder he spoke gently as he went slowly down the stairs always keeping his eyes on the man with the gun he was a hugely tall man well muscled and perhaps in his early thirties wearing a grubby white shirt and creamcoloured trousers held up by a strip of green cloth that served as a belt he looked oddly familiar and sandman wondered if he had been a soldier his musket was certainly an old army musket abandoned after napoleons last defeat but it was clean it was cocked and the tall man held it confidently i have here the home secretarys authorisation sandman said brandishing the letter with its impressive seal and we have not come to harm anyone to steal anything or to cause damage we have only come to ask questions youve no rights here the housekeeper screeched quiet woman sandman snapped in his best officers voice what she said was correct absolutely correct but she had lost her temper and sandman suspected that these men would rather listen to a reasonable voice than to an hysterical rant does anyone want to read his lordships letter he asked holding out the paper and knowing that a mention of his lordship would give them pause and by the way he glanced back up the stairs where the smoke was thinning on the landing the house is not on fire and is in no danger now who wants to read his lordships letter but the man holding the musket ignored the paper he frowned at sandman instead and lowered the weapons muzzle are you captain sandman sandman nodded i am he said by god but i saw you knock seventysix runs off us at tunbridge wells the man said and we had pearson and willes bowling to you pearson and willes no less and you knocked em ten ways crazy and halfway upside down he had now uncocked the musket and was beaming at sandman last year it were and i was playing for kent you had us well beat except the rain came and saved us and by the grace of god the big mans name slithered into sandmans mind its mister wainwright isnt it ben wainwright it is sir wainwright who from his clothes must have been playing cricket when he had been summoned to the house pulled his forelock you hit a ball over the haystack i recall sandman said you nearly beat us on your own nothing like you sir nothing like you benjamin wainwright the housekeeper snapped you aint here to you be quiet doris wainwright said lowering the flint of the musket aint no harm in captain sandman the men with him growled their assent it did not matter that sandman was in the house illegally or that he had filled its upper landing with smoke he was a cricketer and a famous one and they were all grinning at him now wanting his approbation i heard youd given the game up sir wainwright sounded worried is that true oh no sandman said its just i only like playing in clean games precious few of them wainwright said but i should have had you on our team today sir taking a fair licking we are from a side from hastings i already had my innings he added explaining his absence from the game therell be other days sandman consoled him but for now i want to take this young lady into the garden and have a conversation with her or maybe theres a tavern where we can talk over an ale he added that because he realised it would be sensible to take meg off the duke of ripons property before someone with a rudimentary legal knowledge accused them of trespass and explained to meg that she did not have to talk with them wainwright assured them that the castle and bell was a fine tavern and the housekeeper disgusted with his treason walked away sandman let out a breath of relief meg he turned to the girl if theres anything you want to take to london fetch it now sergeant sandman could see the girl wanted to protest maybe even hit him again but he gave her no time to argue sergeant make sure the horses are watered perhaps the carriage should be brought to the tavern sally my dear make sure meg has everything she needs and mister wainwright sandman turned and smiled at the kent batsman id take it as an honour if youd show me the tavern dont i recall that you make bats i would like to talk to you about that the confrontation was over meg even though she was bitter was not trying to run away and sandman dared to hope that all would be well one conversation now a dash to london and justice that rarest of all the virtues would be done ooooooo meg was bitter sullen and angry she resented sandmans incursion into her life indeed she seemed to resent life itself and for a time sitting in the back garden of the castle and bell she refused even to talk with him she stared into the distance drank a glass of gin demanded another in a whining voice and then after benjamin wainwright had left to see how his team was faring she insisted that sandman take her back to cross hall my chooks need looking after she snapped your chickens that surprised sandman i always liked hens she said defiantly sandman his cheek still stinging from her slap shook his head in astonishment im not taking you back to the house he growled and youll be damned lucky if youre not transported for life is that what you want a voyage to australia and life in a penal settlement piss on you she retorted she was dressed in a white bonnet and a plain brown serge dress that was spotted with chicken feathers they were ugly clothes yet they suited her for she was truly illfavoured yet also remarkably defiant sandman almost found himself admiring her belligerence but he knew that strength was going to make her difficult to deal with she was watching him with knowing eyes and seemed to read his hesitation for she gave a short mocking laugh and turned away to look at the seraphim clubs carriage all dusty after its journey which had just appeared on the village green berrigan was watering the horses at a duck pond while sally with some of the sergeants coins was buying a jug of ale and another of gin pigeons were making a fuss in a newly harvested wheatfield just beyond the castle and bells hedge while scores of swifts were lining the taverns thatched ridge you liked the countess didnt you sandman said to meg she spat at him just as sally stalked out of the tavern bastards sally said bloody country bastards they dont want to serve a woman ill go sandman offered theres a potman bringing the jugs she said they didnt want to serve me but they changed their minds when i had words with them she flapped a hand at an irritating wasp driving it towards meg who gave a small scream and when the insect would not leave her began to cry with alarm what are you napping your bib for sally demanded and meg uncomprehending just stared at her why are you bleeding crying sally translated youve got no bleeding reason to cry youve been swanning down here while that poor little pixies waiting to be scragged the potman plainly terrified of sally brought a tray of tankards glasses and jugs sandman poured ale into a pint tankard that he gave to sally why dont you take that to the sergeant he said ill talk with meg meaning you want me to fake away off sally said give me a few minutes sandman suggested sally took the ale and sandman offered meg a glass of gin which she snatched from him you were fond of the countess werent you he asked her again ive got nothing to say to you meg said nothing she drained the gin and reached for the jug sandman snatched the jug away from her whats your name none of your business and give me some bloody max she lunged at the jug but sandman held it away from her whats your name sandman asked again and was rewarded with a kick on his shin he poured some of the gin onto the grass and meg immediately went very still and looked wary im taking you to london sandman told her and you have two ways of going there you can behave yourself in which case it will be comfortable or you can go on being rude in which case im taking you to prison you cant do that she sneered i can do what i damn well like sandman snapped astonishing her with his sudden anger i have the home secretarys commission miss and you are concealing evidence in a murder case prison youll be damned lucky if its only prison and not the gallows themselves she glowered at him for a moment then shrugged my names hargood she said in a surly voice margaret hargood sandman poured her another glass of gin where are you from miss hargood nowhere you bloody know what i do know sandman said is that the home secretary instructed me to investigate the murder of the countess of avebury he did that miss hargood because he fears that a great injustice is about to be done the day that viscount sidmouth worried about an injustice to a member of the lower classes sandman reflected was probably the day the sun rose in the west but he could not admit that to the lumpen girl who had just sucked down her second gin as though she were dying of thirst the home secretary believes as i do sandman went on that charles corday never murdered your mistress and we think you can confirm that meg held out her glass but said nothing you were there werent you sandman asked on the day the countess was murdered she jerked the glass demanding more gin but still said nothing and you know sandman went on that charles corday did not commit that murder she looked down at a bruised apple a windfall that lay on the grass a wasp crawled on its wrinkled skin and she screamed dropped the glass and clasped her hands to her face sandman stamped on the wasp crushing the fruit meg he appealed to her i aint got nothing to say she watched the ground fearfully evidently frightened that the wasp might resurrect itself sandman picked up her glass filled it and handed it to her if you cooperate miss hargood he said formally then i shall ensure that nothing harmful happens to you i dont know nothing about it she said nothing about any murder she looked defiantly at sandman her eyes as hard as flint sandman signed do you want an innocent man to die the girl made no answer but just twisted away from him to stare across the hedge and sandman felt a rush of indignation he wanted to hit her and was ashamed of the intensity of that desire so intense that he stood and began to pace up and down why are you in the marquess of skavadales house he demanded and got no reply do you think he went on that the marquess will protect you he wants you there so that the wrong man can hang and once corday is dead then what use will you be to him hell kill you to stop you testifying against him im just astonished he hasnt murdered you already that at least got some reaction from the girl even if it was only to make her turn and stare at him think girl sandman said forcefully why is the marquess keeping you alive why you dont know a bloody thing do you meg said scornfully ill tell you what i know sandman said his anger very close to violence i know that you can save an innocent man from the gallows and i know you dont want to and that makes you an accomplice to murder miss and they can hang you for that sandman waited but she said nothing and he knew he had failed the loss of his temper was a sign of that failure and he was ashamed of himself but if the girl would not talk then corday could not be saved meg just with silence could defeat him and now more troubles niggling and stupid troubles piled upon him he wanted to get meg back to london swiftly but mackeson insisted that the horses were too tired to travel another mile and sandman knew the coachman was right that meant they would have to stay the night in the village and guard their three prisoners guard them feed them and keep an eye on the horses meg was put into the coach and its doors were tied and windows jammed with wedges and she must have slept though twice she woke sandman as she screamed and beat on the windows she finally broke a window and began to clamber out then sandman heard a grunt a stifled cry and heard her slump back what happened he asked nothing that need trouble you berrigan said berrigan sandman and sally slept on the grass guarding mackeson and billy though there was no fight left in either man for they were confused frightened and obedient they reminded sandman of a french colonel his men had taken captive in the galician mountains a bombastic man who had whined and complained about the conditions of his captivity until in exasperation sandmans own colonel had simply freed the man bugger off he had told him in french youre free and the frenchman so terrified of the spanish peasants had begged to be taken captive again mackeson and billy could have walked away from their tired captors but both were too scared of the strange village and the sheer darkness of the night and the daunting prospect of finding their own way back to london so what happens now berrigan asked sandman in the short summer night we take her to the home secretary sandman said bleakly and let him pick over her bones it would do no good he thought but what choice did he have somewhere a dog barked in the darkness and then as berrigan kept watch sandman slept chapter nine it was just after dawn when the main door of newgate prison was eased open and the first pieces of the scaffold were carried out into old bailey the fence that surrounded the finished scaffold was fetched out first and part of it was placed halfway across the street to divert what small traffic went between ludgate hill and newgate street this early on a sunday william brown the keeper of newgate came to the main door where he yawned scratched his bald head lit a pipe then stepped aside as the heavy beams that formed the framework of the scaffolds platform were carried out its going to be a lovely day mister pickering he remarked to the foreman be a hot one sir plenty of ale over the street god be thanked for that sir pickering said then turned and stared up at the prisons façade there was a window just above the debtors door and he nodded at it i was thinking sir we could save ourselves a deal of trouble by putting a platform under that window build it there for all time see and put a hinged trap there and a beam over the top and we wouldnt needs to make a scaffold every time the keeper turned and stared upwards youre talking yourself out of a job mister pickering id rather have my sundays at home sir with mrs pickering and if you had a platform up there sir it wouldnt obstruct the traffic and it would give the crowd a better view too good a view maybe the keeper suggested im not sure the crowd ought to see the death struggles the present scaffold with its screened flanks meant that only the folk who rented the upper rooms immediately opposite the prison could see down into the pit where the hanged men and women choked to death they see them struggle at horsemonger lane pickering pointed out and folk appreciate seeing them die proper thats why they liked tyburn you got a proper view at tyburn in the old century the condemned were taken by cart from newgate to the wide spaces at tyburn where a permanent scaffold of three long beams had stood with embanked seating all around it it had been a twohour journey punctuated by stops where the tavern crowds obstructed the roads and the authorities had detested the carnival atmosphere that always accompanied a tyburn hanging and for that reason and in the belief that executions outside newgate would be more dignified they had demolished the old triangular scaffold and with it eliminated the rowdy journey i saw the last hanging at tyburn pickering said i was just seven i was and ive never forgotten it its supposed to be memorable the keeper said else it wont deter will it so why hide the death throes i do believe youre right mister pickering and i shall pass on your suggestion to the court of aldermen kind of you sir kind of you pickering knuckled his forehead so its a busy day tomorrow is it sir just the two the keeper said but one of them is the painter corday remember him he was the fellow who stabbed the countess of avebury he sighed bound to attract a fair crowd and the weather will encourage them sir that it will the keeper agreed that it will if it stays fine he stepped aside as one of his wifes kitchen servants hurried down the steps with a tall china jug to meet a milkgirl carrying two lidded pails on a shoulder yoke smell it betty he called after her smell it we had some sour last week the platforms frame was slotted and pegged into place while the cladding for the sides and the black baize that swathed the whole scaffold were piled on the pavement the keeper tapped out his pipe against the doors black knocker then went inside to change for morning service old bailey had little traffic though a few idlers vacantly watched the growing scaffold and a halfdozen choirboys hurrying towards saint sepulchres stopped to gape as the heavy hanging beam with its dark metal hooks was carried from the prison a waiter from the magpie and stump brought a tray of ale pots to the workmen a gift from the taverns landlord who would keep the dozen men well supplied all day it was traditional to provide the scaffold makers with free ale and profitable for the presence of the gallows would mean a glut of customers next morning in wapping to the east a chandler unlocked his back door to a single customer his shop was closed for it was sunday but this customer was special it looks like being a fine day tomorrow jemmy the chandler said itll bring out the crowd mister botting agreed edging into the shop past hanging swathes of ropes and deadeyes and i do like a crowd a skilled man should have an appreciative audience the chandler said leading his guest to a table where two twelvefoot lengths of hemp rope had been laid ready for bottings inspection one inch rope jemmy oiled and boiled the chandler said very nice leonard very nice botting lowered his face and sniffed the ropes like to guess where theyre from the chandler asked he was proud of the two ropes that he had boiled clean then massaged with linseed oil so that they were pliable afterwards he had lovingly fashioned two nooses and spliced an eye in each bitter end looks like bridport hemp botting said though he knew it was not he just said it to please the chandler and the chandler chuckled with delight baint be a man alive that can tell that aint bridport hemp jemmy but it aint its sisal it is hawser laid sisal no botting his face grimacing from its nervous tic stooped for a closer look at the rope he was instructed to buy only the best new bridport hemp and his bill to the court of aldermen would indeed demand repayment for two such expensive ropes but it had always offended him to waste good rope on gallows scum it came out of the halliard barrel of a newcastle collier the chandler said west african shoddy at a guess but boil it oil it and give it a light coat of boot blacking and no man could tell eh a hog apiece to you jemmy a fair price botting agreed he would pay two shillings and indent nine shillings and ninepence for the two ropes then slice them after they had served their purpose and sell off the pieces for whatever the market would bear neither of the men to be hanged was truly notorious but curiosity about the countess of aveburys murderer might drive the price of cordays rope up to sixpence an inch there would be a fat profit anyway he tested that the noose of one rope would tighten then nodded in satisfaction and ill be wanting some strapping cord he went on four lengths ive a butt of swedish lanyard all ready for you jemmy the chandler said so youre still lashing their hands and elbows yourself are you not for long botting said thank you this last was because the chandler had poured two tin mugs of brandy they had a pair of aldermen at the last swinging botting went on pretending they was just there for the entertainment but i knows better and mister logan was one of them and hes a good enough fellow he knows whats necessary mind you the other one wished hed stayed away emptied his belly he did couldnt stand the sight he chuckled but mister logan tipped me the wink afterwards and said theyll give me an assistant a man needs an assistant he does he does jemmy botting drained the brandy then collected his ropes and followed the chandler to a barrel where the lanyard cording was kept nice easy job in the morning he said just two to top maybe ill see you there like as not jemmy well have an ale afterwards botting said and a chop for dinner he left ten minutes later the ropes and cords safe in his bag he just had to fetch the two cotton bags from a seamstress then he would be ready he was englands hangman and in the next days dawn he would do his work ooooooo sandman was in a vile mood that sunday morning he had hardly slept his temper was frayed and taut and megs whining only made his bad temper worse berrigan and sally were hardly more cheerful but had the sense to keep silent while meg complained about being forced to london then started screeching in protest when sandman savaged her with accusations of selfishness and stupidity billy the stable hand was left behind in the village he could hardly get back to london ahead of the coach and so he could not warn the seraphim club of what was happening and thus it was safe to abandon him but how do i get home he enquired plaintively you do what the rest of us did from lisbon to toulouse sandman snapped you walk the horses were ragged and tired they had cropped the grass on the village green shying away from the intrusive geese that resented their presence but the animals were used to oats and corn not thin grass and they were sluggish in the harness though they responded briskly enough to mackesons whip and by the time the sun had climbed above the eastern trees they were going northwards at a fair clip church bells jangled a summer sky where high white clouds sailed westwards you a churchgoer captain berrigan asked judging that their progress would have improved sandmans mood of course sandman was sharing the box with berrigan and mackeson leaving the carriages interior for sally and meg it had been sallys idea to share the coach with meg she dont frighten me sally had said and besides maybe shell talk to another girl i aint a church sort of man berrigan said aint got time for it but i do like to hear the bells all about them concealed by the leafy kent woods the church towers and spires rang the changes a dog cart clipped past them loaded with children in their sunday best and all carrying their prayer books to morning service the children waved the bells went silent as the services began the carriage came to a village its main street deserted they clopped past the church and sandman heard a cellist accompanying the old hymn awake my soul and with the sun thy daily stage of duty run they had sung it he remembered on the morning of the battle at salamanca the mens voices hard and low beneath a sun climbing into a sky that became pitiless with heat on a day of burning death mackeson stopped the team in a ford on the other side of the village and as the horses drank sandman folded down the steps to let sally and meg stretch their legs he looked quizzically at sally who shook her head stubborn she murmured to sandman meg came down and glared at sandman then bent to scoop water into her mouth afterwards she sat on the bank and just watched the dragonflies ill kill you she said to sandman if the foxes have eaten my chooks you care more about your hens than the life of an innocent man let him bloody hang meg said she had lost her bonnet and her hair was lank and tousled youre going to have to talk to other men in london sandman said and they wont be gentle the girl said nothing sandman sighed i know what happened he said you were in the room where corday was painting the countess and someone came up the back stairs so you took corday down the front stairs didnt you you left his painting and his brushes in the countesss bedroom and you hurried him out to the street because one of the countesss lovers had arrived and i know who it was it was the marquess of skavadale meg frowned looked as if she was about to say something then just stared away into the distance and the marquess of skavadale sandman went on is engaged to marry a very rich heiress and he needs that marriage because his family is short of money desperately short but the girl wont marry him if she knows he was having a liaison with the countess and the countess was blackmailing him she made money that way didnt she did she meg asked tonelessly you were her procuress werent you meg turned her small bitter eyes on sandman i was her protector culley and she needed one too good for her own good she was but you didnt protect her did you sandman said harshly and the marquess killed her and you discovered that did you find him there maybe you heard the murder perhaps you saw it so he hid you away and he promised you money but one day meg hell be tired of paying you and hes only keeping you alive until corday is hanged for after that no one will believe anyone else was guilty meg half smiled why didnt he kill me there and then eh she stared defiantly at sandman if he killed the countess why wouldnt he kill the maid tell me that go on sandman could not it was indeed the one thing he could not explain though everything else made sense and he believed that in time even that mystery would unravel perhaps he likes you he suggested meg stared at him incredulously for a few seconds then gave a short bark of raucous laughter the likes of him she asked liking me no she brushed an insect off her skirt he let me look after the chooks thats all i like chooks ive always liked chooks captain berrigan sitting up on the coachs box was staring north captain he called again sandman stood and walked to the carriage and stared northwards across some fields and up a low thickly wooded hill and there on the crest where the london road crossed the skyline and made a gash in the trees was a group of horsemen theyve been looking down here berrigan said like they was dragoons and they was trying to work out how many redcoats they could see sandman had no telescope and the horsemen were too far away to see clearly there were six or seven of them and sandman had the impression no more that they were gazing towards the coach and that at least one of them had a telescope could be anyone he said could be berrigan agreed only lord robin holloway likes to wear a white riding coat and hes got a great black horse the man at the centre of the group had a white coat and was mounted on a big black horse damn sandman said mildly had flossie talked in the seraphim club had she revealed that sandman had trespassed there in which case they would surely have connected him with the missing carriage and then started to worry about meg in kent and then they would send a rescue party to make sure that sandman did not bring the girl to london and even as he thought that so he saw the group of horsemen spur forward and disappear into the trees whip em on he told mackeson sergeant get meg into the carriage hurry how long before the horsemen arrived ten minutes probably less sandman thought of turning the coach and going back to the village where there had been a crossroads but there was no room to turn the vehicle and so when meg was safely bundled aboard mackeson urged the horses on and sandman told him to take the first turning off the road any lane or farm track would do but perversely there was none and as the coach lurched on sandman expected to see the horsemen appear at any second he stared ahead watching for the dust to show above the trees at least the countryside was heavily wooded here which meant that the coach would be hidden almost until they encountered the riders and then just as sandman was despairing of ever finding an escape route a narrow lane fell off to the right and he ordered mackeson to take it rough old road that mackeson warned him just take it the vehicle swung into the lane narrowly missing the gnarled bole of an oak tree as it negotiated the sharp bend i hope this goes somewhere mackeson sounded amused or else were stuck to buggery the coach lurched and swayed alarmingly for the lane was nothing but deep old cart ruts that had solidified in the dry mud but it ran between thick hedges and wide orchards and every yard took them farther from the london road sandman made mackeson stop after a couple of hundred yards and then stood on the carriage roof and stared back but he could see no horsemen on the road had he let his fears make him too cautious then meg screamed screamed again and sandman scrambling down off the roof heard a slap the scream stopped and he jumped down to the road berrigan dropped the unbroken window only a bleeding wasp he said flicking the dead insect into the hedge youd think it was a bleeding crocodile the fuss she bleeding makes i thought she was murdering you sandman said then he started to climb back up onto the coach only to be checked by berrigans raised hand he stopped listened and heard the sound of hoofbeats the sound passed the group of horsemen was on the main road but they were not coming down this narrow lane sandman touched the hilt of the pistol stuck into his belt and he remembered a day up in the pyrenees when with a small forage party he had been hunted by a score of dragoons he had lost three men that day all cut down by the straight french swords and he had only escaped because a greenjacket officer had chanced by with a dozen men who had used their rifles to drive the horsemen away there was no chance of a friendly rifle officer today would the horsemen search the lane the hoofbeats had faded but sandman was reluctant to order the coach on for the vehicle was noisy but he reflected that megs scream had been noisier still and that had brought no pursuers so he hauled himself up to the box and nodded to mackeson gently now he said just ease her on cant do nothing else mackeson said nodding ahead to where the lane bent sharply to the left ill have to take her on the verge captain and its a tight turn just go slowly sandman stood and looked back but no horsemen were in sight so what are we going to do mackeson asked therell be a farm down here somewhere sandman said and if the worst comes to the worst well unhitch the horses manhandle the coach round and harness up again she aint a vehicle built for rough roads mackeson said reprovingly but he clicked his tongue and gave an almost imperceptible tremor to the reins the lane was narrow and the turn was excruciatingly tight but the horses took it slowly the carriage lurched as the wheels mounted the verge and the horses sensing the resistance slackened their pull so that mackeson cracked the whip above their heads and twitched the reins again and just then the leading left wheel slid down a bank obscured by grass and dock leaves and the whole carriage tilted and mackeson flailed for balance as sandman gripped the handrail on the roof the horses neighed in protest meg screamed in alarm then the spokes of the wheel taking the weight of the whole carriage in the hidden ditch snapped one after the other and inevitably the wheel rim shattered and the coach lurched hard down mackeson had somehow managed to stay on his seat i told you she aint built for the country he said resentfully its a town vehicle it aint any kind of bloody vehicle now berrigan said he had scrambled out of the canted passenger compartment and helped the two women down to the road now what will you do mackeson demanded of sandman sandman teetered on the top of the coach he was watching the road behind and listening the wheel had broken loudly and the body of the carriage had thumped noisily onto the ditchs bank and he thought he could hear hoofbeats again he drew the pistol everyone he snapped be quiet now he was sure he could hear the hooves and he was certain the sound was getting closer he cocked the pistol jumped down to the road and waited ooooooo the reverend horace cotton ordinary of newgate seemed to crouch in his pulpit eyes closed as though he gathered all his forces physical and mental for some supreme effort he took a breath clenched his fists then gave an anguished cry that echoed from the high beams of the newgate chapel fire he wailed fire and pain and flames and agony all the bestial torments of the devil await you fire everlasting and pain unimaginable and unassuaged weeping and the gnashing of teeth and when the pain will seem to you to be unbearable when it will seem that no soul not even one as rotten as yours can endure such inflictions for a moment longer then you will learn that it is but the beginning he let that last word ring about the chapel for a few seconds then lowered his voice to a tone of sweet reason that was scarce above a whisper it is but the beginning of your anguish it is but the commencement of your punishment which will torment you through eternity even as the stars die and new firmaments are born so you will scream in the fire which will rend your flesh like the tearing of a hook and like the searing of a brand he leant from the pulpit his eyes wide and stared down into the black pew where the two condemned men sat beside the blackpainted coffin you will be the playthings of demons he promised them racked and burnt and beaten and torn it will be pain without end agony without surcease torment without mercy the silence in the chapel was broken by the sound of mallets erecting the scaffold beyond the high windows and by charles cordays weeping the reverend cotton straightened pleased that he had broken one of the wretches he looked at the pews where the other prisoners sat some waiting for their own turn in the black pew and others biding their time before they were taken to the ships that would carry them to australia and oblivion he looked higher up at the public gallery crowded as it ever was on the day before a hanging the worshippers in that gallery paid for the privilege of watching condemned felons listen to their burial service it was a warm day and earlier in the service some of the women in the gallery had tried to cool themselves with fans but no painted cardboard fluttered now everyone was still everyone was silent everyone was caught up in the terrible words that the ordinary span like a web of doom above the heads of the two condemned men it is not i who promises you this fate the reverend cotton said in warning it is not i who foresees your souls torment but god god has promised you this fate through all eternity when the saints are gathered beside the crystal river to sing gods praises you will scream in pain charles corday sobbed his thin shoulders heaving and his head lowered his leg irons joined to an iron band about his waist chinked slightly as he shuddered with each sob the keeper in his own family pew just behind the black pew frowned he was not sure these famous sermons were of much help in keeping order within the prison for they reduced men and women to quivering terror or else prompted an impious defiance the keeper would have much preferred a quiet and dignified service mumbled and sedate but london expected the ordinary to put on a display and cotton knew how to live up to those expectations tomorrow cotton thundered you will be taken out to the street and you will look up and see gods bright sky for the very last time and then the hood will be placed over your eyes and the noose will be looped about your necks and you will hear the great beating of the devils wings as he hovers in waiting for your soul save me lord you will cry save me he fluttered his hands towards the ceiling beams as if signalling to god but it will be too late too late your sins your wilful sins your own wickednesses will have brought you to that dread scaffold where you will fall to the ropes end and there you will choke and you will twitch and you will struggle for breath and the struggle will avail you nothing and the pain will fill you and then the darkness will come and your souls will rise from this earthly pain to the great seat of judgement where god awaits you god cotton raised his plump hands again this time in supplication as he repeated the word god god will be waiting for you in all his mercy and majesty and he will examine you he will judge you and he will find you wanting tomorrow yes tomorrow he pointed at corday who still had his head lowered you will see god the two of you as clearly as i see you now will see the dread god the father of us all and he will shake his head in disappointment and he will command that you be taken from his presence for you have sinned you have offended him who has never offended us you have betrayed your maker who sent his only begotten son to be our salvation and you will be taken from before his great throne of mercy and you will be cast down into the uttermost depths of hell into the flames into the fire into the everlasting pain he drew the sounds out into a quavering moan and then when he heard a gasp from a frightened woman in the public gallery he repeated the phrase into the everlasting pain he shrieked the last word paused so that the whole chapel could hear the woman sobbing in the gallery then leant towards the black pew and dropped his voice into a hoarse whisper and you will suffer oh how you will suffer and your suffering your torment will commence tomorrow his eyes widened as his voice rose think of it tomorrow when we who are left on this earth are having our breakfast you will be in agony when the rest of us are closing our eyes and clasping our prayerful hands to say a grace of thanks to a benevolent god for providing us with our porridge with our bacon and eggs with toast and chops with braised liver or even and here the reverend cotton smiled for he liked to introduce homely touches into his sermons perhaps even a dish of devilled kidneys at that very moment you will be screaming with the first dreadful pains of eternity and through all eternity those torments will become ever more dreadful ever more agonising and ever more terrible there will be no end to your pains and their beginning is tomorrow he was leaning out from the canopied pulpit now leaning so that his voice fell like a spear into the black pew tomorrow you will meet the devil you will meet him face to face and i shall weep for you i shall tremble for you yet above all i shall thank my lord and saviour jesus christ that i shall be spared your pain and that instead i shall be given a crown of righteousness for i have been saved he straightened and clutched his hands to his chest i have been saved redeemed i have been washed in the blood of the lamb and i have been blessed by the grace of him who alone can take away our pain the reverend horace cotton paused he was fortyfive minutes into the sermon and had as long again to go he took a sip of water as he stared down at the two prisoners one was weeping and the other was resisting so he would try harder he took a breath summoned his powers and preached on ooooooo no horsemen came down the lane the sound of their hooves sounded loud on the london road for a while then they faded and at last vanished in the heat of the day somewhere very far off church bells began ringing the changes after matins so what are you going to do mackeson asked again this time with an undisguised note of triumph he sensed that the wreck of the coach had ruined sandmans chances and his pleasure in that gave him a kind of revenge for the humiliations that had been heaped on him over the last day and two nights what im going to do sandman retorted is none of your damn business but what youre going to do is stay here with the carriage sergeant cut the horses out of the traces i cant stay here mackeson protested then start bloody walking sandman snarled then turned on meg and sally you two are riding bareback he said i cant ride meg protested then youll bloody well walk to london sandman said his temper slipping dangerously and ill make damn sure you do he snatched the whip from mackeson shell ride captain sally said laconically and sure enough when the team was cut from the traces meg obediently scrambled up the unfolded carriage steps to sit on a horses broad back with her legs dangling down one flank and with her hands gripping the fillet strap that ran along the mares spine she looked terrified while sally even without a saddle appeared graceful what now berrigan asked main road sandman said and he and the sergeant led all four horses back along the lane it was a risk using the london road but the horsemen if they were indeed looking for the missing carriage had taken their search southwards sandman walked cautiously but they met no one until they came to a village where a dog chased after the horses and meg screamed for fear when her mare skittered sideways a woman came out of a cottage and slapped at the dog with a broom a milestone just beyond the village said that london was fortytwo miles away a long day ahead berrigan said day and night sandman said gloomily i aint staying up here all day and night meg complained youll do as youre told sandman said but at the next village meg began to scream that she had been snatched from her home and a small indignant crowd followed the plodding horses until the village rector a napkin tucked into his neck because he had been plucked from his dinner table came to investigate the noise shes mad sandman told the priest mad the rector looked up at meg and shuddered at the malevolence in her face ive been kidnapped she screamed were taking her to london sandman explained to see the doctors theyre stealing me meg shouted shes got bats in her belfry sally said helpfully ive done nothing meg shouted then she dropped to the ground and tried to run away but sandman ran after her tripped her and then knelt beside her ill break your bloody neck girl he hissed at her the rector a plump man with a shock of white hair tried to pull sandman away id like to talk with the girl he said i insist on talking to her read this first sandman said remembering the home secretarys letter and handing it to the rector meg sensing trouble in the letter tried to snatch it away and the rector impressed by the home office seal stepped away from her to read the crumpled paper but if shes mad he said to sandman when he had finished reading why is viscount sidmouth involved im not mad meg protested in truth sandman spoke to the rector in a low voice shes wanted for a murder but i dont want to frighten your parishioners better for them to think that shes ill yes quite right quite right the priest looked alarmed and thrust the letter back at sandman as though it were contagious but maybe you should tie her hands you hear that sandman turned on meg he says i should tie your hands and i will if you make more noise she recognised defeat and began to swear viciously which only made the rector believe sandmans claim he began using his napkin like a flyswatter to drive his parishioners away from the cursing girl who seeing that her bid for freedom had failed and fearing that sandman would pinion her if she did not cooperate used a stone watering trough as a mounting block to get back onto her horse she was still swearing as they left the village they trudged on they were all tired all irritable and the heat and the long road sapped sandmans strength his clothes felt sticky and filthy and he could feel a blister growing on his right heel he was still limping because of the damage he had done to his ankle jumping onto the stage of the covent garden theatre but like all infantryman he believed the best way to cure a sprain was to walk it out even so it had been a long time since he had walked this far sally encouraged him to ride but he wanted to keep a spare horse fresh and so he shook his head and then fell into the mindless trudge of the soldiers march scarce noticing the landscape as his thoughts skittered back to the long dusty roads of spain and the scuff of his companys boots and the wheat growing on the verges where the seeds had fallen from the commissary carts even then he had rarely ridden his horse preferring to keep the animal fresh what happens when we get to london berrigan broke the silence after they had passed through yet another village sandman blinked as though he had just woken up the sun was sinking he saw and the church bells were calling for evensong meg is going to tell the truth he answered after a while she snorted in derision and sandman held his temper in check meg he said gently you want to go back to the marquesss house is that it you want to go back to your chickens you know i do she said then you can he said but first youre going to tell part of the truth part of sally asked intrigued part of the truth sandman insisted he had without realising it been thinking about his dilemma and suddenly the answer seemed clear he had not been hired to discover the countesss murderer but rather to determine whether or not corday was guilty so that was all he would tell the home secretary it doesnt matter he told meg who killed the countess all that matters is that you know corday did not you took him out of her bedroom while she was still alive and thats all i want you to tell the home secretary she just stared at him that is the truth isnt it sandman asked she still said nothing and he sighed meg you can go back to the marquesss house you can do whatever you want with the rest of your life but first you have to tell that one small part of the truth you know corday is innocent dont you and at last at long last she nodded i saw him out the street door she said softly and the countess was still alive of course she was meg said she told him to come back the next afternoon but by then he was arrested and youll tell that to the home secretary she hesitated then nodded ill tell him that she said and thats all ill tell him thank you sandman said a milestone told him that charing cross lay eighteen miles ahead the citys smoke filled the sky like a brown fog while to his right glimpsed through the folds of darkening hills the shining thames lay flat as a blade sandmans tiredness vanished part of the truth he thought would be enough and his job thank god would be done ooooooo jemmy botting hangman of england came to old bailey in the early evening to inspect the finished scaffold one or two passers by recognising him called out ironic greetings but botting ignored them he had little to inspect he took it on trust that the beams were properly bolted together the planks nailed down and the baize properly secured the platform did sway a little but it always had and the motion was no worse than being on the deck of a ship in a very slight swell he pulled the peg that held the trapdoors support beam in place then went down below into the gloom beneath the platform where he seized the rope that tugged the beam free it gave way with a judder then the trapdoor swung down to let in a wash of evening sunlight botting did not like that judder no one had been standing on the trapdoor yet still the beam had been reluctant to move so he opened his bag and took out a small jar of tallow that had been a gift from the chandler he climbed the wooden framework and greased the beam until its surface felt slippery then he raised the trapdoor and clumsily pushed the beam back into place two rats watched him and he growled at them he clambered down to the old baileys cobbles and pulled the rope again and this time the beam slid easily and the trapdoor thumped down to bang against two of the upright supports bloody works eh botting said to the rats that were quite unafraid of his presence he replaced the trapdoor and beam put the tallow back in his bag and climbed to the top of the scaffold where he first replaced the locking peg then gingerly tested the firmness of the trapdoor by putting one foot on its planks and slowly easing his weight onto that leg he knew it was secure knew it would not give way beneath him yet still he tested it he did not want to become londons laughing stock by pushing a prisoner onto a trap that gave way before the rope was round the mans neck he grinned at the thought then confident that all was ready he went to the debtors door and knocked loudly he would be given dinner in the prison then provided with a small bedroom above the lodge got any rat poison he asked the turnkey who opened the door only theres rats the size of bleeding foxes under the scaffold that platform cant have been up more than two hours yet theres already rats there rats everywhere the turnkey said then locked the door beneath them even though it was a warm evening the cellars of newgate prison held a chill and so before charles corday and the other condemned man were put into the death cell a coal fire was lit in the small hearth the chimney did not draw well at first and the cell filled with smoke but then the flue heated and the air cleared though the stench of coal smoke stayed a metal chamber pot was put in a corner of the cell though no screen was provided for privacy two iron cots with straw palliasses and thin blankets were put by the wall and a table and chairs were provided for the turnkeys who would watch the prisoners through the night lamps were hung from iron hooks at dusk the two men who would die in the morning were brought to the cell and given a meal of pease pottage pork chops and boiled cabbage the keeper came to see them during their supper and he thought as he waited for them to finish their meal that the two men were so utterly dissimilar charles corday was slight pale and nervous while reginald venables was a hulking brute with a lavish dark beard and a grimly hard face yet it was corday who had committed murder while venables was being hanged for the theft of a watch corday merely picked at his food then his leg irons clanking went to his cot where he lay down and gazed wideeyed at the damp stones of the vaulted ceiling tomorrow the keeper began as venables finished his meal i hope that damn preacher wont be there venables interrupted silence while the keepers talking the senior turnkey growled the preacher will be there the keeper said to offer what spiritual comfort he can he waited as the turnkey removed the spoons from the table tomorrow he started again you will be taken from here to the association room where your irons will be struck and your arms pinioned you will already have been given breakfast but there will be brandy for you in the association room and i advise you to drink it after that we walk to the street he paused venables watched him with a resentful eye while corday seemed oblivious it is customary the keeper went on to slip the hangman a coin because he can make your passage to the next world less painful such an emolument is not something of which i can approve but he is an officer of the city not of the jail and so i can do nothing to end the practice but even without such an emolument you will find that your punishment is not painful and is soon done bloody liar venables snarled silence its all right mister carlisle the keeper said to the offended turnkey some men he continued go unwilling to the scaffold and attempt to hinder the necessary work they do not succeed if you resist if you struggle if you try to inconvenience us then you will still be hanged but you will be hanged painfully it is best to cooperate it is easier for you and easier for your loved ones who might be watching easier for you you mean venables observed no duties are easy the keeper said sanctimoniously not if they are done with proper assiduity he moved to the door the turnkeys will stay here all night if you require spiritual comfort then they can summon the ordinary i wish you a good night corday spoke for the first time im innocent he said his voice close to breaking yes the keeper said embarrassed yes indeed he found he had nothing more to say on the subject so he just nodded to the turnkeys good night gentlemen good night sir mister carlisle the senior turnkey responded then stood to attention until the keepers footsteps had faded down the passage then he relaxed and turned to look at the two prisoners you want spiritual bloody comfort he growled then you dont disturb me and you dont disturb the reverend cotton but you get down on your bloody knees and disturb him up there by asking him for bloody forgiveness right george he turned to his companion spades are trumps is that right in the birdcage walk which was the underground passage that led from the prison to the courtrooms of the session house two felons were working with pickaxes and spades lanterns had been hung from the passage ceiling and the flagstones great slabs of granite had been pried up and stacked to one side a stench now filled the passageway a noxious stink of gas lime and rotted flesh christ one of the felons said recoiling from the smell you wont find him down there a turnkey said backing away from the space that had been cleared of its flagstones when the birdcage walk had been built the paving slabs had been laid direct on the london clay but this clay had a mottled dark look in the uncertain light of the guttering lanterns when was this bit of the passage last used one of the prisoners asked got to be two years ago the turnkey said but sounded dubious at least two years two years the prisoner said scornfully theyre still bloody breathing down there just get it over with tom the turnkey encouraged him then you get this he held up a bottle of brandy god bloody help us tom said gloomily then took a deep breath and struck down with his spade he and his companion were digging the graves for the two men who would be executed in the morning some of the bodies were taken for dissection but hungry as the anatomists were for bodies they could not take them all and so most were brought here and put into unmarked graves although the passage was short and the prison buried the corpses in quicklime to hasten their decomposition and though they dug up the floor in a strict rotation so that no part of it was excavated too soon after a burial still the picks and spades struck down into bones and rotting deliquescent clay the whole floor was buckled looking as though it had been deformed by an earthquake but in truth it was merely the flagstones settling as the bodies decomposed beneath yet though the passage stank and the clay was choked with unrotted flesh still more corpses were brought and thrust down into the filth tom ankledeep in the hole brought out a yellow skull that he rolled down the passageway he looks in the pink dont he he said and the two turnkeys and the second prisoner began to laugh and somehow could not stop mister botting ate lamb chops boiled potatoes and turnips the keepers kitchen provided a syrup pudding to follow then a tin mug of strong tea and a beaker of brandy afterwards mister botting slept two watchmen stood guard on the scaffold just after midnight the skies clouded over and a brief shower blew chill from ludgate hill a handful of folk eager for the best positions by the railings that fenced off the gallows were sleeping on the cobbles and were woken by the rain they grumbled shrugged deeper into their blankets and tried to sleep again dawn came early the clouds shredded leaving a pearlwhite sky laced with the frayed brown streaks of coal smoke london stirred and in newgate there would be devilled kidneys for breakfast chapter ten sallys horse a gelding had fallen lame just after sundays nightfall then berrigans right boot had lost its sole so they tied the gelding to a tree berrigan scrambled onto the back of the third horse and sandman whose boots were just holding together led the two girls horses if we dont return all the horses to the seraphim club sandman remarked worrying about the beast they had simply abandoned they could accuse us of horse thieving they could hang us for that berrigan retorted then grinned but i wouldnt worry about it captain with what i know about the seraphim club they aint going to accuse us of anything the remaining three horses were so bone tired that sandman reckoned they would probably have made faster progress by leaving them behind but meg had resigned herself to telling the partial truth and he did not want to disturb her by suggesting she walk especially after she began complaining again saying her chickens would be eaten by the foxes but then sally had begun singing and that stopped the whining sallys first song was a soldiers favourite the drum major that told of a girl so in love with her redcoat that she followed him into the regiment where she became the drum major and escaped detection till she took a bath in a stream and was almost raped by another soldier she escaped him the officers discovered her identity and insisted she marry her lover i like stories that end happily berrigan had remarked then laughed when sally began her second song which was also a soldiers favourite but this one was about a girl who did not escape and sandman was somewhat shocked but not too surprised that sally knew all the words and berrigan sang along and meg actually laughed when the colonel took his turn and failed to perform and sally had still been singing when the robin redbreast pounced on them from behind a hollow tree beside the road the patrolling horseman suspected that the four bedraggled travellers had stolen the three carriage horses in which he was not far wrong and he faced them with one of his pistols drawn the guns muzzle and the steel buttons on his uniform blue coat and red waistcoat shone in the moonlight in the name of the king he said not wanting to be mistaken for a highwayman stand who are you and where are you travelling your name sandman had snapped the question back your name rank what regiment did you serve in the redbreasts were all men who had served in the cavalry none was young for it was reckoned that a young man would be too amenable to temptation and so steadier older and wellrecommended cavalrymen were hired to try to keep the thieves off the kings highways i ask the questions here the redbreast had retorted but tentatively because there was an undeniable authority in sandmans voice sandman might be in dusty crumpled clothes but he had plainly been an officer put the gun up quickly man sandman said deliberately talking to the redbreast as though he was still in the army im on official business authorised by viscount sidmouth the home secretary and this paper bears his seal and signature and if you cannot read then you had better take us right now to your magistrate the redbreast carefully lowered the flint of the pistol then slid the weapon into its saddle holster lost your coach sir broke a wheel thirty miles back sandman said now are you going to read this letter or would you rather take us to your magistrate im sure everythings in order sir the patrolling redbreast did not want to admit that he could not read and certainly did not want to disturb his supervising magistrate who would by now have sat down to a lavish supper and so he just moved his horse aside to let sandman and his three companions pass sandman supposed he could have insisted on being taken to the magistrate and used his letter from the home office to arrange another carriage or at the very least four fresh saddle horses but that would all have taken time a lot of time and it would have disturbed megs fragile equanimity and so they walked on until well after midnight they trailed across london bridge and so to the wheatsheaf where sally took meg to her own room and sandman let berrigan use his room while he collapsed in the back parlour not in one of the big chairs but on the wooden floor so that he would wake frequently and it was when the bells of saint giles were ringing six in the morning that he dragged himself upstairs woke berrigan and told him to stir the girls from their beds then he shaved found his cleanest shirt brushed his coat and washed the dirt from his disintegrating boots before at half past six with berrigan sally and a very reluctant meg in tow he set out for great george street and the end he hoped of his investigation ooooooo lord alexander pleydell and his friend lord christopher carne almost gagged when they entered the press yard for the smell was terrible worse than the reek of the sewer outflows where the fleet ditch joined the thames the turnkey who was escorting them chuckled i dont notice the smell no more my lords he said but i do suppose its mortal bad in its way mortal bad mind the steps here my lords do mind em lord alexander gingerly took the handkerchief away from his nose why is it called the press yard in days gone by my lord this is where the prisoners was pressed they was squashed my lord weighted down by stones my lord to persuade them to tell the truth we dont do it any longer mores the pity and as a consequence they lies like india rugs you squeezed them to death lord alexander asked shocked oh no my lord not to death not to death not unless they made a mistake and piled too many rocks on he chuckled finding the notion amusing no my lord they just got squashed till they told the truth its a fair persuader to a man or woman to tell the truth my lord if theyre carrying half a ton of rocks on their chests the turnkey chuckled again he was a fat man with leather breeches a stained coat and a stout billy club hard to breathe he said still amused very hard to breathe lord christopher carne shuddered at the terrible stench are there no drains he enquired testily the prison is very up to date my lord the turnkey hastened to assure him very up to date it is with the proper drains and proper close stools truth is my lord we spoils them we does we spoils them but they is filthy animals they fouls their own nest what we give them clean and tidy he put down his billy club as he closed and bolted the barred gate by which they had entered the yard that was long high and narrow the stones of the yard seemed damp even on this dry day as though the misery and fear of centuries had soaked into the granite and could not be wrung out if you no longer press the prisoners lord alexander enquired what is the yard used for instead the condemned have the freedom of the press yard sir during the daylight hours the turnkey said which is an example my lords of how kindly disposed towards em we are we spoils them we do there was a time when a prison was a prison not a glorified tavern liquor is sold here lord alexander enquired acidly not any longer my lord mister brown thats the keeper my lord closed down the grog shop on account that the scum was getting lushed and disorderly my lord but not that it makes any difference cos now they just have their liquor sent in from the lamb or the magpie and stump he cocked an ear to the sound of a church bell tolling the quarter hour bless me saint sepulchres telling us its a quarter to seven already if you turn to your left my lords you can join mister brown and the other gentlemen in the association room the association room lord alexander enquired where the condemned associate my lord during the daylight hours the turnkey explained except on high days and holidays like today and those windows to your left my lord those are the salt boxes lord alexander despite his opposition to the hanging of criminals found himself curiously fascinated by everything he saw and now gazed at the fifteen barred windows that name he said salt boxes you know its derivation nor its inclination my lord the turnkey laughed only i suspects that theyre called salt boxes on account of being stacked up like boxes the salt bboxes are what lord christopher who was very pallid this morning asked really kit lord alexander said with uncalledfor asperity everyone knows theyre where the condemned spend their last days the devils waiting rooms my lord the turnkey said then pulled open the association room door and ostentatiously held out his hand palm upward lord alexander who took pride in his notions of equality was about to force himself to shake the turnkeys hand then realised the significance of the palm ah he said taken aback but hurriedly fished in his pocket and brought out the first coin he found thank you my good man he said thank you your lordship thank you the turnkey said and then to his astonishment saw he had been tipped a whole sovereign and hastily pulled off his hat and tugged his forelock god bless you my lord god bless william brown the keeper hurried to meet his two new guests he had met neither man before but recognised lord alexander by his clubbed foot and so took off his hat and bowed respectfully your lordship is most welcome brown is it lord alexander asked william brown my lord yes keeper of newgate my lord lord christopher carne lord alexander introduced his friend with a rather vague wave of the hand his stepmothers murderer is being hanged today the keeper bowed again this time to lord christopher i do trust your lordship finds the experience both a revenge and a comfort and will you now permit me to name the ordinary of newgate he led them to where a stout man in an oldfashioned wig a cassock surplice and geneva bands was waiting with a smile on his plump face the reverend doctor horace cotton the keeper said your lordship is most welcome cotton bowed to lord alexander i believe your lordship is like me in holy orders i am lord alexander said and this is my particular friend lord christopher carne who also hopes to take orders one day ah cotton clasped his hands prayerfully and momentarily raised his eyes to the rafters i deem it a blessing he said when our nobility the true leaders of our society are seen to be christians it is a shining example for the common ruck dont you agree and you my lord he turned to lord christopher i understand that this morning you will see justice done for the grave insult committed against your family i hope to lord christopher said oh really kit lord alexander expostulated the revenge your family seeks will be provided in eternity by the fires of hell praise him the ordinary interjected and it is neither seemly nor civilised of us to hurry men to that condign fate lord alexander finished the keeper looked astonished you would surely not abolish the punishment of hanging my lord hang a man lord alexander said and you deny him the chance of repentance you deny him the chance of being pricked day and night by his conscience it should be sufficient i would have thought to simply transport all felons to australia i am reliably informed it is a living hell they will suffer from their consciences in the real hell cotton put in so they will sir lord alexander said so they will but i would rather a man came to repentance in this world for he surely has no chance of salvation in the next by execution we deny men their chance of gods grace its a novel argument cotton allowed though dubiously lord christopher had been listening to this conversation with a harried look and now blurted out an intervention are you he stared at the ordinary related to henry cotton the conversation died momentarily killed by lord christophers sudden change of tack to whom my lord the ordinary enquired henry cotton lord christopher said he seemed to be in the grip of some very powerful emotion as if he found being inside newgate prison almost unbearable he was pale there was sweat on his brow and his hands were trembling he was ggreek reader at christ church he explained and is now the sub librarian at the bodleian the ordinary took a step away from lord christopher who looked as if he was about to be ill i had thought my lord the ordinary said to be connected instead with the viscount combermere distantly henry cotton is a ggood fellow lord christopher said a very good fellow a sound scholar hes a pedant lord alexander growled related to combermere are you sir stapleton cotton as was he almost lost his right arm at the battle of salamanca and what a tragic loss that would have been oh indeed the ordinary agreed piously you are not usually tender about soldiers lord christopher observed to his friend combermere can be a very astute batsman lord alexander said especially against twisting balls do you play cricket cotton no my lord its good for the wind lord alexander declared mysteriously then turned to offer a lordly inspection of the association room staring up at the ceiling beams rapping one of the tables then peering at the cooking pots and cauldrons stacked by the embers of the fire i see our felons live in some comfort he remarked then frowned at his friend are you quite well kit oh yes indeed yes lord christopher said hastily but he looked anything but well there were beads of sweat on his brow and his skin was paler than usual he took off his spectacles and polished them with a handkerchief it is just that the apprehension of seeing a man launched into eternity is conducive to reflection he explained very conducive it is not an experience to be taken lightly i should think not indeed lord alexander said then turned an imperious eye on the other breakfast guests who seemed to be looking forward to the mornings events with an unholy glee three of them standing close to the door laughed at a jest and lord alexander scowled at them poor corday he said why do you pity the man my lord the reverend cotton asked it seems likely he is innocent lord alexander said but it seems proof of that innocence has not been found if he was innocent my lord the ordinary observed with a patronising smile then i am confident that the lord god would have revealed that to us youre saying you have never hanged an innocent man or woman lord alexander demanded god would not allow it the reverend cotton averred then god had better get his boots on this morning lord alexander said then turned as a barred door at the other end of the room opened with a sudden and harsh squeal for a heartbeat no one appeared in the doorway and it seemed as though all the guests held their breath but then to an audible gasp a short and burly man carrying a stout leather bag stumped into sight the man was redfaced and dressed in brown gaiters black breeches and a black coat that was buttoned too tightly over his protuberant belly he respectfully pulled off a shabby brown hat when he saw the waiting gentry but he offered no greeting and no one in the association room acknowledged his arrival thats the man botting the ordinary whispered ponderous sort of name for a hangman lord alexander observed in a tactlessly loud voice ketch now thats a proper hangmans name but botting sounds like a disease of cattle botting shot a hostile glance at the tall redhaired lord alexander who was quite unmoved by the animosity though lord christopher recoiled a step perhaps in horror at the hangmans beeflike face that was disfigured by warts wens and scars and subject to involuntary grimaces every few seconds botting gave the other guests a sardonic look then heaved a bench aside so he could drop his leather bag onto a table he unbuckled the bag and conscious of being watched brought out four coils of thin white cord he placed the coils on the table and then took from the bag two heavy ropes each with a noose at one end and a spliced eye at the other he placed the two ropes on the table added two white cotton bags then stepped smartly back a pace good morning sir he said to the keeper oh botting the keepers surprised tone suggested he had only just noticed the hangmans presence and a very good morning to you too and a nice one it is sir botting said hardly a cloud up aloft hardly one still just the two clients today sir just the two botting theres a fair crowd for them botting said not over large but fair enough good good the keeper said vaguely botting lord alexander intervened pacing forward with his crippled foot clumping heavily on the scarred floorboards tell me botting is it true that you hang members of the aristocracy with a silken rope botting looked astonished at being addressed by one of the keepers guests and even more by such an extraordinary figure as the reverend lord alexander pleydell with his shock of red hair hawklike nose and gangly figure well lord alexander demanded peremptorily is it so i have heard it is but on matters concerning hanging then you surely are the fons et origo of reliable information would you not concur a silken rope sir botting asked weakly my lord the ordinary corrected him my lord ha botting said recovering his equanimity and amused at the thought that perhaps lord alexander was contemplating being executed i hates to disappoint you my lord he said but i wouldnt know where to lay hands on a silken rope not a silken one now this botting caressed one of the nooses on the table is the best bridport hemp my lord fine as you could discover anywhere and i can always lay hands on quality bridport hemp but silk thats a horse of a different colour my lord and i wouldnt even know where to look no my lord if ever i has the high privilege of hanging a nobleman ill be doing it with bridport hemp same as i would for anyone else and quite right too my good man lord alexander beamed approval at the hangmans levelling instincts well done thank you you will forgive me my lord the keeper gestured that lord alexander should step away from the wide central aisle between the tables im in the way lord alexander sounded surprised only momentarily my lord the keeper said and just then lord alexander heard the clank of irons and the shuffle of feet the other guests drew themselves up and made their faces solemn lord christopher carne took a step back his face even paler than before then turned to face the door that led from the press yard a turnkey came in first he knuckled his forehead to the keeper then stood beside a low slab of timber that squatted on the floor the turnkey held a stout hammer and a metal punch and lord alexander wondered what their purpose was but he did not like to ask and then the guests closest to the door hauled off their hats because the sheriff and undersheriff were ushering the two prisoners into the association room brandy sir one of the keepers servants appeared beside lord christopher carne thank you lord christopher could not take his eyes from the slender pale young man who had come first through the door with legs weighed down by the heavy irons that he said to the servant that is corday it is my lord yes lord christopher gulped down the brandy and reached for another and the two bells the prison tocsin and the bell of saint sepulchres began to toll for those about to die ooooooo sandman expected the door of the great george street house to be opened by a servant but instead it was sebastian witherspoon viscount sidmouths private secretary who raised his eyebrows in astonishment an unseemly hour captain witherspoon observed then frowned at sandmans dishevelled state and the ragged looks of his three companions i do trust you have not all come expecting breakfast he said in a voice dripping with contempt this woman sandman did not bother with the niceties of a greeting can testify that charles corday is not the murderer of the countess of avebury witherspoon dabbed at his lips with a napkin stained with egg yolk he glanced at meg then shrugged as if to suggest that her testimony was worthless how very inconvenient he murmured viscount sidmouth is here sandman demanded we are at work sandman witherspoon said severely his lordship as you doubtless know is a widower and since his sad loss he has sought consolation in hard work he begins early and works late and does not brook disturbance this is work sandman said witherspoon looked again at meg and this time he seemed to notice her looks must i remind you he said that the boy has been found guilty and the law is due to take its course in one hour i really cannot see what can be done at this late juncture sandman stepped back from the door my compliments to lord sidmouth he said and tell him we are going to seek an audience with the queen he had no idea whether the queen would receive him but he was quite sure witherspoon and the home secretary did not want the animosity of the royal family not when there were honours and pensions to be had from the crown her majesty i believe sandman went on has taken an interest in this case and will doubtless be intrigued to hear of your cavalier attitude good day witherspoon captain witherspoon pulled the door wide open captain you had better come in they were shown into an empty parlour the house though it was in an expensive street close to the houses of parliament had a makeshift air it was not permanently lived in but was plainly let on short leases to politicians like lord sidmouth who needed a temporary refuge the only furniture in the parlour was a pair of stuffed armchairs both with faded covers and a heavy desk with a thronelike chair behind a beautifully bound prayer book lay on the desk next to an untidy pile of regional newspapers which all had articles ringed in ink sandman when they were left alone in the drab parlour saw that the marked articles were accounts of riots folk up and down britain were taking to the streets to protest against the price of corn or the introduction of machinery to the mills i sometimes think sandman said that the modern world is a very sad place has its consolations captain berrigan said carelessly glancing at sally riots rick burning sandman said it never used to be like this the damned french let anarchy into the world berrigan smiled things used to be better in the old days eh nothing but cricket and cream when we werent fighting the frogs yes it did seem like that no captain the sergeant shook his head you just had money then everythings easier when youve got cash amen to that sally said fervently then turned as the door opened and witherspoon ushered in the home secretary viscount sidmouth was wearing a patterned silk dressing gown over his shirt and trousers he was newly shaven and his white skin had a sheen as though it had been stretched and polished his eyes as ever were cold and disapproving it seems captain sandman he said acidly that you choose to inconvenience us i choose nothing of the sort my lord sandman said belligerently sidmouth frowned at the tone then looked at berrigan and the two women the sound of crockery being cleared came from deeper in the house and made sandman realise how hungry he was so the home secretary said with distaste in his voice who do you bring me my associates sergeant berrigan and miss hood associates sidmouth was amused i must acknowledge their assistance my lord as no doubt her majesty will when she learns the outcome of our enquiries that not so subtle hint made the home secretary grimace he looked at meg and almost recoiled from the force of her small eyes and the sight of her mangled teeth and pocked skin and you madam he asked coldly miss margaret hargood sandman introduced her who was a maid to the countess of avebury and was present in the countesss bedroom on the day of her murder she personally escorted charles corday from the bedroom before the murder she saw him out of the house and can testify he did not return in short my lord she can witness that corday is innocent sandman spoke with a deal of pride and satisfaction he was tired he was hungry his ankle hurt and his boots and clothes showed the effects of walking from kent to london but by god he had discovered the truth sidmouths lips already thin compressed into a bloodless line as he looked at meg is it true woman meg drew herself up she was not in the least awed by his lordship but instead looked him up and down then sniffed i dont know nothing she said i beg your pardon the home secretary blanched at the insolence in her voice he comes and kidnaps me meg shrieked pointing at sandman which he got no bleeding right to do takes me away from my chooks he can fake away off where he came from and what do i care who killed her or who dies for her meg sandman tried to plead with her get your bleeding paws off me dear god viscount sidmouth said in a pained voice and backed towards the door witherspoon he said we are wasting our time got ever such big wasps in australia sally said begging your lordships pardon even viscount sidmouth with his thin barren lawyers mind was not oblivious of sallys charms in the dark room she was like a ray of sunlight and he actually smiled at her even though he did not understand her meaning i beg your pardon he said to her ever such big wasps in australia sally said and thats where this mollishers going on account that she didnt give her testimony at charlies trial she should have done but she didnt protecting her man see and youre going to transport her arent you my lord sally reinforced this rhetorical question with a graceful curtsey the home secretary frowned transportation it is for the courts my dear not me to decide on who should be his voice suddenly tailed away for he was staring with astonishment at meg who was shivering with fear very large wasps in australia sandman said famously so aculeata gigantus witherspoon contributed rather impressively no meg cried big ones sally said with extraordinary relish with stingers like hatpins he didnt do it meg said and i dont want to go to australia sidmouth was looking at her much as the audience must have gazed on the pig faced lady at the lyceum are you saying he asked in a very cold voice that charles corday did not commit the murder the marquess didnt he didnt the marquess didnt sidmouth asked utterly mystified now the marquess of skavadale my lord sandman explained in whose house she was given shelter he came after the murder meg terrified of the mythical wasps was desperate to explain now the marquess came after she was dead he often called on the house and he was still there who was still there sidmouth enquired he was there corday was no meg said frowning him she paused looked at sandman then back to the home secretary whose face still showed puzzlement her stepson she said him what had been ploughing his fathers field for half a year sidmouth grimaced with distaste her stepson lord christopher carne my lord sandman explained stepson to the countess and heir to the earldom i saw him with the knife meg snarled and so did the marquess he was crying he was lord christopher he hated her see but he couldnt keep his scrawny paws off her neither oh he killed her it wasnt that feeble painter there was a seconds pause in which a score of questions came to sandmans mind but then lord sidmouth snapped at witherspoon my compliments to the police office in queen square that office was only a short walk away and i shall be obliged if they will provide four officers and six saddle horses instantly but give me a pen first witherspoon a pen and paper and wax and seal he turned and looked at a clock on the mantel and let us hurry man his voice was sour as though he resented this extra work but sandman could not fault him he was doing the right thing and doing it quickly let us hurry the home secretary said again and hurry they did ooooooo foot on the block boy dont dally the turnkey snapped at charles corday who gave a gulp then put his right foot on the wooden block the turnkey put the punch over the first rivet then hammered it out corday gasped with each blow then whimpered when the manacle dropped away lord alexander saw that the boys ankle was a welt of sores other foot boy the turnkey ordered the two bells tolled on and neither would stop now until both bodies were cut down the keepers guests were silent just watching the prisoners faces as though some clue to the secrets of eternity might lie in those eyes that so soon would be seeing the other side right lad go and see the hangman the turnkey said and charles corday gave a small cry of surprise as he took his first steps without leg irons he stumbled but managed to catch himself on a table i do not know lord christopher carne said then stopped abruptly what kit lord alexander asked considerately lord christopher gave a start unaware that he had even spoken but then collected himself you say there are doubts about his guilt he asked oh indeed yes indeed lord alexander paused to light a pipe sandman was quite sure of the boys innocence but i suppose it cant be proven alas alas but if the real kkiller were to be found lord christopher asked his eyes fixed on corday who was quivering as he stood before the hangman could that man then be convicted of the crime if corday has already been found gguilty of it and been hanged a very nice question lord alexander said enthusiastically and one to which i confess i do not know the answer but i should imagine would you not agree that if the real killer is apprehended then a posthumous pardon must be granted to corday and one can only hope that such a pardon will be recognised in heaven and the poor boy will be fetched up from the nether regions stand still boy jemmy botting growled at corday drink that if you want to it helps he pointed to a mug of brandy but corday shook his head your choice lad your choice botting said then he took one of the four cords and used it to lash cordays elbows pulling them hard behind his back so that corday was forced to throw out his chest not too tight botting the keeper remonstrated in the old days botting grumbled the hangman had an assistant to do this there was the yeoman of the halter and pinioning was his job it aint mine he had not been tipped anything by corday hence had made the first pinion so painful but now he relaxed the cords tension a little before lashing cordays wrists in front of his body thats for both of us reginald venables the second prisoner big and bearded slapped a coin on the table so slacken my friends lashings botting looked at the coin was impressed by the generosity and so loosened cordays two cords before placing one of the noosed ropes round his neck corday flinched from the sisals touch and the reverend cotton stepped forward and placed a hand on his shoulder god is our refuge and strength young man the ordinary said and a very present help in times of trouble call on the lord and he will hear you do you repent of your foul sins boy i did nothing corday wailed quiet my son quiet cotton urged him and reflect on your sins in decent silence i did nothing corday screamed charlie dont give em the pleasure venables said remember what i told you go like a man venables sank a mug of brandy then turned his back so that botting could lash his elbows but surely lord christopher said to lord alexander the very fact that a man already stands cconvicted and has been ppunished would make the authorities most reluctant to reopen the case justice must be served lord alexander said vaguely but i suppose you make a valid point no one likes to admit that they were mistaken least of all a politician so doubtless the real murderer can feel a good deal safer once corday is dead poor boy poor boy he is a sacrifice to our judicial incompetence eh botting placed the second rope about venabless shoulders then the reverend cotton took a step back from the prisoners and let his prayer book fall open at the burial service i am the resurrection and the life he intoned he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live i did nothing corday shouted and turned left and right as though he could see some way of escape quiet charlie venables said softly quiet the sheriff and undersheriff both in robes and both wearing chains of office and both carrying silvertipped staves and both evidently satisfied that the prisoners were properly prepared went to the keeper who formally bowed to them before presenting the sheriff with a sheet of paper the sheriff glanced at the paper nodded in satisfaction and thrust it into a pocket of his furtrimmed robe until now the two prisoners had been in the care of the keeper of newgate but now they belonged to the sheriff and he in turn would deliver them into the keeping of the devil the sheriff pulled aside his robe to find the watch in his fob pocket he snapped open the lid and peered at the face it lacks a quarter of eight he said then turned to botting are you ready quite ready your honour and at your service botting said he pulled on his hat scooped up the two white cotton bags and thrust them into a pocket the sheriff closed his watch let his robe fall and headed for the press yard we have an appointment at eight gentlemen he announced so let us go devilled kidneys lord alexander said dear god i can smell them come kit they joined the procession and the bells tolled on ooooooo it was not far a quartermile up whitehall right into the strand and three quarters of a mile to temple bar and after that it was scarcely a third of a mile down fleet street across the ditch and up ludgate hill before the left turn into old bailey no distance at all really and certainly not after the police office in queen square had brought some patrol officers horses sandman and berrigan were both mounted the sergeant on a mare that a constable swore was placid and sandman on a walleyed gelding that had more spirit witherspoon brought the reprieve out of the house and handed it up to sandman the wax of the seal was still warm god speed you captain witherspoon said see you in the sheaf sal berrigan shouted then lurched back as his mare followed sandmans gelding towards whitehall three patrolmen rode ahead one blowing a whistle and the other two with drawn truncheons to clear a path through the carts wagons and carriages a crossing sweeper leapt out of the way with a shrill curse sandman thrust the precious document into his pocket and turned to see berrigan making heavy weather of his mare heels down sergeant heels down dont snatch on the reins just let her run shell look after you they passed the royal stables then took to the pavement in the strand they rode past kidmans the apothecary driving two pedestrians into its deep doorway then past carringtons a cutlery store where sandman had purchased his first sword it had broken he remembered in the assault on badajoz it had been nothing heroic merely frustration at the armys apparent failure to get into the french fortress and in his anger he had slashed the sword at a marooned ammunition cart and snapped the blade off at the hilt then they galloped past sans pareil the theatre where celia collet actress had entranced the earl of avebury an old fool marrying a sharp young greed and when their undying love proved to be no more than unmatched lust and after they had fallen out she moved back to london where to keep herself in the luxury she felt her due she took back her old theatre servant margaret hargood to be her procuress thus had the countess snared her men she had blackmailed them and she had thrived but then the fattest fly of all came to her web lord christopher carne innocent and naive fell for his stepmother and she had seduced him and amazed him she had made him moan and shudder and then she had threatened to tell the trustees of the entailed estate his father and the whole world if he did not pay her still more money from his generous allowance and lord christopher knowing that when he inherited the estate his stepmother would demand more and more until there would be nothing left but a husk had killed her all this sandman had learnt as the viscount sidmouth scribbled the reprieve in his own handwriting the proper thing the home secretary had said is for the privy council to issue this document hardly time my lord sandman had pointed out i am aware of that captain sidmouth said acidly the steel nib scratched and spattered tiny droplets of ink as he scrawled his signature you will present this he said sprinkling sand on the wet ink with my compliments to the sheriff of london or to one of his undersheriffs one of whom will certainly be upon the scaffold they may enquire why such an order was not signed in council and then forwarded to them by the recorder of london and you will explain that there was no time for the proper procedures to be followed you will also be so kind as to pass me that candle and the stick of sealing wax now sandman and berrigan rode the seal on the reprieve still warm and sandman thought what guilt lord christopher must have endured and how killing his stepmother would have brought him no relief for the marquess of skavadale had discovered him almost in the act of the murder and the marquess whose family was near penury had seen his lifes problems solved at a stroke meg was the witness who could identify lord christopher as the murderer and so long as meg lived and so long as she was under the marquesss protection so long would lord christopher pay to keep her silent and when lord christopher became earl and so gained the fortune of his grandfather he would have been forced to pay all he had inherited it would all have gone to skavadale while meg the lever by which that wealth would have been prised from the avebury estate would have been bribed with chickens sidmouth had sent messengers to the channel ports and to harwich and to bristol warning officials there to keep a watch for lord christopher carne and what of skavadale sandman had asked we do not know if he has yet taken any monies by threat sidmouth said primly and if the girl speaks the truth then they did not plan to begin their depredations until after lord christopher had inherited the earldom we might disapprove of their intentions captain but we cannot punish them for a crime that is yet to be committed skavadale concealed the truth sandman said indignantly he sent for the constables and told them he didnt recognise the murderer he would have let an innocent man go to his death and how do you prove that sidmouth asked curtly just be content that you have identified the real killer and earned the forty pound reward berrigan put in happily earning a very dirty look from his lordship as they rode their horses shoes echoing from the walls of saint clements church sandman saw a dozen reflections of himself distorted in the roundel panes of cliftons chop house and he thought how good a pork chop and kidney would taste now the temple bar was immediately ahead and the space under the arch was crowded with carts and pedestrians the constables shouted for the carts to move bullied their horses into the press and yelled at the drivers to use their whips a wagon loaded with cut flowers was filling most of the archway and one of the constables started beating at it with his truncheon scattering petals and leaves onto the cobbles leave it sandman bellowed leave it he had seen a gap on the pavement and he drove his horse for it knocking down a thin man in a tall hat berrigan followed him then they were past the arch sandman was standing in the stirrups and his horse was plunging towards the fleet ditch sparks flying where its shoes struck the cobbles the first church bells began to strike eight and it seemed to sandman that the whole city was filled with a cacophony of bells hoofbeats alarm and doom he settled back in the saddle slapped the horses rump and rode like the wind ooooooo lord alexander as he passed through the towering arch of the high debtors door saw in front of him the dark hollow interior of the scaffold and he thought how much it resembled the underside of a theatres stage from outside where the audience gathered in the street the gallows looked heavy permanent and sombre with its black baize drapery but from here lord alexander could see it was an illusion sustained by raw wooden beams it was a stage set for a tragedy ending in death wooden stairs climbed to his right going up into the shadows before turning sharply left to emerge in a roofed pavilion that formed the rear of the scaffold the roofed pavilion was like the privileged stage boxes offering the important guests the best view of the drama lord alexander was first up the steps and a huge cheer greeted his appearance no one cared who he was but his arrival presaged the coming of the two doomed men and the crowd was bored with waiting lord alexander blinking in the sudden sunlight took off his hat and bowed to the mob who appreciative of the gesture laughed and applauded the crowd was not large but it filled the street for a hundred yards southwards and quite blocked the junction with newgate street immediately to the north every window in the magpie and stump was taken and there was even a scatter of spectators on the taverns roof we were asked to take chairs at the back lord christopher pointed out when lord alexander sat himself in the very front row we were requested to leave two front row places for the sheriff lord alexander corrected him and there they are sit down kit do what a delightful day do you think the weather will last budd on saturday eh budd on saturday lord christopher was jostled as the other guests pushed past to the rearmost chairs cricket dear boy ive actually persuaded budd to play a single wicket match against jack lambert and lambert good fellow that he is has agreed to stand down if rider sandman will take his place he told me so yesterday after church now thats a match to dream of eh budd against sandman you will come wont you a cheer drowned conversation on the scaffold as the sheriffs appeared in their breeches silk stockings silverbuckled shoes and furtrimmed robes lord christopher seemed oblivious of their arrival gazing instead at the beam from which the prisoners would hang he seemed disappointed that it was not bloodstained then he looked down and flinched at the sight of the two unplaned coffins waiting for their burdens she was an evil woman he said softly of course youll come lord alexander said then frowned what did you say my dear fellow my stepmother she was evil lord christopher seemed to shiver though it was not cold she and that maid of hers they were like witches are you justifying her murder she was evil lord christopher said more emphatically apparently not hearing his friends question she said she would make a claim on the estate on the trustees because i wrote her some letters she lied alexander she lied he winced remembering the long letters in which he had poured out his devotion to his stepmother he had known no women until he had been taken to her bed and he had become besotted by her he had begged her to run away to paris with him and she had encouraged his madness until one day mocking him she had snapped the trap closed give her money she had insisted or else she would make him the laughing stock of paris london and every other european capital she threatened to have the letters copied and the copies distributed so everyone would see his shame and so he had paid her money and she demanded more and he knew the blackmail would never end and so he killed her he had not believed himself capable of murder but in her bedroom begging her a final time to return him the letters she had mocked him called him puny said he was a fumbling and stupid boy he had pulled the knife from his belt it was hardly a weapon it was little more than an old blade he used to slit the pages of uncut books but in his mad anger it sufficed he had stabbed her then hacked and slashed at her loathsome and beautiful skin and afterwards he had rushed onto the landing and seen the countesss maid and a man staring up at him from the downstairs hall and he had recoiled back to the bedroom where he had whimpered in panic he expected to hear feet on the stairs but no one came and he forced himself to be calm and to think he had been on the landing for only a split second hardly time to be recognised he snatched a knife from the painters table and tossed it onto the redlaced body then searched the dead womans bureau to find his letters that he had carried away down the back stairs and burnt at home he had crouched in his lodgings fearing arrest then next day heard that the painter had been taken by the constables lord christopher had prayed for corday it was not right of course that the painter should die but nor could lord christopher be persuaded that he himself deserved death for his stepmothers murder he would do good with his inheritance he would be charitable he would pay for the murder and for cordays innocence a thousand times over sandman had threatened that exercise of repentance and so lord christopher had consulted his manservant and claiming that rider sandman had a grudge against him and planned to sue the trustees and thus tie up the avebury fortune in the court of chancery he had promised a thousand guineas to the man who could rid the estate of that threat the manservant had hired other men and lord christopher had rewarded them richly for even making the attempt on sandmans life now it seemed further payment would be unnecessary for sandman had evidently failed corday would die and no one would then want to admit that an innocent man had been sent to dance on bottings stage but your stepmother surely had no claim on the estate lord alexander had been thinking about his friends words unless the entail specifically provides for your fathers widow does it lord christopher looked confused but then made a great effort to concentrate on what his friend had just said no he said the whole estate is entailed on the heir onto mme alone then you will be a prodigiously rich man kit lord alexander said and i shall wish you well of your great fortune he turned from his friend as a huge cheer the loudest of the morning greeted the hangmans arrival on the scaffold i will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle the reverend cottons voice grew louder as he climbed the stairs behind the first prisoner while the ungodly is in my sight a turnkey appeared first then corday who was still walking awkwardly because his legs were not used to being without irons he tripped on the top step and stumbled into lord alexander who gripped his elbow steady theres a good fellow lord alexander said hats off the crowd bellowed at those who stood in the front ranks hats off the roar of the crowd was massive as they surged forward to crush against the low wooden rail that surrounded the scaffold the city marshals men arrayed just behind the rail raised their staves and spears lord alexander felt assaulted by the noise that echoed back from the prisons granite facade this was england at play he thought the mob given its taste of blood in the hope that given this much they would not demand more a child sitting on his fathers shoulders was screaming obscenities at corday who was weeping openly the crowd liked a man or woman to go to their deaths bravely and cordays tears were earning him nothing but scorn lord alexander had a sudden urge to go to the young man and comfort him to pray with him but he stayed seated because the reverend cotton was already close beside corday o teach us to number our days the ordinary read in a singsong voice that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom then the crowd roared in mocking laughter because corday had collapsed botting had half climbed the ladder and was just lifting the rope from the prisoners shoulders ready to attach it to one of the hooks of the beam when cordays legs turned to jelly the reverend cotton leapt back the turnkey ran forward but corday could not stand he was shaking and sobbing shoot the bugger jemmy a man shouted from the crowd i need an assistant botting growled at the sheriff and a chair one of the guests volunteered to stand and his chair was brought into the sunlight and placed on the trapdoor the crowd realising this was going to be an unusual execution applauded the sight botting and a turnkey hoisted corday onto the seat and the hangman deftly undid the line holding cordays elbows and retied it so that it bound the prisoner to the chair now he could be hanged and botting clambered up the ladder attached the rope then came down and rammed the noose hard over cordays head snivelling little bastard he whispered as he jerked the rope tight die like a man he took one of the white cotton bags from his pocket and pulled it over cordays head lord alexander silent now saw the cotton pulsing in and out with cordays breathing the boys head had dropped onto his chest so that if it had not been for the flicker of cotton at his mouth he might already have been dead show thy servants thy work the reverend cotton read and their children thy glory venables came up the steps and received only a perfunctory cheer from a crowd that had exhausted itself at cordays expense the big man nevertheless bowed to his audience then walked calmly to the trapdoor and waited for rope and blindfold the scaffold creaked beneath his weight do it quick jemmy he said loudly and do it well ill look after you the hangman promised ill look after you he took the white hood from his pocket and pulled it over venabless head the lord gave and the lord hath taken away the reverend cotton said lord alexander who had found himself appalled by the last few moments became dimly aware of some disturbance at the southern narrow end of old bailey blessed be the name of the lord intoned the ordinary ooooooo god damn it sandman found himself blocked by the press of traffic at the junction of farringdon street and ludgate hill off to his right the fleet ditch stank in the early morning sun a coal wagon was turning into fleet street and it had jammed on the corner and a dozen men were offering advice while a lawyer in a hackney was telling his driver to whip the coal heavers horses even though there was no room for it to move because an even larger wagon loaded with a score of oak beams was scraping past the mounted constables whistles blowing and truncheons drawn clattered into the junction behind sandman who kicked a pedestrian out of his way wrenched his horse to the left swore at the lawyer whose coach blocked him then had his bridle seized by a wellmeaning citizen who thought sandman was fleeing the constables get your bloody hands off me sandman shouted then berrigan rode alongside and thumped the man on the head crushing his hat and sandmans horse was suddenly free and he kicked it alongside the wagon with the huge oak beams no point in hurrying the driver called not if youre going to the hanging the culleys will be dangling by now all the bells of the city had rung the hour the ones that always chimed early and even the laggards had struck eight but the funeral bell of saint sepulchre still tolled and sandman dared to hope that corday was still alive as he burst out of the tangled traffic and kicked the horse up towards saint pauls cathedral which filled the crest of ludgate hill with its steps pillars and dome halfway up the hill he turned into old bailey and for the first few yards as he passed the law courts in the session house the road was blessedly empty but then it widened as he passed the big yard of newgate prison and suddenly the seething crowd stretched across the whole street blocking him and he could see the beam of the gallows reaching across the sky and the black scaffold platform beneath and then he just drove the horse at the crowd he was standing in the stirrups shouting just as the royals the scots greys and the inniskillings had stood and shouted as they drove their big horses into the french corps they had destroyed at waterloo make way sandman bellowed make way he saw the men on the scaffold and noticed that one seemed to be sitting which was strange and he saw a priest there and a knot of spectators or officials at the scaffolds rear and the crowd protested at his savagery resisted him and he wished he had a weapon to thrash at them but then the constables drove alongside him and thrust at the press of people with their long truncheons then a sigh seemed to pass through the crowd and sandman could see no one but the priest on the scaffolds black stage that stretched halfway across the widest part of the street which meant the trapdoor had opened and saint sepulchres bell tolled on for the dying ooooooo venables swore at the ordinary and cursed the keeper but gave no insults to jemmy botting for he knew well enough that the hangman could hasten his end stop weeping he told corday i did nothing corday protested you think youre the first innocent person to die up here venables asked or the hundredth its a scaffold charlie and it knows no difference between the guilty and the innocent are you there jemmy venables had the white hood over his eyes so he could not see that the hangman had snuffled to the corner of the platform to pull the safety peg are you there jemmy not long now boys botting said have patience he vanished down the back stairs its rider lord alexander was standing now to the annoyance of the guests seated behind him its rider the crowd had at last sensed that something untoward was happening their first inkling was when lord alexander tall and striking stood by the pavilion and pointed towards ludgate hill then they turned and saw the horsemen who were trying to force their way through the crowd let them through some of the people shouted whats happening venables roared from the trapdoor whats happening sit down my lord the sheriff said to lord alexander who ignored him rider he shouted across the crowd his voice drowned by their commotion jemmy botting cursed because he had pulled the rope and the tallowgreased beam had juddered but not moved god damn you to bloody hell he cursed the beam then took hold of the rope a second time and gave it a monstrous tug and this time the beam moved so swiftly that botting was thrown backwards as the sky opened above him the trap fell with a thump and the two bodies fell into the scaffolds pit venables was dancing and throttling while cordays legs were thrashing against the chair sheriff sheriff sandman was nearing the scaffold sheriff is it a reprieve lord alexander roared is it a reprieve yes kit help me lord alexander limped on his club foot to where corday hung twitched and gagged help me haul him up let go of him the sheriff bellowed as lord alexander reached for the rope let go my lord the reverend cotton demanded this is not seemly get off me you damned bloody fool lord alexander snarled as he pushed cotton away he then seized the rope and tried to haul corday back up to the platform but he did not possess nearly enough strength the white cotton bag over cordays mouth shivered sandman thrust aside the last few folk and rammed his horse against the barrier he fumbled in his pockets for the reprieve thought for a dreadful instant that it was lost then found the paper and held it up towards the scaffold but the sheriff would not come to receive it its a reprieve sandman shouted kit help me lord alexander tugged feebly at cordays rope and could not raise the dying man by even an inch and so he turned to lord christopher kit help me lord christopher eyes huge behind his thick spectacles held both hands to his mouth he did not move what the bloody hell are you doing jemmy botting shouted at lord alexander from beneath the scaffold and then to make sure he was not cheated of a death he scrambled over the supporting beams to haul downwards on cordays legs youll not have him he screamed up at lord alexander youll not have him hes mine hes mine take it sandman shouted at the sheriff who still refused to lean down and accept the reprieve but just then a blackdressed man pushed his way to sandmans side give it to me the newcomer said he did not wait for sandman to obey but instead snatched the paper hoisted himself onto the railing that protected the scaffold and then with one prodigious leap jumped to catch hold of the scaffolds edge for an instant his black boots scrabbled on the baize for a lodgment then he managed to grip the exposed edge left by the fallen trapdoor and heaved himself onto the platform it was sallys brother dressed all in black and with a black ribbon tying his black hair and the regulars in the crowd cheered for they recognised and admired him he was jack hood robin hood the man that every magistrate and constable in london wanted to see caper on jem bottings stage and jack hood mocked their ambition by flaunting himself at every newgate hanging now on the scaffold at last he thrust cordays reprieve towards the sheriff take it god damn you hood snarled and the sheriff astonished by the young mans confidence at last took the paper hood strode to lord alexanders side and took hold of the rope but jemmy botting fearing that his victim would be snatched at the last minute had scrambled onto cordays lap so that his weight was added to the choking noose hes mine he shouted up at lord alexander and hood hes mine cordays wheezing breath was drowned in the mornings din hood heaved but could not raise the combined weight of corday and botting hes mine mine botting screamed you sandman snapped at one of the city marshals javelin men give me your hanger now the man bemused but cowed by sandmans snap of command nervously drew the short curved sword that was more decorative than useful sandman snatched the blade from him then was assaulted by another of the scaffold guards who thought sandman planned an assault on the sheriff bugger off sandman snarled at the man then berrigan thumped his fist on the crown of the mans head wait the sheriff shouted there must be order there must be order the crowd was shrieking its noise filling the street like a great roar marshal the sheriff called marshal give up the sword the marshal bellowed at sandman hood sandman shouted as he stood in the stirrups hood hands reached up to haul him out of the saddle but sandman had the highwaymans attention now and he tossed him the hanger cut him down hood cut him down hood deftly caught the blade the constables who had escorted sandman and berrigan from whitehall now pushed away the marshals men lord christopher carne eyes still wide and mouth agape was staring in horror at rider sandman who at last noticed his lordship constable sandman spoke to the horseman nearest him thats the man you arrest that man there sandman pointed and lord christopher turned as if to escape but the stairs from the pavilion led only down to the prison itself jemmy botting had his arms about cordays neck embracing him like a lover as he heaved his weight up and down on the hanging mans lap mine he crooned mine and he heard the scraping in the boys throat then jack hood was sawing the hanger blade at the rope no botting screamed no but the rope though it was supposed to be the best bridport hemp cut like rush string and suddenly corday and botting still locked in their embrace were falling and the legs of the chair splintered on the cobbles as the ropes cut end flicked empty in the london wind we must cut him down the sheriff said having at last read the reprieve the crowd fickle as ever now cheered because the victim they had despised had cheated the hangman he would live he would go free he would paint sandman slid from his horse and gave the reins to a constable other constables had used the ladder that waited for any member of the crowd who wanted to be touched by a hanged mans hand and those men now took hold of lord christopher carne sandman saw his lordship weeping and felt no pity worse he could hear venabless choking noises and see the dying mans rope quivering above the blackdraped platform he turned away trying and failing to discover some consolation that even one soul had been stolen from the gallows thank you sergeant he said its over then berrigan said dismounting its over sandman said rider lord alexander shouted from the scaffold rider sandman turned back lord alexander limped about the hole made by the fallen trapdoor rider would you play a single wicket match this saturday sandman stared in momentary astonishment at his friend then looked at hood thank you he shouted but the words were lost in the crowds howling sandman bowed thank you he called again hood returned the bow but then held up a single finger just one captain he called just one and theyll hang a thousand before you snatch another back its against budd lord alexander shouted rider can you hear me rider where are you going sandman had turned away again and now had his arm round berrigans shoulder if you want breakfast at the sheaf he told the sergeant then youd best hurry before the crowd fills the taproom and thank sally for me will you we would have failed without her we would too berrigan said and you where are you going sandman limped away from the gallows ignored by the crowd who demanded that corday their new hero be brought to the scaffolds platform me sam sandman answered im going to see a man about a loan so that you and i can go to spain and buy some cigars youre going to ask for a loan berrigan said in those boots sandman looked down to see that both boot soles were gaping away from the uppers im going to ask for a loan he said and for his daughters hand in marriage as well and though im not a betting man ill wager you the price of a new pair of boots that hell say yes to both hes not getting a rich soninlaw sam hes just getting me lucky him berrigan said lucky you sandman said and sally too he smiled and they walked on down old bailey behind them venables slowly choked as above him corday blinked in the new days sunlight sandman looked back once from the corner of ludgate hill and he saw the gallows black as any devils heart and then he turned the corner and was gone historical note i have tried to keep the facts of the tale as accurate as may be there was indeed an occasional investigator appointed to enquire into the circumstances of capital cases and he was selected by the home secretary who in was henry addington first viscount sidmouth this was one of the busiest periods for the gallows of england and wales scottish law was and remains different there was a belief that savage and extreme punishment would curb crime and so the bloody code was forged and by there were over capital crimes on the statute books most of these were property crimes theft arson or forgery but murder attempted murder and rape were also punishable by death as indeed was sodomy between and there were executions for rape in england and wales and for sodomy most executions were for robbery between and with murder the second most common capital offence cases in all there were executions in england and wales between and and the victims included women and at least one child as young as fourteen this averages about executions a year of which about one fifth took place outside newgate while the rest were in assize towns or at horsemonger lane but some years the gallows were much busier and the period between and was among the busiest averaging over executions a year yet and this is a crucial point only about ten per cent of those condemned to death were actually executed the vast majority had their sentences commuted almost invariably to transportation to australia thus between and when executions took place in england and wales there were actually sentences of death passed what accounts for this enormous discrepancy mercy it was not a merciful age instead the figures betray a cynical exercise of social control the friends and relatives of a person condemned to death would invariably petition the crown which meant the home secretary and they would do their utmost to secure the signatures of prominent members of society such as aristocrats politicians or senior churchmen knowing that having such names on a petition made it more likely to be granted thus were bonds of subservient gratitude forged this was never made explicit but the process of condemnation petition and reprieve was so well understood and established that it cannot have another explanation many felons were unlucky and had their petitions rejected or else made no petition and their deaths became public spectacles in london the executions used to be at tyburns famous gallows the triple tree which stood at what is now marble arch but in the late eighteenth century the scaffold was moved to old bailey i have tried in the first and last chapters to describe the process of a newgate execution as accurately as it may be depicted after a lapse of two hundred years and i have used the real names of many of the participants thus the keeper of newgate was william brown and he did indeed serve devilled kidneys to the guests who came to watch the hangings the ordinary was horace cotton and the hangman was james jemmy botting who lacked an assistant in charles corday of course is fictional but he could well have survived his hanging a number of folk survived usually because they were cut down too soon and it would be some years before the long drop was adopted which killed more or less instantaneously i owe a great debt of gratitude to donald rumbelow author of among many other good books the triple tree for his great help in disentangling some of the more confusing details of newgate procedure during the regency period i am also most grateful to elizabeth cartmalefreedman who helped with the research and to james hardy vaux who in during his involuntary exile in australia compiled his vocabulary of the flash language the original inspiration for gallows thief came from v a c gatrells book the hanging tree oxford a book that combines a scholarly account of the english and welsh experience of execution between and with a fine and controlled anger against capital punishment the hanging trees cover picture alone which is gericaults sketch of an english public hanging in is a stunning indictment of a barbaric punishment to professor gatrell i offer thanks and the assurance that any mistakes in gallows thief come not from him nor from any other source but are entirely of my own making
