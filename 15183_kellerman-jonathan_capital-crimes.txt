jonathan kellerman faye kellerman capital crimes my sisters keeper acknowledgments for my sisters keeper special thanks to chief douglas n hambleton and officer joseph e okies jr of the berkeley police department detective jesse grant of the oakland police department and dr mordecai and rena rosen the club was from another age so was mother the womans association of northern california conquistadores chapter number xvi was housed in a sumptuous turnofthecentury beauxartstouchedbygothic castle topped by crenellations and turrets and constructed of massive blocks of mauvegray deer isle granite from a longdead quarry in maine the interior was predictable somber and dark save for stainedglass windows featuring historical gold rush scenes that blew jeweled patches on the walls when the sun shone through antique persian rugs softened wellworn walnut floors the staircase banister gleamed from decades of polish thirtyfoot ceilings were coffered and rimmed with gold the ground floor of the building held all the public rooms the two floors above contained sleeping chambers for the members mother had been a member of the association for more than fifty years and sometimes slept over in a room far too modest for her but the fees were nominal and nostalgia was worth something her dinners at the club were frequent they made her feel special they made davida feel like a freak but she gritted her teeth and indulged mothers preferences because the woman was a nottoohealthy eighty most dinners meant mother and various selections of dear friends each one of them more than a step out of time the entire concept of the association with its genteel gatsby pretensions would have been anachronistic anywhere nowhere was it more absurd than here in berkeley a stroll from the club was the peoples park originally conceived as a monument to free speech but reduced to a square block of homeless encampments and ad hoc soup kitchens good intentions in the abstract but the brown rectangle reeked of unwashed bodies and decaying food and on hot days anyone not blessed by nasal congestion kept a wide berth not far from the park was the gourmet ghetto the foodie mecca that typified berkeley s mix of hedonism and idealism and dominating it all the uc it was these contrasts that gave the city a unique character with everything blanketed by a definite point of view davida loved the city with all its strengths and its foibles leftist and proud she was now part of the system duly elected state representative from district she loved her district and she loved her constituents she loved the energy and the electricity of a town stoked by people who cared about issues so different from her hometown sacramento where dishing dirt was respectable recreation and yet here she was commuting back to the capital all for a good cause tonight the domeroofed hushhush dining room was dense with tables dressed with starched linen and sparkling silver and crystal but shy on diners members were dying off and very few women elected to follow in their mothers footsteps davida had joined the association a few years back because it was politically smart to do so she knew most of the members as friends of her mother and they enjoyed the attention she paid them their monetary contributions were stingy compared to their assets but at least they gave more than davida could say about a lot of her own allegedly altruistic pals tonight it was just davida and mother their server handed them menus and davida and her mother silently scanned tonights choices the entrées once biased toward steaks and chops had conceded to presentday realities with more chicken and fish the food was excellent davida had to grant that in berkeley bad food was almost as serious an iniquity as being a republican mother insisted on flirting with the waiter an elfinlooking man in his thirties named tony who was undoubtedly gay mother damn well knew he was gay but she batted her lashes like a moony adolescent tony played his part by smiling and batting back his lashes outclassed mothers thicker and darker than any mans deserved to be davida knew mother was worried trying to mask it with a false cheer still dwelling on the incident though it had seemed like a big deal last week and certainly demeaning davida now had the perspective to see it for what it had been a stupid prank executed by stupid people eggs sticky repellent but not dangerous still mother brooded as she forked her shrimp cocktail davidas minestrone soup remained untouched because dealing with mother tightened up her esophagus if the wall of silence didnt come down both of them would end up with indigestion and davida would leave the club in need ofsomething davida loved her mother but lucille grayson was a supreme pain in the ass lucille called mr eyelash over asked for a refill of chardonnay and drained it quickly maybe alcohol would settle her down tony returned and announced the specials mother ordered the blackened chilean sea bass and davida opted for the linguini with chicken in vodka and sundried tomato sauce tony gave a dancers bow and sailed away you look good said davida not a lie lucille maintained clear blue eyes a sharp nose prominent chin and strong teeth thick luxuriant hair for an old woman once auburn now a gray one shade darker than the clubs granite walls davida hoped shed age as well decent odds she bore an uncanny resemblance to mother and at fortythree her own auburn waves lacked a single silver strand mother didnt answer your skin looks great said davida its the facials mother responded when and if you go to the spa ask for marty ill go so you say how long has it been davida since youve taken care of your skin ive had other things on my mind i bought you a certificate it was a terrific gift thank you mother its a stupid gift if you dont use it mother it doesnt have an expiration date dont worry itll get used if not by me im sure minette will be happy to indulge mothers jaw set she forced a smile no doubt she would be however she isnt my daughter she picked up her wineglass and sipped trying for nonchalance but a trembling lip betrayed her you have a little bruiseon the apple of your right cheek davida nodded the coverup must have come off how bad does it look well darling you wouldnt want to face your public like that true davida smiled they might think that you were beating up on me mother didnt appreciate the humor her eyes misted bastards i agree davida took the old womans hand the skin nearly translucent traced with delicate veins the color of a misty sky im fine please dont worry any idea yet who did it stupid kids thats ambiguous and elusive and im not the press davida have the police made any arrests not yet ill let you know when it happens when not if davida didnt answer a latino busboy murmured something polite and removed appetizer dishes moments later he returned with the entrées davida wondered why in fine restaurants the busboys always served the meal what were the waiters food transport consultants she thanked him in spanish and swirled a forkful of pasta delicious hows your food mother fine again blue eyes clouded lucille looked close to tears what is it mother it could have been bullets luckily it wasnt so lets just enjoy this meal and being together which was an oxymoron because whenever they were together conflict was inevitable mother harrumphed and then abruptly plastered a smile across her face as she waved across the room to two women whod just entered darlene macintyre and eunice meyerhoff the duo hobbled over to the table tongues clucking in unison darlene was short and pudgy eunice tall and severe with impossibly black hair drawn back in a dragon lady bun lucille blew air kisses darling eunice gushed how are you fabulous what else enjoying a dinner with my busy daughter eunice turned her eyes to davida are you all right honey im fine thanks for asking that was just terrible lucille said not to mention frightening darlene said motherfuckers davida broke into laughter but was grateful that the room was empty i couldnt have said it better mrs macintyre she took a sip of her wine would you two like to join us we wouldnt dream of intruding eunice said your mother rarely sees you is that what she tells you all the time dear davida shot a mockstern look at mother then focused her gaze back to the two old women well then its lovely to see you both enjoy your evening you too darlene answered and dont let those assholes get you down when theyd toddled off davida said i hardly see you mother reddened slightly eunice is a troublemakeri dont complain about you chronically davida that battleaxe is smitten with jealousy because her jane detests her isnt that a bit of an exaggeration hardly davida eunice sided with janes ex during the last divorce though i suppose one can understand her frustration seeing as it was a third divorce sly smile or perhaps sixth or twentysixth ive lost count third davida said i heard about eunice taking parkers side on top of being tacky and disloyal it was misguided parker seldeys a jerk and a maniac but goodlooking once upon a time i hear he has quite the temper so do i but that doesnt concern eunice because he was courtly to her remembering her birthday that kind of nonsense lucille sighed ones blood is ones blood still by the same token despite eunices quirks jane shouldnt despise her shes angry at eunice but she doesnt hate her mother believe me i know jane meyerhoff had been davidas friend since grade school and one of her roomies at the uc both had been rebellious teenagers smoking dope skipping school hauled in more than once for petty theft in sacramento stupid selfdestructive acts committed because neither girl liked herself jane had carried fifty extra pounds and hated her summer squash nose she starved and vomited the weight off during her freshman year in college got the nose job as a junior but old selfimages die hard and jane had never been comfortable with who she was probably never would be comfortable davida decided with some sadness she on the other hand came to grips with herself well before college everything changed a few months before her senior prom when she came out like birthing a child painful but you had something to show for it coming out meant life was suddenly honest illuminated by a clean bright light davida had never imagined she chewed her pasta while glancing across the table mother had many faults but homophobia wasnt one of them shed never given a rats ass that her only surviving child was gay perhaps it was because mother though resolutely heterosexual didnt care for men in general and hated davidas father in specific the honorable stanford r grayson district court judge ret now lived in sarasota florida where he played golf with a second wife twenty years younger than lucille mother had been thrilled when the old man got rehitched for now she had something else to complain about and father had stepgrandchildren with mixie so he ignored davida and left her all to lucille if mother ever felt pangs about her lack of grandchildren she never expressed her longings to davida mother picked at her food and pushed it around on her plate how often do you see janey a bit more since she moved to berkeley davida smiled tightly i try to keep in contact with all my old college roomies mother had wanted her daughter to go to stanford davida insisted on berkeley once there shed never really left working first as an assistant to the mayor then moving to the capital where she gofered for ned yellin the most progressive member of the assembly neds shockingly sudden death from a heart attack had propelled her own career now she represented her district with workaholic pride and loved her job although there were days like yesterday that made her wonder why shed ever shaken the hornets nest that was state politics it was challenge enough to deal with the vagaries of constituents basically in harmony with her views working with and around her lessenlightened colleagues could be as frustrating asthere really wasnt anything worse less enlightened her euphemism of the month bigoted and biased would be more accurate then again everyone had his own agenda she certainly had hers and it had nothing to do with sexual orientation when she was ten her older sister glynnis had finally succumbed to her protracted battle with rhabdomyosarcoma a rare muscle tumor davida had loved her sister and watching glynnis spend her last days confined to a hospital bed hooked up to tubes clammy gown wrapped around a sallow stickthin body bleeding from her gums and nose glynnis blood cells were in steady retreat and there were no new donors to be found stem cells would have saved glynnis davida was convinced of that how different would things have been for the grayson family if the scientific community had been funded righteously two and a half years ago davida had been heartened when the people voted in an initiative funding a state stemcell institute but years later she was disillusioned and angry all the institute had accomplished was creating a board of directors and issuing a nambypamby mission statement science works gradually was the excuse davida wasnt buying it people like alice had the answer but alice hadnt even been consulted by the new board davidas repeated requests notwithstanding she decided shed waited long enough buttressed by a battalion of scientists doctors clergy humanists and genetic sufferers she went to war every day in sacramento laboring to convince her lessenlightened colleagues that a less grandiose but more efficient legislative approach was the answer and got precious little for her efforts it wasnt that the stodgy pols really cared about aborted fetuses because shed learned that few pols cared about anything other than getting reelected though they screamed a good case six months into her struggle she was convinced it was davida they were rejecting because of who she was day after day of wearing out her vocal cords making deals she really didnt want to make wasting hours on mindnumbing meetings now eggs in her face on her blouseright there on the capitol steps the humiliation what a mess there was a metaphor for you mothers voice snapped her back to the here and now prattling on about dangers lurking around every corner according to lucille davida was a major target of every whitesupremacist hate group in california not to mention bible belt prolifers hypermacho antigay farmers from the san joaquin valley and of course misogynists of every stripe and gender she recalled mothers first words after the election results were tallied and davidas supporters broke into raisedfist cheers in the social hall of the old finnish church be careful dear dont get cocky and think because you can get elected here that youre really popular mother was being her typical negative self but there was some truth to her admonitions davida knew shed made many enemies many of whom she had never met dont worry mother im fine on top of that you work too hard thats what a public servant does mother if youre going to keep such long hours you should at least be compensated for your efforts like in the corporate world with your experience you could write your own i dont care about money mother that my dear is because youve never been without it true mother fortunate people go into public service to pay back stop worrying about me lucille graysons look was injured and frightened shed lost one daughter survival could be a burden thought davida but she tried to be compassionate no one wants to hurt me im too insignificant thats not what i saw on tv theyll have an arrest soon whoever did it wasnt clever probably imbeciles from the white tower radicals they may not be clever davida but that doesnt mean theyre not dangerous ill be especially careful mother davida took a bite put down the fork and wiped her mouth its been lovely but i have piles of paperwork and its past nine i have to get back to the office mother sighed all right go ahead i have to pack up myself youre not staying overnight no i have a meeting tomorrow morning with my accountant back home whos driving you hector guillermo hes a good guy davida stood up and helped her mother to her feet do you need any help packing no not at all lucille kissed her daughter on the cheek let me give you a ride to your office its a beautiful night mother not too cold and not too foggy i think ill walk walk its not late its dark davida i know everyone en route and as far as i know none of them plans to egg me you be careful yourself i dont like you going home so late i wish youd sleep here overnight not inviting mother to her own apartment there were limits lucille said sacramento is only an hour away davida smiled not the way guillermo drives a shorter journey means less opportunity for problems dear you have your business i have mine fair enough after bidding goodbye to mothers friends davida accompanied the old woman out of the dining room and helped her up the staircase to her room ill talk to you tomorrow mother and ill tell minette you said hello but i didnt in domestic matters honesty isnt always the best policy walking through the stillness of berkeleys business district a thin fog veiling street signs and darkened storefronts and tickling her nose davida jammed her hands into her pockets and enjoyed the solitude then the silence got to her and she shifted to shattuck avenue the core of the gourmet ghetto the cafés that lined the street teemed with life as much a concept as a place the ghetto featured an architectural mix like berkeley itself that refused to conform to anything resembling a standard fussy victorian morphed to arts and crafts california bungalow to deco to fifties dingbat there were a few nods to the contemporary but permits were hard to come by and developers often gave up though shed never admit it to anyone davida had long come to realize that berkeley like any other small affluent town had its own conservative core change was threatening unless it toed the party line in this case the party was hers and she loved the controlled heterogeneity walking with her head down she trudged up shattuck breathing in lungfuls of foggy saline air ducking into her office she checked the messages on her cell there were dozens of them but the only one that interested her was from don once upon a time she had known his number by heart a lifetime ago she hit the green call button his wife answered hi jill its davi ill get don for you thank you their typical conversation five words from jill newell was a discourse the woman just couldnt get past her husbands old high school romance davida thought jills pettiness astounding after all these years especially considering who davida was but forget logic jill simply hated her don came on the line congresswoman grayson detective newell whats the word actually i do have some news we got a couple of eyewitnesses on your egg throwers couple of moron brothers brent and ray nutterly we paid them a visit at their trailer which conveniently reeked of weed theyre spending the night in the slammer courtesy of spd we may be able to send them up for six months to a year for what they did to you but they arent going to do any hard time tell the da to go for the max davida grayson brandnew convert to tough sentencing absolutely said don everyone from the chief on down is pissed at them for making us look bad toss the capital police into the equation and theyre definitely not winning any popularity contests he lowered his voice davy i dont have to tell you this but you know there are others waiting in the wings who are a lot more malicious than those two assholes think about hiring a bodyguard not a chance just until you get further along on your bill all that walking around exactly i need mobility and accessibility thanks for your concern don now i have another favor my moms due to come home in about an hour hour and a half shes been looking a little feeble and refuses to have anyone live with her guillermo will drop her off but at this hour i dont like her being conspicuous could you send a squad car past her house just to make sure shes okay not a problem when are you going to be in the neighborhood ive been thinking about a barbecue sounds great don but you know how swamped ive been i know say hello to jill and the kids for me didnt jill answer the phone she didnt seem too loquacious there was a pause before he answered thats jill after the phone rang three times minette picked up the receiver she was finishing up the last of her bourbon and the smoky aftertaste lingered on her palate just as cigarettes had lingered back in the good old nicotine days she stretched on the sofa and caressed her body tonight she had on a lacy red uplift bra matching thong and thighhigh stockings purchased at good vibrations shed looked forward all day to peeling them off in front of her partner slowly agonizingly slowly the thought of stripping made her horny she whispered an enticing hello into the receiver davida said hi honey hello minette hoped she didnt sound as drunk as she felt ive been waiting for you ooh that sounds good was the answer over the line then the pause minette hated ive got some pressing paperwork tonight min its going to take some time for me to go through all of it how long is some time a minute an hour a day a week more than a minute and less than a week minette did not laugh davida tried to keep her patience she knew min had been drinking because she was slurring her words but now was not the right time to get into it ive got a committee hearing on the bill in two days the wording needs to be perfect or some yahoos going to jump on it another committee and two more after that but things will ease up soon i promise no they wont said minette youll find some other cause to rob all your time davida tried to change the subject did you finalize the tecate reservation yes why do i have to cancel it no no the entire week is engraved into my blackberry i cant wait me neither but minette couldnt muster up much enthusiasm davida had aborted their spa vacation at rancho la puerta twice before when are you coming home ill try to make it before one but dont wait up meaning she wasnt coming home minette sighed stroked a lace bra cup hooked a thumb inside dont work so hard baby thanks for being so understanding honey i love you minettes i love you too was cut short by the click pouting she hung up nine thirtyfive and she looked and felt every bit as sexy the evening was still very much alive she pressed a memorized set of numbers into her cell phone then hit the send button when the caller answered minette tried to steady her voice as expected shes coming home very late tonight if at all what are your plans well i guess im coming over to your place how long will that take give me an hour to make excuses ill see you then oh and pick up a bottle of knob creek minette said were out of joy juice the call came in at eight twentytwo am just enough time to interrupt will barness treadmill torture every day he blasted his joints into oblivion with the faint hope that the mindless machine would increase his life expectancy wills father and grandfather had died of heart disease in their early sixties wills cardiologist said his ticker looked great but the unspoken message got through take special care he slowed the pace said barnes the loo said davida grayson was found dead in her office barnes was so stunned that he almost tripped hopping off the machine he wrapped a towel around his thick sweaty neck what the hell happened thats what youre supposed to figure out ill meet you at the crime scene amanda is also on her way lucky for you youve got a pard who knows how to work the media because this is going to be high profile cap has scheduled a press conference at eleven town hall meeting will be at seven tonight we need a quick close will before the community goes haywire can i put my pants on first sure you can even do it one leg at a time william tecumseh barnes was a wideshouldered guy with a footballflattened nose and soft blue eyes prone to a beer gut and a double chin he sometimes reckoned himself over the hill but women liked those baby blues and he had his own hair most of it still brown with a dusting of pewter at the temples hed gone from high school halfback to the army to law enforcement spending fifteen years at sacramento pd ten as a homicide detective until family matters brought him to the bay area wills only sibling jack was a gay man who made a living out of being a gay man jack had moved from sacramento to san francisco at sixteen and by twenty had been a wellknown activist a fanatical inyourface kind of guy whod managed to offend everyone will knew the abrasiveness went beyond idealism hed spent half his youth cleaning up jacks messes but family was family even if will hadnt ever really understood his brother when jack was murdered their parents were long gone and will faced his grief alone as the case grew cold he knew what he had to do recently divorced with no kids or baggage keeping him in the capital he requested a temporary leave of absence that turned into two years as he searched for his brothers killer bit by bit as he probed into jacks death he came to know jacks life jacks friends grew to trust him confided in him related snippets that came together like the squares of a patchwork quilt in the end jacks death turned out to be one of those stupid homicides an argument with the wrong person when it was time to return to sacramento will discovered that he loved the beauty of the bay area and had grown to respect albeit in a begrudging way the political diversity he applied to berkeley pd because a detective position had just opened and because chasing down his brothers killer had left him drained and exhausted and it seemed like a cushy smalltown job not this morning with davida grayson a vic will showered and shaved and locked up his piece of california real estate a twobedroom onebath eighthundredsquarefoot bungalow when will plunked down a thirtyfivethousanddollar deposit on it fifteen years ago it had been a dump now his mess was fixed up and prettified and damn if it wasnt the best investment he had ever made the area around graysons district office on shattuck was roped off with yellow tape all the magpies were in place local tv radio the papers barnes spied laura novacente from the berkeley crier and gave her a wave theyd dated a couple of years ago and though it had ended it had not ended badly laura weaved and elbowed herself through the throng and sidled up to him making sure to give a little hiptohip contact whats going on willie you tell me laura barnes looked around for amanda isis his partner lived in san francisco in a twentythreeroom pacific heights mansion overlooking everything it would take her at least another half hour to make it over the bridge you got here before i did lady you dont listen to your own scanners not at eight in the morning i dont i heard she was shot in the head then you heard more than i did give me something willie he sized laura up with a swift sweep of the baby blues ten years younger than him with long gray hair that flew in the wind like the mane of a galloping horse still that trim figure he wondered why the two of them had gone south captains arranged some kind of press conference i thought we were friends he loved the urgency in her voice had heard it many times before in a different context your number is still lodged in my brain laura if i find out anything ill give you a ring maybe we can meet the usual place im a creature of habit laura davida was slumped over her desk face cradled in the crook of her arms as if shed been napping away her last moments on earth detective amanda isis preferred to think that the transition from a temporary sleep to a permanent had been painless the nape of davidas neck was blown wide open pellets hitting with enough force to shred her spinal cord just about decapitated amanda was mediumsized slim thirtyeight delicately beautiful with honeycolored hair layered short and enormous brown eyes she had on a charcoal pantsuit that didnt show the dirt armani couture but tailored to look runofthemill the scene was gruesome and bloody with crimson spray all over the desk and the walls not at all the kind of murder that amanda was used to seeing when bpd dealt with homicides they were usually drug killings confined to the dark alleys of the west berkeley region brutal but ultimately mundane crimes that often germinated in oakland amanda studied the body again someone had been serious when she looked closely she could see shotgun pellets embedded in flesh brushing honeycolored locks from her eyes she turned to will this is nauseating lots of spraya couple of partial shoeprints barnes pointed to several spots if the past is any predictor of the future someone somewhere is dumping bloody clothing but the idiots always think twice about tossing the shoes who called the murder in jerome melchior davidas chief aide ive got him stowed away in a cruiser drinking coffee hoping we can steady his nerves id like to interview him while his memory is fresh get him away from the magpies before the press conference barnes checked his watch weve only got about an hour mandy ready to hustle go interview him ill take over here then while im working the microphones with the brass you can have a look around and well compare notes you got it his perfectly organized partner after a year they synched well like a nicely tuned clock will hadnt been thrilled to work with someone whod married into a hundred million bucks had heard the icequeen dilettante chatter figured how could it be otherwise but amanda worked as hard as anyone harder maybe those lottery winners who claimed theyd never quit their day jobs were righteous she smoothed the jacket of one of those designer pantsuits with gloved hands took another look at davida and shook her head you ever have any dealings with her will not professionally barnes sighed shes a sacramento girl i knew her well barnes shook his head her older sister glynnis was a couple of years younger than me she died when davida was a kid my brother jack knew davida in high school they ran in different circles but i know when she came out in her senior year it had a big impact on jack he turned to face her what about you and larry you guys go to parties with pols good deduction detective barnes yeah ive run into her a few times but no extended conversations she came across as a reasonable person not propolice but not as antagonistic as some of the others weve had when she talked though she got animated i guess that was passion about what she believed in if youre passionately for something chances are theres somebody thats passionately against the same thing the stemcell deal that egging last week said amanda wonder if spd has anything on that i still know people over there ill check maybe we should visit the capital amanda suggested scope out her enemies and her friends at the capital they can be one and the same sure good idea but i think hobnobbing with those in the know is more up your alley mandy whats your forte compadre talking to her folk amanda knew he meant the gay and lesbian community of all the contacts that a detective might cultivate she couldnt have thought of a more odd combination than will and gays but he got info from them like no one else could perhaps they trusted him because he was the last person in the world to be condescending or patronizing sure you dont want to take on the gray suits willie it was originally your territory my territory but never my people jerome melchior sat with his head between his knees in the backseat of the cruiser he was compact with weightlifter arms that stretched the sleeves of his black longsleeved tee weeping his eyes out melchior looked up as barnes approached deepset dark eyes cinnamon hair highlighted gold and cut close to the skull he wiped his eyes dropped his head again barnes slid in next to him horrible morning mr melchior im sorry melchior sucked in air i thought she was sleeping sometimes she does that falls asleep at her desk the aide nodded when she pulls an allnighter how often was that more often lately because of her bill stemcell bill yes barnes patted melchiors shoulder melchior straightened and threw his head back and stared at the roof of the police car my god i cant believe this barnes gave him time when did you realize she was dead i dont know why i just came over and gave her a gentle shake on the shoulder when i pulled my hand away there was blood on my fingers it didnt register at firstthen itdid melchior reached around and touched the nape of his neck the hole barnes took out a notepad so nothing immediately clued you in that something was wrong nothing looked out of place if thats what you mean he regarded barnes i touched her again blood all over my hands im sure i left bloody fingerprints oh god is that going to mess up your investigation not since youve told me your call came in to dispatch at around eight in the morning how long after the discovery did it take you to call emergency abouttwo minutes maybe less but i was so fuckedup i dialed instead of i was shaking so hard thats normal mr melchior lets talk about ms grayson politicians have lots of people who dont like their views anyone in particular stand out not enough to kill her give me names anyway im talking other representatives said melchior they may be sleazy but theyre notokay okaymark decody from orange countyalisa lawrence from san diego couldnt stand davida either theyre both republicans she was also having some problems with a democrat in name only artis handel hes actually been the most ferocious about the bill why catholic and makes a big point of it the whole abortionfetus thing anyone else theres a civilian a nutcase really harry modell executive director of some fringe group called families under god were talking extremists ive heard their unspoken motto is kill liberals not babies hes a kook and a grandstander cant say ive ever thought of him as this bad butwho knows howd davida react to the egg throwers that melchior frowned she sloughed it off as crazy kids i agreed but now melchior cried some more when he was through barnes offered him more coffee no thanks anything else youd like to say or add that you think might help no im sorry how about i call you in a day or so sometimes after the shock wears off you remember things sure in the meantime barnes took out his card if you think of anything else that might help me out give me a call melchior stuck the card in a trouser pocket one more thing sir would you happen to know any of representative graysons passwords for her computer why stupid question but barnes had heard so many of those in situations like these there may be important information in there the entire machine will be taken to an expert wholl dissect it but any help you can give us now to speed up the investigation would be appreciated well said melchior once in a while she did ask me to check her emailwhen her laptop wasnt working or he took barness pad give me a few minutes to think take your time when the aide was finally able to focus barnes had a list of five passwords thats great sir would you like an officer to take you home that would be nice melchior smiled your brother was a legend especially in his own mind melchior gave an honest laugh he seemed very passionate i didnt know him well that makes two of us the scene had become dense with live bodies skittering around like ants two csu techs a police photographer a pair of investigators from the coroners office tandy halligan big and tall and female derrick coltrain small black and male hows the hubby coltrain asked amanda retirement doesnt wear well on him ten years ago shed met lawrence isis a halfirish halfegyptian copt software engineer at a campus concert celtic folk music amanda had gone on a lark a friends urging the chemistry had been instant despite the fact that larry resembled woody allen with dark hair and a terrific tan hed signed on early at google rose through the company accruing stock lots of stock after living well below their means in amandas oakland condo theyd made the quantum leap to the mansion two years ago seventeen rooms still empty but amanda loved the echoes larry though needed a hobby derrick coltrain said i wouldnt mind early retirement if i had all the toys giving her a curious look the unspoken message what the hell are you doing here on a day like this good question shed gone through graysons phone had progressed to the representatives stateissued blackberry the womans life had been a series of endless meetings over the last two years shed scheduled one vacation a trip to tecate mexico probably the spa amanda and larry had been there she loving the exercise he bemoaning the lack of wireless coltrain said whats he into the genius hes thinking of starting up another business hey let me know when hes about to go public tandy halligan said by the time it goes public itll be too late she began the process of examining the body going slowly nervous which wasnt like her but what if the head detached from the body carefully she lifted each hand examined digits closely no ligature marks on the wrists fingers and nails look clean and undisturbed doesnt appear theres much if anything to scrape steeling herself she rotated the head to get a side view of the face no scratch marks on the right sidenone on the left either but there is a sizeable bruise on her forehead she was sitting at her desk someone came from behind shot her and she fell forward amanda said or she napped through the whole thing and the impact bounced her forehead into the desk the floor is old wood planks it squeaks when you walk on it alone late at night if she was awake shed have heard someone behind her tandy said unless she was too focused like talking on the phone or typing amanda wondered if there had been an intruder no pry marks on the front entrance the lock was a dead bolt solid in working order the windows also appeared untouched or she wasnt concerned because it was someone she knew which doesnt negate the sneakupandblow scenario if the killer paid her two visits the first was a ruse to get the door unlocked the second was to blast her derrick coltrain said can i suggest something sometimes representatives make a fetish about keeping their doors open to be accessible kind of a berkeley thing at that hour no answer amanda said any idea when she was murdered maybe six to eight hours ago but thats just a guess will entered the office and heard that between two and four am its a guess said tandy ask dr srinivasan amanda said no pries on windows or doors you know her to leave her door open she had a rep for hospitality barnes said continuous coffeepot plate of crullers for anyone who stopped in including the homeless it was chilly last night maybe she let one of them crash in the outer office while she worked maybe he had a psychotic break a homeless man with a shotgun barnes shrugged amanda said i went through her cell calls last night lots came in but she only returned a few one she returned was to a donald newell in sacramento donnies a homicide detective barnes sighed i think they were friends in high school another homeboy how big was your town big but small shit i wonder if donnie knows ill give him a call simultaneously they looked back at the body tandy was in the process of wrapping it up in plastic sheeting when screaming outside the office froze her through the window amanda saw two policemen trying to restrain a hysterical young woman she was trim with shoulderlength platinum hair pink cheeks and marilyn monroe lips tight black leotard top over lowrider jeans highheeled sandals the two detectives rushed outside whats going on im going in screamed the blonde bastards the cops looked to the detectives amanda said crime scene no entrance the young woman cursed her cheeks were tearstreaked her eyes were bloodshot and her breath reeked of alcohol do you know who i am no maam her lover did you hear me her goddamnfucking lover sorry for your loss said barnes you still cant go in there but lets talk said amanda she placed her arm around the blondes shoulders closing her nostrils to the booze stink a smell she knew so well growing up the blonde relaxed sniffed im minette her lover amanda motioned the cops to let her go lets go somewhere quiet minette it took all of amandas emotional and physical energy to ease the woman away from the scene and into a squad car minette the lover sobbed until shed cried herself dry amanda offered her a tissue thank you im so sorry minette whats your last name please minette padgett what hahappened were at the beginning of the investigation minette i wish i could give you some details but i cant but shesgone feeble hope in her voice this part never got any easier im sorry but she is gone fresh batch of tears an explosion of grief minette right now were getting information about davida is there anything about her life that might help us out what do you mean like did she have enemies she had a slew of them assholes in the capital hated her because she was gay lots of people didnt like her messing with stem cells we got some names from her aide harold modell motherfucker mark decody and alisa lawrence motherfuckersss artis handel turncoat minette looked up she expected grief from the others but artishes a democrat she was especially upset about him anything more you can tell me about any of them minette thought a moment then slowly shook her head they were just giving her a hard time politics anybody else i should know about i dont knowi cant think my head isi cant think what about personal relationships minette did she have any problems with friends or relatives her mothers a profound pain in the ass but thats just the usual motherdaughter thing she doesnt have any sibs her father lives in florida in case you want to talk to him why would i want to talk to him because hes an asshole and deserted davida emotionally after he remarried amanda wrote that down anyone else a pretty brow knitted then returned to youthful serenity look i just cant process right now a big sigh has anyone called her mother well take care of that thanks cause i sure dont want to do it the old bitch doesnt like me never did no matter how hard i tried why do you think that is i dont know if i did id work on it sometimes its like that you know people take an instant dislike to you sometimes i take an instant dislike to someone in lucilles case i think we took an instant dislike to each other tell me about your relationship with davida minette snapped her head up what about it i know this sounds insensitive but i have to ask it ms padgett were there any problems between you two the young woman shot her a look of disgust no there werent any problems between us two ive been married for ten years ms padgett there are always ups and downs please dont take it personally minette didnt answer but it was clear from the look on her face that she wasnt mollified so things were fine i think i already answered that minette faced amanda so youll call the old lady yes good because i got a lot of shit to deal with and someone has to start making arrangements it might as well be her my god davida dead don newells voice bellowed through the phone thats fucking crazy what the hell happened willie you know how it works don i wish i had more details but i dont davidaoh man thats at least tell me how she died barnes figured there was no sense being coy twelvegauge shotgun oh man a typical shotgun thing it was ugly donnie thats insanefuckingshit almighty does her mom know its being handled donnie if lucille grayson hasnt left for berkeley im taking her personally even if she has left im coming down newells basso was rimmed with a weird almost hysterical tension even allowing for the shock barnes wondered what the connection was between a married sacramento homicide cop and a gay representative now wasnt the time to press he said donnie everyone knows she had enemies in the capital that egging may have been more than a prank we could use you on home turf unless we get a quick solve down here my partner and i will be coming your way soon anyway there was a long pause will im not dumb and i know what youre thinking because if things were reversed id be thinking the same thing there was nothing between davida and me other than a casual friendship nothing get it sure do said barnes lying smoothly why would there be anything will davidas gay sure once we were close yeah yeah ill stay out of your business but i will talk to lucille two kids and now shes lost both of them don do me a favor assemble everything on davida that you can when i see you next itll be nice and official it is official will i mean its personal but its official too aint that the truth said barnes now i need to get this out in the open don you talk to her last night checked her cell said newell yeah sure i called her because we arrested a couple of white tower boys for the egging brent and ray nutterly but i know it wasnt them who killed her because we put their asses in jail what about their buddies in the organization we were just starting to work that angle as a matter of fact because of other things what other things a couple of months ago she got an anonymous threatening letter lowlevel stuff you know letters cut out of a magazine we could never could trace it to anyone specific but i wanted to do more davida said no didnt want me making a big deal about it she said too much of that kind of publicity gave the bastards what they wanted and made her look bad look bad how she was big on her public image gay and progressive but above the fray her words she also didnt want anyone to think that she wasnt accessible looks like she was too fucking accessible i should have been more insistent damn it just last night i told her to think about hiring a bodyguard she blew me off tell me more about her political enemies enemies is too strong a word id call them opponents no one crazy enough to kill her will did she ever talk to you about specific people she was afraid of first of all we didnt talk on a regular basis second if she did dont you think ida told you paranoia wasnt davidas style just the opposite she minimized danger when this letter thing came up she was blasé to my eye the woman was never afraid of anything while the loo the captain and amanda isis fielded questions from the firestoking press and strident community activists ready to be outraged about anything barnes went through the evidence picked up by csu doorknobs had been wiped clean a tell in itself that supported premeditation but a partial bloody thumbprint was found on an interior jamb bloody shoeprints were of interest as were multiple red fibers stray hairs a used coffee cup and a cigarette pathology would analyze forensic information taken off the body amanda had gone through davidas cell phone and her blackberry that left barnes with the onerous and timeconsuming task of scouring davidas computer desk calendar business files and written correspondence with melchiors password list in front of him he sat down flexed his fingers and began several screen names appeared but none of them looked to be an official representative address with thegov suffix an hour of trial and error later he hit the winning combination screen name dgray password lucyg her mom as entry to cyberspace fortyeight emails he printed them all out the vast majority were what seemed to be inconsequential communications from friends and community members a few were personal mostly from mins two of those graphically sexual lovers hot to trot there didnt seem to be anything overtly hostile in any of the exchanges with minette padgett although in two of the letters mins complained about the long hours that davida was keeping so did lucillegraysoneasymailnet mom was very unhappy about davidas lack of attention to her own wellbeing her latest one implored her daughter to be careful something beyond the egging mom was a mustinterview barnes felt someone looking over his shoulder max flint the csu computer guy you got into her email im impressed i had a cheat sheet barnes gave flint the list of passwords should i be looking for anything specific barnes checked his notes dig up whatever you can find regarding the victim and representatives alisa lawrence mark decody artis handel and eileen ferunzio he spelled eileens last name she was doing political battle with all of them and i heard some of it was intense plus theres a guy harry modell executive director of families under god see if he wrote anything threatening to her finally give me anything that mightve been sent by the white tower radicals looks like they were behind the egging and possibly a threatening note lots of enemies flint said she was a politician when the woman stepped outside of the silver cadillac fleetwood brougham both barnes and amanda took note of how dignified she looked head held high shoulders back thin as paper in a black suit white silk blouse seamed stockings and orthopedic pumps straining to be fashionable atop her gray coif was a black pillbox hat fronted by a small veil a uniformed chauffeur held her arm and propelled her forward taking her other arm was a rawboned stoopshouldered man of medium height and weight his tightly waved hair was equal parts sand and salt but his handlebar mustache was completely white the donnie newell that barnes remembered was a skinny blond kid skateboarding up and down the basketball courts getting in everyones way neighborhood boys used to call him surfer joe a ludicrous moniker because sacramento was hot and dry and hours from the ocean in a snapshot of time donnie had turned middleaged so what did that say about barnes he glanced at amanda the woman was married to a gazillionaire and was pushing forty but she was beautiful bright funny and couldve passed for a grad student if you scratched the designer duds born under a lucky star he harbored a pang of envy then his eyes went back to lucille graysons withdrawn face staring out at nothing with vacant eyes both kids gone hell on earth what a jerk he was for being petty on the other side of the crimescene tape the captain was still answering press questions good it kept the focus away from lucille amanda saw him studying the old woman as you remember her she looks older but not that much older i think women of that generation dressed dowdier or maybe i should say age appropriate man id like to have a nickel for every fiftyplus woman i see walking around in a miniskirt barnes raised his eyebrows not that im complaining amanda tolerated the borderlineletch dialogue everyone had to deal with sorrow in their own way the two detectives began walking toward lucille but before they could formally introduce themselves ruben morantz emerged from the crowd and intercepted offering the frail woman his hand and a round of sympathy maybe some of it was heartfelt barnes allowed the mayor of berkeley had known davida grayson for years and had worked with her on various committees though they had had their conflicts they had also shared victories morantz was slight and mildlooking with a narrow torso and sloping shoulders innocuous on first impression but the restless brown eyes dazzling white smile and perpetual tan were pure politician hizzoner wore a long black coat over a white shirt gold tie and tan slacks pointy toes of lizardskin cowboy boots poked under the break of his pants while he and lucille chatted barnes managed to grab donnie newells attention donnie excused himself and walked over lookin good willie i think the climate agrees with you you dont look so bad yourself a little thicker in the gut a little grayer in the head thats how it goes barnes made introductions and then looked back at the old woman poor lucille i dont know how shes standing on two feet shes tough but how much can even a tough woman take losing two children the mayor led lucille away from the crowd and back to the limo which the two of them entered amanda regarded newell how well do you know mrs grayson davida used to have me look in on her once in a while newell smiled at amanda guess i should bring you up to speed davida and i were an item in high school she came out her senior year but i suspected something wasnt right long before she liked towell experiment is the best way i can say it i didnt care i had more fun with that girl she was a pistol she and her best friend jane meyerhoff cant tell you her latest married name dont reckon if i ever knew it shes had so many i heard the last one ended really messy newell turned to barnes janey lives here now doesnt she barnes nodded he knew all about janey because hed picked her up at a bar and theyd dated a few times janey wasnt so much a pistol as a machine gun bring the file donnie newell held up a manila envelope been looking into the nutterly brothers far as i can tell these two boys are a step below neanderthal but that doesnt mean theyre not dangerous stupid and mean is a dangerous combination right still i dont think theyd act without receiving orders from someone else and who might the ordergiver be barnes asked the head of the white tower radicals is a guy named marshall bledsoe who lives in idaho i know bledsoe barnes said when i was in sacramento he was rumored to be the main architect of the synagogue bombings thats twenty years ago he was a madman then i dont see him getting sane magically but from bombs to eggs unless that was a ruse newell said barnes ran with the idea davidas thinking that whoevers after her is gunning for her in the capital then they get her in the safety of her own office along those lines the threatening letter was sent to her in sacramento what threatening letter amanda asked and barnes realized hed forgotten to tell her newell opened up the envelope and showed them a copy magazine letters of all shapes and colors cut and pasted to form an ominous message immorality leads to death it seemed like a silly prank the kind of thing amanda might have laughed off as some nutcase gone awry with a scissors and stack of people magazines any idea of the authorship no prints or fibers or saliva it was dropped off in a taped envelope with no return address no stamp or cancellation marks either someone dropped it in her mail slot in sacramento that narrows it down to about a million people i wanted to pursue it but davida nixed questioning her colleagues she was trying to woo a couple of detractors hoping to sway them to see the light and didnt want the police turning them hostile so we dropped it newell grimaced in light of what happened big mistake barnes asked were you thinking the white tower was behind it at that point i didnt because they hadnt bothered her yet bledsoes still in idaho newell nodded it would be nice if he stepped over the border hes got some outstanding traffic warrants here in california something was tickling barness brain as he watched as hizzoner and lucille grayson emerge from the back of the limo the old woman remained erect and dryeyed soon the shock would lift and grief would engulf her he needed to talk to her while she could still talk wheres mrs grayson going donnie to see her lawyer final arrangements amanda said would you mind introducing her to usor rather me you people already know each other its been awhile barnes said then he remembered what was nagging at his brain doesnt marshall bledsoes mother live in la newell shrugged dont know i think she does san fernando valley as i recall now thanksgiving is whata week away i wonder if marshall will be paying mom a visit barnes smiled if he has warrants we have probable cause ill have to coordinate with lapd amanda said in the meantime lets talk to lucille grayson then i want to poke around the capital i know some politically connected people so maybe i wont be as threatening as don plus youre a lot prettier and tons more charming newell said amandas smile started off frosted but thawed in a nanosecond people may like me but no one doesnt love my husbands money willie barnes lucille eyed him head to toe you grew up and you got old barnes winked that about sums it up mrs grayson the old woman sighed i never did get a chance to tell you how sorry i was about your brother jack you sent me a lovely sympathy card maam did i yes you did i appreciated it and wrote you back well thennow im telling you in person how sorry i was mrs grayson i am so sorry about davida she was a fine woman and a real asset to this community she was loved respected and admired it is a profound loss for everyone but my heart goes out to you im truly sorry lucille nodded thank you will this is my partner detective isis maam barnes watched lucille give amanda a polite nod amanda said solving this isnt only our top priority its berkeley s top priority the old woman nodded and turned back to barnes what do you think about the mayor willie thrown by the question barnes formulated his answer as quickly as he could hes very concerned maam concerned for davida or concerned for the towns image when barnes didnt answer she said i have an appointment with my lawyer in a half hour if you need to reach me ill be at the club for the next couple of days thank you mrs grayson i appreciate your cooperation could you spare a few minutes for a couple of questions the old woman didnt agree but she didnt walk away amanda went first did davida express any concerns for her safety after the recent incident in the capital i was much more concerned than davida lucille raked nails down her cheek creating temporary stigmata my daughter was fearless she looked at newell for confirmation you remember those nazis dont you willie i dont know the nutterly brothers but i sure as hell remember marshall bledsoe donnie tells me he moved to idaho but hes still got followers in sacramento and i see him around from time to time newell said do you maam when was the last time the old womans eyes clouded id saylast yearmaybe it was longer but im sure he goes back and forth amanda said next time you see him mrs grayson give us a call right away he has outstanding traffic warrants in the state of california so we can arrest him thats all youve got on him lucille said traffic warrants its enough to bring him in especially if you think he had something to do with davidas death id certainly look at him first also that modell man he used to send her the nastiest mail harry modell barnes said seeing amandas inquisitive look he added families under god ill fill you in newell said she never mentioned any hate mail from him davida thought he was a crackpot lucille said she thought the letters were funny although i failed to see any humor in them she showed you the letters amanda asked yes she did i kept a few of them i thought she should send them to the police but she refused and she forbade me to do it said it was a waste of their valuable time you wouldnt still have those letters would you amanda asked of course i have them in my files at home i wanted to keep themjust in case without warning the old womans eyes watered she unfolded a silk handkerchief and dabbed her eyes amanda said who else should we be looking at mrs grayson ohi dont know what about her partner minette the old womans eyes narrowed what about her howd they get along for starts ill give you my observations but im warning you theyre colored i dont like the girl why not barnes said i think shes a mooch an attention seeker and a drunk when davida first introduced us it was hate at first sight but i could tell davida was smitten the girl was a gorgeous thing about five years ago in that showgirl way now the bourbons caught up with her lucille lowered her voice my daughter never said a word about their relationship good or bad but lately i could tell there were problems how so amanda asked during our lunches and dinners the girl was constantly callinginterrupting i could tell that davy was not happy shed get this tight look around her eyes and whisper something like can we talk about this later not a single meal passed without intrusion a wistful sigh and i saw davy so seldom but you never heard davida complain about minette only to say that the girl didnt like her keeping such long hours probably the only thing the girl and i ever agreed on lucille peered into amandas eyes now im not saying that the girl had anything to do with davidas death but i am saying that there was a reason that davida spent so much time away do you think its possible that davida was seeing someone else amanda asked lucille shrugged well let me put it to you this way her father never placed a premium on fidelity if that was the only bad trait that davy inherited from him she did quite well there were numerous cafés in downtown berkeley but for some reason barnes always went to melanies a little holeinthewall that served a mean bran and raisin muffin and a decent cup of nofrills coffee of late barnes was adding milk to the froufrou level because his stomach rebelled when he drank too much black melanies was about half a storefront wide and when the place got crowded he had to walk through the door sideways laura novacente was sitting at what used to be their favorite corner table her long gray hair tied up in a knot when he sat down opposite her she slid the cappuccino in front of him hey there hows it going youre looking good i like that red dress on you brings out your coloring the tape recorder is going smoothguy laura pointed to a small lump under a napkin barnes smiled it was a compliment if i get slapped with sexual harassment youre going to be hearing from my attorney for entrapment what entrapment the red dress it brings out your coloring laura laughed is your attorney cute shes very cute they drank coffee for several moments laura said time for business do you have something i can print all business i dont waste the papers money on flirting how about this said barnes we are still at an initial inquiry stage exploring all open avenues laura got that imhungryandgrumpy look you can do better will barnes reached over uncovered the tape recorder switched it off and looked her in the eye ive got about five minutes before someone realizes im not where im supposed to be in short we got plenty of suspects but no good ones what about her partner minette what about her i heard there was trouble in paradise like what just that rumors thanks ill look into it cmon willie i promise i wont print anything just give me an idea of what youre thinking your promises arent worth much laura she showed teeth neither are yours darling but lets not hold it against either one of us okay he leaned over the table so close he could smell her perfume were working on minettes alibi she claims she was with a friend part of the night but not the entire night whos the friend shes not too forthcoming on that were looking into it any suggestions i hear minette was in and out of a series of relationships before she settled down with davida shes pissed off a lot of people she also drinks willie nodded that doesnt surprise you davidas mother called minette a drunk think shes cheating on davida i wouldnt be surprised laura took a sip of her café mocha i gave you something so how about a little reciprocity davida had lots of enemies in the capital and the skys blue so what everyone knows the capital runs on bile but how many politicians are mowed down with a twelvegauge shotgun who told you about the weapon word gets around laura ran a finger across her lips barnes stared at her she said loose lips at the crime scene your own people great anything else i should know about dont be sulky will its how i make my living how about giving me something that every other reporter doesnt have with her tentacles maybe shed learn something and trade it back to him were investigating some hate mail from you can use the hatemail part but not the name agreed absolutely i mean it laura so do i whos the hatemailer some whack job named harry modell executive director of families under god ever hear of them i have modell sent her nasty stuff huh according to lucille grayson the old woman still has the letters plus and you can print this rumor has it that ray and brent nutterly from the white tower radicals are going to be charged with the egging incident police have eyewitnesses including several who recorded the whole incident on their phone videos you want more information talk to detective don newell sac pd thats good will i can run with that thanks so much touching his hand he said speaking of running id better get back the white tower boys laura said theyre into survivalism and a shotguns a hunting weapon unfortunately the nutterly brothers were behind bars last night so it wasnt them barnes stood up i took a chance meeting you like this laura i appreciate it dinner sometime her smile was wistful i wish you had asked me two weeks ago seeing someone barnes working his smile hard good for you her cheeks were flushed she touched her hair it probably wont work out but what the hell willie live dangerously since lucille grayson was staying in berkeley for the night don newell and amanda isis took the train to sacramento together leaving barnes behind with the nasty job of sorting through thousands of davidas computer files decoded easily by max flint seated in a comfortable chair rocked by amtraks wheels the sacramento detective was fighting the urge to sleep he glanced at his seatmate a few calls had filled in her history a google gazillionaire and definitely someone with clout by the time they stepped onto the train she had appointments with three different state reps now she was napping pretty face all peaceful and unlined newell forced his eyes open lucille grayson had chosen to remain in berkeley until the body was released and entrusted him with a key to her house and directions where to look for harry modells hate letters newell had called up his partner banks henderson and told him to meet him there at the old ladys place with an spd video cam and a civilian witness he didnt want to be accused of planting anything he sneaked a sidelong glance at amanda goodlooking woman greatlooking really with that soft skin kind of a fiftiesmoviestar glamour maybe she knew she was being watched because she woke up and got back to work on her starbucks without looking at newell she began writing furiously in her pad inspiration newell wasnt so much curious as he was trying to stay awake making conversation with a pretty woman was a bonus amanda looked up just writing down any possible questions i can think of for the pols cmon he said whats the likelihood that its a politician low i grant you but so many of these people attract hangerson and whackos itd be stupid not to ask them right she gave newell a hard look he said nothing is there a problem she said my operating in your territory not mine at all capital police territory we just cover the real people newells smile didnt get amandas lips curving no no problem even if it was my turf i was just thinking out loud truth is i have seen plenty of those yokels and no matter how they undermine each other on one bill next day theyve got their arms around each other on another one take davida shes worked on several projects with eileen ferunzio and at that time they were the best of friends you kept in contact with davida wed run into each other now and then like i said work brings me to the cap i used to see eileen and davida eating lunch together all the time newell shrugged not so much lately any occasional lunches between you and davida newells smile was easy but cold oh i see where this is going let me get it on the table we were just friendsnot even close friends my wife didnt like her whys that jills just that way she met the woman and took an instant dislike to her every time davida called i knew it was her by the look on jills face whyd davida call you i was her contact in the police department she was my contact in the halls of government mutually beneficial relationship but nothing more the woman was gay amanda that means she dont like men some gays have relationships with the opposite sex well if she was doing a guy i didnt know about it why would i we didnt work like that amanda nodded you dont mind my asking you these questions do you don not at all he said glibly its good for me gives me empathy for what its like on the other side of the table winding through the berkeley hills on streets barely wide enough for a compact barnes went over the crime scene in his mind after much prodding and some notsosubtle threats minette padgett had finally coughed up an alibi name kyle bosworth hadnt said much over the phone other than to admit being with minette from ten pm to a little past two when barnes wanted to interview him in person bosworth balked but barnes assured him it wouldnt take more than a half hour of his time besides it was better to have such interviews prearranged than to have the police barge in on him finding the address barnes wedged his tiny wheels into a half space and felt lucky to get that the sidewalks were pushed up and cracked from majestic pines that shadowed postcard lawns about half of the houses were turn of the century mostly california bungalows the others were expensive remodels up in the hills the real estate like the air was rarefied a tall emaciated man answered barness knock his amber hair was messy his brown eyes raw and red and drooping he wore a blue flannel robe over red flannel pajamas sheepskin slippers on narrow pale feet he gave barnes a quick onceover mr bosworth in person would you like to see some identification not necessary you look like a cop bosworths smile was feeble hollywoods image of a cop barnes went inside those guys are macho and goodlooking yeah but theres always one guyhow should i put it you know the older craggy one who drinks too much but still shows the rookies how its done thats me huh thats you have a seat do you want some coffee i wouldnt mind barnes remained standing did i wake you mr bosworth actually minette woke me the first time she called she was hysterical and she made me hysterical it took a valium to calm me down what time was that right after she heard the news about eight thirty maybe the second time was a half hour ago what did you two talk about she said the cops were probably going to ask me questions did she tell you anything else like what did she give you instructions what to say to me she told me to tell the truth and the truth is bosworth pointed to an oversized squareback oak chair with plump red cushions just what i told you i was with her from ten to about two in the morning what were you doing i was with her bosworth rubbed his eyes and yawned thats all you need to know barnes said do you have a livein partner mr bosworth bosworth looked at him interesting that you didnt ask me if i have a wife my brother was gay if i look like hollywood s crusty old cop you look like the goodlooking but dissolute gay interior designer set designer please i worked in hollywood for ten years ill go get some coffee when bosworth stepped into the kitchen barnes took a peek around the place the house wasnt large but it was done up nicely all the original mahogany woodwork had been refinished from the wainscoting to the crown molding leaded windows showcased a terrific view of the bay the craftsmanstyle furniture looked to be goodquality reproductions how do you take yours bosworth called from the kitchen a little milk and sugar bosworth returned with a mug on a red lacquer tray here you go thanks barnes took his coffee and finally sat down you referred to your brother in the past tense aids jack was murdered ten years ago his death is what brought me to berkeley oh jeez im sorry barnes sipped coffee placed the mug on the tray took out his pad and a pencil how long have you known minette weve traveled in the same circles for at least four years how long have you known her well about a year we hooked up at the gym both our partners keep long hours i prefer men she prefers women but both of us have an aversion to loneliness im sure yves suspects something although i doubt if he suspects its minette when he comes home theres always tasty food on the table and a clean house so he doesnt ask too many questions what does yves do hes a patent lawyer for micron industries theyre very demanding but hes paid extremely well where was he last night bosworth stared at him barnes smiled actually detective he was working at home when i told him i needed to visit a friend in trouble he barely looked up from his paperwork was he up when you came home yes and i suppose you can ask him what time i came home but id prefer that you dont tell him any more details than necessary did you know davida grayson as well as you knew minette bosworth laughed are you asking if i ever slept with davida i must really look like a stud barnes waited ive never slept with davida lately minette wasnt sleeping with her either she was beginning to wonder if there was someone else in davidas life did she mention any names the question gave bosworth pause i dont feel good getting someone involved based on minettes paranoia minettes paranoid she can be when she drinks bosworth sighed okay minette was sure davida was fooling around with a woman named alice kurtag dr alice kurtag shes a research scientist at the uc and her specialty is gene splicing shes a consultant on davidas bill it seemed normal to me that theyd spend a little extra time together barnes looked up from his notes and what did minette say to that she didnt say anything maybe shes just justifying her bad behavior by transferring it to davida do you know alice ive met her a couple of times at davidas parties is she gay i dont know both times i met her she wasnt with a man but that doesnt mean anything she was mixing but she wasnt flirting she just seemedi dont knowvery businesslike i dont know anything about science or politics so we didnt talk a lot mr bosworth would you mind if i tested your hands for gunshot residue me bosworth appeared shocked ive never held a gun in my life he held out his hands i just got a manicure yesterday will it ruin my nails its a simple swab called a dpa test if you fired a gun youll get little blue specks if you didnt you wont get any discoloration did minette agree to this she did the swab turned up negative do i have to agree to it no but why wouldnt you i dont like being considered a suspect when barnes didnt answer bosworth said look if i do it does that mean that you wont have to talk to yves about yesterday night not necessarily but if you dont have gunshot residue ill put you a little farther down on the list if yves verifies your story youll be way way down the list why would i make the list at all dont take it personally mr bosworth its a very long list finishing her meal eileen ferunzio wiped her mouth then reapplied her apricot shimmer lipstick amanda noticed that the state representative had barely made it through half of her caesar salad the woman looked drawn her complexion ashen except for two smudges of pink that ran along her cheekbones her eyes were an uneasy mixture of green and brown shifting with the intensity of the light eileen was a big woman five eight or nine with sturdy square shoulders long legs and a strong handshake at odds with all that were her tiny wrists today those wrists were adorned by a gold lady rolex and a gemstudded gold cuff bracelet amanda had met her at fundraisers and she greeted amanda by first name larrys money youre not hungry eileen how can i eat this whole thing is just terrible i eileens eyes moistened do you know why it happened i wish i did amanda put down her turkey wrap and wiped her mouth thats why im here what can you tell me about davida she was a colleague and a friend again eileens eyes moistened ive known her for a while even before she got elected to the house we worked together on various issues which issues davidas a lawyer you know she went to hastings yes i heard something about that amanda smiled at eileen which issues did you work with davida on she had worked as a lobbyist for the partnership against domestic violence she was very effective i of course am an activist in that area amanda said eileen i heard that you and she had been at odds on this latest bill hs the state representative looked away we had our differences sure she turned back to amanda what of it given your voting record i would have assumed that the bill was something you would have wholly endorsed then you would have been wrong tension in eileens voice amanda said what didnt you like about the bill just about everything eileen shook her head in theory cell lines and cell cloning seems to be the kind of issue that every liberal should get behind in reality we are pouring millions of dollars into something that has yet to be proven to be consistently if at all effective im progressive but i am fiscally responsible and the initiativebased institute has accomplished nothing so far i happen to believe there are sufficient monies allocated for stemcell research and related topics i didnt feel it was prudent to allocate the amount of money davida was talking about which was a half billion dollars over the next three years eileen said she was dreaming i told her to pare it down and then we could discuss the matter intelligently and who knows she might even be able to sway me she refused so i refused what did that do to your friendship eileens eyes narrowed what are you suggesting im just asking a question oh please eileens face darkened im not stupid and i resent the implication i had nothing to do with davidas death and ill take a liedetector test if you want to pursue this but it is beyond insulting where were you last night at home sleeping in bed with my husband not at the capital nor anywhere near berkeley eileens district was a sixhour car ride from davidas amanda asked how did you travel here this morning i took a seven oclock from my local airport anything else no offense intended eileen im doing my job eileen huffed i suppose you are but surely some independent thinking is called for then as if realizing something she flashed a sudden plastic smile im sorry amanda this is all just sotraumatic larrys money amanda smiled back just a few more questions sigh sure how did your opposition to the bill affect your friendship with davida it put a strain on it but we remained on speaking terms it certainly didnt discourage davida from calling me frequently trying to convince me to change my mind and i called her after the egging incident i told her how horrified i was what did she say she thanked me for my sympathies but she told me shed rather thank me for my support then she went to work on me again she was so persistent that i agreed to meet her later this week she seemed so pleased about that eileen swabbed her eyes with her napkin that was the last time i spoke to her if you want to find out who did this talk to those fascist cretins which cretins in particular the nutterly brothers they were in jail when davida was shot amanda there are a helluva lot more white tower boys than just the nutterly brothers and they all seem to congregate around sacramento why arent you talking to them theyre on our official list why are you talking to me first because you were her friend and i figured you could tell me who in the legislature was really after her eileen shook her head lord knows the legislature has its share of sobs but no one there would have killed her for gods sake stick around long enough were all at odds with one another sometimes thats just the nature of the beast did davida ever talk to you about harry modell that psychotic weirdo what about him i heard he sent her threatening letters he sends everyone threatening letters eileen blanched including you oh my god she whispered frantically do i have something to worry about do you still have the letters eileen in my nut file ill get them to you asap she signaled the waiter for the bill her face had taken on deep worry lines answer me honestly should i be nervous i meanshould i get a bodyguard amanda thought about that had no clear answer she said until we know more i dont think it would hurt spoken like a true politician as luck would have it barnes found a parking space right on telegraph the avenue swimming with the typical timewarp mix of hippies retrohippies onenote fanatics and junk entrepreneurs looking scruffier than any of the others the uniform was torn jeans message tshirts leather headbands and glassy eyes booths were set up on the sidewalks hawking everything from maoist theory and antiamerikan nihilism to mood rings organic viagra and scented candles music blared from speakers attached to competing cd stores the resulting aural broth was a wall of white noise to barness ears but what did he know hed never progressed much past buck owens noise and body odor notwithstanding barnes was happy to be there the day had turned sunny the skies were clear and his lungs needed to suck in something other than death on telegraph that meant secondary smoke not from tobacco back in the stone ages when hed been an eighteenyearold high school graduate advanced education in his circles meant two years at a community college learning animal husbandry hed been a decent but uninspired student and a good varsity football player unfortunately there werent a whole lot of jobs for good but never never ever gonna make it to the pros running backs ergo the military and that had been okay for a few years when he finished up his tour he had narrowed his future to farming trucking or the police academy law enforcement was the decision because it seemed like more fun and barnes had some book smarts so he advanced within a narrow sphere as a detective he got to use his brain and sometimes he felt like he had a good one still whenever he had any business at the uc he felt uncomfortable he had never attended classes at a genuine university and the berkeley campus was as big as a city it had its own government its own police force and its own set of rules explicit and otherwise as he walked along leafy lanes some of the buildings were downright imposing others looked as inviting as a concrete bunker and he felt like an invader from outer space invader past his prime using his little map as a guide he couldnt help but notice how young the kids were and that made him feel even older dr alice kurtags lab was housed in a sixstory postmodern brick and concrete structure that had been retrofitted for earthquakes berkeley wasnt perched directly on the san andreas fault but like all the bay area the ground was plenty seismic and no one could predict when the big one was coming and yet thought barnes we pretend he entered kurtags building drawing stares from a clutch of grad students kurtags lab on the fourth floor was sizeable her office was not her private domain barely held a desk and two chairs it did have a nice view of the city and the water beyond the fog had lifted several hours ago and the burnoff had produced a blue sky streaked with white clouds and contrails kurtag looked to be in her fifties a handsome woman with strong features and a short efficient hairdo she had blond streaks running through dark hair and strong brown eyes she wore little makeup just a dot of red on her cheeks and something soft and wet on her lips she had on a longsleeved green blouse black slacks and boots her ears were adorned with diamond studs her nails were short but manicured do you know anything about a memorial service she asked barnes her voice was soft and surprisingly airy no doctor i dont but im sure there will be one as soon as the coroner releases the body i suppose its premature at this stage barnes nodded this is just terrible what happened was it a robbery i hate to sound evasive but we just dont have all the facts i know the city council is going to hold a town hall meeting tonight at seven maybe well know more by then i certainly hope so this is so upsetting i work late at night im alone here myself quite often id hate to think of a predator stalking single women and of course poor davida hows the security here its a university its filled with people who belong and people who dont most of the time i bury my nose in my work and dont look around too much now im so upset i can barely concentrate were you and davida close over the past year wed become very close working on her bill nowwithout her as an advocatei really dont know what chance we have for passage barnes said when was the last time you saw her yesterday afternoon the doctors voice cracked it seems so far away now what was the occasion she stopped by to pick up some reports for some lobbyists she was going to hit the capital full force this week and needed all the scientific information i could muster i had some of the material ready but not all of it she was going to come by this afternoon to pick it up again her voice broke but this time her eyes filled with tears im sorry its a terrible thing barnes said did you socialize with davida outside of work alice kurtag wiped her eyes with a tissue with davida everything was work from her parties to her meetings occasionally when we were working long hours wed treat ourselves to dinner and a movie neither of us have children to rush home to the scientist smiled sadly we werent lovers if thats what youre hinting at barnes gave her a neutral shrug did she ever confide in you now and then i guess shed tell me how worried she was about the bill she only had support in the house if every one of her fellow democrats chose to back her up some had changed their minds others gave her a hard time from the beginning how so they objected to the cost of funding the proposition said give the initiativefunded institute a chance kurtag frowned science doesnt come cheap what worthwhile endeavor is cheap did she ever talk to you about personal fears when kurtag seemed puzzled barnes clarified his question was she specifically afraid of someone or something she never said anything to meother than to complain how betrayed she felt betrayed by her colleagues which ones i dont recall i organize data conduct experiments write reports detective i dont do the actual lobbying she paused there was a woman representativeelaine something eileen ferunzio shes the one davida was furious with her apparently davida had recently thrown her support behind one of eileens bills so when she didnt get reciprocity she felt totally betrayed but there was never any hint that eileen was dangerous thats absurd barnes wondered weve heard davida had received some threatening letters threatening letters alice thought about that oh from that crackpot down in orange county she seemed more amused by it than scared do you remember the crackpots name harry something harry modell yes the doctor appeared annoyed if you know all of this why are you wasting my time i know some things but not everything so she didnt take modells threats seriously not to my eye she mentioned something to the effect that she knew things about him and that all his threats were nothing but bluster what kind of things she didnt specify blackmail things oh please why would she waste time blackmailing a loser like him barnes pressed on after davida mentioned these things did the threatening letters stop i really dont know it wasnt the focus of our meetings how often did she mention harry modell expansive maybe twice three times when was the last time she mentioned him i havent the faintest idea detective a week ago a month ago maybe a month but i couldnt swear to it really youre making too big a deal out of him is that all im distracted enough as it is i really need to get back to work please dr kurtag just bear with me did davida ever talk to you about minette padgett alice appeared uncomfortable she didnt answer right away you think minette murdered her the frankness of kurtags question took barnes aback what do you think i think that unless you think minette had something to do with her death i dont want to talk about her barnes ignored her and pressed on minette was having an affairwith a man did davida know kurtags eyes hardened davida didnt place a premium on her domestic life she had bigger issues to deal with what does that mean she knew but didnt care no answer barnes said was she was going to dump minette was she having an affair herself alice kurtags eyes drifted to the ceiling it would be helpful if you asked your questions one at a time okay said barnes did davida know about minettes affair she hinted about it minette thinks shes subtle but shes not but she didnt seem to care detective she was getting a bit tired of minettes whining was she going to dump minette that never came up do you know if davida was involved with someone else no i dont frankly i dont see when she would have had the time im sorry to have to ask you this dr kurtag but where were you last night alice was silent then she said where i am practically every night here at the lab working alone yes alone who else works at two in the morning davida had been at her desk at two in the morning barnes kept his thoughts to himself when did you leave the lab i didnt i slept here last night where at my desk and barnes thought he had a lonely life do you often sleep at your desk not often alice shot him a cold stare occasionally if i offended you barnes said that wasnt my intention i have to ask sensitive questions doctor right now im trying to piece together a time line so you were here all night kurtag showed him her profile tight lips squinty eyes all night she said softly alone i already told you that youre sure no one saw you here kurtags smile came nowhere near mirth i suppose that means i have no alibi would you mind if i gave you a gunshot residue test just a swab of your hands i would mind because i resent the implication but go ahead do it anyway then you can leave the ronald tsukamoto public safety building housed both the fire and police departments of the city of berkeley the twostory entrance was shaped like a sewing spool with the bottom foot lopped off it was deco in style each of the two semicircular levels punched with large rectangular windows that sat atop each other with geometric precision the paint job however was pure victorian ecru trimmed in robins eggshell blue and bright white once inside anyone having business with bpd waited in a rotunda with multicolored abstract mobiles hanging from the ceiling a spiral staircase with spaghettithin railings wound its way to the second story the station was pleasant and clean with checkerboard flooring and soft natural light filtering in from the generous windows the actual working interior was plainwrap cop shop windowless beige walls fluorescent lighting small cubicles with charmless but functional workstations the equipment was often mismatched and in the case of some of the computers sorely outdated the conference room furniture consisted of white plastic tables and black plastic chairs maps of the district a calendar a video screen and a chalkboard made up the wall decor an american flag stood in one corner the golden bear stood sentry in another it had been a hellish morning for berkeley pd but it was the captain on the hot seat at six years away from retirement ramon torres now had to explain to the mayor the governor and his highly vocal constituency how a beloved state representative had been nearly decapitated in her office and no one knew a damn thing about it the captain was short stocky with leathery brown skin and piercing eyes one shade lighter each month expanded his bald spot what little hair remained was black and that offered him some consolation he winced as he read through the hatespewing letters penned by harry modell executive director of families under god torres put the missives down and looked across the conference table at isis and barnes two of his best detectives and theyd learned nada theyre obviously written by someone whos bigoted and meanspirited but i dont see enough actual threat for us to act the first amendment doesnt discriminate between civil and barbaric barnes said im not recommending that we prosecute him cap but both amanda and i think itd be negligent if we didnt at least talk to him amanda said hes written other poisonpen letters to female members of our state congress if something happens to one of those ladies well be in deep waters headlines flashed in torress head talking heads on the tube his own name bandied about like a cussword how many women are we talking about at least two what about men torres asked amanda said none so far but detective don newell from sacramento pd is investigating torres said then maybe you should wait until newell makes his report before i allocate the funds to send you down south i have another reason for wanting to go to la this week sir barnes said detective newell arrested two losers who were behind the assault on davida grayson last week the egging barnes nodded coupla morons named ray and brent nutterly from the white tower boys their boss marshall bledsoe might be visiting la bledsoe said torres suspected synagogue bomber but he was never charged egging seems lightweight for him true sir but newell is pretty sure the nutterly boys wouldnt have acted without bledsoes goahead in light of graysons murder we should question him thats two obvious reasons for going south obvious torres repeated amanda said bledsoe lives in idaho but weve got a bench warrant for outstanding traffic violations his mother lives in the san fernando valley and thanksgivings coming up dropping in on mommy said the captain you do any prep on this we called lapd west valley division and they called saying theres a pickup with idaho plates in moms driveway that was an hour ago barnes said four months ago modell moved about ten miles north of bledsoes mother convenient said torres do the two of them know each other good question torres glanced at his wristwatch its too late to put you two on a plane and get you back in time for town hall if bledsoe is visiting mom for the holidays he isnt going anywhere the community meetings been pushed back from seven to eight community affairs is making up a list of mock questions go over them so youre prepared i know i dont have to tell you this but i will anyway no mention of modell or bledsoe by name if someone asks about suspects tell them were focusing our attention on a few persons of interest you do all that you can book tickets to la la land thanks got it barnes said meanwhile said torres go down to the morgue in oakland and see what forensics you can get on grayson coroners running a full toxicology screen given an overkill shotgun thing in the wee hours of the morning im still seeing red flags for a dope deal gone sour her blood turns up dirty weve got a new kind of complication afterward grab some dinner and clean up before town hall i want you both presentable were not presentable amanda asked you are torres said barnes looks a little wilted ill unwilt sir maybe even shave when should we leave for la book a seven am tomorrow call up southwest and jetblue go with whoevers cheaper it took ten minutes for amanda to connect with the deputy coroner in charge of davida graysons autopsy dr marv williman was in his late sixties but had the voice of a much younger man detective isis well this is kismet i was just about to call you and here i am amanda answered will barnes and i are on our way to see you i finished up the autopsy an hour ago that means we can meet somewhere other than the crypt thats fine with me im wearing a designer suit hoo hah said williman berkeley s coming up in the world im a little hungry theres a great italian place named costinos about three blocks from my office more trattoria than osteria sounds good amanda secured the address well see you in about thirty forty minutes what sounds good will asked were meeting dr williman at an italian restaurant instead of the morgue pasta in place of pancreases excellent its been awhile since i ate something serious what constitutes awhile depends on my mood the pasta was excellent but barnes was so hungry he barely registered the taste until he polished off the plate linguini with fresh tomatoes basil garlic smoked ham and fresh parmesan cheese williman seemed equally enamored of his osso buco amanda nibbled one slice of her mini white pizza and picked at her salad greens are you going to eat that will asked pointing to the pizza knock yourself out amanda answered want a slice marv williman said youre not going to eat it im full big lunch barnes asked just trying to take off a little weight where both men asked simultaneously i hide it well she put down her fork so what can you illuminate for us dr williman the doctor took a gulp of chianti and set down his wineglass actually i have a couple of important things to pass on wait a minute barnes wiped his face with a napkin appalled at all the sauce it had soaked up then fished out his notepad and pen okay go doc williman opened his briefcase and handed amanda and barnes a twopage stapled summary of the autopsy i havent finished the complete transcription but i wanted to give you this right away he let them scan then continued as you can see the tox screen came up negative for the usual array of street drugs is that blood alcohol level right barnes remarked ah you noticed very good yes we ran it twice did this woman hit the bars last night i was told she went out to dinner with her mother at the ladies club then headed straight to the office according to the server they left around nine her mother was the last person to see her alive other than the killer williman said i dont know about you but i couldnt work very effectively with a bal of any idea how much alcohol she consumed over dinner amanda said according to the waiter it was the old lady who was shooting back the booze davida just had a single glass of wine well she made up for lost time later and her drinking wasnt a oneshot deal her liver was in the early to middle stages of fatty cirrhosis amanda said i dont recall anyone saying davida was a heavy drinker its minette who imbibes barnes said the people ive talked to say davida spent most of her time working a lot of that alone maybe she was a secret drinker williman said she got booze in her system somehow chronically amanda said a bal of could explain why she was napping at her desk and didnt hear anyone enter her office true said barnes i like that ive got something else to add to the mix williman said dont tell me said barnes she was pregnant close she had had an abortion no willie youre fixating on her female parts said amanda because everyones fixated on their respective parts in this case said williman detective barnes is on target davida had gonorrhea the table went silent the doctor continued now im not saying it isnt possible to transfer the disease from female to female but its considerably more likely to transfer the disease from male to female amanda said did she know there were no external symptoms said williman with women especially it can be like that makes it worse by the time you find out theres damage barnes said did you happen to find semen something we can send to the lab for dna no semen just bacteria said the pathologist and it took an eagle eye to spot em floating around he polished his knuckles so to show your gratitude ill let you pick up the tab the berkeley city council met in the old unified school district building an imposing twostory white neoclassical structure adorned by corinthian columns and topped by a cupola with a spire that reminded barnes of an oldfashioned prussian army hat it was next to the police station and the juxtaposition of newer deco and older beaux arts was yet more stylistic chockablock by seven fortyfive the auditorium was filled to capacity with spillover distributed to two additional rooms set up with video monitors after going over the list of mock questions amanda felt well prepared barnes on the other hand was nervous intellectuals scared him and everyone in berkeley imagined themselves an intellectual using big words when simple ones did the job just fine going on talking jags and rambling from topic to topic and never making a point maybe that was the idea to be so vague that the debates would go on forever barnes didnt deal much with the locals homicides in berkeley were usually drugrelated the bad guys imported from oakland alameda county s real city lucky for him amanda was a great mouthpiece and would be doing most of the talking the two of them sat backstage in a room not much bigger than a closet waiting for their cue to go onstage the city council was talking about safety issues trying to calm down a jumpy muttering audience pronouncing profoundly about vigilance caution and the need for a supplementary police presence which brought on a whole different flavor of muttering this part of the meeting had been allotted thirty minutes but had already eaten up an hour not necessarily the councils fault though every one of them could speechify like castro tonight it was the public who kept interrupting with pointed questions grayhaired guys with ponytails and women in blousy dresses wearing the kind of makeup that resembled no makeup at all words like accountability and personalized security and guantanamotype vigilance kept cropping up so did necessary evil countered by quotes from che guevara and frantz fanon amanda finished her crossword and put the paper down she leaned over and whispered eventually we need to compare notes every time i have something to ask you theres always a third party in the room anything specific barnes whispered back for starters who told you davida kept long lonely hours her mom complained she worked too hard and too long that could be just a mother talking minette padgett also mentioned that davida worked too hard that could be a lonely lover talking barnes grinned how about this mandy alice kurtag the scientist helping with the stemcell bill said shed worked long hours with davida some nights theyd go to dinner come back and confer in the lab hmmm exactly said barnes she swears there was nothing between them was minette ever with them during these work orgies if she was kurtag didnt mention it lets ask minette did kurtag say anything about davida drinking in excess no an idea was scratching barness brain its funny minettes been described as the drunk but davidas liver was in trouble the two of them drank together maybe together and in excess barnes said davida wasnt characterized as a drunk but maybe she was good at maintaining and minettes younger said amanda give her time to develop her own cirrhosis barnes nodded amanda thought a moment if someone knew davida drank herself asleep be easy to take advantage and shoot her while she was out and who would know more about her drinking habits than minette said barnes minettes hetero fling kyle bosworth told me he left the apartment by two in the morning kyles partner verified kyle was home around two fifteen minette had plenty of time to go down to davidas office share a bottle with her lover wait until davida had nodded off and blow her head off clear opportunity said amanda clear means if we can connect her to a shotgun now whats the motive davida had the clap and dr williman said it was passed easier from man to woman maybe she was having her own hetero fling still its not impossible from female to female she said louder barnes put his finger to his lips and amanda dropped her voice any indication that davida had a man on the side not yet no special guy shows up in any of her emails amanda played with her hair to my mind willie it makes more sense that minette got it from kyle and gave it to davida minette was the one with the free time to carry on an affair and we know she slept with a man dr kurtag thought davida might have suspected minettes affair maybe she learned minette had given her gonorrhea and blew up bigtime when davida tried to break it off minette became enraged an argument ensued and boom amanda said minette passed the gunpowder test all that means is that she washed her hands really well man id just love to examine her clothing for blowback blood sprayor powder do we even know if minette ever came near a shotgun let alone knows how to use one barnes shrugged took out his pad and pen and scribbled some notes an assistant to one of the councilwomen poked her head in berkeley pd youre on in two the detectives stood amanda lifted barness bolo tie let it fall back to his chest and smiled this and that bigass belt buckle pard taking out a billboard that says im a shit kicker hey said barnes this is the land of tolerance and youre doing most of the talking ms couture ready for your closeup amanda smoothed her black wool skirt and tucked in her white blouse ready as im going to be as they neared the stage she saw will straighten his tie tight jaw she hadnt meant to rattle the big guy she said i like your theory about minette drinking with davida and blowing her head off and id love to see minettes clothing too unfortunately a theorys not enough to get us a warrant to search her apartment barnesss brain ran through a series of possibilities now his jawline was a track for ball bearings how about this minettes apartment is also davidas apartment we shouldnt have any trouble getting a victim warrant if we happen to find bloody clothing and brain tissue in the sinks drain trapswell then thats the way it goes sometimes viva accidents said amanda that and zapata said barnes hes one of the good guys around here right as he stepped into his pajama bottoms will thought about the town hall meeting and the press conference amanda had summarized the investigation better than he couldve speaking clearly and simply personable but terse captain torres did a decent job of easing community fears keeping his cool under a barrage of questions thoughtful and stupid then there was him speaking into the microphone with that little nervous stutter in his voice that told the world he was a shitkicking dufus the tie and buckle didnt help either he could almost taste the contempt made him drawl even more until he ended up sounding like gomer pyle on downers what a he stopped selfreflection was for chumps the phone rang good maybe laura that new relationship biting the dutorress voice shot over the line you know the warrant that you requested to search davidas apartment i havent put it in yet cap dont bother you wont need it minette padgett called in a emergency about twenty minutes ago the whole damn place has been ransacked they got me as i walked through the door amanda said what about you i was just about to go to bed amanda made a sour face i wasnt anywhere near going to bed this commute is a killer i really should move you shouldnt even be working barnes retorted man if i had a thousandth of your money id be sailing or playing golf or willie if you quit the force youd be cranky twentyfourseven im already cranky twentyfourseven barnes looked around at the living space in complete disarray what a total shit pile thats the bad news amanda said the good news is now we can look for evidence against minette without raising any hackles so stop sneering pard and lets get to work barnes took out a camera and began snapping pictures had it been tidy the living room would have felt generous with the wall of picture windows and a high ceiling but it was hard to look beyond the mess craftsmanstyle seating had been overturned madras throw pillows were strewn across the floor oak bookshelves had been emptied a couple of cheap glass vases the kind that come with flower deliveries were shattered the only breakage in plain sight the open floor plan allowed barnes a view of the kitchen cupboard doors flung open but the crockery within was untouched the contents of the kitchen drawers on the other hand had been emptied and dumped on the floor the detectives walked as best as they could trying not to squash evidence under the soles of their papersheathed shoes the condo had three bedrooms a master and two smaller guest rooms identical in size the first of the smaller bedrooms had been converted into a home office the floor space of the second was taken up with gym equipment when you got past the disorder the master bedroom was a great space generous and airy with a striking view of the city below and the bay beyond davidas sanctuary at the end of a hectic day the rooms current ambience was chaos clothing tossed on the floor drawers dumped bed linens stripped from the mattress the first word that came to barness mind was staged despite countless movie scenes most thieves didnt randomly ransack because disorder made it difficult to find valuables he nodded at amanda and she got it without his having to say a word the two of them moved to the home office and surveyed a snowstorm of paper through the doorway same draweremptying filedumping mess books and videos on the floor the swivel desk chair overturned in a way that suggested calculation barness large feet couldnt manage a baby step without crunching something under his feet and he retreated someone really did a number amanda said barnes said all this disorder and the plates and dishes are intact a lot easier to clean up paper and upright couches and chairs much bigger hassle clearing broken china why would minette stage this could be her or someone setting her up thoughts were rolling around barness brain or maybe even the real deal when i mentioned harry modell to dr kurtag she told me that davida wasnt afraid of him because she knew some things about him what things she didnt tell kurtag someone crazy who knows what theyll do amanda considered that maybe but its a reach so unless we know modells here in town hes low on the list minettes at the top you bet wonder where she is torres took her complaint and let her go torres is taking citizen complaints now significant other of a highprofile vic said barnes shes staying with some friends for a couple of days which i like we can sift through the stuff without her poking around in our business amanda surveyed the toss how long do you think it will take us to go through all this material most of the night barnes said whens our flight to la seven am i wonder if we can move it to eleven without getting someones nose out of joint she smiled sneaking in the shuteye both of us you can bunk down at my place if you want save you a trip over the bridge i thought youd never ask barness cell chirped just as the garbled pa voice issued a boarding announcement he fished the phone from his pocket did she just call our flight amanda looked up from her paperback uhuh phoenix how do you understand anything she said it just sounds like static he pressed the green button barnes sorry to bother you detective its alice kurtag barnes wedged the phone between his shoulder and ear and found his notepad no bother at all dr kurtag what can i do for you i dont know if this is important or not but you asked me to call you if i thought of anything whats up as i told you before my relationship with davida was almost exclusively business i barely knew minette and i didnt know most of their friends okay barnes answered i doubt if this is important but i recall that about a month ago davida dropped by the lab with a friend an old friend someone she had gone to high school and college with they looked there was silence for a moment i dont know how to put this they looked comfortable with each other the implication was obvious barnes said more than chummy well they were laughing and touching each other of course they were old friends do you remember this persons name jane i honestly cant recall if davida mentioned her last name if she did its eluding me jane that threw barnes nothing about jane ever seemed remotely gay just to make sure he said what did this jane look like tall slim pretty davidas age long jetblack hair very striking hair and maybe a bitshopworn i dont want to be unkind but it was as if shed been through a lot no doubt who she meant jane sure hadnt had good luck with men could it have been jane meyerhoff yes it was now i remember she did use her last name you know her shes indeed an old friend of davidas all right dr kurtag thanks for the information tacking on the basic detectives parting shot anything else youd like to add actually yes but she added nothing barnes said go on im listening doctor davida told me that she and jane were going to be away for a couple of days to do some whitewater rafting davida told me that she had had an intense week and jane had been going through a very messy divorce both of them needed to unwind and both of them loved physical challenges she told me her cell wouldnt be operative but she gave me a contact number if something important came up in my research she said the number was only for me and that i shouldnt give it out to anyone else who would you give it to since we were working together so often people would sometimes call me looking for davida which people at the capital sometimes friends anyone specific silence doctor minette called frequently said kurtag eight ten times a day that is pretty frequent in regards to this other woman it could be totally innocent perhaps davida was taking the trip just to grab a little welldeserved privacy the onehour flight from oakland to burbank was on time and blissfully free from squalling children as soon as the plane began its descent barnes turned to amanda ive been thinking she grinned thats always dangerous thats why i dont do it often in terms of staging what about that crank letter donnie newell showed us someone cutting block letters from a magazine and pasting them on a piece of paper how hollywood is that we should really talk to newell again minettes been harassing davida for a while the woman does seem to like her fair share of attention maybe she was upset when davida didnt take the letter seriously amanda nodded good point now how does it connect with minette as the murderer barnes conceded that he had no answer there are other reasons to talk to donnie he was davidas exboyfriend in high school before she came out remember he said something about davida being a pistol howd you take that that she was hot in bed amanda shrugged so they probably fucked whats the big deal it was a long time ago it struck me that donnie remembered the relationship so clearly and chose to mention that aspect of it with davida lying dead with her head nearly blown off men are always thinking about sex true but that thing he told you his wife hating davida obviously the two of them were still in contact minimal contact according to newell whats minimal to him may have seemed like maximal to minette also from dating her in high school do you think donnie knew about davidas drinking amanda laughed what are you suggesting im not suggesting anything yes you are and it seems a big jump what youre seeing newell as a suspect first of all we know he was in sacramento the day of the murder because she called him exactly and we dont know the nature of the callonly what newell told us maybe she says cmon down to the office for a latenight fling and they spent a little time together minette told us davida had planned to pull an allnighter who said it was to work she and donnie are alonedrinking and and what dunno something went awry you know people can get crazy when theyre under the influence do you not like this guy or something some kind of high school thing i barely knew donnie i remember him as a skinny blond kid thats all amanda wagged a finger at him your imagination is doing overtime detective barnes maybe its sleep deprivation or lack of useful evidence in the apartment barnes said at the very least i want to talk to newell about davida grayson and jane meyerhoff he inferred theyd both been party girls pair that with kurtag telling me davida and jane were going away together and not to tell minette and im wondering is their relationship new or were davida and jane picking up where they left off in high school and college im also wondering if jane was the reason that davida came out how does that tie in with newell maybe donnie did a threesome with the girls and davida discovered she liked jane better than him and and maybe newell felt threatened so he decided to pop her after whattwentyfive years barnes smiled yeah its thin but think of this williman told us maletofemales an easy way to transmit the clap and donnies male you know what i think what you want to interview newell in hopes hell give you lurid details about a threesome maybe barnes laughed then he turned serious no way to bring up gonorrhea with him in a coptocop chatokay lets shift gears if there was a sexual relationship between davida and jane it could be a motive for minette being jealous jane just moved back to berkeley about a year ago after three failed marriages maybe she wanted something from her youth amanda regarded her partner didnt you date jane uh yeah but not for long why not she was a piece of work no such thing as a casual conversation everything was a debate did it end badly no it just ended i stopped calling and she didnt care seeing as theres no hard feelings why dont you ask her about her relationship with davida instead of asking newell because davida was murdered and i dont know how truthful jane will be with me i can approach donnie differently cop to cop she said but you cant bring up venereal disease barnes grew silent okay the whole thing sucks hey she said i like the way your mind works im just trying to keep things organized are you really suspicious of newell maybe intrigued is more the right word the planes wheels hit the tarmac and a flight attendant launched into the usual spiel pretending they had a choice who to fly with when the announcements were over amanda said i like the davidajane thing i dont know if its relevant but its always good to look at close friends first barnes said i reckon we should also think a little bit about what were gonna do in la especially since the department paid for luxurious transportation whos our contact at lapd amanda checked her notes detective sergeant marge dunn she told me her lieutenant his name is decker is very curious about marshall bledsoe what mischief did that dirtbag pull off there a local synagogue was ransacked about five years ago and decker always felt that there was someone behind the scenes amanda couldnt help it she was a bay area snob san francisco was a city la was a monster the freeways stretched for miles without a break in the urban ugliness and the traffic never seemed to let up at least this time of year the sky was clear and blue a welcome change from the fog dirty air but warm enough for the berkeley detectives to roll down the windows of their compact rental the tin can wheezed at the slightest hint of an incline barnes drove while amanda navigated allowing for ten minutes of gettinglost time it took them an hour and a quarter to reach the west valley stationhouse a square windowless brick thing larger than berkeley pd but minus the style there she was ms imsosophisticated no matter how hard she fought clichés northern cal and her own social status wouldnt be denied she tried to focus on their case but no new ideas had surfaced since she and will had deplaned they walked to the station entrance in silence and were met in the lobby by detective sergeant marge dunn she looked around forty tall big and blond with soft brown eyes and a bright smile escorting them up to the detectives room she knocked on the wall to the lieutenants cubicle even though the door was open the man who waved them in was in his fifties a fit fifties a moustachioed redhead with flecks of white in his hair he wore a blue buttondown shirt coral silk tie gray slacks shiny black wingtips amanda thought he couldve easily been a lawyer when he stood up the top of his head wasnt that far away from the ceiling another big one she put him at six four minimum he extended a huge freckled hand to her then to will pete decker he said welcome have a seat he offered them two plastic chairs you two want anything to drink coffee would be nice barnes said times two amanda said pots low ill make a fresh one marge dunn said you want some loo absolutely thanks decker answered and while youre out there ask dispatch to send another cruiser by bledsoes house to see if the trucks back in the driveway barnes said bledsoes gone probably out with mom i dont see him leaving town before thanksgiving decker looked barnes and amanda over without making too much of a show of the scrutiny crossing long legs he leaned back in his chair i wanted to keep a low profile so we dont spook him all the bozo has to do is take out a checkbook pay his fines and hes out were hoping he isnt savvy enough to know that although if he murdered a state representative hes not naïve what evidence do you have on him nothing barnes answered decker smiled well thats not good we need some excuse beyond unpaid parking tickets to bring him in for questioning bledsoes head of the white tower radicals amanda said two days before davida graysons murder two white boys egged her on the steps of the state capitol we think bledsoe gave that order and maybe more yeah i heard about that said decker those two are locked up right have they implicated bledsoe no but bledsoe doesnt need to know that barnes said maybe if we scare him enough we can pry something out of him marge dunn came back in with the coffees no truck in the driveway decker said anything else besides bledsoe on your agenda one other interview barnes said some bigot named harry modell heads a group called families under god we found three very nasty letters that he wrote to grayson amanda said if you want us to wait for bledsoe first before we interview modell we can do that well work around you decker said someone from west valley should make the arrest and if im going to give up a detective you might as well interview modell and make good use of your time he turned to marge hows your schedule looking holiday light marge answered i can wait around until he shows just need my thermos and my ipod harry modells address was a trailer park nestled in the oaks of the foothills among miles of unspoiled landscape not a hint of a dugin structure could be seen anywhere happy wandering mobile community consisted of fifty slots all occupied with generators going full blast modells slice of la real estate was space his travelrancher was sided in yellow vinyl with white trim perched on a flat roof a dish aimed south as barnes and amanda climbed a makeshift plywood ramp to the front door they saw tv images blinking through a stingy front window barnes knocked on the door waited an appropriate amount of time got no answer and knocked again a voice from inside told him to go away police barnes yelled we need to speak with you mr modell the voice louder creaky told him to fuck himself barnes blew out air and looked at his partner we cant force our way inside the guy sounds old amanda said were worried for his safety thats not going to abruptly the door swung open the man in the wheelchair was ancient with a cueball head sunken jaundiced eyes and illfitting dentures that clacked as he rotated his mandible smalljawed face once round now sagging in the middle like a bell pepper grainy complexion more wrinkles than smooth flesh stick legs but his arms were surprisingly muscled probably from wheeling around mr modell what the fuck do you want to talk to you what the fuck about may we come inside amanda asked modell eyed amanda you can he cant were a team sir then go play a fucking game but modell didnt wheel back into the trailer and amanda saw something in his eyes other than hostility a faint longing she smiled modell said ahh why the fuck not im bored he propelled the chair to the side so they could enter they walked into a hothouse the temperature must have been hovering in the nineties three humidifiers filled the cramped dim space with mist the upside of the oppressive microclimate was tables of flora bromeliads african violets wild beautiful blooms amanda didnt recognize she began to sweat and glanced at will he took off his jacket his shirt was sodden modell ignored them and wheeled to the only surface devoid of plant life a rickety card table that hosted bottles of pills an ancientlooking burrito and the tv remote modell muted the sound but left the picture on some old movie in black and white amanda said we have a few questions for you if you dont mind i do mind modell said clacking his teeth but can i stop the minions of hag hag heathen atheistic government modell reached over to pinch off a papery old african violet bloom barnes got right down to business could you tell me where you were two nights ago modell squinted at the detective im always here does it look like i can go anywhere you moved to this trailer park recently amanda said you got that right lady i sold my house in orange county pocketed an absurd profit and decided to spend my days doing what i do best communicating with atheists reprobates and perverts god knows there are enough of them to fill my time communicating with letters said barnes lost art said modell all that email buggery when i was at my peak i sent out thirty forty a day now im down to five the hands waving gnarled digits damn shame the perverts seem to be multiplying faster than ever which perverts have you written to lately again modell squinted what the fuck do the police care about an old man writing letters amanda said an old man who heads families under god not anymore i gave that up two years ago dont you police people keep abreast of the times whyd you resign amanda asked i started the ministry thirty years ago all by my lonesome built it up big he shook his head too big the members decided they needed a board to do what i dont know but the assholes started telling me how to run my organization so i told them to fuck off and i quit damn shame at our heyday we were a powerful force against the perverts what theyre doing now dont know dont care i write five letters to perverts gods happy now if you dont tell me what you want you can just leave at least you can leave i dont mind if the lady staysunless youre one of those lesbos then you can be the first out the door you dont like lesbians amanda asked whats to like theyre homos and theyre perverted did you ever write a letter to state representative davida grayson amanda asked aha modell jabbed a finger upward now i see what this is about the lesbo representative big smile but that happened up north were from up north amanda told him berkeley pd you came all the way down just to see little ol me lady im flattered you did write to her barnes said fuck yeah i wrote to her i wrote to her many times the pervert was not only a lesbo she was trying to cut up unborn babies for her own selfish purposes amanda said stemcell research modell seemed to levitate out of his chair stemcell research bull nothing good will ever come from butchering human babies young lady and i certainly dont want to pay for such shit with my tax dollar he sank back down yeah i wrote to that sodomite told her what i thought of her bull and of her being a lesbo told her everything she needed to hear which was women got no business being in politics it turns them into perverts like grayson im certainly not mourning graysons demise but if you think i had anything to do with her murder you are seriously misguided and as stupid as she was barnes loosened his tie and undid the top button of his shirt amanda gave him a tissue from her purse and both of them mopped their brows she said politicians receive negative mail all the time sir but your letters were especially nasty lady im a nasty goddriven man i dont deny it but last i heard you cant arrest someone for that you can arrest someone for threatening harm i didnt threaten harm mister i just told her the truththat she was going to burn in hell for eternity two seconds flat her flesh would look like pig cracklings and her insides would boil like soup i told her she was so far gone even jesus wouldnt know what the hell to do for her you want to arrest me for truthtelling go ahead and give me the entertainment and the publicity and maybe ill start another church do one of those websites amanda said is there anyone who can verify your whereabouts for the last couple of days lady im damn flattered that you think i have enough energy to fly up to that pinko city and pop the lesbo fact is im eightyfour for the last ten of those wheelchair bound and a good day for me is when i wake up and move my bowels without straining you couldve hired someone barnes said i could go to the novelty shop buy a big nose and say i was a jew listen you two just because i decided to use my first amendment privileges and tell the perverts what i think of them doesnt mean i have to sit hear and listen to your bull your bosses will be hearing from me get the fuck out of here before i run you over with my chair barnes started the engine and let it idle while he pulled out his cell phone other than providing entertainment for the old bastard that was a colossal waste of time had to be done amanda said he fooled with the phone scowled cant get my messages no reception in this dump thought you liked rural living rather have twenty rooms with a view lets go back to the west valley and see if anythings up with bledsoe unless you want to grab something first we can eat in the car nutrition sounds good as long as its not hamburgers whats wrong with burgers larry got a new barbecue turbopowered and hes collecting marinades boy needs a hobby huh she shrugged hell find something ill find a subway or something it aint chez panisse but what is delicately marge dunn unwrapped the wax paper that held together a turkey and cheese sub wow thanks for thinking of me im hungry she steadied the sandwich then took a big bite mmmmmthats good amandas idea shes the considerate one barnes said he was sitting shotgun in an lapd unmarked amanda was in the backseat and marge was at the wheel marge spoke over her shoulder thank you considerate one no prob the car fell silent until barnes grumbled you think this joker is going to show marge wiped her mouth i dont see why hed leave if he came down to be with mom for the holidays and if he does leave that tells us something she regarded barnes i really like the silverwork on your belt buckle what kind of stone is that green turquoise exactly nice got it in santa fe ever been there sure she said i go there a lot sometimes during opera season if my daughters schedule permits never been to the opera amanda said wills into buck owens me too im eclectic big loss buck dwight yoakams carrying it on said will he rocks but still its not the same marge finished her sandwich and stowed the trash in a plastic bag the opera house is really special its outdoors with this beautiful view of the mountains sometimes crickets sing along big smile sometimes theyre on key theyve got great chamber music too and country at some of the casinos great little town culturewise barnes sneaked a quick look at marges left hand no ring whole southwest area is a pretty part of the country magnificenta real break from la marge turned around again have you ever been there amanda once and it was gorgeous barnes said i remember the food being good that too marge said if either of you go again give me a call ill tell you some good restaurants barnes said i just might do that the two of them swapped brief smiles further interchange was cut short by a black pickup truck tooling down the road instinctively all three detectives slouched down in their seats marge said lets wait until theyre out of the car the truck pulled into the driveway a man got out on the drivers side carrying several bags of what looked to be groceries seconds later an older woman opened the front passenger door she was pearshaped grayhaired and slowmoving he had wild unkempt hair and several days of dark beard growth he wore a white tshirt a denim jacket and jeans white sneakers she had on a long gray sweater a blue turtleneck and black polyester pants her sneakers were black with bledsoes hands occupied the situation for arrest was ideal lets do it marge said the three detectives jumped and swarmed the unsuspecting duo police mr bledsoe dont move marge barked as soon as barnes relieved bledsoe of his bags the women brought his arms around his back and marge slapped on the cuffs good afternoon mr bledsoe we have a bench warrant out for your arrest for outstanding traffic warrants youve got to be shittin me bledsoes voice was lazy no sir i am not out of the corner of her eye marge saw something blurry coming at her nose she ducked but a hard object made contact with the left side of her forehead flailing fingernails the contact stung amanda caught the old ladys arm midair laverne bledsoes breath was ripe with liquor and garlic that was really stupid amanda spun mom around now youre under arrest for assault on a police officer laverne responded by trying to stomp on amandas shoe amanda stepped back but the old woman caught her on the tip of her toe she wrestled granny down to the ground and snapped lavernes hands behind her back maybe a little more forcefully than necessary the cuffs clicked bledsoe remained completely passive watching from the sidelines almost amused are you going to arrest my mom too looks that way amanda said bringing the squalling woman to her feet shes sixtyeight barnes said she assaulted two police officers thats bogus this whole arrest thing is bogus the old lady began cursing but bledsoe stayed quiet marge patched in a call for transport laverne looked at her son with panicked eyes bledsoe spoke in a monotone calm down ma its not good for your heart shitheads laverne screamed manhandling an old woman barnes saw blood on marges temple got a bandaid she got you marge touched her head bad barnes gave a slight shake of his head as a blackandwhite pulled up amanda tightened her grip on the granny carefully she escorted the irate woman to the confines of the backseat the uniforms wrote down basic facts and drove off barnes said that was something marge got a bandaid and neosporin from the firstaid kit in the unmarkeds trunk and amanda tended to the wound i actually took the time to do my makeup this morning what a waste you look fine barnes said marge smiled hows your foot amanda shes no lightweight but ill survive marshall bledsoe said you calling my mom fat when no one answered he said i need to be with her to calm her down her hearts not so good marge said whys she so riled up anyway one shes sick of you guys badgering me two thats just her she riles easily especially when shes had a few beers how many is a few bledsoe thought a moment i think she drained a sixpack but thats just getting started in her prime ma could keg with the best of them a second cop car picked up bledsoe and delivered him to the station the detectives got there first and worked out the interview smoking and sipping coffee bledsoe slumped looselimbed in a hard chair that he seemed to find comfortable so relaxed he could have been zoned out in his living room watching the game marge was willing to let laverne go but the old lady refused to leave without her son so she was in a room next door none of the detectives had any idea what theyd get out of bledsoe but they had him in custody for a few hours until his traffic arraignment the court had to add up all the fines and penalties with skipping out on a warrant and some luck thered be jail time since it was lapd territory barnes and isis deferred to lieutenant decker the big man announced he and barnes would go in first and the women would do round two if there was anything worth pursuing decker opened the door lumbered in and sat opposite bledsoe barnes sat on bledsoes right how are you doing marshall hows my mom waiting for you she needs to eat she has yoyo blood sugar she had lunch on the taxpayers money any way we can rip off this illegitimate government is great bledsoe shook his head would you like to tell me whats really going on youre a lousy driver said decker you owe the city the county and the state a lot of money you know thats horseshit said bledsoe still without passion for the police to make a house call you must think i know something important decker leaned back in his chair and what important thing would you know bledsoe stubbed out his cigarette i dont have to talk to you clowns all i have to do is lawyer up and that ends that no curiosity said decker what am i supposed to know exactly huh its complicated said decker now bledsoe was confused and trying hard not to show it decker shot barnes a nod barnes leaned in close to bledsoe youre known as a leader marshall you give the orders you dont take them bledsoe shrugged deckers turn to lean forward we had a synagogue desecrated a few years ago the guy who took the fall was some mope named ernesto golding definitely an ordertaker who were his people white tower radicals decker lied an organization near and dear to you bledsoe smiled and fluffed his beard if youre asking me if im a member i plead proud and guilty but whatever youre talking about that jew place or any other place it wasnt me i didnt say it was you decker said did i say it was you bledsoe was quiet marshall i believe you you know why something that important trashing a jew place ernesto had to be taking orders from a guy higher up than you marshall blinked and who would that be ricky moke ricky bledsoe laughed right hes the man marshall bledsoe laughed again dont you turkeys know anything mokes dead he was eaten by a bear a mountain lion either way hes still animal shit before that he was a peon thats not what i hear then you hear shit either way said decker rickys gone youre saying that makes you the big guy bledsoe started to smile cut it short stayed silent decker said how did it feel having someone like moke muscle in on your authority right bledsoe huffed ricky was a peon so correct me marshall tell me what you know about the ransacking of the synagogue straighten me out i dont know shit about it never followed any of that and since moke is dead and golding was popped i guess youll never know what really happened if you didnt know anything about the case how do you know goldings dead let alone popped bledsoe smacked his lips together and said nothing we can dance like this for a while but bottom line youre in trouble marshall at this point you could use someone on your side bledsoe let out a lone chuckle let me set you straight man i didnt ransack any kikehouse down here and thats the truth theoretically if i had been involved it wouldnt have been a ransacking something would have exploded and you can bet your ass there would have been kikes inside the younger the bet his chair flew out from under his butt and unceremoniously he toppled to the floor what the fuck sorry i tripped and knocked your chair decker exchanged glances with barnes barnes didnt emote then the lieutenant turned to bledsoe gave him a tight smile and righted the seat here sit back down marshall what were you saying bledsoe got up from the floor wiped off his pants stayed in the corner decker was still smiling have a seat id rather stand have a seat deckers tone took on menace reluctantly bledsoe sat down decker continued well you might not have witnesses against you for the synagogue but detective barnes here has very good news for us his witnesses against you are still alive witnesses against bledsoes brow creased what the hell are you talking about two boys in the white tower radicals bledsoe barnes said they nailed you on davida grayson who bledsoe asked cmon we know you ordered the hit barnes lied and those two boys are in custody and tripping over their feet to testify against you who the fuck is davida gray shes a state representative from berkeley barnes said she was found the night before last in her office with her head blown off bledsoes expression made barness mood sink genuine puzzlement it took the scruffy bastard a few moments to find his voice uhdidnt that happen up in northern california yes it did barnes said im from berkeley pd you dont have jurisdiction down here bledsoe said but i do decker said ransacking a synagogue is one thing marshall gunning down an elected official is taking your shit to a whole different level barnes said we cant help you unless you start helping yourself and you can start helping yourself by telling us what happened bledsoe leaned back in his chair i honestly dont know what the fuck youre talking about he crossed his arms you guys are throwing me shit and trying to make me think its perfume why would we do that barnes said because thats what you clowns do let me tell you something you and your jew masters are all on borrowed time barnes said marshall why would we waste our time coming down here unless we had you cold cause youre afraid of me and what i represent bledsoe answered i dont know anything about the dyke howd you know she was a lesbian because i read jack who are these imaginary fairies testifying against me your peeps marshall who ray and brent nutterly oh christ bledsoe made a pained face those two idiots theyre saying i had something to do with blowing a diesel dykes brains out neither barnes nor decker answered ive been with my mom for the last week the pop was just a couple of days ago right im a superhero for the people but even i cant be in two places at the same time sly smile maybe next year im working on my superpower mojo decker said where were you the night before last i told you i was with my mom that tells us bullshit cause shell lie for you barnes said lets try again where were you the night before last and what were you doing bledsoe tapped his toe let me think let me think uh last night he snapped his fingers we watched a dvd boldface liars a laugh you two should know about that the night before last night barnes said okay okayuhlet me think make it a good one marshall decker said another snap of the fingers mom and i went out to dinner codys family restaurant i paid with a credit card that should be even easy enough for you clowns to check out barnes said what time did you eat ninemaybe a little earlier the place was pretty empty the waitresss name was kris big tits ugly face anything else whatd you eat barnes asked bledsoe laughed chili cheeseburger onion rings and a coors mom had the same except she ordered curly fries she loves her curly fries what did you do after dinner went back to mas drank a couple of brewswatched a little tv i guess i knocked off around twelve what were you watching barnes asked uhsome old movie robert mitchum and some nicelooking piece of oldfashioned ass piece of shit i turned it off before the end can i go now barnes remained stoic but bledsoes alibi was too damn specific and he wasnt happy if someone verified him in la at nine it would have been difficult though not impossible for him to travel four hundred miles do the murder in the earlymorning hours and drive back down there were also planes but barnes figured a guy like bledsoe would be memorable easy enough to check out bledsoe could have ordered the hit so he wasnt off the hook but bottom line no evidence to pursue an investigation decker asked how did you know ernesto golding was popped good news travels fast again decker kicked the chair out from under bledsoes ass marshall cursed and stood up again wiping off his pants shit you can keep persecuting me man but it wont help your fucking cause i had nothing to do with his death or the lesbo so how do you know about ernesto golding being popped decker said i knew the cunt that set him up name decker flexed a leg ruby ranger shes doing a long stretch of time which is probably okay for her i think she also likes girls guess theyre everywhere big grin minus one a knock the door opened marge dunn handed decker a piece of paper decker read it and nodded your arraignment is scheduled in two hours marshall youll be put in a holding cell and when the time comes cuffed again and driven to court after you pay your fines youll be lucky to have cab money then again you can always hock your truck you wont need it since your license will be revoked bledsoe gave a sick smile youve got to be shittin me you got three speeding tickets two going excess of eightyfive this is so bogus then there are all the parking violations whats the problem marshall have trouble reading signs something in bledsoes eyes told barnes that decker had hit a nerve decker said the grand total for your ass to stay out of jail is five thousand six hundred and twenty bucks bledsoe glared at decker muttering to himself fucking asshole kike deckers leg shot out again and bledsoe buckled under his own weight and went down he looked up from the floor spittle running down a corner of his mouth ill have your badge for this decker laughed great i could use a vacation after bledsoe was duly escorted out of the interview room barnes shut the door and lowered his voice little rough dont you think decker faced barnes eye to eye let him sue i meant what i said barnes dropped the issue why piss off someone who was helping him out besides hed been in similar situations decker said if bledsoe gets jail time and his alibis dont check out ill give you a call and you and your partner can take a shot at him again tight smile he brushed back the ginger mustache bristly hairs spread and fell back into place itd probably be better if i wasnt around marshall wasnt my most sterling interview seemed fine to me lieutenant thanks for the help decker stretched his hands reached the ceiling look i caused him some grief and im not sorry about that i know hes caused mischief down here but im thinking that alibi had too much detail for you guys and if hes right about the time frame its going to be tough tying him in directly i was thinking the same thing barnes concurred codys restaurant is about twenty minutes from here decker said marge will give you directions thanks well track down kris the waitress and see what she says even if she alibis him well check the airports to make sure he didnt take a quick hop north as they left the room decker said i wouldve liked to see it work out better for you murder trumps everything and that guy should be put away barnes said he was a long shot lieutenant eggings a far cry from blowing someones head off he took out his card and handed it to decker if we can ever reciprocate just let me know will do and have marge dunn give you her cardjust in case you need anything else ill do that said barnes just in case kris the thirtyyearold blond waitress with a large chest and a face barnes thought more okay than ugly remembered both bledsoes how could she forget them he was a surly jerk and mom was foulmouthed they left like a dollar tip on a twentydollar tab and acted like i was lucky to get that do you remember what time they left amanda asked her kris twirled a strand of tooyellow hair late like ten like i remember thinking that if i could you know finish off with these asshothese people like id be done for the evening i was more gone than there you know thanks for helping us out barnes said sure is he like in trouble barnes shrugged he must be in trouble like why else would the police be asking about him doesnt surprise me he had a strange look strange how kris bobbed her head up and down you knowlooking over his shoulder a lot really barnes asked sort of again she bobbed her head up and down kind of or maybe he was just hungry and wanted his food faster than we could give it to him amanda said you should be a detective yourself thanks kris smiled a mouth of white straight teeth i watch a lot of law order especially svu christopher meloni is hot as soon as the plane took off amanda closed her eyes and fell asleep the state of bliss lasted approximately fifteen minutes until turbulence woke her up with a start a flight attendant was urging everybody to return to their seats and buckle up amanda looked to her left at barnes gripping the armrests with white knuckles the plane rocked in a sea of wind and barnes turned green around the gills she said turbulence isnt dangerous so they say its true you should feel it in a small jet cork in a bathtub effect you get used to it barnes stared at her well thank god i dont ever foresee me having that problem hey how many times have i offered to give you a ride somewhere gratis i hate flying you get all the catering you want wills big hand clamped on his gut uhoh wrong thing to say she kept her mouth shut and the turbulence faded really she said hitch a ride with us one of these days too rich for my blood said barnes amanda didnt answer he said dont be sore pard the hell i wont being pissed is a godgiven right even for rich folk she wagged a finger at him and its rather poor judgment of you to alienate me especially after making a date with that tall drink of water you might need a lift to la barnes reddened we didnt make a date you exchanged numbers william what do you call that just being polite amanda laughed wills blush was hilarious from green to pink today her partner was a christmas tree she said she seemed nice if my opinion means anything and she certainly understands the biz its nothing amanda just being courteous youre not going to call her i didnt say that should the timing be right uhhuh can we drop this the seat belt sign turned off barnes felt more relaxed he didnt mind her ribbing but now he wanted to focus on work how about we talk about the case since thats what were getting paid for mr workaholic she said yeah youre right now that bledsoe and modell have sunk to the bottom of our short list of suspects im not feeling too perky but i guess it puts us back in standard territory someone close to davida barnes nodded someone close enough to her to know she was a closet drinker the question is who among her friends did she piss off that bad the gonorrhea cant be ignored who she got it from and did she give it to someone tomorrow we should talk to minette and find out if she knew davida was sick if she doesnt shes got to get tested and if she doesnt test positive we have to find the partner who gave it to davida if for no other reason than the public health issue and if minette is infected said barnes we have to find out if minette gave it to davida or was it the other way around you talked to minettes boyfriendwhats his name kyle bosworth what about him as the bad guy whats his motive amanda said maybe he gave the clap to minette who gave it to davida maybe davida was going to tell kyles partner about his infidelity and kyle killed davida to shut her up people lead that kind of complicated life anything can happen from what people have been telling us about davida and minette i dont see davida caring all that much about minettes indiscretions amanda thought for a while then what about this will alice kurtag told you she thought davida might have been having an affair with jane meyerhoff didnt you say that jane was married a bunch of times three times donnie newell said it the point is jane has sex with men barnes felt his cheeks go hot and looked away but amanda didnt appear to notice maybe jane got the clap and gave it to davida who gave it to minette who gave it to kyle that would be a reason for minette to be furious in addition to it being evidence of davidas infidelity alleged infidelity and minette definitely cheats so she rationalizes it davida works all day leaves her high and dry but davida has no excuse the fact that minette chose a man could be her way of pretending it didnt count kind of nutty and narcissistic she has that theatrical quality about her will phoning ten times a day maybe staging that breakin the point is minette had plenty of reason to be angry at davida and shed likely know about davidas drinking who better to sneak up and blow davidas head off plus the fact that it was probably done when davida was sleeping could indicate a woman why were a sneaky bunch hey said barnes im bringing you up on sexism charges at the next berkeley truth council dont go there pard both detectives laughed barnes said do you think that little minette is big enough to handle a shotgun talk about sexism yeah i do all she had to do was handle it for one blast her hands were clean barnes said answering his own question so she washed them good minette as the shooter would also explain staging the ransacking what better way to turn suspicion away from yourself than to be a victim of a crime barnes turned silent after a few minutes amanda asked him what was on his mind youre making sense mandy lets ask around about minette before we talk to her you must know some people in common why you seem to know everyone else attached to this case sacramento said will it can be a small town everyone went to public school back then even rich kids like davida and jane ended up at the same high school as us regular folk their fathers owned the ranches and our fathers worked the ranchesyou really see this as a female thing why not to me it feels like a mans murder cold calculating precise davida didnt have many men in her life amanda said she had a fewstarting with donnie newell back to him im not saying he did it but they were close enough at one time for donnie to say she was a pistol a pause both her and jane again barnes fell silent i am not sexobsessed at this moment im just saying there could be something that goes way back and speaking of men janes last divorce was extremely messy how do you know i asked around he said other high school buds her last husband was a financial type who lost his job jane didnt take well to that and she didnt want him getting any of her first two husbands cash asking around said amanda so quietly barnes had to read her lips over the planes roar annoyed hed hotdogged it without telling her like i said its a small town mandy so you did the place was dark and smoky with the band playing texas swing there was sawdust on the floor and beer was flowing in a continuous stream from tap to glass just a half hour from berkeley mamas was a different world barnes was on his second heineken but his third plate of buffalo wings wondering if shed bother to show she hadnt sounded all that enthusiastic over the phone but who could blame her theyd never progressed beyond a few months of dating and a couple of meaningless bounces between the sheets besides as hed explained the call was business not personal a shapely blonde approached his table tall like marge dunn narrower with coltish legs a body that could definitely handle the miniskirt but unlike dunn this face was worn desperation tugging down the eyes barnes wasnt in the mood to play therapist to another wounded soul looking for some company barnes smiled and shook his head unfortunately im meeting someone here some other time she suggested life is long the blond woman didnt exactly know how to interpret that she walked away with an exaggerated sway in her hips and for a moment barnes wondered if hed done the right thing by shutting her down his ruminations were interrupted when he spotted jane at the door he stood and waved her over shed dressed way over the mamas level tailored black pantsuit sapphireblue silk scarf worn like a choker around her neck filmy edges shimmering in the turbulence created by dancing bodies she walked gingerly across the sawdust in pointy highheeled black boots carrying an oversized black bag that could have been crocodile she had a long face and long teeth but elegant carriage and demeanor and a lush body saved her from horsy her jetblack hair was poker straight and thick and flowed over her shoulders like an oil spill she came over and gave him a quick peck on the cheek her eyes were soft blue red around the edges thanks for meeting me on such short notice barnes said she looked at the chair brushed off the seat with a paper napkin and sat down you couldnt do better than this dive its on the way to sacramento thank you and i appreciate that but so are a few fine restaurants will i like the music how about some wings and a beer how about no wings and a scotch that can be done barnes signaled the waitress and ordered a dewars on the rocks jane reached in her bag and pulled out a pack of cigarettes you always were kind of a cowboy she lit up and blew out a plume of smoke so what was so urgent that it couldnt wait im talking to just about everyone who knew davida and you knew her very well jane shrugged and what can you tell me about her her eyes got wet she was a remarkable person committed to what she believed in very comfortable in her own skin i admired her so much i still cant believe she started to cry barnes was right there with a napkin but she elected to pull out a tissue from her exotic skin bag she blew her nose and dabbed her eyes just as the waitress plunked down the glass barnes paid the bill and the tip and edged the glass closer to jane she sipped took a second swallow half the whiskey was gone before she decided to resume the conversation i talked to lucille this afternoon she and my mom are good friends like you and davida jane smiled second generationanyway the poor old woman is having a rough time im spending the night with heri dont want her alone thats really nice of you jane actually i was thinking of moving in with her for a whilejust until barnes waited for more i dont know what just until means jane said shes not even my mother and i feel the need to look after her make sure she doesnt sink into a bad depression although who could blame her if she did barnes nodded jane said my mother never needs anyone so strong she comes across dar but back when we had the ranch shed be sinking posts with the guys i know said will you were one of them she didnt even remember he said summer job i worked at a whole bunch of ranches your mom was tough speeding up in that big pink lincoln not a glance at the hired help as the car kicked up dust do you think its weird that i want to stay with lucille i havent asked her yet i suspect shell say no she probably will refuse your hospitality at first later on barnes shrugged she frowned he said you feel close to her its no sin ive known her forever weve all known each other so long she finished her scotch and barnes called for a refill he said its nice to stay in contact with old friends and davida and you were very old friends jane nodded we hadnt been in much contact for about fifteen years but when i moved back to berkeley we picked up where we left off whatever that meant did that cause any problems with minetteyour being so close to davida jane stared at him he said being such an old friend minette impresses me as the emotional type with or without a good reason youve got that right will minette has a lot of problems and jealousy was one of them she resented davida nursing me through my divorce once parker lost his money his entire personality deteriorated hed waver between being a vicious bear and a passive lamb you cant even imagine one moment i was afraid hed assault me the next hed be sobbing on the phone begging me to come back to him im sure you remember their big stab at dating had come just as jane had split from parker one of those accidents barnes running into jane on shattuck he coming off shift exhausted in a down mood she leaving chez panisse alone needing to talk to someone they went for drinks one thing led to another she had a gorgeous body but her enthusiasm waned midway through he said i remember you being nervous about him i dont remember you saying he wanted you back i didnt want to burden you with sordid details will it was totally my fault that parker and i got married when i met him i admired his machismo and his takecharge attitude it took about four months to realize how controlling he was thats always been my mistake i hook up with the ultramacho men and get surprised when they turn brutal call it growing up with a dominant mother and a father who wasnt i suppose i got used to people pushing me around and long for the daddy i never hadthats what i really liked about davida she always let me be me you two travel together at all jane lifted her head from her scotch looked him square in the eye and didnt answer him barnes said alice kurtag said you two went away together for a few days to unwind yes we did jane was still trying to stare him down what better way to get your mind off of your troubles i was involved in a horrible divorce and davida was stressed about the stemcell bill we went hiking and whitewater rafting sounds like fun it was the best weekend id had in a long time jane im sorry to have to ask you this but were you involved with davida im bringing it up because davida was infected with gonorrhea and if you were are you serious barnes nodded hah jane shrugged she never said a word to me about that then again why would she i would imagine shed be embarrassed about it she glanced at her watch finished off her scotch and started to open her wallet barnes stopped her my treat so youre okay healthwise im fine perfect and in answer to your question davida and i were just friends period im sure minette gave it to her she stood up its getting late whats the rush its not that late and youve only got about thirty miles to go all true will but still im done here i cant believe you talked to her last night amanda was clearly pissed barnes said it was an impulsive thing first you call around old high school buds then you meet with one of them whos a serious witness all by your lonesome whats gotten into you will he gave the honest answer dont know amanda shook her head rummaged in her purse fishing out a ghirardelli chocolate square she unwrapped and ate not offering him one from her stash as she usually did sorry said barnes hed parked the car in front of davida graysons complex i know it was stupid and i apologize but its done so can we move on amanda wasnt about to let go so easily did you at least learn anything other than that janes back in sacramento and why no answer she said thought she moved back to berkeley guess she moved back you didnt ask her it didnt seem relevant only her sex life was she claims there was none with davida you believe her said amanda dont know dont know if it matters mandy well as soon as she gets back i want a crack at her just because she denies having the clap doesnt make it true and seeing as how you were both drinking none of it can be entered into the case file no reason for her to lie well we wont know until we officially talk to her will we partner he gave her a few minutes to cool down she ate another chocolate made a show of chewing it slowly mandy maybe im off but im thinking right now our minds should be on minette and not on jane per our previous discussion and unless you can stop glaring at me we cant go in and interview her silence man forget it just dont do it again okay will for your own sake it looks bad youre right i was wrong shall we move on absolutely was that a female or a male absolutely whats the difference a male absolutely is absolutely a female absolutely is ill drop it for now but ill bludgeon you with it later on a female absolutely thats what i thought the disarray had been cleared but the condo was far from clean the kitchen was piled with dirty dishes and the dining room table held cartons of takeout chinese at nine in the morning minette was still in a terry bathrobe and mules her eyes and nose were puffy and red and her hair could have used a good scrubbing the faint odor of alcohol lingered on her breath and in the unit thanks for seeing us so early amanda said sure minette was still dazed have a seat anywheres fine the two detectives looked around and found space on a craftsmanstyle sofa it was as flat as a bench and merciless on the ass thank you barnes told her you want some coffee i sure as hell need a cup for myself id love some amanda said but let me make it minette why dont you sit down and relax that would be nice amanda went into the kitchen and began to open the cupboards and refrigerator looking for coffee minette made no effort to direct her the open space gave amanda an earful of conversation rough night will asked probably one of many minettes eyes watered its so surreal i just cant believe the tears came down im still in shock i cant tell you how sorry we are for your personal loss ms padgett the hardest part is that bitch mother she wont let me plan anything more tears shes taking the body back to sacramento davida hated sacramento she had nothing but bad memories can i ask what those bad memories are it might be relevant to the case minette clamped her lips together then she said you knowher parents divorceher coming outit was painful im sure it was tough barnes said but she traveled there often for work she worked there but she lived here minette folded her arms across her chest barnes backed it up its must be very painful to be excluded from the funeral plans im very sorry minette the woman lowered her voice but her tone remained harsh its goddamn painful a sigh im so damn angry its not your fault youre here to listen to me bitch but i make no excuses for my behavior barnes glanced at his watch theyd been in her place over ten minutes and she had yet to ask about progress on her lovers murder or the ransacking of the condo he wished amanda would hurry up with the coffee he didnt want to approach touchy subjects without her minette said i need to sleep for about six months and wake up after this entire nightmare is over i had to take the phone off the hook and turn off my cell im sick of people calling they dont really care about me all they want to know is the gory details gory details you know like was there a struggle did she put up a fight she looked at barnes did she put up a fight barnes said from what we could tell she appeared to be sleeping at her desk did she do that oftenfall asleep while working all the timeespecially when she pulled allnighters did you often visit her office and find her asleep not often minettes eyes narrowed sometimes id bring her dinner and wed eat together amanda came back with a tray of mugs milk sugar and splenda here we go i poked around in your cabinets i hope these cups are okay theyre fine minette doused her coffee with milk and artificial sweetener i dont want you to think that i made a habit out of going to her office i never liked to bug her when she was working barnes nodded thinking about ten calls a day to dr kurtags office i mean occasionally id surprise her minette said couple of times i did find her asleep at her desk and here too at her home office shed fall asleep she was very tired you can imagine barnes nodded and glanced at amanda who was ignoring his pleading eyes if you wouldnt mind ms padgett we do have a couple of questions for you call me minette she sipped coffee and nodded go ahead im more awake now barnes decided to forestall the bombshell would you like to know about our progress on the ransacking of your apartment minette looked momentarily confused ohyes of course did you find the bastard no but were getting close barnes lied what do you mean minette asked what have you found out were not at liberty to discuss everything but we found some interesting forensic evidence barnes was pleased with his glib tone of voice like what kind of forensic evidence for starters amanda said it doesnt appear that the vandals were out for anything specific we think they just wanted to make a mess were there were two of them or maybe just one barnes said the point were trying to make is that the mess appeared to be superficial not when youre the one cleaning it up minette said im sure thats true but we think someone is trying to throw the police off track how do you know that we can tell these things minette theres just something about it that looks funny as soon as we know more well pass on that information to you in the meantime can you think of anyone who has access to your condo my housekeeper and the condo manager wed like to talk to them amanda said could you get me their numbers sure she got up and came back a few minutes later with the information emilia has worked for us for two years i dont see her doing anything like that but the manager is kinda creepy creepy in what way you know she lowered her eyes lewd looks well check him out minettes eyes drifted to the wall clock she stood and wandered around the room anything else amanda said nothing deferring to barnes he was senior anyway let him handle it he said could you sit back down for just a moment minette why please after minette sat barnes said theres no easy way to say this so im going to be blunt did you know that davida grayson was infected with gonorrhea gonorrhea minette appeared truly stunned like in std gonorrhea amanda nodded the coroner found evidence at the autopsy holy moly shit in a few ticks of time the womans features had turned from baffled to enraged she flung her coffee cup across the room that motherfucker bastard she got up and started to pace ill kill him i swear to god ill kill the fucking bast she stopped talking and turned to the police i dont mean that literally im just so fucking furious how could he do this to me who is he amanda asked kyle of course kyle bosworth she spat out the name son of a bitch are you sure you got it from him barnes asked she turned her wrath on him look detective i dont know what you think about me and frankly right now i dont give a shit i only began seeing kyle because i was so goddamn lonely i loved davida but it gets real old drinking by yourself if she would have been a tiny bit more available i wouldnt have had to look elsewhere amanda said i dont think he meant it that way minette it sure as hell sounded accusatory i think he meant to ask if it were possible that someone gave the disease to davida other than you that suggestion did little to mollify minettes fury her face turned bright red if davida didnt have time for me she certainly didnt have time for another woman or man said barnes you two have a lot of nerve and for your information davida wasnt into men she burst into tears id like you both to go now amanda said we dont mean to be intrusive minette but youre going to be anyway i really need you both to leave barnes said you need to get tested what do you think of course ill get tested when you get the results could you give us a call please no i wont give you a call please i dont give a shit about you or her or anything else a new batch of tears why is everyone always fucking me up im sorry amanda said no youre not minette wiped her eyes im going to call up that bastard and give him a piece of my mind barnes said i dont blame you for being angry but maybe you should wait until youre tested if you come back negative you may be angry at the wrong person minette shook her head its impossible for me to be angry at the wrong person because im so fucking angry at everyone barnes kept his eyes on the picture window the one that framed a magnificent view of the bay a lot more interesting than watching kyle bosworth pace back and forth the man was raking his hair with long slender fingers the parallel rows cut into the shafts reminded barnes of a field during planting season summers working the ranches notepad in hand amanda kept refocusing in on the moving target im sorry that you had to find out from us you should know that minette accused you of giving it to her the bitch bosworth exclaimed the absolute bitch i take it you dont agree no i dont agree i dont know what that wicked witch was talking about i was clean when i met her and if anybody gave anything to anyone it was she who gave it to me he muttered as he paced this is great this is just fucking great so you had no idea you might be infected amanda stated none whatsoever he glared at her i had no symptoms have no symptoms why would i be infected i dont routinely go around cheating on my spouse minette was a distraction and only because yves works too hard same thing minette said about davida barnes thought minette wasnt even a serious distraction bosworth continued i like women but i prefer men why in the world would i suspect i was infected with anything amanda said not to get too clinical but symptoms of the disease appear much earlier in men than in women that stopped bosworths running a rut in the rug the symptoms burning pus hard to pee no ive never had it but in this day and age one educates oneself he brightened the obvious conclusion from no symptoms is no clap i know it can be latent but puleeze suddenly standing straight amanda said mr bosworth you need to talk to a doctor men do get more obvious symptoms and they get them earlier than women do but there are no hardandfast rules barnes said also its easier for a man to give the disease to women than for men to get the disease from women kyle stared at him are you saying that yves gave me a dose anger tightened his face he started pacing again ill kill that bastard i should have known all those late nights were more than work whoa whoa whoa barnes said before you consider homicide maybe you want to get yourself tested it could be that yves has been working late at night and youre not infected at all kyle stopped moving and stared into space yes that probably should be the first stepmaybe im not even infectedfirst things first eh maybe im clean that would certainly be nice heh heh if you two will excuse me now i have to make a rather embarrassing appointment amanda stood up from the couch will you let us know the results as soon as you find out whats it your business it might have some relevance to davida graysons murder ruling me out kyle proclaimed and here i was enjoying being a suspect so delicious when you know youre innocent you will let us know sir yes of course but please dont call me let me call you if i get a reprieve on this i dont want yves to know i was tested i think hed tolerate my indiscretion but the man has an absolute phobia of germs the two interviews turned out to be the highlights of the detectives day the remainder of their time was spent chasing down leads that deadended at five in the afternoon barnes put in calls to minette padgett and kyle bosworth reminding them to phone as soon as they got their test results they didnt expect to hear from minette but held out hope that bosworth would cooperate bosworth figured a negative would rule him out if only life were so simple no disease meant only that kyle was out of the infection loop though if there was a good reason to seriously suspect him neither barnes nor amanda could come up with it flagging blood sugar made it hard to work and before returning to their cubicles they made a pit stop at melanies snagging barness favorite corner table will stoked his engine on black caffeine and amanda ordered a decaf nosugaradded vanilla latte with nonfat milk barnes said are you sure theres even coffee in that concoction i dont know how you drink it black rots your stomach lining its already rotted from dealing with all these deceptive jokers lord give me a dishonest drug dealer any day of the year at least i know what im dealing with notice how minette didnt make eye contact when she was talking about her creepy condo manager amanda made quotes with her fingers while we were in la a couple of the uniforms canvassed the complex the residents had nothing but nice things to say about davida she sipped foamy milk minette was a different story how so she wasnt friendly for one thing her downstairs neighbor had a runin with her about making too much noise late at night davida smoothed it over by assuring they would take off their shoes after ten minette being difficult is a given mandy now weve got to get from there to murder sure be nice if we had the shotgun barnes said we dont even know if minette has ever fired a gun we should see if she has any permits on file i can do that amanda regarded her partner youre still skeptical about her she was with kyle until early morning and both of them were more than a little looped davida was murdered with a deadon single shot even with a shotgun that requires coordination hard to get it wrong when youre a foot away from the person whos sleeping i still say the murder looks male more violent than it needed to be it was done up close and personal by someone who knew how to use a gun this was not the work of a hysterical drunken woman another sexist nono amanda grinned does male mean youre back to don newell he called davida and she called him back were taking donnies word what the conversation was about i think i can justify speaking to him again lets say its newell why would he kill davida first thought is he was having an affair with her and she threatened to tell his wife the wife who hates davida quote unquote said amanda meaning theres another suspect but if davida knew about the resentment why would she threaten to tell newells wife also from everything ive ever heard about her she had a vested interest in being gay so maybe donnie threatened to expose her why would he do that hes got a wife and kids hes got a good position with sacramento pd even if they screwed once in a while he wasnt in love with her and had to know there was no future in the relationship also you yourself said he seemed shocked by the murder give me a reason why hed drive down to berkeley and blow her head off with a shotgun i dont have a good reason amanda and im not saying he did it im just saying it looks like a man did it barness cell rang and he glanced at the number its bosworth he depressed the green button barnes kyle bosworth detective there was lightness in the mans voice thanks for calling back said barnes so far so good said bosworth as if talking to himself a couple of the blood tests will take a little time but my doctors nearly certain im clean his voice turned hard no thanks to that bitch good to hear mr bosworth for all we know minette may be clean too then how did davida oh sure our late state rep wasnt a saint sure why not were all human ta ta detective im going to go out and have a wonderfully cholesterolladen dinner did minette ever talk to you about problems between davida and her no response on the other end hello yes detective im still here anything minette says needs to be taken with an entire quarry of salt what did she tell you mr bosworth i should preface what im about to tell you our fling minette and me what we said and what we did was often the product of overindulgence you drank together minette was a huge drinker and not a pleasant drunk when she got pickled shed go into a litany of complaints about everyone and everything she told me while drunk that she was sure that davida was fooling around on her did she suspect anyone specific im sure she suspected a lot of people with enough bourbon in her she could be downright paranoid did she mention any names nothing i recall can you remember if minette specified davidas paramour as being male or female again bosworth went silent causing barnes to ask if he was still on the line yes yesdavida with a man well that would be interesting ive never heard anything about her swinging both ways but im not terribly surprised we all have a bit of both yin and yang in us whether we admit it or not the best place to reinterview minette was the station they flipped a coin amanda lost the toss and made the call to get minette in amanda decided to appeal to the womans vanity minette picked the phone up on the third ring whispered a boozy hello ms padgett im so sorry to bother you again but this is detective isis if i could just a have a moment of your time id be very grateful whaat my partner and iwe were discussing things and we both decided that we really needed your help would it be possible for you to come to our office to chat with us for a bit what about were making some headway but you knew davida better than anyone else and we could use your insight i did know davida bettern anyone so you tell me why tha bitch wont let me do anythin at the memorial there was no way the woman was fit to interview tonight but maybe amanda could set something up for tomorrow how about this minette come in and help us out and ill call lucille grayson and make a personal appeal for you to be part of the service how does that sound youll never change the hags mind shes a real bitch let me try minette amanda took in a silent breath and let it out when can you come in not tonight too late it was quarter to six lord only knew how long shed been hitting the bottle youre right how about tomorrow say ten am mebbe eleven eleven would be perfect ill call you at ten thirty to see if youre on schedule sure bye oh by the way did you get tested yet a long pause good news the doctor thinks im clean thats very good news i suppose bye amanda placed the phone back in the cradle being clean meant minette realized that her worst fear had been true davida had been cheating on her the big question was with whom minette must be wondering the same thing that could explain her drinking this early she looked around the squad room for barnes tucked into a corner facing the wall talking on the phone she went over and tapped him on the shoulder barnes whispered a gotta go into the receiver and disconnected his cell who were you talking to amanda asked casually no one on the phone talking to no one theyve put people away for far less will it wasnt businessrelated amandas smile widened to a grin you were talking to that cop in la amanda what was her name amanda snapped her fingers marge tall drink of water but nicelooking ill grant you that she adopted an orphan in her teens the kid goes to caltech we were just talking about kids youve never had any i was doing the listening willie and margie sitting in a tree are you going down south or is she coming up north shes got a couple of days off can we move on to business sure because i took care of some minettes coming down to the stationhouse tomorrow at eleven you got her to come in barnes nodded with approval amanda punched his shoulder lightly call it the old charm im going home now to work my magic on my husband unless you want my advice on something like what like where to take margie theyre predicting high sixties with sunshine you should rent a convertible and take her to wine country spring for some bucks and stay at the sonoma mission inn that actually wasnt a bad idea but damn if barnes would give her any satisfaction you can go now mandy ill be in around nine tomorrow me too god and traffic willing ill call minette at around ten thirty tomorrow to remind her about the appointment shes already a bit inebriated so ill probably have to remind her of our conversation no doubt shell be hung over and in a foul mood barnes said ill pick up some juice donuts whatever every little bit helps if only it were that simple amanda said get aspirin too at ten thirty in the morning minette was still in bed having forgotten about the appointment amanda decided the most efficient thing to do was just pick her up and bring her in it took a full hour for the woman to dress and another half hour of plying her with designer coffee until she seemed coherent enough to interview even with the star treatment minette was surly her makeup couldnt hide the bags under her eyes making them look more muddy than exotic her hair was in need of a good brushing as well as a root job she was dressed in crumpled khakis a white tee and sneakers the woman was lanky and thin and from the back she could have passed for an adolescent boy amanda escorted her into the interview room and helped her to a chair can i get you anything to eat it makes me nervous when youre too nice minette groused thats just the way we are here to help and we need your help a munch minette considered her response as if world peace depended on it i suppose i wouldnt mind a muffin anything reducedfat not a problem be right back while amanda got someone to pick up the muffins barnes watched minette through a oneway mirror she seemed more tired than nervous and to underscore the point she lay her head down in the cradle of her arms and closed her eyes five minutes later she was snoring amanda came into the observation room barnes said if the woman has anxiety shes hiding it well maybe she has nothing to feel guilty about we all feel guilty about something its a matter of degree a policewoman entered and handed amanda the goody bag she passed it to barnes who pulled out a bran muffin and chomped half of it in one bite by way of explanation he said no time to eat this morning what were you doing while i was babysitting ms padgett the official memorial service for davida is tomorrow afternoon at two in sacramento i want to set up an interview with lucille grayson afterward thanks for telling me im telling you now barnes said i got us tickets for the noon train he finished his muffin and stood ready sure lets see what sleeping beauty has to say for herself gently amanda rocked minettes shoulder minette woke up with a start and it took her a few moments to remember where she was a thin line of drool had slipped out of the corner of her mouth she sucked it up and wiped her lips with the back of her hand wow minette sipped her coffee im more tired than i thought do we really have to do this now the sooner we finish the better our chances of catching a murderer barnes told her have a muffin amanda offered her the bag you can keep all of them if you want minette extracted the blueberry ones fine thanks heres some napkinsneed a refill on the coffee sure be right back as soon as amanda left barnes said again im sorry for your loss thanks can we get on with this she looked at her watch i really got things i need to do barnes smiled and amanda came back in with the coffee here we go anything else ms padgett is a busy woman barnes said without a trace of irony we should get started before we get into davida i have a couple of questions for you concerning the breakin at your condo minette peered over the rim of the coffee cup yeah you reported that you didnt think anything was missing is that still correct i didnt say that i said im not sure but your valuablescash jewelry expensive itemswere all accounted for i think im missing cash you think amanda asked yeah davida always kept cash on hand couple of hundred maybe more i only found fifty so maybe the burglars took the rest and your jewelry minette shrugged i guess its all there i didnt check every piece what does this have to do with davidas murder maybe nothing barnes moved in closer we have a little bit of a dilemma minette and we need your help at first we thought that the breakin was done by davidas murderer that he or she was looking for something specific makes sense right minette nodded barnes went on but then we realized davidas office wasnt ransacked so were figuring why would your condo be ransacked and not the office amanda said so now were thinking that the two incidents might be unrelated what do you think barnes asked how the hell would i know minette was irritated thats your job fair enough barnes answered so my first question is who would want to ransack your condominium and not take anything valuable am i supposed to answer that minette frowned if i could answer that we wouldnt be talking well heres the thing we didnt find any pry marks or forced entrance were figuring whoever messed up your place had a key minette took a few moments to collect her thoughts she looked from detective to detective then down at her watch i told you we had a creepy manager did you check him out we did amanda said he was working on the plumbing at one of your neighbors homes that night till midnight beyond seriously clogged line so he couldnt have done it said barnes minette didnt reply he pressed her who else had a key to your condo lucille grayson minette said you know i wouldnt be surprised if she did it amanda acted as if she took that seriously why would she do that to piss me off i told you the woman hates me barnes said sorry that night she was at the club with some friends we know for a fact wellthats what her friends would say she was identified by dozens of people and her nurse stayed with her the entire time she wasnt anywhere near the condo barnes tried to get the woman to make eye contact minette one way or the other were going to get to the bottom of the ransacking shouldnt you be concentrating on the murder were doing both barnes said and right now wed like to rule out a connection between the murder and the ransacking to do that weve really got to find out what happened at your place whoever did it minette i just want you to rest assured that were going to nail him or her and throw his or her sorry ass in jail amanda said so if you know anything about it nows the time to say something because detective barnes and i really dont want to be spinning our wheels see thats what gets us really pissed offwhen people lie to us yeah that really is a nuisance amanda concurred barnes said even though we realize that sometimes people dont lie to us on purpose know what im saying minette shook her head slowly bloodshot eyes focused on something in the distance amanda said people sometimes lie to protect someone or something would you know anything about that minette no her voice was strong but she started gnawing on her thumbnail you said you needed my help what do you want from me for one thing wed like to know who might have ransacked your condo barnes said because its definitely an inside job how can you be so sure no valuables are missing i told you some cash might be missing thats just for show amanda said know how we know that no answer the ransacking was messy but all of your dishes remained in the kitchen cabinets none of that stuff was touched a lot of disorder but almost no breakage barnes said easier on whoever had to clean it up amanda said you know minette if you have something to tell us tell us now before it gets too far barnes said we know youve been under terrible stress amanda said we know you havent been yourself at all we understand that its been an emotional time for you barnes smiled amanda smiled minettes left cheek quivered she hugged herself yanked at an errant strand of hair you have no idea how could we understand such loss amanda said we cant and were not even going to try but we do have to get to the bottom of what happened in your condo we do have to know what really happened what do you mean minette sniffed if i knew what happened id tell you barness smile turned reptilian we think you know way more than youre telling us so nows the time to get it off your chest amanda broke in while we can still help you i dont understand minette whispered if you tell us what happened minette we can do something for you you know being so stressed out and all well understand but said barnes if we waste valuable time trying to solve the ransacking and things begin to point in your direction he shook his head thats going to look very bad minette very very bad amanda leaned forward we think you know who did it honey and nows the time to tell us because if you dont tell us now we cant help you and we really want to help you yes we do want to help you but first weve got to know what really happened minette cried silent tears amanda reached over and took her hand its all right honey you can tell us it must be so hard for you it must have always been so hard for you with davida being away all the time i thought she was working minettes voice was clogged with emotion now i realize she had someone else she burst into tears how could she do that to me that bitch a bitch that came from a bitch im so sorry amanda said you must be terribly disillusioned with her totally she sniffed back tears i thought she was working so hard you must be so angry im furious i bet barnes said but you suspected the affair didnt you quickly she made eye contact with barnes then broke it off i suppose i did you came home after the press conference didnt you barnes said minette hesitated gave a guiltykid nod you came homealone disillusioned confused upsetall those things right nod nod alone in the place that you once shared with davida amanda said you must have been beside yourself with confusion and anger barnes said so to get rid of those horrible feelings maybe you threw something at the wall just because you were so upset amanda added i was very upset barnes said and then it went from there no answer we need your help minette we need the information straightarrow truthful you need to tell us what happened after you got home from the press conference i was upset minette said softly i threw a pillow at the wall the two detectives waited for more andthen i threw another pillowand another and then i turned over one of the couches i was surprised that it wasnt all that heavy so i turned over the other one she was breathing harder now and then i saw davidas office looking all neatlike it hadnt been used in ages because it hadnt been used in ages and i just knew in my heart of hearts that if she wanted to really work she could have worked at home so i began to take things out of her file cabinetsand tear them upand toss them because its not like she needed them anymore tears were streaming down her cheeks and then i went on to the closets and i threw clothing all over the placeand then the dressers and then she was sobbing hard i realized i had made a gigantic mess and that id have to clean it all up and i was so alone and lonely and more sobbing amanda offered her a tissue so then what did you do i turned the sofa back and put back a pillow but that only made me angrier and i felt so stupid and scaredi dont know who killed davida honestly i swear i dont know okay we believe you and barnes didsort of she seemed too hysterical to pull it off but he kept an open mind because he had been fooled before you were scared being alone then what i totally freaked myself out minette said i started thinking you know like your mind gets hold of something and just keeps going thats what happened to me the thoughts took over like whoever hurt davidamaybe hes coming to get me and here i was alone in the place which was now a total mess i was so scared i wanted to call the police but i felt stupid telling them that i was freaked out and scaredyou know thats what were here for barnes said yeah right minette dried her eyes with a tissue you guys are quick with traffic tickets but if i told anyone i was scared i bet not one cop would have come out to see me she had a point barnes thought amanda said you must have really felt alone i did so then what did you do barnes prompted i called the cops and told them that our place had been tossed i needed people to stop already with davida and focus on me she was dead but i wasnt minettes egotism took neither detective by surprise but her admission did in the future barnes said if you feel scared again there are people who can help you and you dont have to fib to get them to talk to you thats all it was meant to be she sobbed a stupid fib because i was desperate am i in trouble you filed a false police report barnes said so that could be trouble yes but i think the judge will take into consideration your circumstances minette nodded i should probably contact my lawyer probably amanda said if you cant afford one the county will give you one free of charge im okay with money she stood up on wobbly feet can i call my lawyer now first we need to read you your rights minette sat through the beginning of the routine numb inert when barnes got to the part about an attorney being provided she said you just said that i know all of it anyway from tv i watch a lot of tv because she left me all the time shes vain and egotistical and selfcentered barnes said once they returned to the other side of the oneway mirror but the real question is did she murder davida we went through her house and her clothes no bloodspattered clothing nothing with gunpowder residue no shoes with trace evidence of blood or carpet fiber no gun registration and theres no evidence that shes owned an illegal firearm she could have hired someone why would she want davida dead because she was cheating on her because davida left her alone once too often minette dealt with that said barnes doing her own cheating minette is a selfish little bitch who probably flew into a narcissistic rage when she found out that davida had someone on the sly okay so you like her amandas smile was weary barnes said you really like her for it no but i dont want to rule her out shes unstable and she knew davidas habits better than anyone no sense belaboring the subject are you coming to sacramento with me tomorrow of course why are you even asking the memorials scheduled the day after the funeral i set up the interview with lucille grayson for when its over barnes smiled like a cat with feathers in his teeth is that okay whats on your mind willie after the funeral im going to don newells place for dinner at five thirty she stared at him and im not invited i can get you invited but its up to you but you didnt mention me the first time around it was more of a social thing oldboy barbecue amanda whistled oh man first high school buds then jane meyerhoff then this maybe youd like to take over the entire case by yourself cmon amanda dont be you think im losing my touch i was the one who just got minette to confess to the breakin barnes had seen that as teamwork he said that was great but with donnie newell there might be things i can he might be uncomfortable talking in front of you goodoldboy sex talk woman talk said barnes specifically his relationship to davida while youre with him i could talk to the wife who hated davida or is she too hysterical and weak to pull it off i thought about that mandy i really did but then instead of the dinner being a friendly invitation and the boys retiring for a cigar its too much like a cop interview you know you take one i take the other he was making sense although amanda hated to admit it if you exclude me from anything one more time im walking this is a partnership remember mandy you know how much respect i have for you dont go there will im too pissed off for condescension look i really do respect your opinion as a matter of fact i took your advice she regarded him with narrowed eyes what advice you knowme and marge dunn i rented a convertible were going to drive through napa and sonoma do a couple of tastings actually barnes hadnt prepared a damn thing but amandas idea had been a good one and it seemed like a dandy time to tell her any idea if theres a cheese shop en route i think a cheese fruit and wine picnic would be great you agree amanda sighed actually i do have an address also try the olive press near sonoma and if shes still tolerating you by the end of the day ive got some dinner recommendations that would be super now cut the crap and rent that car and stop bullshitting me im still pissed will i know you are how about coffee at melanies ill pay she cracked up you think you can get me to come around with a measly mocha latte lunch youre getting warmer chez panisse i know one of the waitresses maybe if its slow thanks love to amanda smiled ill pull out the car while you check your wallet though she had no children davida grayson had left behind a legacy her lust for life her obsession with justice for the underclass her dogged pursuit of righteousness were iterated and reiterated by each speaker those who eulogized her knew her well enough to make it sound real everyone pledged not to let davidas dream of creating a new stemcell line perish with her in the end lucille grayson had acted with class and had allowed minette padgett to speak surprisingly minette was clear of thought and steady of balance she spoke briefly always a sign of discretion and from the heart if barnes hadnt known what a nutcase she was he mightve choked up when the hour was up the casket was loaded into the hearse and a community that had loved davida offered its final goodbyes the graveside service was to be a small and private affair amanda checked her watch as she and barnes filed out of the auditorium they joined the massive black wave undulating toward the exits it was shortly after three your mantoman dinner still on for five thirty far as i know did you see newell here i looked for him couldnt find him anywhere barnes answered weve got time to kill want to grab a cup of coffee why not she walked slightly ahead of him made her way through the throng civil but still pissed off outside the auditorium barnes caught up with her i called newell this morning youre invited for dinner why the change of heart because you should be there after dinner ill take donnie and you occupy jill newell just like you said neither detective spoke for several footsteps barnes said you know im a loner amanda i work well with partners but only up to a point i feel a little bad about that but not too bad i am what i am but that doesnt mean that when someone calls me on my bullshit i cant set it right they walked a couple more steps in silence did you tell newell i was definitely coming i said you might didnt know if you had other plans i dont now so ill call donnie and tell him its a go how about if i call jill and ask her if its okay for me to come to dinner then when she says yes ill thank her personally and ask her if i can bring anything woman to woman said barnes person to person as a state capital sacramento played a fine host to its politicians it had classy restaurants several art museums courtesy of crocker bank concert halls a few theaters and the arco arena with its nba team the almostchamp kings but like most cities it had multiple identities in sacramento s case that meant a mining history and agricultural presence when the kings made the playoffs the fans came armed with cowbells barnes had grown up in a semirural farming community twenty quiet miles from the capitol dome where like most of his schoolmates he learned how to shoot a rifle and use his fists the music of choice was country for the masses and bluegrass for those serious about guitar and fiddle having a gay brother and living in berkeley had altered barness perspective but had never totally erased it as amanda had pointed out sometimes he reverted to the cowboy thing sometimes to his detriment but this wasnt one of those times sitting at the newells big pine dinner table wearing his bolo tie a soft pair of wranglers and wellbroken boots he felt right at home the ranchstyle house sat on ten acres of oak and eucalyptus in a semiagi neighborhood with barns and paddocks the furniture was a chainstore leather ensemble complete with two lazboy lounge chairs fitted with cup holders that faced a sixtyinch flatscreen tv whatever art in sight was made by the newell kids most of the table conversation centered on the kids asking the adults to pass around the food everyone praised jill on her fine cooking which was no lie jill seemed to take little joy in the attention shy woman she always had been during the meal barnes snuck several sidelong glances at amanda who ate sparingly and complimented the behavior of the newells three kids as far as barnes could tell no thanks to don who was loose and jocular and made no attempt to act parental it was jill who ran a tight ship she was statuesque about five ten with a weathered oval face high cheekbones and piercing brown almond eyes that suggested indian blood her lips were full but she rarely smiled her hands had been roughened by use her fingers long but her fingernails short she wore tight jeans and a loosefitting sweatshirt her chestnutcolored hair was tied up in a high ponytail like that artistgeorgia okeeffe i dont remember the last time i ate so well barnes patted his stomach man that was terrific jill those ribs unbelievable jill acknowledged the comment with a slight smile and a soft thank you when she got up to clear the plates so did amanda sit amanda jill told her the kids will do it i really dont mind amanda said besides i know its a weekday and they must have homework i sure dont mind helping if you want them to get a jump on it well okay if youre sure positive jill nodded all right you three you caught a break go to your lessons and no computer privileges until all three of you are through she turned to her oldest a fifteenyearold boy named ryan if i catch you sneaking online before youre done there will be hell to pay understood her son gave her a look somewhere between a smile and smirk i hear you thanks for dinner then he grinned at his father who gave him a wink behind jills back amanda the millionaire fit in seamlessly she said i can wash or dry barnes knew shed grown up hard could still relate to anyone we have a dishwasher jill said even better ill load you need help hon don asked not even pretending to mean it were fine amanda answered don said jill would you mind if i show will your new shotgun go ahead jill said your new shotgun amanda said jills a crack shot don said we could use people like her for swat but id rather have her cooking jill frowned shooting people dont interest me see theres where were different newell managed to kiss his wife before she could turn away see you in a bit ladies after they were gone amanda took in a pile of dishes and began to push the leftover food into the garbage whered you learn how to shoot my daddy he took me hunting when i was ten at the time i hated it but i loved my daddy so i went along i never like to kill any animals so i took up skeet i discovered i had a good eye and good coordination when i was fifteen i started entering competitive shooting i have enough blue ribbons to paper my powder room but to me competition is sillya guys thing you know but it made my daddy real proud the shotguns for turkey hunting donnie bought it for me one of those gifts men get you cause they want to use it themselves donnies the hunter in the family jill nodded i used to just tag along you know but lately i decided if i was going to cook the holiday turkey i should be honest about where our meat comes from so now i pull the trigger i gotta say there is nothing like fresh game it is positively delicious im sure thats true you hunt nobut neither did my dadnot that it mattered amanda smiled i didnt have such a great relationship with my father but i dont dare complain my husband more than makes up for that deficit jill was silent then she said we all have our crosses to bear donnies got good intentions she shrugged you know what they say about good intentions i do he just gets caught up in stuff jill said he dont always think things through its cost him some promotions hows that instead of studying for the sergeants tests hes helping this old friend or that old friend or just shooting the bull down at bradys she faced amanda sometimes people take advantage of him thats not good not good at all jill exhaled but like i said hes a good man actually she said he had good intentions but amanda didnt correct her how long have you two been married twentyone years we met in high school oh amanda feigned ignorance did you know davida grayson she was also a local yes i knew davida were you at the memorial service today donnie was but i couldnt make it conflict with the schoolparentteacher thing jill shrugged it must have been sad very to be honest i didnt want to gotoo freaky you know to know someone who was murdered were you and davida friends oh heavens no i didnt like her at all back then but that was probably ignorance shed already come out when i was a sophomore and i thought it was gross you know women with women sure anyway that was a lifetime ago it didnt help my feelings that donnie had dated her also did you know that amanda shook her head keep those bald lies coming anyway after she came out donnie was sorely traumatized he got lots of ribbing from his friends i can imagine did you start dating him right after pretty much yeah the rest like they say is history jill smiled tightly how many children do you have changing the subject amanda said none yet they bear watching kids my oldest one really bears watching hes sneakylike some other people i know the implication was obvious but amanda didnt press her for more when people opened up too quickly there was often a backlash of anger you ever practice shooting on your own property what do you have here like twenty acres ten and a half but it looks bigger cause a lot of its clearing sometimes when im in the mood i do target practice on a bullseye that i got hanging on the trees if i used my shotgun on the oaks id blow them to a stump well maybe one day we can go shooting together im not a bad shot but theres certainly room for improvement jill hid a smile be happy to show you whatever i know that would be great amanda was very satisfied with the turn of events both donnie and now jill could be suspects if she went shooting with jill it would be a good way to pocket some shotgun casings barnes looked at the twelvegauge browning gold lite pump gun nice piece of equipment didnt know you were a hunter newell gave him a chance to hold it then took it back and placed it on the gun rack locking the bar into place oh yeah for some years now life can get tedious willie a man needs a hobby he turned to barnes youve been itching to get me alone all evening what do you want to talk about what do you think dont turn that question with a question shit on me newell said ive been a cop long enough for you to respect me now either spit it out or go home barnes said fair enough you need to tell me about your relationship with davida grayson and you need to be honest newell smiled and shook his head i knew this was coming so youve had time to think about it nothing to think about willie davida was an old friend and a controversial politician if she needed police help i was happy to give it to her buddy thats it what about your past with the woman thats what it is will its a past i need to know about it donnie because this case seems to revolve around it how so barnes was caught in his lie wish i could tell you but you know the drill am i considered a suspect you were one of the last people to talk to her i only have your word what the conversation was about the men were silent newell shrugged like i said theres been nothing between us for the last twentyfive years not that i would have minded because at one time i was crazy about that girl she fucked like a bunny you have no idea when youre seventeen thats all a girls got to do to make you crazy about her i know all about that barnes said so you had no idea she was gay i dont think she had any idea she was gay barnes was silent all right maybe she did know newell told him she was the one that suggested doing a threesome with jane meyerhoff i was a normal redblooded american teenage stud and that meant i was horny all the time when she suggested a threesome man i thought i died and went to heaven i guess looking back at it she used me to get to janey howd it happen it was one of those pivotal moments willie we were double dating and went back to janes house because her parents were never homealways off to some fancy destination there were four of us janes date some loser derek hewitt i remember hewitt said barnes tall skinny dumb and rich rich was a big thing to janeys parents anyway we were downing shooters and smoking weed and getting high hewitt got sick to his stomach and fell asleep on janeys bed the rest of us were feeling no pain when davida threw out the suggestion janey and i thought she was joking newell turned grave his voice lowered but she wasnt it happened slowlyyou know just kissing and copping feels thenbam newell was sweating afterward was the scary part jane freaked out it took the both of us and a lot more weed to calm her down convince her that it was no big deal only normal experimentation a couple of months later davida came out she and jane remained friends but i became an outsider real quick so davida and jane hooked up that long ago i rightly dont know if they did or didnt eventually i started dating jill cause she was hot too wanted it all the time though looking back it seems like she wasyou know maybe acting like she really didnt like it as much as she pretended howd davida react to your hanging with jill dont know that she reacted at all davida and i were pretty much avoiding each other mostly i was avoiding her i was embarrassed stuff guys said i can understand that like i couldnt compete with a carpet muncher crap like that newell frowned jane and i went our separate ways and she went back to hewitt until we graduated high school then jane and davida went off to the uc and hewitt went to stanford and i went to community college were talking ancient history pal barnes nodded willie the last time i had really anything personal to do with davida is when i brought her to the senior prom and thats the truth you took davida to the prom what a dumbass thing to do jill has never let me forget it whyd you do it because davida begged me and i guess i thought i owed her something for the great sex id only been dating jill for a few months and the girl was a sophomore i figured shed have two more chances in her junior and senior year also since davida was a lesbian i thought jill wouldnt care he laughed boy was i one stupid shit and you havent done anything sexually with her since she came out i believe i already answered that dont get testy donnie i have my reasons for asking davida had gonorrhea and it didnt come from her girlfriend minette there was a long silence newell looked up at the black sky did it come from a guy i have no idea don but we do know that the bug is passed more easily from boy to girl than from girl to girl son of a bitch he whispered so she was carrying on with a man maybe if she would have asked me for a tumble i dont know what i would have done she was still a finelooking woman his blue eyes focused in on barness face lucky for me she didnt put me in that bind where were you the night davida was murdered every minute of the night home in bed mind if i test any of these shotguns for ballistic comparison newell thought long and hard what that rifling stuff hell i couldnt care less but if i agree jills gonna wonder why i dont want to give my wife any reason to suspect me of anything willie even though i didnt do nothing you know how it is sometimes that just dont matter to the missus more silence why dont you see how far your investigation takes you without my guns if youre still curious then ill comply but i sure as hell wont be happy about it who in their right mind would be happy being viewed as a murder suspect lucille grayson lived in a threestory victorian shinglesided and stately the curving front porch was set up with wicker furniture including an oldfashioned swinging love seat the house had been painted a soft cream and trimmed in a green that blended with the surrounding acreage specimen oak eucalyptus sycamore and pine dotted the velvet lawn flower gardens shouted color orchards of citrus and peach and plum pumped out fruit well beyond the growing season inland california was flat hot and dry but this neighborhood had been bulldozed into hillocks and irrigated nearly a century ago with gold rush optimism and enough truckedin water anything could happen barnes and amanda were almost a half hour early and they secreted themselves under an oak whose boughs hung so low they nearly touched the ground sipping the peets coffee theyd picked up along the way they watched visitors arrive and leave during the entire drive barnes had slept now he yawned and blinked himself awake amanda had stayed up just as late then made the drive back to san francisco shed ended up talking to larry then cuddling then more and hadnt slept much at all what a doll her husband was but she knew eventually fatigue would beat her to the ground right now though she felt amped good morning so what do you think barnes said about what about barry bonds taking steroids about your old homeboy donnie newell still suspicious of him havent ruled him out but he said we could test his guns and he didnt give off any obvious tells honestly i dont know mandy well im liking jill newell shes always resented davida she doesnt trust her husband and she knows how to shoot if don and davida rekindled their passion and jill found out shed be major pissed i dont think they were doing the nasty she took in her partners eyes why not when he told me they werent he seemed straight and you believe him just like that he was upfront about everything mandy not a trace of edge when i told him about the gonorrhea his reaction was resentful almost outraged but not nervous it was more like if davida was going to fuck a guy it should have been him ah vanity vanity the male species is thy name i dont think thats the quote pard anyway he started reminiscing and it sounds like he and davida had quite a thing going before she came out he filled amanda in she said all the more reason for wanting to start up again i guessyeah he was bragging but it had more of awistful quality like life was better back then were talking over twenty years ago im not saying dons been an angel but if he cheated i dont see it with davida because i think he wouldve told me stud talk guy to guy its what we do on the other hand maybe that was a ploy big fella amanda said he confesses to what you already know so he doesnt have to tell you anything new you could be right amanda smiled so weve basically reversed positions im liking jill and possibly don and youre not thats what we do right the old openminded waltz moments later when hed finished his coffee id feel a whole lot better if we had some kind of forensics lets see what happens when we test the newells guns any reason we didnt take them last night i told donnie id hold off he didnt want to give jill the idea that he might be even a remote suspect whens the right time will after hes dumped the guns i took down the serial numbers hes not gonna dump anything one minute youve got a hardon for him the next minute you let him off the hook i dont understand you barnes turned to her right now even if the newells are involved we got shit on the case if we rule their guns out well have less than shit so we engage in major denial to forestall disappointment you are not making sense we need to go back today and get the guns suit yourself but my gut says it isnt either of them so who does your gut say it is so far my guts only good at eliminating suspects not catching them amanda regarded her partner paler than usual and his hands had a slight tremor maybe you should ease off on the allblack will its not the coffee mandy its being back here i used to clear brush over there pointing couldnt have been more than fourteen no one ever offered me a drinkyeah im a bundle of raw nerve endings tom clancy was right you cant go home furthermore you shouldnt even if you could that was thomas wolfe thomas wolfe the writer in the white suit thats tom wolfe barnes was irritated what im trying to say is ill be happy to get the hell out of here the interior of the mansion was hot and close and noisy a horde of wellwishers drank chardonnay munched on tea sandwiches and made small talk lucille grayson held court from a camelback ruby brocade chair in a simple black dress black stockings and black orthopedic shoes her makeup was discreet her eyes dry as a san joaquin summer when she saw barnes she cocked a beckoning finger he quickly made his way through the crowd again im so sorry mrs grayson lucille couldnt hear him she shouted go into the parlor ill meet you there in twenty minutes barnes had no idea where the parlor was hed never gotten past the front room davida had always met him outdoors stealing away was part of the thrill the two of them under the stars smelling the menthol of eucalyptus faint overtones of horseshit her hair the quick uptake of her breath he sidled through the crowd and searched for the parlor this day and age who had a parlor amanda as stylish as any of lucilles friends saw him and made her way over she wants to meet us in the parlor wherever that is house like this it would be off the side with a porch view she pointed and he followed once again groping through the mob until he felt a hard tap on his shoulder he looked back faced jane meyerhoffs steely eyes she yelled something i can help you with wheres the parlor why meeting lucille there jane pointed exactly where amanda had grabbing barness hand she accompanied the two detectives to a carved door then stepped forward and flung it open the room was musty highceilinged draped in heavy red velvet fringed with gold nailhead chairs and tufted ottomans were arranged in formal seatings a mirrorbacked walnut bar was stocked with bottles and crystal stemware to barness eye it resembled a spaghetti western whorehouse he wondered if davida had brought any boys here jane closed the door behind her and looked amanda over both of them in black suits svelte groomed like champs like a photo from a charity luncheon jane meyerhoff she proffered a hand i dont believe weve met amanda isis would you like a drink water janes eyes drifted to barnes i drink whatever youre pouring well said jane inspecting the bottles lucille has glenlivet glenfiddich glenmorangiearent you a bourbon man at times the second row is wild turkey knob creek jane anythings fine and just a fingers worth were paying our respects but were also working working with lucille wherever it takes thanks for directing us not a problem jane poured the drinks allowed herself two fingers of vodka lucille asked me to handle things today you know help marshal the great unwashed tilting her head toward the door waves of chatter leaked through the wood i didnt speak it mightve provoked minette not the time or the place amanda said precisely barnes said you and minette dont get along jane took a long swallow of vodka no one gets along with minette if youll excuse me i should see how lucilles doing she hurried out amanda said sensitive topic minette before barnes could answer the door opened and lucille entered holding a cane and clutching janes arm barnes pulled out a chair and jane eased the old woman into it something to drink lucille johnny walker rocks red or black at this point im not tasting anything as jane poured make it a double dear thanks so much for agreeing to see us mrs grayson amanda said lucille gripped the handle of her walking stick carved ivory a womans bust perhaps i should thank you its a good excuse to get the hell out of there jane handed her the drink and lucille polished it off with astonishing speed ah thats good take over for me janey someone has to hold down the fort jane said youre sure you dont need me here lucille waved a dismissive hand go on out there and make sure no one steals the silver jane sighed heavily and left lucille looked at barnes im assuming willie that you and your pretty partner wish to talk to me without her hanging around you read my mind mrs grayson your mind is not that tough to decipher barnes smiled you cut me to the quick mrs grayson im good at that lucilles eyes misted davida was good at it also though she was patient with me im sure i was a giant pain in the posterior im sure you werent lucille patted his hand you didnt know her very well did you willie barnes kept a straight face she was younger than me in jacks class jack knew everyoneand everyones business true enough how long has it been since he passed away ten years really i can scarcely believe how quickly the time passes it does indeed mrs grayson you can only imagine how rushed life has become for an old lady like myself i recall all of them as youngsters glynnis jackand now davida life has dealt me bins of shit but i refuse to die she waved her glass thank god for alcohol get me another willie barnes complied lucille faced amanda im not being very polite am i going on about old times with which youre not familiar she looked around absently as if studying the overstuffed room for the first time ill need to get back to the barbarians shortly what is it that you want to ask me barnes rubbed his hands together this might get a little prickly lucille sat and drank and waited impassive do you know if davida was having an affair lucilles eyes whipped away from barness face and settled on the fireplace she took another sip of whiskey i dont like minette never did and davida was well aware of that fact if my daughter had someone else she wouldnt have told me because i would have nagged her to dump minette once and for all let me rephrase the question amanda said if davida had someone else who might it have been the old lady shrugged amanda said is it possible that it could have been a man lucille didnt answer right away no i dont think so davida got a lot of mileage out of being a lesbian all the more reason to keep an affair with a man hidden a man as if considering an exotic species no lucille shook her head i knew my daughter better than one might think she wasnt interested in men another sip of whiskey she stared at amanda a smile spread slowly as the saying goes it takes one to know one barnes almost choked on his drink although lucilles admission shouldnt have come as a shock it was wellknown around town that shed treated her husband coldly had had no use for men since the divorce he thought that resulted from a bad marriage but maybe hed mixed up cause and effect one of the reasons i didnt like minette lucille said is that she wasnt real just a shallow stupid girl using my daughter as a meal ticket now its out in the openwhat that little bitch was doing all those nights my daughter was working barnes rubbed his chin i think davida was doing more than working mrs grayson davida had gonorrhea but minette is clean there was someone else in your daughters life lucille took a deep breath and let it out i see thats why i asked if there was a man in her life said amanda the disease is passed easier from male to female than from female to female aha lucille nodded i see your logic but i still know my daughter if she got the disease it was from a woman most probably a woman who sleeps around with men any candidates barnes asked her lucille smiled youre wondering about jane jane moved back to berkeley she and davida reignited their friendship that silly boat ride why anyone would subject themselves to bumping and lucille checked herself finished her second drink could davida and jane have had a thing oh yes definitely sitting back and enjoying the look on the detectives faces amanda said definitely i know it for a fact dear not that either one would tell me but im able to recognize love when i see it davida always loved jane it just took jane twenty years and all those ridiculous marriages to decide she loved davida excusing herself lucille left them alone in the parlor barnes steadied his hand with more bourbon amanda drank water and said well that was earthshattering jane and davida just like the old days i told jane about the gonorrhea when we met up a couple of nights ago she was pretty casual about it suggested davida had gotten it from minette now im thinking she was out to make a point this has nothing to do with me maybe a diversion but maybe also the truth will no matter what mother says davida couldve been flinging with a y chromosome weve gone over all of her emails for the last three months personal and business havent found anything hinting at a secret male lover nor have we found anything linking jane to davida barnes conceded the point maybe janes still in denial about her own sexuality or lucille has it all wrong its not just lucille it was alice kurtag too amandas turn to concede jane wanted the relationship but wasnt ready to come out mandy what if jane was all thrilled about hooking up with davida and davida wanted to go public jane wasnt ready for that she goes to davidas office to beg her to hold off on any announcements but davida refuses she visits with a shotgun in hand so they drank together and had an argument jane left and returned to do the deed donnie newell told me that jane freaked out bigtime after they did a threesome if davida threatened to out her she couldve freaked out again maybe newell was taking the heat off himself and directing you elsewhere and we know he owns shotguns barnes gathered his thoughts okay you win ill go back and round up newells guns amanda applauded silently barnes said that doesnt mean that jane is off the hook all this time youve been saying the crime had a masculine quality to it then we get a decent male suspect andor his eagleeye shootin wife and you switch to jane meyerhoff does jane even know how to shoot never saw her actually do it but she grew up on a ranch okay enough of this ive been blabbing so much i might as well run for city council well get the guns and well talk to jane see if we cant get her to admit to the affair how do we crack her lucille figured it out its useless denying it lucilles a lesbian with a lesbian daughter she could be accused of overactive gaydar jane denies it its her word against mothers then we lie tell jane that davida told lucille about their affair in no uncertain terms and lucille told us then we sit back no judging and watch how she reacts ah the suspense said amanda i love my job lucilles visitors had thinned but the mansion still buzzed with latecomers after mingling for a few minutes amanda and barnes found jane in the kitchen placing cucumber cress and egg salad finger sandwiches on a silver tray she looked up and resumed her work barnes said we need to talk some more about what forced lightness in her voice barnes placed a hand on her arm immediately janes eyes watered barnes whispered lucille told us tears etched a meandering trail through janes foundation told you what no question mark in her inflection about you and davida jane stared at the refrigerator barnes said she told us what does an old woman know davida told her everything i dont believe that lucille wants to make it public janes face infused with color more than a blush the deep hue that comes from a hard slap but why would she want she shook her head cant we discuss this later im afraid not amanda said barnes said the only way were going to get your side of it is if you tell us jane wiped her hands on a napkin and picked up the tray amanda took it from her and placed it out of reach the gesture being deprived of her task made jane sag my side of it sick smile barnes said how long have you been involved with davida please will janes eyes were pleading cant you just let things be my mother is here she doesnt know and i really dont see the point of her finding out now that davidas gone im not talking to your mother janey im talking to you how long have you been involved with davida janes eyes skittered between amanda and barnes then trailed back to the fridge amanda followed her gaze nothing to see on the old subzero no cutesy kitschy magnets no personal touches the kitchen was as sterile as an operating room jane said since i filed for my divorce her shoulders lowered another inch parker went crazy started doping more heavily became an absolute psychotic shit i called davida for support becausei dont know whyshed always been there when i was downbefore all those men and she did it again became my main source of support because mother had zero tolerance for my complaints against parker sometimes i think she preferred parker to me never arguing with her dressing right then he goes and turns into such a shit but its my fault spoiled janey whining about another man gone bad parker played it horrible to me but courtly to her mother is not only a gossip she is also the most superficial person i know makes minette look like gandhi if davida hadnt been there for me i would have had a total breakdown she stopped talking abruptly gasped for breath cried and didnt bother to wipe her face amanda got a napkin and did it jane didnt seem to notice the kindness amanda said were you two planning a future together we werent planning anything nothing was planned it just happened even after we continued to see each other i told davida i wasnt sure davida certainly didnt push me she was a busy woman she had things other than sex on her mind you know about the gonorrhea i assume youve been tested jane looked down at her feet i am currently on medication apparently i was asymptomatic do you know who gave it to you she laughed bitterly that could be a bit of a listincluding my ex among his many other transgressions the man got around of course mother doesnt know anything about that she thinks the divorce was another one of my quote unquote impulsive follies barnes said janey did parker know that you and davida were intimate i dont see how he couldve i havent spoken to the asshole in over seven months amanda said how do you think hed react if he found out that you not only left him but you took up with a woman how would he find out lucille knew barnes said alice kurtag also suspected there was something between you two even minette wondered about the two of you being more than friends word gets around jane amanda said so please answer the question how would parker react if he thought that you left him for davida jane licked her lips when hes threatened parker can be an extremely violent man over the past seven months ive heard his drug use has gotten out of hand what does he take weed coke pills bitter smile an eclectic man does he know how to shoot a shotgun barnes asked jane blanched parker loved to hunt loved guns i never let him keep any of them in the house he was too unpredictable whered he keep them in storage i couldnt tell you where amanda said where can we find parker jane licked her lips again we owned a cabin near the river about an hour from here as part of the divorce settlement i agreed to let him buy me out at a bargain price even with that he hasnt paid me lord only knows where hell get the money among parkers other wonderful traits is a congenital inability to keep a job the deeds still in your name it is until he comes up with the cash so the cabin is yours but he lives there he might said jane for all i know hes in timbuktu i always hated the place dirty lousy plumbing roughing it was his idea her eyes softened when davida and i were on the river roughing it seemed fine amanda broke in do we have your permission to enter the property including the interior of the cabin sure why not she gasped you really think he oh god oh god rising to her feet hands fisted go if it was him go and kill him ill draw you a map barnes floored his honda the car balked tried to tackle the grade kicked back finally slipped into gear and chugged along blackness all around amanda rechecked her gun and wondered if the backup theyd called would get there rural sheriff claiming to be understaffed he hadnt sounded too impressed to begin with and berkeley had caused him to grow silent thats unincorporated land not really our jurisdiction whose is it good question ill see what i can do the tiny car continued to labor up the mountain road why did a big man like will drive such dinky wheels up here in the boonies small things like insufficient acceleration mattered janes scrawled map was helpful to a point then everything started to look the same and landmarks vanished in the darkness the gps amanda had attached to her handheld computer had been rendered useless ten miles back reception blocked by massive oaks and giant redwoods whats wrong said will with what youre fidgeting like you do when you have serious doubts if we really suspect this joker of blowing off davidas head we could be making a big mistake by going in alone davida was sleeping were wide awake mr macho hey he said its a social call well ring the guys doorbell and act nice and polite its almost ten pm and we didnt clear it with torres we tried is it our fault hes at a fundraiser shaking his head community gardens theres a lawenforcement issue for you amanda went silent five miles later barnes said you know maybe its a good idea for you to wait in the car especially if parker doesnt cotton to women i should just sit by and watch as parker plugs you in the gut if you hear ratatat put the pedal to the metal and get the hell out of here youve got someone to go home to not funny will barnes smiled wondering if hed really been aiming for humor he slowed to five per had amanda shine a flashlight on janes map drove another ten miles and forked left nothing is going to happen to me or to you were just paying the guy a visit thats all amanda shook her head just make sure your gun is drawn they came to a dirt lane marked by a small wooden sign nearly overtaken by vines and suckers rising glen no trespassing a chainlink gate sagged on its hinges barnes got out no lock the clasp wasnt even set in place swinging the gate inward he got back in the car and coasted down on a rutted dirt lane amanda said its so dark i can barely see my hands barnes stopped had another look at the map clicked off the flashlight when we come to a pond its fifty yards to the right moments later amanda spotted a pinpoint of light a sliver of moon breaking on water she pointed over there off in the distance another dot of illumination amber like the lit end of a cigarette they watched for a while the dot never moved barnes said probably a porch light he aimed the honda at it driving carefully along the curving surfaces of the pond bank a small structure came into view more of a leanto than a cabin fashioned of rough planks and topped with tar paper lowwattage porchlight no illumination through any of the windows parked to the side was a chevy blazer long unwashed tires so underinflated they were perilously close to flat barnes said guy treats his wheels like that hes not taking care of himself amanda said im sure hell love getting woken up barnes killed the headlights switched off the engine the two of them got out of the car just stood there something small and frightened scurried into the brush an owl hooted a burble sounded from the pond the air smelled pure herbally sweet amanda said is that the theme from deliverance i hear wafting through the piney woods both detectives checked their weapons and headed for the cabin barnes whispered you hear anything save yourself and the younguns and take the wagon back to laramie amanda said lets get this damn thing over with you bet said barnes figuring he sounded pretty mellow the gun in his hand was so cold that he wondered about frostbite halfway to the cabins front door the detectives agreed that barnes would do the talking and amanda would be on the watch for any weird behavior on parker seldeys part a second after theyd reached that accord two booms exploded into the night and the sweet air turned sulfurous barnes hit the ground and reached out to push amanda out of the firing line she did the same for him and their fingers touched momentarily then both of them stretched on their bellies and twohanded their guns a hoarse voice screamed get the hell off my property barnes screamed back police we just want to talk to you mr seldey i dont want to talk to you a flash from the doorway was followed by another concussive burst something whizzed by barness right ear sighting a stand of small oaks he crept and slithered for cover while motioning for amanda to do the same not knowing if she could see him hearing her itoldyouso minus the usual goodnatured inflection she did have someone to go home tohe made it to the trees amanda had gotten there first both of them holding their breath as parker seldey stepped into the porch light rifle in one hand flashlight in the other seldey swept the earth with the electric torch amanda whispered dont move pard without warning she crouched straightened a bit kept her body low and ran toward the car seldey shouted something incoherent and aimed the rifle at her back barnes fired first seldey pivoted toward the source shot three times missed barnes by inches barnes scooted back struggling for silence seldey advanced on him sweeping with the flashlight muttering breathing hard when he was twenty feet away barnes began to make out details limned by sparse moonlight baggy tshirt shorts bony knees a thatch of hair the woolly outlines of an untrimmed beard seldey got closer barnes smelled him the hormonal reek of fury and fear seldey swept the ground the beam mustve caught a glimpse of something because seldey hoisted the rifle and aimed noise to his back made him pivot a car engine racing seldey aimed at that was knocked backward by white light amanda flashing the high beams blinding seldey the startled man fired into the sky barnes was on him wresting the gun away pounding seldeys face no resistance from seldey and barnes rolled him over put his knee on seldeys back was ready to cuff him but amanda did it first everyone panting they rolled seldey over and had a look at him mountainman hair almost obscured patrician features sharp brown eyes maybe not sharp inflamed seldey said whyre you here theres no full moon they only come with the full moon whos they said amanda squeezing the words out between gasps my friends the forest people seldey laughed just kidding do you guys have any weed rattling the cuffs and maybe you should take this shit off if you do i can put you out of your misery within an hour dozens of enforcement officials had collected outside the cabin parker seldey was taken away and the structure was taped off by the earlymorning hours an arsenal had been removed including three shotguns seldey was living like a savage in the insectinfested cabin with no outdoor plumbing and food rotting in tins no phone or computer but seldey had brought a ham radio and a batteryop vcr a cs unit from sacramento scoured his meager belongings don newell showed up at three am but didnt do much other than stand around barnes and amanda borrowed a sheriffs phone that worked and told the story to captain torres being woken up didnt endear them to the boss and torres wasnt mollified by amandas assurance that theyd had consent from the legal owner to enter the property blood spatter on parker seldeys jeans and shirt calmed him down a bit but im reserving judgment until you get real evidence that happened two days later a rush dna matched the blood to davida and word had it seldeys attorney would be going for a plea some sort of mental health explanation barnes gave laura novacente the exclusive in return she invited him to her place for an intimate dinner being a gentleman barnes let her down easy laura showed class call if it doesnt work out will of course i will the citizens of berkeley were pleased with the arrest of parker seldey for the murder of davida grayson seldey being a registered republican turned satisfaction to glee and someone talked about silkscreening a tshirt capitalizing on that fact final message yet to be decided everyone settling down except amanda isis early friday morning found barnes and amanda at their favorite corner table at melanies he was on his second double espresso and his third muffin she sipped foam off of her cappuccino and picked at her croissant barnes was in a great mood looking forward to a second weekend with marge dunn hed volunteered to fly to la but marge asked if she could come back up north smart woman nothing was as beautiful as the bay area on a crisp cool day barnes figured to ask amanda for more social advice because the weekend in napa had turned out perfect hed arrived with several ideas to run by her but she was quiet almost sullen whats wrong barnes asked nothing dont give me that you didnt like the wine i sent you or something you didnt have to send me wine will i was just doing my job your job was saving my life the guy at the liquor store told me it was good stuff it was and i thank you so whats bugging you mandy and be honest im not good at this shrink stuff speaking of shrinks i just talked to the psychiatrist whos taking care of seldey she said she says the guys clearly psychotic i dont need a shrink to tell me that hes actively paranoid will as in unable to form a coherent plan of action yesterday he had to be straitjacketed because he scratched himself raw he claimed that voices were telling him to repent by skinning himself like they did to jesus in that mel gibson movie so hes faking it trying for reduced culpability hes not trying to get out of anything just the opposite he keeps ranting about shooting davida saying hes proud of it all thats the das problem maybe its our problem will as in getting the entire picture you see a guy that disordered planning a careful murder all by his lonesome he says voices told him to kill davida what im wondering is was one of them real someone coached him davida may have welcomed the homeless but given all jane told davida about parker you see davida letting him in at two am his having a key would change the equation what if someone pointed him in the right direction and said go boom someone who knew him realized he was crazy someone who had power over him and might have a key and knew she was drinking because she drank with her jane who else amanda said why would parker obey her they hated each other thats according to jane what do you remember about him not much he wasnt a local i think he grew up in hillsborough or some other highpriced spread maybe went to stanford will ive been asking around discreetly no one from the good old days knows him and he didnt grow up in nocal hes from massachusetts so my point is that everything we know about him has been filtered through jane jane told us she expected parker to pay off the cabin but if he was that compromised mentally how could that happen maybe she let him stay because he was useful to her she kept him on the side because she knew she was going to use him to murder davida if parker was crazy why would jane rely upon him hell why would she marry him in the first place maybe his pathology was under control medicated officially or otherwise maybe being married to jane helped him maintain when she petitioned for divorce and the paperwork says she initiated he broke down as to how shed rely on him she knew him well enough understood which buttons to push sounds like a movie said barnes youre stretching why it just doesnt sit right with me the guys too crazy to do it all by his lonesome whats janes motive davida was going to dump her and it pissed her off or davida was about to out her and she couldnt handle it you saw how squeamish she was when we talked to her at lucilles what better way to get rid of davida than to sic poor psychotic parker on her telling parker that it was all davidas fault that they broke up in the first place davida dies parkers locked up talk about killing two birds inventive said barnes you thinking of quitting and writing screenplays granted i cant prove any of it and maybe itll turn out to be fantasy you want me to check it out alone or with you thats my choice you bet pard barnes pinged a spoon against his demitasse if parkers that disturbed maybe hes got some prior hospitalizations that will tell us more about how his head works why dont you check that out and youll talk to jane i was thinking id look into jane and parkers financials see if she was supporting him and for how long you want us to do everything together fine no more cowboy amanda laughed no i was just asking lets divide it up you can even wear that string tie it took the detectives several days to get a reluctant goahead from captain torres with the evidence presented and corroborated the boss had no choice but he told them to be tactful whatever that meant giving the order to both of them but looking straight at barnes amanda had covered him claiming the hotdog to seldeys cabin was a joint decision but torres was no fool he kept his mouth shut and said yes sir saluted behind torress back as the captain hurried off to a meeting the womans association was doing a brisk lunch trade tables of genteel ladies exercising their jaw muscles on gossip and the tritip special barnes felt stiff in a jacket and tie but amanda glided through the dining room in a navy suit with matching pumps the table they were looking for was in the corner six septuagenarian females chattering and wielding silverware with finishingschool precision five of them focusing their attention on a blackhaired dowager in a black knit suit and pearl earrings a thin old woman bordering on emaciation with shoepolish hair drawn back in a bun her blue eyes flashed with excitement as she spoke eunice meyerhoff enjoyed holding court when barnes and amanda reached her table she looked up blinked smiled good afternoon detectives what are you doing here barnes said hi ladies hows everything the women clucked pleasantries in unison eunice said were just about done with our meal would you like to join us for dessert amanda said actually mrs meyerhoff we need to speak to you in private just for a second eunices companions stared at her she bristled beamed why of course barnes took her by the elbow as they crossed the dining room eunice waved to other diners when they got past the tables her jaw tightened around her smile what is this about detective barnes we need your help said amanda and how long will it take today is boston cream pie which i adore the kitchen generally runs out if one hesitates too long maybe the ladies should order dessert without you barnes told her eunice stiffened in his grasp skinny but tough like an old wild turkey annealed by challenge out in the lobby eunice said where shall we chat amanda said lets use your room nice and private i dont well if you insist a frail smile i suppose she patted barness arm so muscular william you were always a good worker the elevator ride was silent eunice fished out her key and opened the door to a surprisingly shabby little room papered in a lilac print the carpet was worn the drapery was gray and dusty and the place emitted a nursinghome smell leadedglass windows let in some natural light but the day was overcast nearly all the space was taken up by a queen bed a simple wood chair a chipped nightstand that held a clock radio and an old bakelite dial phone and a folding suitcase rack ancient vuitton valise on the rack eunice sat down on the chair slumping as if making the most of her advanced age but there was something sharp and distrusting in those eyes barnes said i have a few questions for you mrs meyerhoff it has to do with some of your bank transactions those sharp eyes narrowed well i dont think my finances are any of your business im sorry for the intrusion but we had to obtain certain facts what facts her tone had hardened generally your spending is quite light amanda said thats why we were surprised by two recent withdrawals that were substantial two cashiers checks barnes added ten thousand dollars each over the last fortyfive days so said eunice last time i checked the federal government was still allowing me to spend my own money we know who cashed them said amanda the old woman grew silent one rednailed hand scratched the other parker seldey barnes said thats quite a lot of money to give an exsoninlaw we dont like him much amanda said he tried to shoot us were curious why you like him you were trespassing eunice blurted no maam barnes said jane gave us permission to enter the premises and jane owns the premises parker didnt know that a pause barnes said thats our point you seem quite fond of parker eunices mouth screwed up whatever issues jane has with him hes always been a gentleman with me whats wrong with that nothings wrong with it barnes said though im sure its hurtful to your daughter eunice grunted as if she cares whats hurtful and whats not shes been hurtful to you amanda asked i cant remember a time she hasnt been hurtful always taking up with bums or drug addicts using drugs herself the stories i could tell you do you think thats a daughter who cares about her mothers feelings id say no amanda said darn right no still said barnes your being so close to parker isnt exactly sitting right with lucille grayson am i supposed to care about that witch eunices eyes spat fury always bragging bragging bragging about her perverted daughter i think ive had quite enough of lucille grayson yes i have i dont give a hoot about her or her lesbian daughter and i dont give two hoots what she thinks about me is that why youre paying for parker seldeys defense barnes said risking a guess when eunice didnt answer he thought yes sherlock lives amanda read his mind ran with it your hiring parkers lawyer really puzzles lucille grayson the old woman folded her arms across her chest i told you i dont care about that biddy your personal relationship with lucille is none of our business amanda said darn right eunice said however said barnes davida graysons murder is our business parker confessed to killing her so we know who actually pulled the trigger we also know someone paid him to do it those cashiers checks of yours mrs meyerhoff we know exactly what they were for because parker told us and it looks pretty incriminating the first one was issued awhile before davida was murdered but the second was issued and cashed the day after her death payment for a job well done said barnes eunice chewed her lip scarlet lipstick smudged the meager flesh amanda said what did you tell him mrs meyerhoff that davida was responsible for jane leaving him she was responsible eunice snapped if it hadnt been for that pervert janey wouldnt be doing sick things what kind of sick things barnes asked im a lady eunice retorted i dont talk about things like that so you do blame davida for janes behavior you bet your backside i blame davida shes always been responsible for janey straying back to grade school it wasnt davida whos been married three times barnes pointed out of course not why would she marry she was a pervert and lucille defending her all the time enjoying it if you ask me shes that way too eunice punched a palm with her fist not much sound small bones she said after that biddy told me what janey and her daughter were doing i had to do something no decent mother would do any less so you talked to parker about it amanda said he was just as frustrated with janey as i was i see barnes said you know mrs meyerhoff i think at this point we need to inform you of your rights my rights she stared at him is it your intention to arrest me oh yes barnes stated the miranda rights and asked her if she understood them of course i understand them im old but im not senile you dont have to talk to us barnes said but if you want to tell us your side of the story nows the time we might be able to help you if we knew your side amanda said but like detective barnes said you dont have to talk to us i know that eunice squeaked i have nothing to hide im proud of what i did i defended my daughter i prevented her from further debasing herself with that pervert why dont you start at the beginning amanda said barnes said the more we know the more we can help you theres nothing to tell eunice said i told parker what needed to be done and he agreed i told him id give him money to pay off janey for his cabin but i dont think he even cared about that he was as furious at davida as i was i knew that davida was a horrid alcoholic god only knows how much she and janey used to pack away in high school i also knew that janey had a key to her office i took it one day and i made a copy i told parker to wait until the time was right meaning when that pervert got herself so damn drunk shed fall asleep how would you know that amanda asked because i had parker install a hidden video camera barnes felt himself go hot csi had torn through the office a lunatic plants a bug and no one finds it whered he install it exactly where i instructed him to in the light fixture above her desk eunice said you know you can get tiny tiny cameras no bigger than a nail head i learned that from a movie and found the equipment online she giggled of my friends im the only one online one must change with the times amanda said so you knew when davida was asleep because of the secret video camera where was the monitor i used to carry it with me teeny little thing sometimes the reception was fuzzy but as long as i was here in the city it worked fine i dont have it anymore i have no use for it now that the pervert is gone so what happened when you found davida asleep i think thats obvious eunice said tell us anyway better in your words than someone elses a sigh i happened to be in town as davida supped with lucille i knew davida drank alone at night figured dinner with that biddy mother of hers would drive her to drink that night i contacted parker through his shortwave radio it took about two hours for him to get down here and by that time davida had passed out who had the key i did i sneaked out of the clubthose old guardsnot worth a plugged nickel i met him outside and we drove to the office eunice smiled i kept guard while he did what he needed to do a liverspotted hand flew to one ear i heard the blast it sounded pretty darn loud to me but no one seemed to notice parker emerged he wore a long coat that concealed the gun and looked just like one of those homeless bums you people coddle he escorted me back to the club the guard was sleeping she chuckled not that it mattered whod want to break in and harm a few old ladies eunice stood and offered fragile wrists if you get pleasure arresting an old lady indulge yourselves i have heart problems and recurrent breast cancer i am proud that i helped rid the world of that witch that is my legacy to my daughter go ahead detective cuff me barnes complied more symbolic than precautionary the bracelets were too big for her as they left the room he took her elbow again ah a gentleman ive always appreciated a courtly man she smiled at barnes but he didnt smile back she let go with a big sigh well if youre going to be that way about it i suppose i should call my lawyer she turned to amanda my cell phones in my purse his name is leo matteras and hes in the directory could you dial it for me honey even if my hands werent tied up id have some problems old alluring eyes just arent what they used to be barnes and amanda found jane sitting in a teak chair on the rear deck of her rented house on oxford street the place was a smallish english cottage beautifully designed and festooned with iceberg roses high spot on the street the berkeley hills were verdant the view across the bay pictureperfect jane hadnt bothered to notify the da shed moved nor had she told them she was planning to travel to europe that nugget had come to barnes by way of an old sacramento classmate a woman named lydia mantucci whod never liked jane and had forwarded the gossip with glee no one answered his knock on the stout handcarved door but a walkway on the far side of the house led to a flight of wooden steps that they climbed it was late afternoon and cold wind blew across the water jane had dressed for a warmweather fantasy black shortsleeved polo shirt khaki shorts oversized sunglasses her skin was prickled by goose bumps and she hugged herself intentional suffering amanda wondered jane had lost weight and with no makeup and her hair drawn into a high ponytail she looked plain and worn she wasnt surprised to see them you detected me she said drink indicating a halfempty bottle of sapphire gin and an ice bucket no thanks said will nice view when i pay attention it is i got the place cheap because the previous tenant was denied tenure and left in a snit without giving notice or paying two months rent angry professor jane smiled angry assistant professor of ethics amanda said when are you leaving for italy jane removed her sunglasses the sclera of her eyes were pink smudgy pouches had formed under the lower lids and her eyebrows drooped youre worried ill leave in a snit the das office sent us said will they may need you to testify that you gave us permission to be on the property i already put that in writing for the da amanda said if the defense makes a big deal out of our right to search inperson testimony will be required jane turned away and stared at gray water and milkcolored sky plus theyre hoping ill testify against mother have they asked you to do that no but that was the clear subtext i even received a little lecture about there being no filial privilege under the law amanda said so when are you planning to leave and where exactly are you going jane said thats the linchpin of the defense you people trespassed barnes said probably not but weve got to be ready for anything probably not theres talk parker will be pleading diminished capacity and that your mothers lawyer will be delaying to the max jane faced them again matteras hes probably hoping shell die first so he can avoid having to earn his retainer fat chance shes healthy only the good die prematurely janes hands clenched like davida god i miss her she sniffled and poured gin and drank way too much and suppressed a belch dont worry ill be there if im needed in the meantime i have to try something new whats that said barnes being alone youre sure thatll be good as sure as ive ever been about anything look at me will pathetic she touched her chest let her hand trail down to her abdomen her legs were prickled and white long sleek legs legendary in high school maybe still her best feature but for the first time barnes noticed encroaching signs of age spider veins hints of varicosity patches of pucker and slack he said you look great jane i look like shit but thanks for lying even though you were never really good at itthink about it will have you ever seen me alone for any significant stretch of time barnes considered that jane laughed not a pleasant sound exactly its an addiction as much as any other what is needing people to hell with streisand fools like me are anything but lucky i dont know how i ended up this way but im sure as hell going to try to find out in europe said amanda florence to be specific said jane ive been there with each of my glorious spouses mother took me when i was twelve fourteen and sixteen i figured it would be a good place to start if i dont fall apart i can work my way up to some meaner places she laughed maybe ill tour beirut amanda said testing yourself its about time said jane ill probably flunk lord knows ive failed every other life lesson barnes said jane jane wagged a finger hush bad liar right now nothing is sure to churn my stomach more than reassurance amanda said good because this is a business call not psychotherapy using a voice so cold barnes had to fight not to stare janes face went white amanda stepped closer took the glass from her hand and set it down hard on the table if youre serious about growing up losing the selfpity is a good place to start bottom line you need to cooperate fully if you dont youll be subpoenaed as a material witness and well confiscate your passport we need all your flight information as well as your addresses overseas so start dictating she whipped out her pad jane said all i know so far is my flight number and my hotel in florence then well start with that you need to know that if the das not satisfied with what we bring back you wont be getting on any planes jane tried to lock eyes with her but amandas stone face made her turn away my but youre a tough one more like a busy one said amanda lets stop screwing around and get some facts down on paper twenty minutes later walking back to their car barnes said arent we the stern unrelenting authority figure amanda got behind the wheel as she fooled with her hair and started the engine he said im sure there was a reason amanda pulled away from the curb driving faster than usual she covered half a block and stopped keeping her eyes on the street no big riddle she said i felt sorry for her so i gave her what she needed musiccity breakdown acknowledgments for music city breakdown special thanks to chief ronal serpas commander andy garrett and sergeant pat postiglione of the metro nashville police department and to the inimitable george gruhn a beautifully carved mandolin in a velvetlined case was stashed in the bedroom closet of baker southerbys house the instrument a gibson f with just a little pick wear below the treble fhole was worth more than bakers house a little frame bungalow on indiana avenue in the west nashville neighborhood known as the nations the area was solid bluecollar with some rough edges lots of residents living paycheck to paycheck the house was the only one baker southerby had ever known but that didnt make it more than it was the gibson rare because it had been a commercial failure was now a serious sixfigure collectors item a fact bakers partner liked to obsess on one just sold at christies for a hundred and seventy lost boy you follow auctions i was curious when lamar van gundy got like that usually when the two of them were grabbing a quick meal baker kept chewing his burger and pretended that hed gone deaf mostly that worked but if lamar was in a mood and persisted bakers next retort was as automatic as voice mail and your point is im just saying its a gold mine pass the ketchup stretch stop hoarding it in the first place lamars huge hands stretched across the table here drown your grub in the stuff el bee one seventy what does it take to impress you im impressed whens the last time you played the damn thing something that pricey no sense risking damage what you got epilepsy gonna drop it you never know stretch lamar said you know and i know and everyone knows that they sound better when you play em you open up the soundboard a bit who knows you could push it to one eighty and your point is lamar tugged a moustache end someone didnt take his midol why do you hate the damn thing when its like the most important thing you own baker shrugged and smiled and tried not to think about a little boys voice cracking honkytonk smoke loose laughter curled on the backseat as the old van bumped over country roads the greasy way headlights could wash over rural asphalt lamar saw bakers smile as consistent with his partners quiet manner and sometimes that would be end of topic three years theyd been working together but the big man had no clue bakers show of teeth was forced for the most part lamar could read people real well but he had his blind spots times when lamar wouldnt let go his next comment was so predictable it could be from a script you own a treasure and your alarm system sucks im wellarmed stretch like someone couldnt break in when youre on the job deep sigh one seventy oh lord thats serious money who knows i own it other than you stretch dont give me ideas hell george gruhn could probably unload it for you in like five seconds is it dropping in value as we speak this time it was lamar who was hard of hearing i consigned my precision with george last year got twenty times what i paid for it bought a threeyearold hamer that sounds just as cool and i can take it to gigs without worrying about a scratch being tragic george has the contacts i had enough left over to buy sue flowers plus a necklace for our anniversary the rest we used to pay off a little of the condo look at you said baker a regular warren buffett having enough he rose to his feet before lamar had time to reply went to the mens room and washed his hands and face and checked the lie of his buttondown collar he ran a sandpaper tongue over the surface of his teeth returning to find all the food gone and lamar tapping a rhythm on the table he crooked a thumb at the door unless youre planning on eating the plate stretch lets go look at some blood the two of them were a muttandjeff murder squad detective team operating out of the spiffy brick metro police headquarters on james robertson parkway lamar was sixfive thirtytwo skinny as a shoestring potato with wispy brown hair and a walrus moustache like an oldtime gunslinger born in new haven but he learned southern ways quickly baker southerby was two years older compact and ruddy with skin that always looked razorburned bulky muscles with a tendency to go soft thin lips and a shaved head despite lamars tendency to digress hed never had a better partner nashville homicides had dropped to sixtythree last year most of them openandshuts worked by district detectives the routine killings tended to be gang shootings random domestics and dope dealers cruising into town on the i and getting into trouble the three twoman murder squad teams were called out on whodunits and the occasional highprofile case the last new murder southerby and van gundy had worked was a month ago the shooting of a foulmouthed substanceabusing music row promoter named darren chenoweth chenoweth had been found slumped in his mercedes behind the crappylooking warehouse that served as his sixteenth avenue office an unindicted coconspirator in the cashbox payola scandal his death was a headscratcher with serious financial overtones possibly a revenge hit but it closed four days later as just another domestic gone bad mrs chenoweth coming in with her lawyer and confessing a quick plea down to involuntary manslaughter because fifteen witnesses were willing to testify darren had been beating the crap out of her regularly since then baker and lamar had been working cold cases and closing a nice number of the green folders lamar was happily married to a vanderbilt med center pediatric nurse with whom hed just bought a fifthfloor twoplustwo condo in the veridian tower on church street stretch and sue used overtime to pay off the mortgage and they treasured their meager free time so baker living alone volunteered to take all the latenight and earlymorning calls do wakeup duty in a nice quiet voice hed been up watching old nfl reruns on espn classic when the phone rang at three twenty am on a cool april night not dispatch brian fondebernardi calling direct the squad sergeants voice was low and even the way it got when things were serious baker heard voices in the background and immediately thought complications whats up i disturb your beauty sleep baker nope wheres the body east bay said fondebernardi first below taylor in a vacant lot full of trash and other nasty stuff almost a river view but you asked the wrong question baker whos the body there you go jack jeffries baker didnt answer fondebernardi said as in jeffries bolt and ziff i got it mr even keel said the sergeant a brooklyn native he worked at a whole different pace had taken awhile to understand bakers slogo style central detectives buttoned down the scene me investigators down there now but that wont take long we got a single stab wound in the neck looks to be right in the carotid lots of blood all around so it happened here lieutenants on her way you dont want to miss the party call the midget and get the heck down here hi baker sue van gundy answered in her throaty alabama voice too fatigued to be sexy at this hour but that was the exception and though baker thought of her as a sister he wondered if maybe he shouldve agreed to date her cousin the teacher whod visited last summer from chicago lamar had shown him her picture a pretty brunette just like sue baker thinking cute then who am i to be picky then figuring it would never work why start now he said sorry to wake you sue jack jeffries got himself stabbed youre kidding nope jack jeffries she said wow baker lamar loves his music baker restrained himself from saying what he knew lamar loves everyones music maybe thats the problem he said millions of people agree with lamar jack jeffries unbelievable said sue lamars out like a light but ill nudge him oh look hes waking up by himself got that cute look honey its baker youve got to work hes comin round ill make some coffee for you too baker no thanks had some baker lied ill be by in a jif sue said hes so tired up doing our taxes ill make sure his socks match baker drove his department caprice to lamars highrise and waited on the dark street until lamars whoopingcrane form lurched out the front door a paper bag dangling from one gangly arm lamars walrus moustache flared to the periphery of his bony face his hair was flying and his eyes were halfshut baker wore the unofficial murder squad uniform crisp buttondown shirt pressed chinos shiny shoes and a holstered semiauto the shirt was oxford blue the shoes and the gunsack black his sore feet craved running shoes but he settled for crepesoled brown payless loafers to look professional his kmart preppy special shirt was broadcloth laundered spotless the collar starched up high the way his mother had done it when he was little and they all went to church lamar got in the car groaned pulled two bagels out of the bag handed one to baker got to work on the other filling his stash with crumbs baker sped to the scene and munched his mouth still fuzzy not tasting much maybe lamar was thinking about that when he swallowed hard and dropped the mostly uneaten bagel into the bag jack jeffries hes pure la right think he came here to record who knows or cares baker filled his partner in on the little he knew lamar said guys not married right i dont follow the celebrity world stretch my point said lamar is that if theres no wife involved maybe it wont dud out to a stupid domestic like chenoweth a fourday close bothers you we didnt close squat we took dictation you were happy at the time said baker it was my anniversary i owed sue a nice dinner but looking back he shook his head total dud like a solo that dies you prefer a sleepdestroying whodun said baker thinking i sound like a shrink lamar took a long time to answer i dont know what i like john wallace jack jeffries a natural irish tenor prone to baby fat and tantrums grew up in beverly hills the only child of two doctors alternately doted upon and ignored jackie as he was known back then attended a slew of prep schools each of whose rules he violated at every turn dropping out of high school one month short of graduation he bought a cheap guitar taught himself a few chords and began thumbing his way eastward living on handouts petty theft and whatever chump change landed in his guitar case as he offered renditions of classic folk songs in that high clear voice in at the age of twentythree usually drunk or high and twice treated for syphilis he settled in greenwich village and attempted to insinuate himself into the folk music scene sitting at the feet of pete seeger and phil ochs zimmerman baez the farinas was educational he had a better shot actually jamming with some of the younger lights crosby sebastian the heavy girl with the great pipes whod begun calling herself cass elliot john phillips whod do a favor for anyone everyone liked california boys voice but his temperament was edgy pugilistic his lifestyle an allyoucansmokesnortswallow buffet in having failed to snag a record deal and watching everyone else do so jeffries contemplated suicide decided instead to return to california where at least the weather was mellow settling in marin he hooked up with two struggling folkies named denny ziff and mark bolt whom hed seen playing for not much better than chump change in an oakland shakeys pizza in what subsequent armies of publicists termed a magical moment jeffries claimed to be munching on a doublecheese extralarge and admiring the duo while realizing something was missing rising to his feet he hopped on stage during a spirited a capella delivery of sloop john b and added high harmony the resulting melding of voices created a whole much greater than the sum of the parts and brought down the house word of mouth seared through the bay area like wildfire and the rest was music history the real story was that a speedshooting promoter named lanny sokolow had been trying to get ziff and bolt past the pizza circuit for two years when he happened across a chubby longhaired bearded dude crooning to a giggly bevy of porn actresses at a wesson oil party sponsored by the oleary brothers san franciscos favorite adult theater tycoons even if sokolow hadnt been racing on amphetamine that high clear voice wouldve tweaked his ear the fat guy sounded like an entire angels chorus hell if this wasnt exactly what his two borderlineintelligence baritones could use jack jeffriess response to sokolows greeting and attempted power shake was fuck you man im busy lanny sokolow smiled and bided his time stalking the fat kid finally getting him to sit down and listen to some demos of ziff and bolt caught at a weak moment jeffries agreed to take in the shakeys show now sokolow figured if three edgy temperaments could coexist one thing about the official version was true word of mouth was instantaneous and supercharged nudged along by a new electric thing called folkrock lanny sokolow got his trio amplified backup and a series of freelance drummers and booked them as opening acts at parrish hall and the other free venues on the haight soon the three as they called themselves were opening for midsized acts then major headliners actually bringing in serious money an oedipus records scout listened to them lead in for janis on a particularly good night and phoned la a week later lanny sokolow was out of the picture replaced by saul wineman who as head man at oedipus rechristened the group jeffries ziff and bolt the sequence of names determined by a coin toss four tosses really each of the three demanded a turn but none was happy until wineman stepped in the trios first three singles made top ten the fourth my lady lies sweetly hit number one with a bullet and so did the lp crystal morning every song on the album credited the trio as writers but the real work had been done by brill building hacks who sold out for a flat fee and a strict nondisclosure pact that exposé was among the almanac of allegations listed in lanny sokolows breachofcontract lawsuit a marathon feast for attorneys that dragged on for six years and ultimately settled out of court three weeks prior to sokolows death from kidney disease six subsequent albums were penned with some help from saul wineman four of the five went platinum my dark shadows dipped to gold and were still alive tanked in the group broke up due to creative differences saul wineman had moved on to movies and each of the trio had earned more than enough to live as a rich man residuals though tapering each year added cream to the coffee denny ziff burned through his fortune by backing a series of unfortunately written and directed independent films by he was living in taos and painting muddy landscapes in he was diagnosed with smallcell carcinoma of the lung that killed him in three months mark bolt moved to france bought vineyard land and turned out some decent bordeaux marrying and divorcing four times he sired twelve children converted to buddhism sold his vineyards and settled in belize jack jeffries chased women nearly lost his life in a helicopter flight over the alaskan tundra vowed never to fly again and bunked down in malibu overindulging in any corporeal pleasure at hand in he donated sperm to a pair of lesbian actresses who wanted a creative kid the match took and one of the actresses gave birth to a son jeffries was curious and asked to see the boy but after the first few visits where jeffries showed up toasted the mothers termed him unfit and filed a ceaseanddesist jack never fought for contact with his son now a highachieving high school senior living in rye new york rugrats had never been his thing and there was all that music yet to be made he slept till three kept a small staff that pilfered from him regularly drank and doped and stuffed his face with no eye toward moderation the residuals had trickled to a hundred g a year but passive income afforded him the house on the beach cars and motorcycles a boat docked in newport beach that he never used from time to time he sang on other peoples records gratis when he performed it was as a solo act at local benefits and venues that got smaller and smaller each year he put on more weight refused to cut his hair now white and frizzy even though every other mf had sold out to corporate amerika he hadnt been to nashville since that time but remembered it as a cool place but too far to drive so when the owner of the songbird café sent out a mass email requesting participants in a first amendment concert inveighing against federal snooping in public libraries he tossed it then he retrieved it read the list of those whod agreed to attend and felt crappy about having to say no hemmed in like maybe the cure was worse than the disease then he happened to bring his guitar for repair into the chick with the magic hands and started talking to her and she made a suggestion andwhy not even though he didnt have much hope give it a try maybe it was time to show some cojones two months later would you believe it it worked ready to fly good name for a song jack jeffries lying dead in a weedchoked garbageflecked lot a short walk from the cumberland river would be a noshow at the songbird concert cleared by the me lamar van gundy and baker southerby gloved up and went to take a look at the body the okay didnt come from an investigator an actual pathologist had shown up meaning high priority ditto for the appearance of lieutenant shirley jones sergeant brian fondebernardi and a host of media types kept at bay by a small army of uniformed cops the two local homicide detectives had signed off to the murder squad more than happy to be free of what was looking like the worst combo publicity and a mystery lieutenant jones handled the press with her usual charm promising facts as soon as they were in and urging the newshounds to clear the scene after some grumbling they complied jones offered words of encouragement to her detectives then left as the morgue drivers hovered in the background sergeant fondebernardi trim darkhaired economical of movement led the way to the corpse the killspot was a shadowed wicked place reeking of trash and dogshit not really a vacant lot just a sliver of clumped earth shaded by the remnants of an old cement wall that probably dated to the days when riverboats unloaded their wares jack jeffries lay on the ground just feet from the wall vacant eyes staring up at a charcoal sky dawn was an hour away cool night midfifties nashville weather could be anything anytime but in this range nothing would weirdly accelerate or slow down decomposition both detectives circled the scene before nearing the body each thinking dark as sin a body could walk right by it at night and never know fondebernardi sensed what was on their minds anonymous tip some guy slurring his words sounds like a homeless the bad guy said lamar anythings possible stretch but on the tape he sounded pretty shook up surprised youll listen when youre finished here lamar got closer to the body the man was obese he kept that to himself his partner said looks like he let himself go sergeant fondebernardi said were being judgmental tonight baker yeah aerobics wouldve made him prettier but it wasnt a coronary that got him flashing that sad brooklyn smile the sergeant leaned in with a flashlight highlighted the gash on the left side of the victims neck lamar studied the wound all that music that voice baker kneeled and got right next to the corpse his partner following suit jack jeffries wore a blousy longsleeved black silk shirt with a mandarin collar his pants were lightweight black sweats with a red satin stripe running the length of the leg black running shoes with red dragons embroidered on the toe gucci insignia on the soles size eee jeffriess belly swelled alarmingly a pseudopregnancy his left arm was bent upward palm out as if caught in the act of waving goodbye the right hung close to a spreading hip jeffriess long white hair was a droopy corona some of it floating above a high surprisingly smooth brow the rest tickling puffy cheeks muttonchops trailed three inches below fleshy ears a fuzzy moustache as luxuriant as lamars obscured the upper lip would have hidden both lips but for the fact that the mouth gaped in death missing teeth baker noted guy really let himself go he pulled out his own penlight and got eye to eye with the wound two or so inches wide the edges parting and revealing meat and gristle and tubing an upwardly sloping cut ragged at the top as if the knife had been yanked out hard and caught on something he pointed it out to lamar yeah i saw that maybe he struggled the blade jiggled baker said the way it climbs is making me think the thrust was upward could be the stabber was shorter than the vic he eyeballed the corpse id put him at six even so that doesnt clear much fondebernardi said his drivers license says six one close enough said baker people lie said lamar baker said lamars license says hes five nine and likes sushi flat laughter cut through the night when it subsided fondebernardi said youre right about lying jeffries claimed his weight to be one ninety add sixty seventy to that said baker all that heft even if he wasnt in shape hed be able to put up some resistance no defense wounds said fondebernardi check for yourself neither detective bothered the sergeant was as thorough as they came at least said lamar we dont have to waste time on an id baker said what else was in his pocket besides the license fondebernardi said just a wallet morgue guys have it in their van but its yours to go through before they book were talking basics credit cards all platinum nine hundred in cash a marquis jet card so maybe he flew in privately thats the case we might get a whole bunch of data those jet companies can book hotels drivers the whole itinerary no hotel key said lamar the sergeant shook his head maybe hes got friends in town said baker or he didnt bother with the key said lamar celebrity like that people carry stuff for you if he is in a hotel where else is it gonna be but the hermitage you got it said lamar ten to one hes got the alexander jackson suite or whatever they call their hotshot penthouse sounding like he yearned for all that thought baker dreams died hard better not to have any fondebernardi said anything else baker said the big question is what was he doing in this particular spot its industrial during the day empty at night pretty much away from the club scene restaurants dope dealers even the adult entertainment overlay doesnt reach here anymore one exception said the sergeant theres a dinky little club called the t house two blocks south on first looks like some kind of a hippie joint handpainted signs organic teas they advertise entertainment no ones ever heard of place opens at seven and closes at midnight why would jeffries be interested in that said lamar he probably wouldnt but its the only place anywhere near here you can check it out tomorrow baker said id be wondering if he found himself a hooker she brings him down here for a shakedown but nine hundred in the wallet he checked the body again no wristwatch or jewelry but no tan lines on either wrist said fondebernardi maybe he didnt wear a timepiece maybe time wasnt a big deal for him said lamar guys like that can have people telling time for them an entourage said baker wonder if he privatejetted in with some people it might be a good place to start those service places are open twentyfourseven anytime anywhere for the rich folk the sergeant left and the two of them walked around the site several times noting lots of blood on the weeds maybe some indentations that were footimpressions but nothing that could be cast at four fifty am they okayed the morgue drivers to transport and drove dark deserted downtown streets to the hermitage hotel on sixth and union on the way over baker had called the tollfree number on the jet card dealt with resistance from the marquis staff about relinquishing flier information but managed to ascertain that jack jeffries had flown into signature flight support at nashville international at eleven am they were not forthcoming about any of his fellow passengers the rich and famous demanded privacy except when they wanted publicity baker saw it all the time in nashville hotshot country stars hiding behind big glasses and oversized hats then when no one was noticing them they talked louder than anyone else in the restaurant lamar parked illegally at the curb right in front of the hermitage night door nashvilles only aaa five diamond award recipient was a gorgeous heap of italian marble stainedglass skylights insets of russian walnut carved exuberantly restored to opulence locked up after eleven the way any sensible downtown hostelry should be baker rang the night bell no one responded and he tried again it took three more tries for someone to come to the door and peek around the side windows young black guy in hotel livery when the detectives flashed id the young guy blinked took awhile to process before unlocking the door his badge said william yes lamar said is mr jack jeffries the rock star staying here william said were not allowed to give out guest baker said william if mr jeffries is staying here its time to switch to was no comprehension in the young mans eyes baker said william mr jeffries was found dead a couple of hours ago and were the guys in charge the eyes brightened a hand flew to williams mouth my god ill take that as a yes hes registered here yessir oh my god how did it what happened thats what were here to find out said lamar well need to see his room sure of course come in they followed as william sped across the monumental lobby with its fortyfoot coffered ceiling inlaid with stained glass arched columns brocade furniture and potted palms at this hour deadsilent and sad the way any hotel gets when stripped of humanity baker remembered more motels than he could count he thought to himself doesnt matter what the tariff is if it aint home its a big fat nowhere william nearly flew behind the walnut reception desk and set about playing with his computer mr jeffries is was in an eighthfloor suite ill make you a key was he staying alone said baker in the suite yes he was the kid wrung his hands this is horrible alone in the suite said lamar but he arrived with someone that persons staying on the fourth floor a lady no no a gentleman a doctor i guess his doctor mr jeffries was sick said baker william said i didnt see any symptoms or anything like that the other guest is a doctor i really couldnt tell you what its all about anyone else arrive besides this doctor no sir a doctor said lamar did he and mr jeffries seem to be hanging out i recall them leaving together at the end of my first shift i do doubles when i can paying for college vanderbilt william stared at him the absurdity of the suggestion tennessee state but i need to pay room and board good for you educations important said lamar what time we talking about mr jeffries and his doctor leaving i want to say eight thirty maybe nine how was mr jeffries dressed all in black said william a chinesetype shirt you know one of those collarless things same outfit theyd just seen baker said so he and this doctor went out at eight thirty or thereabouts did either of them return i couldnt say we were pretty busy and mostly i was checking a large party of guests in anything else you can tell us about this doctor he did the checking in for mr jeffries mr jeffries just kind of stood back over there pointing to a towering palm he smoked a cigarette and turned his back on the lobby like he didnt want to be noticed and let the doctor check him in yes sir when the two of them left what was their demeanor you mean were they in a good mood or any other kind of mood hmm said william i really couldnt say nothing stands out in my mind one way or the other like i said it was busy baker said but you noticed them leaving because hes a celebrity said william was i dont know much about his music but one of our bookkeepers is in her fifties and was really excited he was staying here any idea why mr jeffries was in nashville actually i do said william i believe theres a benefit concert at the songbird and he was going to sing the performance list according to the same bookkeeper is quite impressive deep sigh i know he brought his guitar with him bellboys were competing to carry it williams eyes rose to the glass coffers the doctor brought one too or maybe he was just carrying mr jeffriess spare a doctor roadie said baker whats this persons name more fooling with the computer alexander delaware another state of the union heard from said lamar cuffing bakers shoulder lightly maybe hes from the nations oh i dont think so william was humorless he lists his address in los angeles i can give you the zip code and his credit card information if you like maybe later said baker right now give us his room number room was a short walk from the elevators down a silent plush hallway the corridor was empty save for a few roomservice trays left outside doors nothing outside dr alexander delawares door baker knocked lightly both detectives were surprised when a voice answered right away one second lamar checked his watch it was close to six in the morning guys up at this hour baker said maybe hes waiting for us so he can confess stretch wouldnt that be nice and easy muffled footsteps sounded behind the door then a blur washed across the peephole yes said the voice baker said police and placed his badge a few inches from the hole hold on a chain dropped the doorknob rotated both detectives touched their weapons and stood clear of the door the man who opened was forty or so goodlooking medium height solidly built with neatly cut dark curly hair and a pair of the lightest grayblue eyes lamar had ever seen wide eyes so pale the irises were nearly invisible when they engaged you straight on in the right light that orphan annie thing they were slightly redrimmed boozing crying allergies brought on by nashville s high pollen count no sleep pick a reason dr delaware yes lamar and baker stated their names and delaware offered his hand warm firm shake each detective checked for fresh cuts any evidence of a struggle nothing delaware said whats going on soft voice lowkey kind of boyish is jack okay he had a square jaw a cleft chin a roman nose dressed for lounging around in a black tshirt gray sweats bare feet as lamar peered past the guy into the room baker had a second look at the hands smooth slightly oversized with a faint spray of dark hair across the top the nails of the left hand had been clipped short but those on the right grew just past the fingertips and were tapered to the right possibly a classical guitarist or some other type of fingerpicker so maybe the second guitar was his no one had answered delaware s question the guy just stood there and waited baker said any reason mr jeffries wouldnt be okay its six in the morning and youre here youre up said baker trouble sleeping said delaware jet lag whend you get in sir jack and i got in at eleven yesterday morning and i made the mistake of taking a threehour nap may we come in sir delaware stepped aside frowning as he ushered them in smallish standard room nothing fancy about it a neatfreak lamar decided no clothes in sight every drawer and closet door shut the only way youd know the room was occupied was the guitar case near the bed pillows propped up against the headboard and the comforter slightly mussed indented where a body had reclined on the nightstand was an oldfashioned glass in which two ice cubes melted a minibarsized bottle of chivas in the wastebasket there was also a largeformat magazine american lutherie another music wannabe lamar waited for bakers reaction baker was impassive lamar had a closer look at the minibottle empty doctor mellowing out from insomnia with a drink and a read or calming himself down he and baker pulled up chairs and dr alexander delaware perched on the bed they gave him the bad news straight out and he placed a palm to his cheek my god thats horrible im his voice trailed off baker said how about filling us in about what for starters how about why mr jeffries travels with a doctor a deep sigh this isyouve got to give me a few minutes delaware went to the minibar and took out a can of orange juice he drank it quickly im a psychologist not a medical doctor after a helicopter mishap several years ago jack developed a phobia of flying i was treating him for it nashville was his first actual flight after the near crash and he asked me to accompany him leave all your other patients and go with him said baker im semiretired said delaware semiretired baker said that would mean you work sometimes mostly police work for lapd ive been consulting on and off for several years profiling said lamar and other things delaware smiled enigmatically once in a while im useful how did jack die thats your whole practice said baker consulting for lapd i also do court consults baker said you dont see patients but you were treating jack jeffries i dont see many longterm patients jack came to me through my girlfriend shes a luthier has worked on jacks instruments for years awhile back he mentioned to her that hed been invited to sing at the songbird café for the first amendment gathering and was frustrated that his anxiety prevented him from going he was open to treatment and my girlfriend asked me if i would see him i was between projects so i agreed lamar uncrossed and crossed his legs what do you do for that kinda thing there are lots of approaches i used a combination of hypnosis deep muscle relaxation and imagery teaching jack to retrain his thoughts and emotional responses to flying that include drugs said baker delaware shook his head jack had engaged in decades of selfmedication my approach was to see how far we could get without medication get him a backup prescription for valium if he needed it during the flight he didnt he was really doing well he ran a hand through his curls tugged and let go i cant believe this isgrotesque a solemn headshake then he strode to the minibar and retrieved another can of orange juice this time he spiked it with a bottle of tanqueray time for me to selfmedicate i know enough not to offer you any booze but how about soft drinks both detectives declined baker said so you were his hypnotist i used hypnosis along with other techniques jack invested serious money in a jet card as a way of encouraging himself to keep practicing if the flights to and from nashville went smoothly the plan was for him to try another trip alone the success hed achieved so far mastering his fear was good for him he told me he hadnt accomplished much for years so it felt especially good sounds like he was depressed said lamar not clinically said delaware but yes hed reached an age was looking inward he drank what else can i help you with how about an accounting of his and your movements from the time you arrived in nashville said baker again the pretty boy raked his curls and threw them a look with those pale pale eyes lets seewe got in around eleven in the morning we flew privately which was a first for me a limo was waiting for us i believe the company was csl we got to the hotel around noon i checked in for jack because he wanted to smoke a cigarette and was concerned about being conspicuous conspicuous how the whole celebrity thing said delaware being mobbed in the lobby did that happen a few people seemed to recognize him but it never got beyond looks and whispers anyone scarylooking said lamar not to my eye but i wasnt looking for suspicious characters i was his doctor not his bodyguard all i remember were tourists how about the few people who recognized him middleaged tourists delaware shrugged its been a long time since he was a household name that bother him who knows when he told me he didnt want to be noticed my first thought was he really did and wanted to reassure himself he was still famous i think attending the concert was all part of thatthe desire to get out there and be someone but not because of anything he said this was just my perception you checked in what next said baker i walked jack up to his suite and he said hed call me if he needed anything i went down to my room intending to take a twentyminute catnap usually i wake up right on the dot this time i didnt and when i did get up i felt logy i went to the hotel gym worked out for an hour took a swim a strong exhalation lets see i showered i made a couple of calls did a little reading played a little indicating the guitar case and the magazine whod you call baker asked my service my girlfriend the luthier baker said whats her name robin castagna lamar furrowed his eyebrows she got a writeup in acoustic guitar last year right when delaware looked surprised he said youre in nashville doctor its the towns business he pointed to the guitar case that one of hers it is the psychologist unlatched the guitar case and took out a pretty little abalonetrimmed flattop like a size martin but no decal on the headstock and the fretboard inlays were different delaware fingerpicked a few arpeggios then ran some diminished chords down the board before frowning and returning the instrument to the case nothing sounds too good this morning he said nimble baker thought the guy could play lamar said you planning on doing some performance while youre here hardly delaware s smile was wan jack had his psychologist the guitar is my therapy baker said so you picked a little read a littlethen what lets seemustve been six thirty seven by then i was hungry the concierge recommended the capitol grille right here in the hotel but after i looked at it i decided i didnt want to dine alone in a place that fancy then jack called and said he wanted to go out and score some grub could use company howd he sound moodwise rested relaxed said delaware he told me the songs had been going well no trouble remembering lyrics which had been one of his main concerns he made a lot of jokes about old age and hard living causing brain damage he also told me that he was thinking of writing a new song for the benefit something called the censorship rag but now he was hungry for ribs specifically we ended up at a place on broadway jacks he picked it out of the restaurant guide thought it was funny the name some kind of karma howd you get there we took a cab over its walking distance said baker we didnt know that at the time when did you get there said baker maybe a little before nine anyone recognize him at jacks delaware shook his head we had a nice quiet meal jack ate lots of pork shoulder was he bothered by not being recognized more he laughed about it said one day hed just be a footnote in a book if he was lucky to live that long delaware winced baker said so what he had a premonition not about being murdered lifestyle issues jack knew he was obese had high blood pressure bad cholesterol on top of all the hard living bad cholesterol but he ate pork shoulder delaware s smile was sad lamar said who paid for dinner jack did credit card yes baker said what time did you leave the restaurant id say ten thirty at the latest at that point we split up jack said he wanted to explore the city and it was clear he wanted to be alone baker said why his words were i need some quiet time doc maybe he was on a creative jag and needed solitude any idea where he went none he waited until i caught my cab on fifth then started walking on broadwaylet me get my bearings he headed east baker said east on broadway is the center of downtown and its anything but quiet maybe he went to a club said delaware or a bar or maybe he was meeting up with some friends he came here to perform with people in the business maybe he wanted to meet up with them without having his therapist around any idea who those friends might be no im just postulating same as you east on broadway said baker did you hear from him after that doctor delaware shook his head what time was he killed we dont know yet any idea whod want to do him harm none whatsoever said delaware jack was moody i can tell you that much but even though id treated him it wasnt indepth psychotherapy so i dont have any window into his psyche but throughout the dinner i felt he was keeping a lot to himself what makes you say that intuition the only thing i can tell you that might be useful is that his mood changed toward the end of dinner hed been talkative for most of the meal mostly reminiscing about the good old days then suddenly he got quiet really buttoned up stopped making eye contact i asked if he felt okay he said he was fine and waved off any more questions but something was on his mind but you have no idea what said baker with someone like jack couldve been anything someone like jack my experience has been that creative and moody go together jack had a reputation for being difficult impatient sharptongued unable to maintain relationships i dont doubt any of thats true but with me he was pretty pleasant though at times i felt he was working really hard to be amiable he needed you to get on and off that plane said baker that was probably it said delaware ribs at jacks said lamar any liquid refreshment jack had a beer i had a coke only one beer only one pretty good selfcontrol since ive known him hes been temperate lamar said this was a guy who skydived on acid and raced motorcycles while driving blind ill amend the statement around me hes been temperate he once told me he was slowing down like an old freight train he rarely divulged his private life to me even after we built up a rapport how long did that take rapport couple of weeks no treatments effective unless theres trust im sure you guys know that what do you mean doctor interrogating witnesses is more about developing a relationship than strongarming baker rubbed his shaved head you counsel the la police on technique my friend over there lieutenant sturgis does pretty well by himself sturgis with an is or an es with an i like the motorcycle meet youre also a biker i rode a bit when i was younger said delaware nothing bigbore slowed down yourself delaware smiled dont we all they stayed with the shrink for another twenty minutes going over the same ground asking the same questions in different ways in order to tease out discrepancies delaware answered consistently with no sense of evasiveness that wasnt enough for baker to give him a pass seeing as he was the last person so far to see jack jeffries alive and most murders boiled down to someone the vic knew the guy being a doctor didnt mean much either then there was the hypnotist deal which no matter what delaware claimed was a form of mindbending on the other side there were no visible cuts on the guy his demeanor was appropriate his movements could be traced easily until ten thirty he had no obvious motive and hadnt bothered to set up an alibi for the time of the murder do you know if jack was married baker asked him he wasnt any special person in his life no one he told me about anyone we should contact in la about his death i suppose you could start by calling up his agentor maybe its his exagent i seem to recall something about jack firing him several years ago im sorry but if he told me a name i dont remember it baker wrote down agent on his notepad so no one keeping the home fires burning no one that i know about lamar said what are your plans now doctor i guess theres no reason for me to stick around wed appreciate it if you did you were planning to be here till after the concert baker said so how about at least for a day or so those pale eyes aimed at them small nod sure but let me know when its okay to leave they thanked him and went up to the eighth floor after roping the door with yellow crime scene tape they gloved turned on the light and proceeded to paw through jack jeffriess magnificentview suite during the ten hours jeffries had lived there hed managed to turn it into a sty clothes were strewn everywhere empty soda cans wrinkled bags of chips nuts and pork rind whose contents littered the floor no booze empties doobies or pills so maybe jeffries had told the shrink the truth about slowing down in a corner next to a couch jeffriess guitar a shiny jumbo gibson with a rhinestonestudded cowboy pickguard leaned against the wall in a precarious position lamar was about to move it but checked himself finish up and take polaroids first on jeffriess nightstand was the room key they hadnt found in his pocket so much for that lead also a snapshot curling at the edges the subject was a kid a big beefy young man eighteen or so with cropped fair hair he wore some kind of athletic uniform not football no pads a winecolored shirt with a white collar across the chest westchester in gold letters smiling like a hero lamar said looks just like jack at least what jack used to look like right this is maybe the kid he had with melinda raven and that other actress whatshername baker lifted the picture with a gloved hand on the back genteel handwriting feminine in deep red ink dear j this is owen after his last big game thanks for the anonymous donation to the school and for giving him space love m m for melinda said lamar baker said what kind of uniform is this rugby el bee isnt that british they play it at the prep schools baker regarded his partner you sure know a lot about it one of my many schools played it but not all that well said lamar flint hill i lasted six whole months there if it hadnt been for varsity basketball i would have been booted in two once i discovered guitars and stopped playing sports for the wellheeled alumni no one had a lick of use for me baker opened a drawer looky here holding up a sheet of lined paper with crenellated edges that said it had been torn from a spiral notebook verses in black pen filled the sheet blockprinted lettering but with flourishes on the capitals thought my songs would carry me far thought id float on my guitar but the man says youre no good for us might as well catch that greyhound bus refrain music city breakdown its a music city breakdown just a music city shakedown a real music city takedown thought they cared about mournful hank thought id come and break the bank then they made me walk the plank now im here all dark and dank refrain so much for creative output baker said this is pretty juvenile the tall man took the sheet scanned maybe its a first draft baker didnt answer lamar said guess the guy didnt figure on getting his throat cut and us archaeologizing all over his shit slapping the paper down on the nightstand we should take it said baker so take it someones cranky hey said lamar im just feeling for the guy he beats his fear manages to fly over here on his own dime just to do some good and ends up like we just saw him thats a rotten deal any way you shake it el bee im not denying that baker placed the sheet in an evidence bag the two of them continued to toss the suite going over every square inch and finding nothing interesting except a note on a message pad that seemed to bear out delaware s story bbq jacks bway bet call ad or solo the note was in a completely different handwriting from the song lyrics the directions have to be jacks handwriting baker said so whered the lyrics come from maybe he had a visitor lamar said you know some wannabe using a ruse like room service then dropping his bad poetry on him so why didnt jack throw it away lamar said maybe the guy was dry and he was searching for inspiration baker stared at him he musta been desperate to steal from the likes of this well he hadnt had a hit in a long time thats thin stretch agreed el bee but its all i can think of lets see if we cant get prints off it anyway run an afis baker jiggled the bag what we need to do is bring in the csers and have em print the whole damn pigsty ill take the pictures and then we can book lamar stood back as baker walked around snapping polaroids both of them careful not to disturb easily printable surfaces baker said you wanna call melinda raven tomorrow morning find out if owen is her kid and ask what his relationship was with his daddy i can do that alternatively we can go to the library and read old people magazines why play our ace card baker nodded and continued to snap polaroids when he was done he stowed his camera and headed for the door lamar still gloved hesitated then placed jeffriess guitar on the bed before he closed the door baker dropped lamar off at his condo at nine am theyd made a short stopover at the lab to run an afis fingerprint check on the note the system was down try again later im going to catch a couple hours of shuteye said lamar okay with you better than okay baker drove off sue van gundy was up at the dinette table eating her special k with sliced banana decaf on the side planning as was her habit to leave in twenty for the beginning of her eleventoseven shift she lit up when she saw her husband got up wrapped her arms around his waist rested her cheek on his flat hard chest that he said feels nice howd it go on jeffries honey lamar kissed her hair they both sat down and he pilfered her decaf it went nowhere babe were starting from nothing and bakers in one of those snits because its musicrelated statement not a question three years weve been working together and he still wont tell me why he hates anything to do with tone and rhythm lamar said sue im sure its something to do with his folks just like that nickname you gave him he really was a lost little boy growing up on the road it couldnt have been anything like a normal childhood then they up and die on him lamar and hes all alone i know he said thinking but theres got to be more one time right after he and baker had started as a team and hed learned of his partners quirk hed done some sniffing around found out bakers parents had been a pair of singers danny and dixie traveling the back roads doing honkytonk county fairs roadhouse onenighters danny on guitar dixie on the mandolin the mandolin a long way from stars nothing on google lamar dug some more found the obit in an old newspaper file sue was insightful but still there had to be more to it than longtime grief she said let me make you some eggs no thanks baby i just need to sleep then ill tuck you in baker went home stripped naked fell into bed was asleep before his face hit the sheet much of the afternoon was spent with the two of them sitting at the center table in the pale purple murder squad detectives room working the phone and sifting through the slew of tips that had poured in after jack jeffriess murder hit the news tv broadcast radio the final edition of the tennessean by evening it would be the national entertainment shows fondebernardi and lieutenant jones stopped in to see how everything was going both of them too experienced and smart to push because that would accomplish nothing other than make their detectives nervous but they were edgy all that media attention baker and lamar had a data flood on their hands from the blitz of phone tips sometimes too much information was worse than none at all like a room with fifty different fingerprint patterns every call they fielded was from a nut a psychic or just a wellmeaning citizen imagining or exaggerating two dozen people claiming to have seen jeffries in two dozen unfeasible places at impossible times a few informants were certain hed been accompanied by a dangerouslooking person half of those described a woman the other half a man details as to height weight clothing and demeanor were cloudy to the point of uselessness but everyone agreed on one thing a dangerouslooking black person and that included black informants the detectives had seen that before called it the color kneejerk but given a caller who sounded africanamerican it couldnt be dismissed then the caller showed up at headquarters a former merchant marine now homeless named horace watson who lived in an eastside shelter and liked to take long walks by the river the man was seventythree wizened and toothless he was also as white as al gore his southern louisiana accent misconstrued as black patois lamar and baker took him into a room and started in on developing a relationship by giving him a danish and coffee watson was already tipsy but outgoing a nice drunk and eager to help volunteering about how he always walked by that area that particular piece of land because sometimes you could find aluminum cans for the redemption center and one time hed found a watch too bad it didnt work this time hed found more than he was looking for freaking out when he saw the dead man hed hurried back to the shelter to tell someone found a pay phone along the way and made the call now he was wonderingahemabout maybe a reeward sorry sir said lamar no rewards for finding bodies only murderers oh said watson flashing a sunken grin caint blame a guy for trahn they questioned him awhile longer ran him through the system and got a hit with a few misdemeanors when baker suggested a polygraph watson loved the idea long as it dont hoit painless mr watson lets do it den always wanna try new tings lamar and baker traded looks stretch cleared his throat uh sorry sir no polygraphers on the premises well call you okaay said watson i got nuttin a do calls to jack jeffriess credit card company followup chats with a supervisor at marquis jet and the limo driver whod taken jeffries and delaware to the hotel and a brief sitdown with the staff at jacks barbque confirmed every detail of dr delaware s story no one at the restaurant had noticed where jeffries had gone baker and lamar spent the next two hours canvassing neighboring merchants east of the barbecue joint talking to passersby anyone who hung out regularly on the numbered streets between fifth and first nothing with little else to go on the two detectives started making phone calls splitting the list of the performers for the upcoming evening at the songbird café for the benefit and protection of the first amendment among the names were some of lamars idols stretch did his police duty with gusto baker made the calls with reticence bordering on hostility the sum total of twentytwo phone calls yielded the same results which were no results everyone was stunned by the news but no one had seen hide nor hair of jack jeffries some didnt even know he had been scheduled to perform checking jeffriess outgoing cell calls verified the stories if jack had attempted to reach former buddies hed done so on a landline that the detectives were unaware of a seven pm call to lieutenant milo sturgis in la verified dr alexander delawares longtime association with the department sturgis termed delaware as brilliant if you can use him the lieutenant said do it baker asked him if he knew delaware had been treating jack jeffries sturgis said no he never talks about his cases guys ethical sounds like you like him hes a friend said sturgis thats an effect of his being a good guy not a cause the afis report on the scrap of song lyrics from jack jeffriess room came back negative for any match with an individual in the system the crime scene people were still working at the scene and the results would start to trickle in tomorrow baker called the coroners office and spoke to dr inda srinivasan she said obviously tox wont be back for a few days but this was one unhealthy guy his heart was enlarged his coronary arteries were seriously occluded his liver was cirrhotic and one of his kidneys was atrophied with a cyst on the other not that long from bursting top of that hes got noticeable cerebral atrophy more like what youd see in an eightyyearold than a sixtyfiveyearold he was also fat and had dandruff said baker now tell me what killed him severed carotid laceration exsanguination and subsequent shock said the pathologist my point is baker he probably didnt have long either way at seven thirty they returned to the killspot in diminishing daylight stripped of hubbub and artificial illumination the site was even more depressing last nights footindentations were almost gone plumped by dew but streaks of rusty brown remained on the weeds fresh dog dropping deposited inches from where the body had lain the pooch disregarding the boundaries of the yellow crime scene tape why should life stop at eight thirty they were starving and went back to jacks barbque not just for the food but also hoping someone might remember something baker ordered smoked chicken lamar asked for tennessee pork shoulder and when the food arrived said its like some primitive rite baker wiped his mouth with a washn dri what is im eating what jack ate like that could transfer his karma to us i dont want his karma you gonna eat all those onions they wiped their chins and drove to the t house the front door was open but from the street the club looked empty the interior was a single dim plywoodpaneled room with a warped pine floor mismatched chairs pulled up to small round oilclothcovered tables a few pictures of bands and singers hanging askew not quite empty three patrons all young emaciated sullen drinking tea and eating some kind of anorexic biscuits big and rich on the tooloud soundtrack asking women to ride them behind a makeshift bar a blackshirted spikyhaired guy dried mismatched glasses as the detectives stood in the doorway he glanced their way briefly then returned to his chore not curious about their presence meaning jeffries probably hadnt been here they entered anyway looked around no hard liquor permit just beer and wine and a skimpy selection of that to the left of the bottles a blackboard listed two dozen types of tea talk about selection said lamar oolong is one thing unfermented white sounds illegal baker said look at this cocking his head at the rear of the room where a stage should be no platform no drum kit or any other evidence of live entertainment another dude in allblack fiddled with a karaoke setup they cant hire someone live said lamar the large pizza blues just got sadder referencing the old strummers joke whats the difference between a nashville musician and a large pizza a large pizza can feed a family of four this town getting someone to play for cheap was as easy as blinking but whoever owned this place opted for a computer someone turned the volume down on big and rich a young woman wearing a waitress apron over a red tank top and jeans stepped out of a door in the back checked with all three teadrinkers refilled a pot then went over to the karaoke guy he offered her a cordless microphone she wiped her hands on her apron untied it and placed it on the bar untying a blond ponytail she fluffed her hair flashed teeth at the nearly empty room finally took the mike the room grew silent the blond girl wiggled more nerves than sexiness she said here we go and tapped the mike thump thump thump testingokay folks howre yall tonight nods from two of the teadrinkers awesome me too milewide smile pretty girl twenty twentyone small and curvy fivetwo or three square jaw big eyes she cleared her throat again wellyeah it is an awesome night for some music im gret thats short for greta then again im kinda short pausing for laughter that never arrived the karaoke guy muttered something gret laughed and said bart says wed best be moving along okay heres one of my favorites cause im from san antonethough i love love love nashville silence a third throat clear gret threw back her shoulders tried to stand taller planted her feet as if ready to fight someone a musical intro issued from the karaoke box and soon gret was putting heart and soul into god made texas lamar thought she started out pretty good belting out the song in a smooth throaty voice just above an alto but she was a long ways from great meaning another rider on the dead dream express nashville chewed them up and spit them out the way hollywood did with starlets according to what hed heard about hollywood the farthest west hed been was vegas five days at a homicide investigation seminar sue had won twenty bucks playing dime slots and hed lost all that and forty more at the blackjack tables he stood there as gret wailed on glanced at his partner baker had turned his back on the stage was staring at a blank wall and lamar caught a glimpse of his profile as baker winced suddenly as if seized by a cramp lamar was wondering what was wrong when a nanosecond later gret from san antone skidded off pitch maybe an eighth note flat a few measures later she did it again and by the end of the verse she was way off off the beat too hopping in too early on several verses baker looked ready to spit how the heck had he heard the bad note before she sang it lamar wondered maybe he was so finetuned that the sound waves got there sooner maybe that was why even though he could pick and grin up there with adam steffey and ricky skaggs at least according to what people said he let that f just sit in the he stopped himself jack jeffriess throat had been cut and he was here to work the song ended finally gret from san antone bowed as a pair of hands clapped lazily she said thanks yall now were going to do a little traveling down to that awesome town so devastated by that evil woman known as katrina this is a real oldie i wouldnt know it but my mamas a big doowop fan and back when she was littler than me im talking a real bobbysoxer yall know what that is no answer gret made the wise choice of not continuing the digression anyway back then my mama just loved a boy from new yawk named freddy cannon palisades park silence anyway she repeated freddy also recorded this one back in the dinosaur age gret blinked and straightened up okay here we go folks way down yonder in new awleans baker walked out of the café and stood out on the sidewalk lamar listened to a few sour beats then joined him dont you think we should at least ask if he was in here el bee yup said baker im just waiting for the static to die down yeah said lamar she stinks poor thing maybe shes the lucky one whys that no onell give her any false hope and shell go find a real job they watched from the doorway as gret put the microphone down and resumed her waitress duties none of the patrons needed her and she headed over to the bar sipping a beer she peered over the foam locked eyes with the detectives and smiled when they approached she said police right lamar smiled back today we are i figured youd be here she said cause mr jeffries was here i was gonna call you but i really didnt know who to call and i figured youd be here soon enough whys that that threw her i dunnoi guess i figured someone would know mr jeffries was here and youd be following up baker said who would know his entourage maybe said gret as if answering a question on an oral exam i figured someone must have drove him from wherever fancy place he was staying a celebrity like him doesnt just show up by himself was he with anyone gret chewed her lip nopehe wasnt i guess i shoulda called sorry if you didnt come by tomorrow i was gonna call not that i can tell you anything else except he was here last night baker turned to the bartender whod ignored them when they entered pimplyfaced kid the spiked hair was dyed black he had a long gaunt chindominated face didnt look old enough to drink shifty eyes real shifty eyes anything you want to say son like what like were you on last night nope did you know jack jeffries was here last night gret told me man gets murdered and he was here last night we show up and you dont think to mention it gret just told me she said shed be talking to you gret said i really did officers byron doesnt know anything lamar said whats your last name byron banks said the barkeep sounds like you dont enjoy talking to the police son no answer you have experience talking to the police son byron banks gazed at the ceiling not really not really but what i did nine months when last year for what grand theft auto youre a car booster just once i was wasted never gonna happen again uhhuh baker said do you have a substanceabuse problem im okay now tending bar lamar stood up and stretched to his full height he did that whenever he wanted to intimidate dont you think its a little risky for a guy like you its tea said banks i dont do nothing and i dont know nothing shes the one who was here greta said thats really true baker said where were you last night byron over on second doing what walking around by yourself with friends we went into a club which one fuse thats techno said lamar how about the names of your friends shawn dailey kevin dimasio paulette gothain what time were you cruising second until about one or two then i went home which is where my mothers wheres that new york avenue said banks the nations said lamar with a quick glance to baker later if he was in a mood hed have some fun neighbors like that and your alarm sucks yeah im feeling antsy can i go have a smoke they took his stats and let him go the kid walked past the karaoke gear disappeared through the rear door hes really a nice person said gret i never knew he was in jail how could you tell lamar turned his eyes on the waitress we got ways whats back there through that door just the bathroom and a little room where we put our stuff i keep my guitar there you play said lamar how come you used the machine house rules said gret some kind of union thing who else was here last night gret said our other bartender bobby champlain and me and jose jose sweeps up after we close so he came in maybe ten to midnight either of them have a criminal record i wouldnt know for certain sir but i wouldnt think so bobbys around seventy deaf in one ear mostly deaf in the other and a littleslow you know joses real religious pentecostal bobby told me hes got five kids and works two jobs neither of them would have recognized mr jeffries especially lookingwell different i was the only person who did mr jeffries looked older than you expected nod and a lotyou know fatter we might as well be honest but you recognized him my mama loved the triobut her favorite was jack he was the star you know she has all the old lps sad smile we still got a record player baker said who makes the house rules the owner dr mcafee hes a cosmetic dentist loves music he worked on byrons moms teeth thats how byron got the job dr mcafee around much almost never said greta bobby champlain told me hes too busy doing teeth bobby started off working here when it opened around a year ago dr mcafee worked on his teeth too he lives in brentwood dr mcafee i mean not bobby nowadays he hardly ever makes it over last couple of weeks i been opening and closing and hes been paying me a little extra for that what time did mr jeffries show up id have to say around eleven fifteen thirty we close at midnight but the music stops at fifteen to i was just about to start my second set singing old favorites said lamar the girl smiled those big eyes were brown and soft singings in my blood its my goal to get a record deal well sure that would be great but i just love singin sharing what ive got with other people my goal is to one day be able to do that as my real job her lips turned down here i am talking about me and its so horrible about jack jeffries when i found out i was so shocked i cant tell you hes more from my mamas time but she plays his records all the time and he had a beautiful voice just gorgeous she always said it was a gift from god small fists clenched how could anyone do that to him when i found out this morning i was horrified and then i said ohmigod i need to talk to them meaning you the police i thought of but they say if its not a real emergency dont use it cause it ties up the lines why exactly said baker did you think you needed to talk to us confusion clouded the brown eyes lamar added is there something specific you want to tell us no but he was here said gret sat right in that chair and drank two pots of chamomile and ate yellowraisin scones with oodles of butter and listened to me sing i couldnt believe it jack jeffries sitting there listening to me i was so nervous i thought id fall down usually when i sing i make eye contact connect with the audience you know last night i just stared at the floor like a stupid little kid when i realized it i looked up and wouldnt you know he was looking back at me and paying attention afterward he applauded i nearly ran off to the bathroom but finally i built up my courage and went back out and got him more tea and told him how much i admired his music and that singing was my goal he told me to follow my dreamsthats what he did when he was my age for a long time everyone discouraged him but he stuck it out and stuck with it tears welled in her eyes to hear those words from a superstar like that i cant tell you what it meant then he shook my hand and wished me luck left a nice tip too i ran out to thank him but he was already talking to that lady and i didnt want to disturb his privacy she reached for a bar napkin and wiped her eyes lamar said what lady gret some older lady they were talking a little ways up but not too far from the t then he walked her to her carwhich was parked even farther up how long did they talk dont know sir i didnt want to stare didnt want to be rude so i went back inside but you definitely saw jeffries talking to this lady yeah she just walked up to him out of nowhere like shed been waiting for him did jeffries appear startled she thought no no he didnt look surprised like he knew her i guess would you say it was a long conversation or a short one i really couldnt say sir did either of them look upset no one was laughing but it was too far away to see baker said why dont you show us exactly where they were standing lamar watched from where gret said shed been standing and baker accompanied the girl as she paced off five yards stopped and said right around here i think east of the café direct route to the killsite baker had her point out where the womans car had been parked another three four feet east he brought her back to the café and the three of them stood out on the sidewalk so you cant say how long were they talking said lamar i really wasnt staring the whole time she blushed i mean its natural im not going to run away bigtime superstar just walks in just walks in by himself and sits down and listens we never get anyone important never ever not like on second or fifth or over at the songbird those places you hear all kinds of stories about celebrities dropping in at the popular clubs but were away from all that yeah it is kind of a different location said lamar dr mcafee bought the building cheap hes a big real estate investor i think hes planning to tear it down eventually and build something else meanwhile were doing music and im grateful for the opportunity big brown eyes lamar wondered what theyd look like chilled by failure baker said talk to us about this lady gret what did she look like thats a tricky one the detectives exchanged glances thats a tricky one is often code for im lying through my teeth baker said do the best you can well she was older but not as old as mr jeffries maybe forty or fifty shoulderlength dark hairnot so tall maybei dunno five four or five five she shrugged what about clothing a dark pantsuitmaybe dark blue but it couldve been gray or black thats about all i could tell you it was dark and like i said i didnt want to stare now ask me about the car what about the car real nice mercedesbenz sports car and bright red like a fire truck you didnt happen to catch the license plate no sir sorry convertible no a coupe no canvas top red bright red even at night you could see that looked like it had custom shiny wheels real shiny you think she had something to do with it its too early to think anything gret anything else you can remember that might help us would sure be appreciated hmm she took hold of her hair bunched it back in a ponytail let it drop thats really about it they asked for her full name address and phone number she said greta lynne barline the brown eyes shot to the sidewalk im in between phones looking for a better carrier you know im staying temporarily at the happy night motel just a ways down on gay street so i can walk the detectives knew the place onestar joint not far from their office it had once been a hotbed of naughtiness before the big vice crackdown now the place was trying to grab the tourist trade and an aaa rating mostly it drew truckers and transients greta added i had an apartment with a roommate but she left and the rent was too much i was thinking the eastside but its still pretty black maybe ill get a car and live near opryland a big smile that way i can visit all the time watch those tropical fish in that restaurant they have doesnt sound so bad baker said one last question greta and then i think were done for now sureshoot another wide smile she was enjoying the attention mr jeffries was here for about a half hour maybe an hour more like a half hour he left after i stopped singing what was mr jeffriess state of mind when he was here you mean his mood she brightened he was happy really enjoying the music the red mercedes was a good lead how many of those could there be the major dealer was mercedesbenz of nashville out in franklin but it was way too late to reach anyone what now el bee lamar asked time to pack it in actually i was thinking of heading out to the songbird i hear theyre doing a tribute to jeffries thats gonna last pretty late as long as im out i thought id pay my respects and check out the crowd while youre there reckon so you know im a big one for multitasking why dont you come with me stretch a hint of a genuine smile or do i have to twist your arm big grin from lamar buddy i am so there the café and dinner club was located in a strip mall sharing a common wall with taylor s insurance it had expanded recently taking over mcnultys travel which had gone south courtesy of internet booking bad luck for aaron mcnulty but a bit of good fortune for jill and scott denunzio the owners the club was bursting at the seams and even with the extra room on specialty nights there wasnt a chair to be had the place was dimly lit with a beer and wine bar opposite the front stage large fir planks made up the floor and a half dozen ceiling fans were going full blast about twenty tables were crammed with tearyeyed fans paying tribute to jack jeffries the crowd looked to be well beyond the clubs capacity but neither detective was counting when they walked in the stage overflowed with some of musics finest all of them lifting their voices in unison for a soulwrenching edition of one of jeffries ziff and bolts signature tunes just another heartbreak once inside the detectives leaned against the wall and listened catching most of the song lamar had to remember to blink totally entranced by the music then thinking yet again about the differences between good great and a shot at the gold each individual up there had righteous pipes worthy of several platinum records but there was something to that saying about the whole being greater than the sum of its parts maybe it was the time and the place maybe it was the emotion but even baker seemed under the spell when they were done the room remained silent for a few beats then erupted into heartfelt applause that lasted a good five minutes the stage cleared and jeremy train took the mike megapopular in the seventies a chick magnet with his laidback manner and boyish good looks jeremy had preserved amazingly well he was around five ten trim and muscled with the famous stickstraight shoulderlength hair the locks were still dark with a few sparkles of gray that twinkled every time train moved his head a couple of wrinkles were carved into his face but they made him look manly he wore jeans a black tee boating shoes without socks like greta barline had done yesterday evening he tapped the mike several times unnecessary a singers tic hed just used it for the group number yeah i guess its still hot a few titters of laughter uh i want to thank everyone for showing up at thisuh impromptu gathering that was supposed to be for the first amendment applause yeah right on instead we gather for a much sadder reason andwellyou know jacks music really speaks for what he wasmore than uh i can say you know applause from the audience but someone should say a few words about jack and i guess i was elected since i knew him well in ouruh craaazy days a smile oh man jack waswell lets not bullshit around jack was one crazy motherfucker applause and laughter yeah one crazy motherfuckerbut a very sensitive human being underneath all that craziness he could be a mean sonofabitch and then he could turn around and be the nicest guy in the universe you know throwing beer bottles out of the car at a hundred miles an hour sticking his head out cussing at the top of his lungs streaking naked down sunsetman he loved to get attention and that sure got attention jeremy train laughed nervously then jack would turn around and shitlike once i was admiring a painting he had on his wall and he just took it off the wall and fucking gave it to me i tried to hey man but jacks mind was made up and yall know how stubborn that crazy motherfucker could be nods among the performers yeah he was justno one could outdrink him certainly no one could outeat him subdued laughter yeah it didnt end well for jack and thats really jeremys eyes got moist and you know thats really a shame because lately he was really getting his act together a new cd was in the workshed got his bad habits under controlexcept maybe his eating and you know cmon give the guy a break things were going better for him personallyso maybe jack ended on a high note after all a hard swallow so thank yall for comin out here for jackand lets not forget denny and mark so this is for the triowe love you guys keep the faith and i think were gonna end on a piece that hey jack we love you bro were really gonna miss you the performers shuffled back on stage took up their positions and ended with my lady lies sweetly when they had finished the standing ovation was thunderous and long lamar had to shout over the bravos and encores talk to train reckon hed be the one they wound their way through the crowd until they found jeremy talking earnestly to a bevy of nubile teenage girls each one looking profoundly sad as jeremy dispensed his words of wisdom yeah that was jack just a crazy guy baker stepped toward him badge in hand mr train im detective southerby and this is detective van gundy could we have a word with you in private jeremys eyes darted from side to side the dilated pupils could have been from the dark or from something that would make him nervous to be around the police baker interjected its about jack jeffries looking a little relieved jeremy train nodded sureuh wanna step outside so i can take a smoke that would work baker said once outside jeremy lit up and offered the detectives a marlboro both declined with a shake of the head bad habit he said just think of it as helping the southern economy baker said i liked what you had to say about jack it sucked man he shook his head in disgust i cant talk in public its weird i can write good songs great songs lamar interrupted yeah a smile thanks i can singi dunno im kinda shy in public not like jack from what i hear lamar said no jack wasnt shy about anything he was justyou know out there damn shame he looked up from his smoke youre the detectives whore investigating his murder we are baker said anything about him you can tell us would be helpful the truth is that jack and i hadnt been in touch like forsheezten years you could call him one day and hed be like real cheerful then ten minutes later hed be cussing you out and hanging up on youthe guy was as unpredictable as the weather yeah that was his rep lamar said in your talk on stage you mentioned that there was a new cd and some personal relationships what can you tell me about that the cd was going real well actually he emailed me and asked me if i wanted to participate whatd you tell him baker asked i said hell yeah if the timing works out he emailed me back telling me wed talk about it at the benefit in nashville i was pretty surprised he was comin out we all knew he had a fear of flying im interested in the personal relationships lamar said what about those i think i meant more like his personal life from what i understand he was getting his addictions under controlalcohol in particular he was a mean drunk so that was good baker said what about that kid he fathered with that lesbian couple melinda ravenyeah i met her i thinkyeah gaybeen a lot of women in my life jeremy said that without braggadocio just a statement of fact we all thought jack was a little weird for volunteering but in retrospect who knows for as much as i see my oldest daughter she could have been put up for adoption her old lady likes me to keep my distance except when it comes to child support if the checks arent there by the first of the month she sure doesnt mind calling me up so maybe jack had the right idea have fun and let someone else take care of the kid talking about his ex had hardened his face i really dont know if jack had contact with the kid or not like i told you weve basically been out of contact for ten years i was surprised by his email his contacting me after all these years lamar said and you told him youd work with him on his cd not work with himjust participate like cut a background track i coulda used pro tools emailed it to him i was happy he called me but there was this part of me that was a littleuh hesitant i mean the guy was a real asshole even though he was blessed with the voice of an angel a chuckle were in the bible belt so i guess i can say that god really does work in funny ways the next morning lamar was on the phone with the mercedes dealers sales manager a voluble guy named ralph siemens siemens gave up a name instantaneously thats got to be mrs poulson she bought a fireengine slk two months ago i only sold two red ones in a long while everyone wants white or black the other was to butch smiley but he got an suv defensive tackle for the titans threehundredpound black man is mrs poulson around fortyfive with shoulderlength dark hair said lamar that would be her said siemens you know who im talking about right who poulson as in lloyd poulson banking electronics shopping centers whatever else makes money real nice gentleman bought a new sedan every two years he died last year cancer mrs poulson stayed in the house but she also breeds horses in kentucky there was talk she was going to move there fulltime where does she live where else said siemens belle meade do me a favor and dont tell her im the one who told you but i might as well give you the address cause youre going to find out anyway belle meade is seven miles southwest of downtown nashville and a whole different planet quiet meandering streets wind past greek revival colonial and italianate mansions perched on multiacre lots sweeping lawns are shaded by monumental oaks pines maples and dogwoods the towns an oldmoney bastion with plenty of newmoney infiltration but wholivedherebefore still affects real estate values driving through the wide lanes of asphalt it wasnt unusual to spot trim young women riding beautiful horses around private corrals the street signs said it all a racing horse with a colt behind a lowslung fence equestrian sports ranked right up there with golf and family football games as sunday pastimes the towns two thousand residents had been absorbed into the metro nashville utility grid years ago while managing to keep their highpriced real estate officially independent with its own police force autonomy and some believed psychological segregation from nashville as a status symbol was so important to the landowners of belle meade that they agreed to pay taxes to both cities no big strain average family income nudged two hundred thousand highest in the state the locals were ninetynine percent white one percent everything else kids who wanted to go to vanderbilt could for the most part not much reason in the past for lamar and baker to drive through over the last three years belle meade had registered no homicides one rape no robberies four assaults most of them minor and a quartet of stolen cars two of them joyrides by local teens that kind of peace and quiet left the twentyofficer belle meade police force time to do what had made it famous mercilessly enforce the traffic rules including no special treatment for cops lamar drove down belle meade boulevard slowly and carefully making a quick turn passing al and tippers place he found the address easily enough pinkish cream flattopped thing about ten times the size of a normal house set behind iron fencing but with a nice clear view of a threeacre swath of bluegrass in the center of a circular driveway a onestory fountain burbled the red benz was parked right in front along with a volvo station wagon pines so dark they almost looked black had been barbered to cones and were positioned at the front of the mansion like sentries toward the front of the property hanging over the fence were some of the biggest oaks the detectives had ever seen as they parked and walked to the gate lamar saw how theatrical the landscaping was the trees and foliage had been manipulated for uneven sun exposure so that the threestory expanse got maximum dappling there was no lock on the gate they walked through made the hike to the front door rang the bell expecting a maid in full uniform or maybe even a butler to answer their call instead a nicelooking middleaged woman in a pink cashmere cowlneck sweater tailored white slacks and pink sandals came to the door polish on her toenails but not pink just natural same for her nails which were clipped surprisingly short no jewelry except for a platinum wedding band she had dark hair shoulderlength and flipped at the ends softlooking skin and blue eyes true blue not like the shrinks her face was the perfect oval a bit too tight around the edges but still pretty mrs poulson im cathy soft thin voice the detectives introduced themselves nashville detectives is this for fundraising chief fortune didnt mention anything letting them know she was connected that she saw them as beggars baker said were here about an incident that took place in the city maam lamar said a murder im afraid jack jeffries no shock on cathy poulsons smooth face she nodded slumped oh jack she said please come in she led them across an entry hall bigger than their residences into a sunlit room that looked out to manicured acres of hillocks streams stone waterfalls and tree girdle at the rear a royal blue olympicsized pool was edged with golden tiles and dressed at the corners with more statuary naked nymphs a patch of color sparkled off to the left where a rose garden thrived green tarpaulin fencings in the distance shouted tennis anyone a maid in full uniform young black slim dusted antique furniture a rich lady who answered her own door thought lamar nervous about something cathy poulson went up to the woman and rested her hand on a shoulder amelia i need to talk to these gentlemen a bit would you please bring us some of that amazing lemonade then see if the kitchen needs freshening yes maam when amelia left cathy said please sit i hope you like lemonade sinking into enormous silkupholstered chairs baker and lamar drank the best lemonade theyd ever tasted and took in the room fifty feet long by half as much wide with high coved ceilings not much simpler than those in the hermitage lobby stiff arrangements of gleaming curvylegged wood tables delicate chairs and highback french provincial couches shared space with realistic soft seating the walls were pale green silk hung with giltframed paintings of still lifes and country scenes the stone fireplace at the far end was big enough to walk into a few color photos rested on the carved mantel lamar said he loved the lemonade cathy poulson said its amazing isnt it the key is to use meyer lemons along with the regular kind gives it a bit more sweetness my husband taught me that he was originally from california fallbrook thats down near san diego his family grew citrus and avocado a drought and some bad investments wiped them out completely lloyd had to start all over by himself and he was successful beyond belief he died six months ago he was a wonderful man she got up walked to the mantel fetched one of the photos and brought it back it looked like some sort of charity ball shot where rich folk pose for photographers as they enter a fancy room cathy poulson stood next to a short thick balding man with curly white hair fringing his ears red designer gown for her same color as her car tux for him lloyd poulsons eyes crinkled when he smiled his pudgy fingertips were visible around his wifes wasp waist he wore thicklensed blackframed glasses and had a gut that swelled his cummerbund appeared to be at least seventy cathy poulson looked like a movie star in the photo plenty of jewelry that night diamonds at every strategic location the bodice of her red gown was lowcut enough to expose a big soft expanse of swelling breast perfect cleavage thought lamar youd never know to look at her in the sweater such a vital man she said with a sigh prostate cancer there was pain but he never complained sorry for your loss maam cathy poulson picked invisible lint from her sweater reached for the photo placed it faceup on her lap sorry to bore you with my personal problems youve got important work to do and you want to know why i was talking to jack the night before last yes maam first off she said its pretty obvious that i wasnt trying to hide anything you dont go into that neighborhood with a car like mine park right out in front if youre worried about being seen she tapped the photo who saw me that girl which girl a little blond girl i assumed she was a waitress or something like that she and a mexican were the only ones left in the place i saw her watching jack and me from the doorway spying said baker probably but trying hard not to show it said cathy poulson unable to resist i suppose which is understandable given how famous jack is was she bit her lip i found out about it this morning like everyone else drinking my morning coffee and reading the paper and there it was her eyelids quivered i went into the bathroom and was completely sick you knew about the murder but you acted surprised when we showed up said baker cathy poulson blinked pardon that remark about fundraising the woman blushed that was stupid and snobbish detective please forgive me i guess i i dont know why i said that i certainly wasnt surprised that you showed up i knew that girl had seen me and if she told you youd probably trace me through my car and of course youd want to talk to me i might have been the last person to see jack before he was i so far thats the case maam well thats horrible repugnant and horrible neither detective spoke cathy poulson said did the girl tell you that jack and i didnt leave together that i drove off and that he stayed behind no maam lamar answered well thats what happened so its obvious im not your culprit smiling and aiming for levity but one hand clawed a whitetrousered knee baker said whyd you go down to the t house to talk to mr jeffries he chose it said it was off the beaten pathhow right he was i knew it was a dump but jack could get insistent she shook her head the original plan was for me to be there earlier i got held up and didnt make it until closing jack understood he could be quitepleasant when he wanted to be sounds like you two go back a ways cathy poulson smiled and sat back and swept dark hair from her face light from the rear of the room caught on her platinum ring i suppose you could say that would you be so kind as to fill us in said lamar about my relationship with jack yes maam is that really necessary seeing as im not your culprit the more information we have the easier our job is maam believe me said cathy poulson im not going to be able to make your job any easier because all i can tell you is jack and i spoke briefly and then i left a manicured hand graced her left breast please guys given all ive gone through this past year i really cant handle any more stress shifting from gentlemen to guys this one parceled out the charm lamar wondered how much shed rehearsed and knew baker was thinking the same thing baker put on his nice voice and leaned forward we have no intention of causing you stress maam but we do need to compile data she stared at him as if seeing him for the first time shifted back to lamar college basketball no maam sorry that was inappropriate its just that my sons into sports basketball football baseball you name it he just started at college im here all alone feeling really alone vanderbilt oh no she said with some fervor vanderbilt wouldve been great he couldve stayed in a dorm room he knows id never meddle but hed still have the opportunity to come home on weekends to dump laundry maybe grant me a few hi moms no tristans at brown in rhode island smallest state in the union and theres where he picks supposed to be a good school said lamar ivy league right right but so what my husband went to chico state college and he was the most successful man ive ever met granted tristans an excellent student his sats were terrific and all his varsity letters were impressive his guidance counselor said he was ivy league material from the gitgo but vanderbilts just as good now hes never here never raising her volume so by the last word it was like hearing someone elses voice shrill angry a deeper flush took hold of her face and wrinkles started to show around the edges of her makeup like fault lines one of those mooddisorder things lamar wondered or is she trying to tell us something because this one sets things up like a stage director from the way she plants her trees and arranges her expensive furniture to bringing us lemonade we dont ask for staying in control but if there was a message beyond the fact that she missed her kid he wasnt picking it up and for a new widow he supposed that was a normal reaction still there was something about herhe said must be tough alone in a big house alone said cathy poulson is tough anywhere baker smiled could i use your restroom please maam he glanced at the mantel as he left and was gone for a while lamar digressed by commenting on cathy poulsons paintings she jumped at the opportunity to walk him around the room announcing titles and artists and describing how and where and when her deceased husband had acquired each picture when they got to the mantel he saw mostly pictures of her with a token nod to a few snapshots with the husband nothing of the kid baker came back looking sharpeyed and ready to say something cathy poulson got there first saying okay ill be open and tell you everything if you pledge that youll do your best not to violate my privacy baker said well do our utmost best maam looking relaxed too loose lamar could tell there was something on his partners mind the three of them sat back down cathy poulson said jack and i had a relationship ancient history before i met lloyd im from california too la thats where i met jack another west coast connection like the shrink lamar wondered if delaware knew her then told himself he was being stupid ginormous city like la what were the chances cathy poulson said thats it baker said a relationship yes whyd you decide to meet last night jack called me to let me know he was in town out of the blue you couldve knocked me over with a feather he said hed heard about lloyds passing and was real sweet about it jack could be like that he said hed had some rough patches himself but of course nothing comparable to what i was going throughwhich i thought was extremely empathic id heard a bit about what jack had gone through from the media not personally the lifestyle issues the career ups and downs for him to put all that aside and consider my pain i thought that waskind baker said so he called to say hi we talked a bit he said hed had a terrible fear of flying after that helicopter thing i read about that too he said hed lived with his fear for years finally decided to conquer it and get some therapy the flight to nashville was a big accomplishment he sounded so incredibly proud as if hed just had a number one hit i told him that was wonderful then we talked some more about lloyd then he asked if i wanted to get together i suppose i shouldnt have been surprised but it caught me off guard i didnt know how i felt about that not sure you wanted to see him to tell the truth she said we didnt part on great terms back in the old days jack could be tough how so said baker mercurial moody drugs made it worse then there were all those women groupies do they still call them that yes maam said lamar thinking all those gigs i played never saw a single one all those groupies said cathy poulson you cant really expect a man to be faithfulanyway it was jarring hearing from him so many years later maybe my grief was what led me to say okay im still not sure he told me there was a club he was going to over on first could we meet there i agreed but right after i hung up i regretted it what in the world was it going to accomplish i considered calling him back and canceling but didnt want to hurt his feelings especially with his conquering his fear i didnt want to set him back can you understand that sure said baker i mean that would make me feel guilty stressing him to the point where he backslid she glanced to the side back in the good old days i had plenty of experience with backsliding drugs said baker the whole crazy scene she said funny thing was no one really saw it as crazy except me i never indulged not once never i respect myself way too much for that jack of course was another story i spent many a night walking him around when a doctor needed to be called i was usually the one who did it you had a close relationship said lamar such as it was but ancient ancient history gentlemen thats why i wasnt sure i wanted to play the reminiscence game with him still i didnt want to upset jack so i didnt cancel instead i showed up late a glassy smile almost intoxicated i thought that was the perfect solution showing up late of course that way wed have minimal contact but id have fulfilled my obligation once again lamar thought of cathy as a master director baker said youd say hi nice to see you then youd go your separate ways exactly said cathy poulson frankly when i saw jack i was shocked and that made it easier my image of him was stuck back in the time when we were together he had been a handsome man now she shrugged not too well preserved said lamar that makes him sound like a lab specimen but im afraid youre right she sighed poor jack time hadnt been kind to him i drove there expecting a goodlooking man which was foolish after all those years had passed what i saw was a heavy old bald man not unlike her late husband thought lamar she picked up her glass of lemonade we had a little hug chatted briefly then parted ways i will tell you this jack wasnt upset the entire encounter was friendly i got a clear sense that he felt the same way i did which was dont fix it if it aint broken said cathy poulson whoever wrote that famous book was right you really cant go home psychologically i mean lamar still had a feeling about the woman and wouldve stuck around to see if he could tease anything more out of her but he could tell baker was antsy a few more of lamars questions made his partner downright restless perched on the edge of the sofa ready to spring up like a frog at a fly lamar said thank you maam if you think of anything else heres our number he handed her a card and cathy poulson placed it on a table in an absent way that let him know hed never hear from her again she said of course would you like me to put some lemonade in a little bottle back in the car lamar said okay what okay what what the way you were itching to book el bee sportin a rash baker grinned huge an unusual sight drive lamar made his way back to belle meade boulevard passed more mansions engine roar sounded at their rear end a couple of rich kids in a bmw convertible testing the speed limit they got inches from his rear bumper he let them pass heard laughter baker said did you notice that theres no pictures of her kid in the living room sure did not too many of her late great husband lloyd either i figure her for one of those narcissists its all about me or maybe something else said baker when i go to use the facilities i notice an alcove up a ways shes got alcoves niches whatever all over the place has these little prissy figurines glass globes that kind of stuff but the one near the john has a picture in a nice frame just like the ones on the mantel and it shows her kid big old blond bubba could be a twin of the one in the picture we found in jeffriess hotel room owen the rugby player said lamar by the way that one is definitely melindas kid i found a picture in an old copy of people magazine good for you said baker now just let me stay on track here for a second stretch this other kid poulsons kid is wearing a uniform too real football with the pads and the black stuff under the eyes and im telling you he couldve had the same papa as owen same coloring beefy big jaw to my eye an even stronger resemblance to mr jack jeffries that makes me curious so i turn over the photo and on the back theres an inscription happy ems day mom you rock love tristan the really interesting part is the handwriting block letters with little flourishes on the caps im no graphologist but to my eye a dead match in handwriting for those silly lyrics we found in the hotel room music city breakdown what its looking like said baker is a whole bunch of stuff broke down they drove back to the city grabbed fastfood burgers and cokes took them to the purple room where brian fondebernardi joined them around the center table the sergeants shirt matched the walls his charcoal slacks were razorpressed his black hair was clipped his eyes sharp and searching dealing with the press all morning hadnt dented him but he wanted a progress report lamar said matter of fact we have something to report when they finished filling him in fondebernardi said he was a rock star had beaucoup girlfriends she was one of them and got knocked up so so said baker the kids a college freshman meaning eighteen nineteen tops lets even say twenty if hes dumb which he aint because he got into brown she was married to her husband for twentysix years oops said fondebernardi oops indeed said lamar theres a secret worth keeping in belle meade plus said baker we know the kid tristans his name had contact with jeffries via the handwriting of the song said fondebernardi kid couldve mailed that in maybe sarge but jeffries held on to it meaning maybe there was some kind of relationship or he thought the lyrics were good baker rocked an open palm with splayed fingers back and forth not unless he lost his ear completely lyrics needed something thats for sure said lamar but they were full of frustration like nashville screwed him over doesnt sound like a pampered rich kid so maybe theres a side of ol tristan we dont know about someone that age said fondebernardi he hasnt had time to get frustrated rich kids said baker theyre used to having their way get their panties in a sling real easily maybe this one wanted approval from jeffries didnt get it and freaked out hes in rhode island baker we havent verified that yet why not said fondebernardi then he checked himself you want my okay before you call baker said its belle meade sarge end of discussion the registrar clerk at brown university was squirrelly about giving out student information lamar said you got facebook right yes then nothings secret so why dont you make my life easy i dont know i dont want his grade point average only to know if hes on campus and this is because police investigation said lamar you dont cooperate and something bad happens its not going to reflect well on brown and i know what a great school brown is my sister went there whos that ellen grant he said picking a nice waspy name out of thin air she loved it well said the clerk on campus or not well do the rest hold on captain another little fib less than a minute later no captain tristan poulson took a leave of absence for the second semester he did the fall semester then he left yes said the clerk the freshman year can be stressful they called fondebernardi back to the purple room and told him he said rich kid who thinks hes a songwriter drops out to follow his dream that plus maybe lloyd poulsons dying got him delusional said lamar its possible somehow tristan figured out jack was his bio dad and maybe he found out more than that the me said jacks internal organs were a mess he didnt have long maybe tristan read about jacks health issues in some fan magazine worried about that and it tipped him over get in touch with my bio dad before he kicks too use music to bond and where else would he go to do that but back home because heres where the music is not to mention mommys money and connections or said baker tristan didnt figure out who his real daddy was but he wanted to meet jack anyway mommys old boyfriend who just happens to be a onetime superstar and tristans into writing songs jeffries might not be able to motivate hits anymore but to a needy kid he couldve seemed larger than life especially said lamar if mommy told him detailed stories about the good old days shes a genteel rich lady now but likes attention i can see her basking in old glory fondebernardi didnt answer fame said lamar its the hardest drug of all right sarge tristan gets in touch with his songwriting self writes a plaintive ditty that he sends to jack who just happens to be his real daddy said baker lamar said i havent seen the kids picture yet but baker says the resemblance is real strong baker nodded strong enough for mommy to take juniors pictures off the mantel in case we showed up unfortunately for her she forgot about the alcove thank god for bakers bladder said lamar fondebernardi said find out everything you can about the kid they started where everyone does google came up with twenty hits all scores from football games and field hockey matches tristan poulson had played in varsity star at madison prep a fancypants place out in brentwood theyd both heard of because lieutenant shirley joness son had been accepted there on a basketball scholarship one of two black kids admitted three years ago they asked her if they could talk to tim and told her why she said you bet and he knows how to keep his mouth shut tim jones came to the station after school all six six of him carelessly goodlooking still wearing his blazer and khakis white shirt and rep tie he hugged and kissed his mother followed her into the purple room sat down and attacked the quiznos black angus on rosemary parmesan bread smothered with mozzarella mushrooms and sautéed onions shed bought for him baker and lamar watched in admiration as the kid polished off the fullsized sub in what seemed like a few bites washed it down with a jumbo root beer not a crumb or stain on his preppy duds excellent he told the lieutenant usually you get me the italian special occasion said shirley jones touching the top of her sons head briefly then heading for the door talk to my ace detectives tell them everything you know and then forget it ever happened when will you be home right after i guess said tim massive homework you guess right after ill pick up some dreyers on the way excellent rocky road ahem please i knew him said tim but we didnt hang out he seemed okay you play on a team together said baker nope he did some hoops but just jayvee footballs his thing hes built for it big guy like a refrigerator an okay guy huh said lamar tim nodded seemed mellow hed play aggressive on the field but he wasnt like that the rest of the time i went to a few parties with him jock stuff after games but we didnt hang out whod he hang with other football dudes i guess he had a girlfriend from briar lane remember her name sheralyn said tim dont know her last name cheerleader no she was more of a brainiac good student dont know about her grades said tim brainiacs more than good grades its a category you know concentrating on books art music all that good stuff music said baker she played piano i saw her at a party tristan was standing with her singing along with her good voice he sounded okay what kind of music tim frowned something like old jazz maybe sinatra which was kind of weird everyone thought it was funny they were playing oldpeople music but they were serious my mom plays sinatra sammy davis junior tony bennett has those vinyls you know antiques said baker tim said she has a typewriter too likes me to know how things used to be what do you know about tristans music his what weve heard that he wrote songs thats a new one for me said tim i never heard rumors he and sheralyn broke up but maybe he was looking to get another girl why do you say that thats mostly why guys write songs googling briarlane academy sheralyn pulled up a review in the girl schools campus paper the siren call last october the thespian club had presented a postmodern version of as you like it the reviewer had loved the show singling out sheralyn carlsons portrayal of rosalind as mercilessly relevant and psychologically deep they traced the girl to an address in brentwood nashville s other highpriced spread five miles south of belle meade brentwood had a higher concentration of new money than its cousin with rolling hills and open land a magnet for music types whod cashed in faith and tim and dolly had brentwood spreads so did alan jackson and george jones homes ranged from horse estates to sleek ranch houses ninetyfour percent white six percent everything else sheralyn carlson mightve posed a problem for the census taker with a chinese radiologist mother and a hulking blond radiologist father who wouldve looked fine in viking duds the girl was gorgeous tall and lithe with long shiny honeycolored hair almondshaped amber eyes and a softspoken disposition of the type that tended to reassure adults drs elaine and andrew carlson seemed like quiet inoffensive types themselves they briefed the detectives on the fact that their only child had never earned a grade lower than a had never given them a lick of problem had been offered a spot in the johns hopkins gifted writer program but had turned it down because as dr elaine phrased it sheralyn eschews divisive stratification our view as well added dr andrew we try to maintain family cohesiveness said dr elaine without sacrificing free expression stroking her daughters shoulder sheralyn took her mothers hand dr elaine squeezed her daughters fingers my daughter our daughter said dr andrew is a fabulous young woman thats obvious said baker wed like to talk to her alone i dont know said dr andrew i dont know either said dr elaine know said sheralyn please flashing a brief tight smile at her parents the drs carlson looked at each other very well said dr andrew he and his wife left the stark white contempo living room of their stark white contempo house as if embarking on a trek across siberia glancing back and catching sheralyns merry wave when they were gone the girl turned grave finally a chance to express whats been on my mind for some time im extremely concerned about tristan why said baker hes depressed not clinically at this point but dangerously close depressed about his father his father she said blinking yes that of course what else the usual postadolescent issues sheralyn turned her fingers like darning needles life lamar said sounds like youre interested in psychology sheralyn nodded the ultimate questions always revolve around human behavior and tristans behavior concerns you more like lack of behavior she said hes depressed going through rough times tristans not what he seems she said as if she hadnt heard she had the refined good looks of a beauty queen but aimed for edgy floral minidress combat boots henna patterns banding the tops of her hands four pierces in one ear three in the other there was a tiny little dot above her right nostril where a stud had once rested what do you mean at first glance she said tristan comes across as mega jock from planet testosterone but hes preternaturally sensitive preternaturally said baker we all have our masks the teen remarked a less honest person might have no trouble donning his tristans soul is honest he suffers neither detective was really sure what she meant lamar said is he going through an identity crisis of some kind she looked at him as if he needed tutoring sure why not changing his ways said baker silence lamar said we know he took a leave from brown where is he at home living with his mother only in a physical sense they dont get along tristans home is not a nurturing place conflict with his mother noo said sheralyn carlson for conflict there needs to be involvement mrs poulsons not involved oh she is the girl frowned with herself such a cozy relationship you dont like her said baker i dont think about her enough to dislike her a second later she represents much that repels me how so have you met her sure have yet you ask said sheralyn carlson working at looking amused baker said whats her problem besides being a distant mom the girl took several moments to answer twisting those fingers playing with her hair and the hem of her dress i love tristan not as a sexual lover theres no longer that spark between us she crossed her legs words dont do it justice but if i had to encapsulate id say brotherly love but dont take that as a freudian hint tristan and i are quite proud that weve managed to transition our relationship from the realm of the physical to idealistic companionship another long pause tristan and i have both taken on the mantle of celibacy silence sheralyn carlson smiled socalled adults shudder at the notion of socalled adolescent sexuality but when the sc adolescent eschews sexuality the sc adults think its bizarre i reckon thats not too foreign a concept in these parts baker said churchgoing people every wednesday and sunday like clockwork she frowned the point is that tristan and i have opted for a more internal life since his senior year art and music said lamar the internal life the girl repeated well thats fine sheralyn and now hes living at home you see each other much at home and about about where he tends to gravitate toward sixteenth street looking for a record deal on music row tristan is close to tone deaf but he loves to write the obvious choice is lyrics for the last month hes been attempting to sell his lyrics to the philistines on music row i warned him hed encounter nothing but crass commercialism but tristan can be quite determined from jock to songwriter said baker howd his mom take that she would have to care to take apathetic she would have to believe that others exist in order to fit into any sort of category such as apathetic lamar said mrs poulson lives in her own little world little said sheralyn carlson being the operative word she did break out of it long enough to tell tristan that he was too good for me crooked smile because of this touching the side of one eye the epicanthic fold trumps all shes a racist said baker well said the girl that has been known to exist in various civilizations over a host of millennia aiming for breezy but recalling the slight had tightened her voice one of those highiq types who hid behind words thought lamar that rarely worked for any length of time he said tristan couldnt have been happy with that tristan laughed said sheralyn carlson i laughed we shared the mirth the detectives didnt answer she said the girl letting the word hang there for a few seconds she okay let me fill in the picture with an anecdote when tristan started at brown he was the epitome of mega jock with his shaved head and freshfaced optimism by the end of his first semester his hair had reached his shoulders and his beard was full and woolly he grew a lovely masculine beard thats when he began suspecting but she denied everything suspected what said baker his true paternity he doubted that mr poulson was his detective southerby said the girl why not be honest youre here because of jack jeffriess murder baker had mentioned his own surname once when first meeting the family most people never bothered to register it this kid missed nothing he said go on throughout tristans childhood she had always talked about jack rather incessantly at times tristan knew that her relationship with lloyd was sexless and he noted the sparkle in her eye when jacks name came up he wondered as anyone with a brain would wonder then when the inner world began exerting its pull and he began to write wonder turned to fantasy about jack jeffries being his real dad said baker every adolescent has them said sheralyn carlson escape fantasies the certainty that one has to have been adopted because these aliens one finds oneself living with cant be linked to one biologically in jacks case a rather dramatic physical resemblance kept the fantasy alive another crooked smile and wouldnt you know she crossed the other leg exposed some thigh tucked down her dress and ran a finger under the top of a boot lamar said tristan felt he looked like jack jeffries he did i did anyone who saw pictures of jack jeffries when he was young did two things happened that further fed his fantasy before it became reality before tristan left for brown i came across a picture of a boy in a magazine in people magazine an article about sperm donors melinda ravens son by jack jeffries owen said sheralyn as if recalling an old friend he couldve been tristans twin the similarity in age made the resemblance undeniable thats why the first thing tristan did when he got to brown was grow his hair and beard to compare himself to pictures of jack taken back in the hairy days the result was beyond debate tristan experienced a crisis of sorts we spent long hours on the phone and decided he needed a paradigm shift he took a leave of absence came home moved into the guest house of mommys manse and prepared to confront her we had strategy meetings beforehand devising how to approach her finally settled on simplicity tell her you know and request verification tristan took some time to build up his courage finally did it when she was on her way to her country club we expected initial denial then confession then some sort of emotion she didnt bat an eyelash told him he was crazy and that hed better clean up if he intended to ever have lunch with her at the club what did tristan do said lamar nothing nothing at all ergo depression did he try to contact jack jeffries he did more than try he succeeded they met in cyberspace email said baker tristan contacted jack jeffriess website introduced himself sent a jpeg of his senior photo as well as a later hirsute version and some lyrics he expected nothing but jack answered said he was happy to hear from tristan said tristans lyrics were awesome howd tristan react to that the girl turned away placed her hand on a small white abstract carving resting on a glass and chrome table this place is like an igloo thought baker how did tristan take that the girl gnawed her lip sheralyn said baker he cried she said tears of joy i held him ten minutes later drs andrew and elaine peeked in sheralyn said im fine and waved them away and they disappeared during that time shed verified that the lyrics tristan had sent were music city breakdown but she denied knowing about any facetoface meeting between tristan poulson and jeffries nor was she willing to pinpoint tristans whereabouts beyond the guest house on his mothers property hes still there said baker i believe so you believe tristan and i havent been in contact for several days thats why im concerned thats why im talking to you what did you think when you heard jack jeffries had been murdered what did i think she said i thought nothing i felt sad did you consider that maybe tristan had done it never does tristan carry a weapon never has he ever shown a violent side never never never never to any incriminating questions youre going to ask about him if i thought he was guilty id never have talked to you why not because id never do anything to incriminate tristan even if he murdered someone sheralyn rubbed the space to the side of one eye same spot shed touched when discussing cathy poulsons racist comment then she sat up straight and stared baker down something few people tried i she pronounced am neither judge nor jury just for the record said baker where were you the night before last say between twelve and two am thats not night its morning correction duly noted young lady where were you here in my bedroom sleeping i make an effort to sleep soundly good habits said lamar i have obligations school sats theater club model un et cetera sounding bitter headed for brown not hardly im going to yale sleeping said baker first time you heard about jack jeffries was when my father brought it up hes our own personal town crier he reads the morning paper and comments extensively on every article you didnt think anything of it just sad over the loss of life said the girl any life just that said baker even though you knew this was tristans real dad and tristan had recently contacted him i was saddest for tristan am ive called his cell twentyeight times but he doesnt answer you should find him he needs comfort why do you think hes not answering ive already explained that hes depressed tristan gets like that turns off the phone goes inward thats when he writes no chance hes run away from what guilt thats absurd she said tristan didnt kill him because he loved him as if that explained it thought lamar smart kid but utterly clueless tristan loved jack even though hed never met him irrelevant said sheralyn carlson one never falls in love with a person one falls in love with an idea drs andrew and elaine carlson verified that sheralyn had been home the nightmorning of the murder from five pm until eight thirty am at which time dr andrew drove her to briar lane academy in his porsche cayenne not that theyd say anything else muttered baker as they got back in the car shes got them wrapped around her little intellectual finger couldve climbed through a window and met up with tristan and theyd never know think she was involved said lamar i think shed do and say anything to cover for tristan her celibate lover you believe that kids nowadays i believe anything so lets find this tortured soul and shake him up back to mommys mansion its a short drive when they got to the poulson estate a lowering sun had grayed the house and a padlock had been fixed to the main gate the red benz was in the same place the volvo was gone no call box just a bell baker jabbed it the front door opened and someone looked at them black uniform with white trim dark face the maid whod fetched the lemonade amelia baker waved amelia didnt budge he shouted her name loud the sound was a slap across the genteel silent face of belle meade she approached them not here she said through iron gate slats please her eyes were wide with fear sweat trickled from her hairline to an eyebrow but she made no attempt to dry her face where did the missus go said baker silence tell us right now kentucky sir her horse farm yes sir when did she leave two hours ago she take tristan with her no sir youre sure about that yes sir we could sit here and watch the house for days said lamar we could come back with a warrant and go through every room of this place and make a godawful mess no answer baker said so youre sticking with that story she didnt take tristan no sir no youre not sticking with it or no she didnt take him bakers ears were red she didnt take him sir he in the house right now no sir where then i dont know sir whens the last time you saw him when you were here sir when we were talking to mrs poulson tristan was here in the guest house when did he leave after you did why i dont know sir did he take a car his car said amelia make and model said lamar whipping out his pad a beetle green did he take anything with him i didnt see sir you cleaned his room right yes sir any clothes missing i havent been in there today sir what were getting at said baker is did he just take a drive into town or do you think he left town i dont know sir its a big house i start at one end takes me two days to get to the other and your point is there are many things i dont hear or choose not to hear amelias face remained impassive lamar said tristan left right after we did did he and his mother have a discussion i dont know sir whyd mrs poulson decide all of a sudden to fly to kentucky it wasnt all of a sudden said the maid she flies there all the time to see her horses loves her horses does she apparently sir youre saying the trip was planned yes sir i heard her calling the charter service five days ago so you do hear some things depends which room im working sir i was freshening outside the study and she was using the study phone remember the name of the charter service dont have to said amelia she uses the same one all the time new flight thank you said lamar now where can we find tristan dont know sir sure about that more than sure sir back in the car they got the registration stats on tristan poulsons vw and put an alert out on the car they called new flight charter were told in no uncertain terms that the company maintained strict client confidentiality and that nothing short of a warrant would change that that sowell good for you said baker hanging up with a scowl what said lamar they fly big shots like president clinton and tom brokaw everything hushhush hushhush but they tell you they fly clinton guess hes beyond mere mortality drive stretch on the way back to town they got a call from trish the receptionist at headquarters a dr alex delaware had phoned this morning and then again at two no message baker said guys probably itching to get back home guy works with the police said lamar youd think hed know hes free to go we cant keep him here legally youd think hmmmaybe you should call him back or better yet lets drop in on him at the hotel see if he knew cathy poulson in her la days while were there we can also show tristans picture around to the staff two bad we dont have two pictures said baker another with all that hair like father like son said lamar it always comes down to family doesnt it delaware wasnt in his room the concierge was sure of that the doctor had stopped by around noon to ask directions to opryland and hadnt returned no one at the hermitage remembered ever seeing tristan poulson the cleancut high school senior photo version asking people to imagine long hair and a beard produced nothing but quizzical looks just as they were about to leave for a drivethrough of music row delaware walked in spruced up la style blue blazer white polo shirt blue jeans brown loafers taking shades off his eyes he nodded at the concierge doctor said baker good you got my message cmon up ive got something to show you as the elevator rose lamar said how was opryland delaware said tracing me huh it was more disneyland than downhome but with a name like opryland i shouldnt have been surprised i had lunch in that restaurant with the giant aquariums which wasnt bad have a hearty seafood dinner the psychologist laughed steak any luck on jacks murder were working on it delaware worked at hiding his sympathy his room was the same pinneat setup the guitar case rested on the bed he opened a closet drawer drew out some papers hotel fax cover sheet over a couple of others after you left i started thinking about my sessions with jack something he told me as the trip approached dead people dont get confidentiality i had my girlfriend robin go through the chart and fax the relevant pages here you go two lined pages filled with dense sharply slanted handwriting not the clearest fax hard to make out delaware saw them squinting sorry my penmanship stinks would you like a summary lamar said that would be great doctor as the date got closer jacks anxiety rose that was understandable and expected we redoubled our efforts to work on deep muscle relaxation pinpointed the stimuli that really set off his anxiety basically we gave it the fullcourt press i thought we were doing fine but about a week ago jack called me in the middle of the night unable to sleep agitated i told him to come over but he said hed wait until morning i asked if he was sure he said he was and promised to show up at nine am he arrived at eleven looking haggard i assumed it was preflight jitters but he said there were other things on his mind i encouraged him to talk about anything that bothered him he made a joke about it something along the lines of thats allowed good oldfashioned headshrinking instead of cognitive hoochycoo mojo mindbending he sat down on the bed touched the guitar case that had been an issue right from the beginning jack did not want psychotherapy said hed had plenty of that during his various rehab stints and that the sound of his own voice bitching made him want to puke afraid of something said baker arent we all delaware slipped off his jacket folded it neatly placed it on the bed changed his mind got up and hung it in the closet he sat back down theres always that possibility what people in my business call baloney afraid of the slicer but i take people at their word until proven otherwise and i went along with jack not wanting to get into topics other than flying we had a deadline approaching and i knew if jack didnt get on that plane id never see him again but now hed changed his mind and wanted to talk im not saying what he told me about is profoundly relevant to your case but i thought you should know appreciate it said baker holding out an expectant palm what jack wanted to talk about was family said delaware that surprised even me because jack had always been an extremely focused and goaloriented patient im sure the stress of the upcoming flight released a barrage of unpleasant memories he started with a brutal upbringing abusive father negligent mother both of them doctors respectable on the outside but severe alcoholics who turned his childhood into a nightmare he was the only child bore the brunt of it his memories were so traumatic that hed seriously considered sterilization when he was in his twenties but never followed through because he was too damn lazy and stoned and didnt want anyone cutting down there before i had enough fun but im not sure that was it i think a part of him did yearn for that parentchild connection because when he talked about not having his own family he got extremely morose then he brought up something hed done that made him smile fathering a child with an actress who was gay and sought him out because she admired his music melinda raven said lamar so you know thats all we know her name the story she put out for the media was sperm donation said delaware the truth was jack and she made love several times until she conceived she had a boy jack was not involved in his life why not he claimed it was fear said delaware that hed mess the boy up i know jacks image was that of a rock n roll bad boy afraid of nothing and he had taken some outrageous risks during the early days but those had been fueled by drugs at the core he was a highly fearful man ruled by fear when he brought up owen he looked proud but then when he got into owen not being a part of his life he broke down then he started on a long jag about all the other children he mightve sired all those groupies onenight stands decades of random promiscuity he made a joke about it im a bachelor meaning no kids to speak of then he broke down again wondering what might have been visualizing himself old and alone at the end of his life with his money said lamar if he sired kids youd think at least some of the women wouldve filed paternity suits i told him exactly that he said a few had tried but theyd all turned out to be liars what concerned him were the honest women too kind to exploit him or women who simply didnt know his phrasing was i rained sperm on the world it had to sprout somewhere why wouldnt women know delaware ran his fingers through his curls at the height of jacks career he spent a lot of time in a haze that included group sex orgies just about anything you can imagine he partied hearty and now hes worrying about unknown kids said baker he was an old man said the psychologist getting closer to mortality can turn you inward same phrase sheralyn had used about tristan father and son delaware said what im saying is that the issue of family not having a family was on jacks mind as the trip approached and something else he told me something i really didnt appreciate at the time makes me wonder if the trip was really about family lamar hid his enthusiasm the story was he was coming out here for the songbird benefit yes it was but you know guys like me small smile always looking for hidden meaning whats the thing he told you the day after he poured out his heart he came in looking great standing straighter walking taller cleareyed i said he seemed like a man with a mission he laughed and said i was right on he was ready to fly ready for anything god or odin or allah or whoever was in charge was going to toss his way gonna sing my guts out doc gonna reclaim my biology thats the part i overlooked when i first talked to you biology i thought he was relating it to guts joking around that was jacks style he made light of things that frightened him until they got to a level where they overwhelmed him reclaiming his biology said baker a paternity thing the day before all he could talk about was paternity i shouldve made the connection and youre thinking thats relevant because im no homicide expert said delaware but ive seen a few crime scenes the paper said jack was stabbed and a knife can be an intimate weapon you need to get up close and personal when you use one if you tell me jack was robbed ill change my mind if he wasnt ill continue to wonder if he was cut by someone he knew given his remark about biology how resolute he looked before we left ill also wonder if he chose nashville for his maiden voyage chose that particular benefit when there are so many others because he wanted to be here for a personal reason and ended up dying because of it neither detective spoke delaware said if ive wasted your time sorry i wouldnt have felt right if i didnt tell you baker said we appreciate it doctor leaning over and taking the fax do you know a woman named cathy poulson sorry no no curiosity about why i asked ive learned to modulate my curiosity but sure who is she old girlfriend of jacks hung out with him in la maybe thirty years ago thirty years ago i was a kid in missouri the thing is said lamar she also hooked up with him nineteen and a half years ago delaware studied them thats a precise time frame you know because it was punctuated by a specific event baker looked at lamar lamar nodded blessed event said baker another kid said the psychologist one of the women jack wondered about she lives here yes sir but for now were asking you to respect confidentiality even though dead people dont get any of course boy or girl boy they showed him tristans picture he said oh man he looks just like a young jack he writes songs said lamar or thinks he does delaware said meaning a reunion could have involved an audition maybe not a happy one baker removed a folded photocopy of the song from his pad delaware read the lyrics i see what you mean you found this on jacks person in his room how would jack react to something like this delaware thought hard to say i guess it would depend on his state of mind what do you mean like i told you jack could be moody youre not the only person to tell us that baker answered he might even have had a borderline mood disorder he could shift from amiable to downright vicious pretty quickly i only saw his angry side a couple of times in therapy and it wasnt severe flashes of irritation mostly at the beginning when he was ambivalent when i probed too deeply as i told you the first time he was mostly amiable when he decided he really needed you to get on that plane with him he behaved himself could be said delaware so he never got violent with you no nothing like that my hope was that if jack stuck around long enough to see concrete results once he was able to imagine himself nearing an airport without getting sick to his stomach hed level out emotionally and thats exactly what happened except for that night he called me what i mostly saw was the charming side but that other side didnt disappear said lamar he just held himself in check its possible so someone catches him in the wrong mood shows him crappy music he couldve turned nasty delaware nodded baker said do that with a kid a kid you never acknowledged and just met and things could turn downright ugly delaware looked at tristans photo hes your primary suspect hes looking good for it but weve got no evidence lamar smiled just psychology baker said first we have to find him so wed better be doing our job thanks for doing yours doc you can head home now we need you well phone you delaware handed the photo back hope its not him why its tough when theyre young back in the car lamar said smart guy baker said thats what the la loo said whatd you think about his theory im getting that warm fuzzy feeling like when everything starts fitting together lets find the kid thats the plan they cruised up and down sixteenth then tried the neighboring streets searching for the green beetle or a big hulking hippietype with long hair and beard or maybe tristan poulson had switched back to the cleancut version a couple of prospects turned out to be gardenvariety homeless dudes one of them panhandled and lamar handed him a buck father teresa said baker got to give to get back where now drive a canvass of the city core turned up nothing baker said these are rich people they lie with more style meaning he could be in kentucky no matter what the maid said or in that guest house the bug stashed in the garage did you notice theyve got five of em garages didnt said lamar one thing for sure his mama lied that big speech about how far away he was in brown how much she missed him that was just one big misdirectsame thing as taking his pictures off the mantel before we showed up the mantel said baker couldve been something else maybe there never were any pictures of him up there why not there were only two with the husband and both were him and her and shes in front the rest were all her by herself lots of those freakishly selfcentered said lamar just like sheralyn said think about it stretch her kid drops out of school changes his appearance gets depressed now hes in bigtime trouble as a murder suspect what does she do packs out for horsey land unless she took him with her either way weve got no grounds for warrants and are wading through a swamp of lies okeechobee okefenokee everglade of lies el bee what do you think the real reason was for her meeting with jack maybe warning him away from the kid like dont be a bad influence said lamar or it was just what she said jack got in touch with his inner parent wanted to see his kid and the kids mommy too some sort of family reunion but she wasnt going for it either way if jack didnt cooperate shed have reason to be upset true but greta barline didnt see any animosity and cathy wants us to think shes clean because she drove off even if thats true what stopped her from circling around following jack as he strolled in the dark cutting his throat said baker you think a nice wellbred rich lady would stoop to that smiling bitterly more likely it was the kid el bee big enough to get the job done we were figuring someone shorter than jack lamar didnt answer baker rubbed his head swamp of lies dont let your feelings get all hurt occupational hazard you heard the man even shrinks have em baker looked at his watch close to one am and they were nowhere nothing nohow he phoned headquarters and made sure the alert on tristan and his car was still in place clicking off he said whats the chance belle meades going to help us with surveillance on the house heck said lamar whats the chance we do it ourselves theyre not going to ticket us for trespassing waking up lieutenant jones at one fortytwo am wasnt a snap decision neither was calling her direct without going through fondebernardi they took a twoman vote i say do it said lamar why have two people pissed off at us baker said unanimous and made the call a brief one she was cool stretch didnt even sound like shed been sleeping shes gonna call the belle meade chief maybe hes a night owl too moments later jones phoned back the chief bobby joe fortune promised to send a uniform by the poulson house at regular intervals first thing in the morning hell also notify his departments single criminal investigator guy named wes sims once worked as a nashville detective i know wes a good smart man lamar and baker were to avoid surveillance themselves oh man said lamar bobby joe made a good point said shirley jones quiet street like that youre going to stick out an officer passing at regular intervals wont said baker the lieutenant said its something they do anyway meaning theyre not doing anything extra for us baker said jones we live on earth not mars now why dont you tell me why youre so hot on this rich boy he complied when he finished the lieutenant said im with you good work ill make sure the uniforms really chase our streets for him now lets all get some sleep be fresh as daisies for another day of public service sleep was brief at four am a call from headquarters informed baker that tristan poulson had been spotted by a local squad car and taken to headquarters for questioning nashville pd we got lucky sir tristan had been walking along the river unarmed no resistance the vw was parked behind a warehouse no real intent to conceal baker roused lamar and the two of them drove to work waited in an interview room for their suspect to arrive tristan was led in uncuffed by a female officer no reason to restrain him he hadnt been arrested and had shown no signs of violence lamar thought lucky break his mama being out of town no lawyer called in and with the kid nineteen no legal obligation to call her the belle meade connection will probably end up complicating matters but lets just see what shakes out tristan was neither cleancut or shaggy hippie his fair hair was long but washed and combed his beard trimmed to a neat goatee he wore a black nike tshirt baggy blue jeans white running shoes there was a small gold knob in one ear his nails were clean nicelooking kid glowing tan all that beef looked to be solid muscle more buff than any pictures lamar had seen of jack jeffries but the resemblance to jack was striking the boy refused to make eye contact despite the hard body and the good grooming the detectives could see the depression sheralyn carlson had talked about stoop in the walk shuffle in his gait staring at the floor arms swinging limply as if their being attached to his body didnt matter he sat down and slumped studying the floor tiles clean tiles they smelled of lysol one thing you could say about the murder squad the maintenance crew was firstrate lamar said hi tristan im detective van gundy and this is detective southerby tristan slid down lower baker said we know its rough son something plinked onto the tiles a tear then another the kid made no effort to stop or even wipe his face they let him cry for a while tristan never made a move or a sound just sat there like a leaky robot lamar tried again real tough times tristan the boy sat up a bit breathed in deeply and let out the air and made abrupt eye contact with lamar is your father alive sir that threw lamar thank god he is tristan wondering for a split second what baker would have said if hed been the one asked then getting back in detective mode and hoping his answer and a subsequent smile would spur some resentment jealousy whatever make the boy blurt it all out and theyd be finished when tristans attention returned to the floor lamar said my dads a great guy real healthy for his age tristan looked up again smiled faintly as if hed just received good news im happy for you sir my dads dead and im still trying to figure that out he loved my music we were going to collaborate were talking about jack jeffries asking one of those obvious questions you had to ask in order to keep a clear chain of information jack was my true father said tristan biologically and spiritually i loved lloyd too until a few years ago i thought he was my true father even when i learned that wasnt true i never said anything to lloyd because lloyd was a good man and hed always been good to me howd you find out tristan patted his chest i guess i always knew in my heart the way mom always talked about jack more than it just being the good old days and how she never did it around dad lloyd then when i got bigger seeing jacks pictures friends would show them to me everyone kept saying it saying what we were clones not that popular opinion means anything sometimes just the opposite i didnt really want to believe it lloyd was good to me but the evidence was too strong said lamar tristan nodded also itverified stuff id always felt another pat deep inside lloyd was a good man but no buts he was a good good man he died too youve had a lot of loss son said baker its like everything exploded inward said tristan i guess thats imploded implosion enunciating the word as if performing at a spelling bee implosion said baker it was like everything tristan looked up again looked at both detectives thats why i considered it considered what son jumping in into the cumberland another weak smile like that old folk song which one goodnight irene great song leadbelly said baker and lamar almost got a stiff neck from not swiveling toward his partner the boy didnt answer baker said yeah thats a great old song the way that lyric just hits you like its not really part of the rest of the song then boom silence baker said sometimes i have a great notion to jump in the river and drown ol leadbelly killed a man spent time in prison thats where he wrote it and midnight special you like the old ones son i like everything good makes sense said baker so there you were imploding i got to tell you things go a certain way its easy to see how someone could feel that way just take a few steps tristan didnt react baker said guilt can make a person feel that way tristan retorted or just plain life going to shit he dropped his head pressed his cheeks with his palms baker said son youre obviously a smart guy so i wont insult your intelligence by spinning a lot of theories but the fact is confession can be good for the soul i know said tristan thats why i told you told us what i was thinking of doing it the river did mom send you all the way from kentucky send us for what to stop me baker rubbed his bare head youre thinking we picked you up for attempted suicide mom said if i ever did it again shed have me arrested again said lamar i tried twice before said tristan not the river pills her prozac im not sure it was really seriousthe first time it was probably one of thosea cry for help to use a cliché your mamas pills she had her purse open i needed some cash and shes cool with me just taking whatever money i needed she left the pills in a vial on top of her wallet i was just hungry for sleep you know when was this son you keep calling me son the boy smiled nashville pds babysitting me amazing what money can buy you think were doing this for your mama said lamar tristan smirked and now they could see the spoiled rich kid in him everyone knows the eleventh commandment whats that money talks bullshit walks tristan said baker let me give you some education we are not here to babysit you or to prevent you from doing whatever you want to do to yourself though we think that would be pretty stupid jumping into those muddy waters we have not talked to your mama since we interviewed her yesterday at your house and she led us to believe you were in rhode island tristan stared at him then what you are being questioned regarding the murder of jack jeffries tristan gaped sat up straight you think oh man thats ridiculous that is so psychotic ridiculous whys that i loved jack your new dad my always dad we were said tristan he shook his head clean blond hair billowed fell back into place you were what reuniting i mean he felt it and i was starting to feel it the bond but we both knew it takes time thats why he came to nashville to bond to meet me first time said lamar nod you get together not yet so whend you give him your song music city breakdown i mailed it to him five oh two beverly crest ridge beverly hills how long ago a month i mailed him a bunch of lyrics before that did you exchange letters we emailed weve been doing it for six months you can check my computer ive saved everything between us whyd you send him breakdown using snail mail i wanted him to have somethingsomething he could touch it was part of a whole notebook i sent him all my lyrics jack liked four of them the rest he said were too shapeless that was the way he put it but those four had potential to be songs if they grew up he said hed help me grow them up he said we should concentrate on breakdown because even though it needed work it was the best then if iti was thinking about moving to la maybe getting into a creative writing program at ucla or something you and jack making plans long silence then tristan shook his head jack didnt know about that we were concentrating on breakdown to grow it up we were supposed to do it before the concert he was playing a concert at the songbird if it came together he was going to sing it and then call me up on stage and introduce me as the writer and maybe more his son slow tortured nod now she ruined it who said baker silence no theories son no offense said the boy but that makes me feel worse not better sir hearing you call me son apologies said baker who ruined things for you no answer baker said she as in mom you think she killed jack i dont see her actually stabbing someone too messy what then shed hire someone maybe some lexington bad dude shes got all sorts of people working on the farm i hate that place dont like horses dont like horseshit and all the racism thats part of the whole scene some lexington bad dude said baker what reason would your mama have to kill jack to prevent me from entering his world thats what she called it his world like it was some hades thing some netherhell of deep dark iniquity all those years shes been bragging about knowing jack how she used to hang with all those rock stars not in front of lloyd though sometimes if she was drinking did it bother him hed smile and go back to his paper easygoing sort said lamar that said tristan and he had all his girlfriends his smile was weary it was what you might call a free environment sir until i wanted to invent my own brand of freedom mom wasnt pleased the music scene said lamar she calls it the lowest of the low lamar quelled another urge to look at baker you really think shed murder a man to stop him from being a bad influence on you she went to warn him off said tristan when the night he flew into nashville at least thats what she told me she was going to do drove straight to where i was supposed to meet him told me to forget about going there you stay away unless you want an ugly scene youll never forget go where the place jack was gonna be someplace on first where theres no other clubs the t house yes sir you were supposed to meet up with jack there yes sir he called me that night said he was going there i should bring the extra verses i was working on for breakdown and he was going to check them out then i was going to drive him back to the hotel and we were going to pull an allnighter so the song would be in shape to sing at the concert but mom warned you off and you didnt go i called jack and asked what to do about it he told me to be cool hed calm her down and we would meet up howd you feel about all that angry as hell but jack promised me wed get together with enough time before the concert the concert was important he was going to bring me up on stage whered you go instead of to the t house nowhere said the boy i stayed home and worked on breakdown i fell asleep maybe at three four i dont know it was at my desk then i got up and worked some more check my computer logs when i write something i record the time why to preserve it preserve everything about the process you can have my computer if you want to prove it its on the backseat of my car you seem real anxious for us to get hold of your computer anything about me is going to be on my hard drive lamar said we find your computer was used at a certain time doesnt tell us who used it the boy scowled well it was me ask amelia our maid i was in all night and never left howd you end up at the river i went there after i found out what happened tristans eyelids swelled as if allergic to remembering it was like a big hand entered here and ripped me knuckling his solar plexus what time seven nine in the afternoon i dont know i just drove like i was in a dream where up and down the highway all over which highway the iforty anyone see you no it was just trees i drove to the old prison down west where they film movies there were these with the whitestriped blue pants i guess theyre minimumsecurity prisoners theyre always walking around cleaning up sounds like you go there a lot its quiet said tristan helps me think i was there that morning parked on top of the hill and looked down at all those dirty gray walls and one of them saw me he had a rake was raking leaves he saw me and waved i waved back i sat there a little more drove back to the city parked near the river sat in an empty building andthats what i was doing when the cops found me thinking about killing yourself i probably wouldnt do it probably it would be selfish right like her your mama she hated jack said the boy told me so when she was screaming no way i was going to meet him shed make a scene whyd she hate him for leaving her in the first place then for coming back when she didnt want him to she was married to lloyd when she conceived you but things werent going so well said the boy least thats what she told me she was bored and thinking of leaving lloyd my mom used to be jacks main groupie she made like it was more but thats what it sounded like to me then he dumped her and they didnt see each other for a long time then she was visiting a friend in la looked him up they hooked up for a couple of days after she found out she was pregnant she called him about it but he didnt answer so she went back to lloyd and forgot about jack and now he was coming back said baker and being a bad influence on you you really think shed have killed him over that you dont know her sir she sets her mind to something shes not going to be convinced otherwise shes got all sorts of people working the farm lots of trash some animation had spread across tristans face you dont believe me because shes rich and cultured well said baker if we had some evidence if she didnt do it who did baker sat back placed his hands behind his head as a matter of fact son weve been thinking about you the boy shot to his feet big boy all those muscles his jaw was tight and his hands were clenched i told you thats fucking insane meeting jack was the coolest thing in my life i was going to go to la your plan not his he wouldve been into it the detectives remained in their seats tristan glared down at them lamar said sit back down son stop calling me that lamar rose to his full height tristan was unused to looking up at anyone he flinched please sit down tristan the boy obeyed im really a suspect youre what we call a person of interest thats crazy fucking crazy why would i kill someone i loved baker said maybe he changed his mind about singing your song he didnt said tristan but even if he did thats no reason to kill someone people get killed for all sorts of reasons not by sane people anyway it never happened he loved my songs read my emails everythings positive everythings cool my laptops in the back of my car its out of power but you can recharge it my passwords ddpoet short for dead poet well do that said baker but no matter what your email says it doesnt mean that jack didnt change his mind and decide not to sing your song lamar said people change their mind all the time and jack was real moody he wasnt moody with me said tristan i was important to him not like the others what others all those loser trailer trash women claiming they had his kids sending him pictures of their loser kids and stuff songs cds he never listened to i was the only one he was sure of because he liked my songs and because he remembered the exact day it happened the day you were conceived baker asked he told you about it lamar questioned its in one of the emails if you ever get around to reading the computer he even forwarded an email she wrote him five years ago when he was thinking of coming out to see me she told him that she didnt want to risk losing lloyd and that i would never accept him because i was close to lloyd that unless he wanted to destroy her and me and everything shed built with lloyd he needed to stay away and he agreed for my sake its all in there and he saved it for years lamar said mom didnt want to risk losing lloyd the kid smirked again didnt want to risk what lloyd gave her eleventh commandment jack had money too said baker not as much as lloyd money has always been her first and only love you have strong feelings about your mama i love her said tristan but i know what she is you need to talk to her ill give you her number in kentucky i know shes there even though she didnt tell me she was headed there how would you know she always goes to the horses when shes disgusted with me horses dont talk back and if you put the time into them you can eventually break em they retrieved an ibm thinkpad from the backseat of the vw booted it up spent an hour with tristans old mail and sent mail a tech ran a basic scan of the boys internet history weird said the tech what is just music stuff downloads articles tons of it no porn at all this must be the first teenage boy in the history of the cyberage who doesnt use his laptop as a strokebook lamar snickered we know what you do at night wally it keeps me busy and i dont have to brush my teeth beforehand the mail between jack jeffries and tristan backed up the boys story there was at least a half year of correspondence transitioning from initial reserve on both their parts to amiability to warmth to professions of fatherson love nothing smarmy or sexual the letters couldve been howtocommunicate instructional tools from dr phil or one of those other preachers with doctorates jack jeffries praised some of his sons lyrics but he never gushed criticism of weaker songs was tactful but frank and tristan reacted to every received comment with lamblike gratitude no indication jack had ever changed his mind about music city breakdown they spent another hour phoning the new hitech penitentiary and finding out the names of the trustees who tended the old prison grounds two of the inmates remembered seeing the green vw atop the hill just before water break and one recalled waving to a distant figure standing near the car none of which provided an airtight alibi the murder had taken place before that when tristan poulson claimed to be working on his song and sleeping and surfing the internet no doubt amelia the maid would back him up even without backup the detectives were starting to doubt tristan as a prime suspect the boy had plenty of time to develop a real alibi but hadnt bothered there had been an openness to tristans manner despite all hed gone through if either man had been able to admit it they would have called it touching and as far as the detective could tell the boy hadnt lied as opposed to his mother baker and lamar agreed that tristans theory about her was intriguing repeated calls to al sus jahara arabian farms were met by a recorded message so brief it bordered on unfriendly lamar googled the place it had a thousand acres of rolling hills and big trees and gorgeous horses champion bloodlines big antebellum mansion paddocks stables stud service cryogenic semen storage the works a place that hoohah one would think thered be a person at the other end not voice mail unless someone was in hiding by days end and after reviewing the situation with fondebernardi and jones they decided cathy poulson had grown to the status of serious suspect but they had no easy way to get evidence on her before they went about digging around in belle meade social circles they decided to recontact an eyewitness of sorts someone whod seen cathy and jack shortly before jacks throat got cut the happy night motel looked no better than it had in its bordello days gray texturecoat stucco had flaked leaving chickenwire lesions the green wood trim was bilious a couple of big rigs were parked in the cracked asphalt motor court one filthy pickup and a primerpatched celica made up the rest of the vehicular mix the night clerk was an old crushedfaced guy named gary beame flyaway white hair greasestained shirt illfitting dentures rheumy eyes that jumped all over the place maybe a barely reformed homeless guy the owners had hired on the cheap he made the detectives right away rasped through cigarette smoke evening officers we dont hire out to whores mr bikrams a clean businessman it sounded like a rehearsed little speech congratulations said baker which room is greta barlines beames face darkened he yanked out his cigarette scattering ash on the star magazine spread atop the counter that little i knew she was gonna get mr bikram in trouble scratching the corner of his collapsed mouth he peered at something flicked it away all that dirty whorin and then she stiffs mr bikram for a weeks worth lamar said she was hooking out of here not like youre thinking said beame not waltzing out to the street in them halters and hotpants like the good old days i wouldnt know about that beame lied so what shed just be here and theyd show up who johns i never saw no one sneak in said beame warming to his falsehood sonata not on any regular schedule anyway im all alone here caint be bothering to watch all the comings and goings then how do you know she was hooking beame puffed manically working his jaws while constructing his answer only way i found out was we had a family staying in the room next door tourists from missouri or someplace mother calls me up complaining about three different guys in one night the noise was coming through the wall bad enough they had to hear it but they had kids whatd you do about it said lamar what could i do said beame my responsibilitys up here what i done is phone mr bikram they tell me hes back home visiting thats calcutta india mrs bikram says when he comes back in three days hell deal with it next time i see barline coming in i try talkin to her the little whore has the nerve to ignore me when mr bikram comes home i tell him what happens and he marches straight over there but shes gone with all her stuff then we found out she passed a bogus money order the little whore still owes a week you find her you tell me or you can call mr bikram direct heres his card your housekeeping staff never informed you about the prostitution what staff said beame we got a couple mexicans come during the day they dont even speak no english they asked to see greta barlines room beame said sorry cant do i gotta a couple of people in there more respectable tourists said baker no answer maybe onehour tourists said lamar hey said beame they pay i dont ask they might even be married you find that little whore you call mr bikram any idea where we can find her beame finally gave some serious thought to a question well mebbe one thing i saw her go off with a guy once this wasnt no trucker suit and tie drove a lexus silver it had a white coat hanging in the back like a doctor out in the motel parking lot they thumbed through their notes for the name of the dentist who owned the t house here we go said lamar dr mcafee lives in brentwood baker said if she was telling the truth about that about anything hooks passes bad paper real sweet kid lamar looked up maybe theres something to the churchgoing lifestyle at the very least you know where the kids are on wednesday and sunday baker rubbed his head lets talk to the good doctor and find out what other games gret likes to play motor vehicle records placed dr donald j mcafees house six blocks away from the drs carlsons white contempo must be a medico thing said baker as they headed there the house was a shingletopped ranch with an oddly sloping roofline that suggested pagoda a little stone fountain in front and a patch of mondo grass said someone loved the whole asian thing two vehicles were registered to mcafee a silver lexus sedan and a black lexus rx neither was in sight but a tenyearold red mustang sat in the driveway it was dented and sagging rust on the bumpers a cracked rear side window texas plates lamar said so much for gret not having any car why lie to make yourself poorer than you are tugging at our heartstrings said baker for what reason the little gal thinks she can sing maybe shes into acting too not much light over the red door they knocked a gonglike chime sounded and greta barlines voiced trilled one second when the door swung open she was standing there with her blond hair all long and combed out wearing a tiny little lace apron spike heels and nothing else flour whisk in one hand roundtipped frosting knife in the other few people look better naked than clothed this girl was the exception every visible inch of her was smooth and golden and nubile and voluptuous and all sorts of other good adjectives shed come to the door licking her lips and grinning but that died fast baker said sorry to interrupt the production gret the girls eyes widened and then darn if her little pink nipples didnt get hard and all puckery around the rosellas or whatever you called them lamar said dressed for business hed never admit it but hed been distracted by those nipples when she went after him with the frosting knife they subdued her but it took surprising effort even cuffed and facedown on a red silk asian print sofa she kept up the kicking and screaming lot of nonsense about rape the interior of the house looked like someone had raided every tourist trap in bangkok lamar found greta barlines clothing in the master bedroom a wide shagcarpeted space dominated by a huge plaster buddha spraypainted gold in a teak dresser one drawer was reserved for bikinis thongs and crotchless panties a section of the walkin closet held negligees wifebeaters and tshirts and three pairs of size diesel jeans tons of makeup and other female products in the bathroom shed made a real mess of the place leaving wet towels on the floor along with crumpledup national enquirers living here on and off when she wasnt bedding johns and belting out karaoke lamar selected the most modest clothes he could find a yellow tee along with a pair of jeans and brought them back to the living room maybe calling for a female officer wouldve been the smart thing but they didnt want to wait around with this foulmouthed naked girl screaming rape the detectives managed to wrestle her into the duds but it made them sweat then lamar remembered no underwear like shed care they sat her up and had just gotten her something to drink when a big florid middleaged guy wearing a domino pizza delivery uniform showed up the duds were a size too small and downright stupidlooking on a paunchy grayhaired idiot with steelrimmed eyeglasses trembling hands clutched a pizza box dr mcafee the dentists eyes got wild as if he were contemplating escape baker said bad idea sit over there he took the box and inspected it finding a packet of ribbed condoms an aerosol can of whipped cream and some creepylooking big old plastic beads on a string talk about nutrition said lamar the dentist clutched his chest and when that didnt work flashed a nice set of white teeth and looked over at greta dont know her just met her officers she insisted on coming over it was just going to be some oldfashioned fun in the privacy of my own domicile fuck you screamed the girl you said i was the best mcafees look was ripe with pity greta barline squinted ill kill you you bastard ill cut you like i cut him mcafee blanched guess id better be more careful who i allow to pick me up baker and lamar hauled the girl out of there when they reached the door mcafee was still standing there in his ludicrous delivery duds may i change baker said you better he deserved it same interview room same chairs a different kid lamar said he deserved it because he wouldnt stand up said gret barline for what his responsibilities to who all that sperm he shot around like it was drain water the cuffs had been removed from the girls slender wrists the heavy theatrical makeup shed worn for her roleplay with the dentist glowed salmonorange in the bright light a fertile guy said baker he and lamar were proceeding cautiously the girl had made what could be construed as a spontaneous confession during her tirade against mcafee if one construed him to mean jack but who knew what a judge would make of that they hadnt mirandized greta barline out of fear that she would lawyer up and because they had no grounds just the certainty that came from years of dealing with the messes that people made of their godgiven lives baker sensed the girl was a sociopath but he wasnt totally without sympathy in the end human beings were frail beings now she said fertile turtle and laughed at her own wit her brown eyes were hot and a little scary maybe to the point of craziness when they traced her ncic records they found out she was twentyeight not the twenty twentyone theyd assumed pushing thirty and old beyond even those years tenyear history of bad checks trespassing soliciting forgery petty larceny shed served maybe a total of half a year all of it in county lockups there were muscles in those smooth little arms a butterfly tattoo in the small of her back lamar remembered how much effort it had taken for both of them to restrain her when they booked her she came in at a hundred and eight fully clothed he said so what was he supposed to stand up for not what freakaleak who she said he was supposed to stand up for me his flesh and blood you know for a fact that youre kin my mama told me and she dont lie about things like that when did she tell you as long as i can remember i never had a livein dad just foster assholes and assholes whod come in and out to see mama another laugh plenty of inandout mama was always talking about him jack this jack that wicked smile jack had a nice little beanstalk on him howd she meet him he and denny and mark did a concert in san antone talking about the other two members of the trio like they were favorite uncles and said baker and she had a friend who was working security and he got her a backstage pass and she got to meet all of them they all liked her but jack liked her the most she used to be real sexy before she put on a hundred extra pounds pantomiming a watermelon paunch and sticking her tongue out in disgust so jack and your mama started hanging out said lamar they fucked all night is what they did said gret and the result is moi she pointed to her chest nipples poking through the yellow tee darn he shouldve thought of a bra lamar said youve known your whole life i followed his career when id see a computer like in an internet café id google him there wasnt much happening in the lastten years but i still did it trying to figure out if i should try try what try to meet him maybe hed see me and nervous laugh people meet me they like me i can see that she batted her lashes arched her back lamar said so you finally decided to i moved to nashville about six months ago for my singing career you know so it seemed like fate when i found out he was coming here were you living in the happy night right from the beginning a couple other places before that happy night was the best of em then you got yourself a job at the t house yeah howd that happen gret drank from the starbucks theyd brought her and rattled off the chronology the horndog dentist had been one of many whod showed up at the motel since he was richer she extended herself to him and his little stage productions being longdivorced with no one else in the house mcafee decided to move the show to brentwood for occasional fantasy games when the tourist family complained she figured it was time to relocate permanently when did you find out he owned a club soon after she said i saw the bill for the karaoke machine he told me what it was for i said thats bogus cheap shit you should get a band he said no way im losing money as is then you started working at the t it was the perfect match she said i got my stage and he got me i need to sing creative drive said lamar the term puzzled the girl but she smiled and nodded he said so when did you intend to meet up with mr jeffries mister jeffries she said shaking her hair and taking a long time to fluff the yellow strands he dont deserve the title hes a dog just like mama said whyd she say that he left her knocked up and never returned her letters why didnt she file a paternity suit she tried got a stupid san antone lawyer he wrote a letter and got a call from a bigtime beverly hills lawyer who told her the choice was take some cash now and shut your face forever or go to court and go broke because they had the money to drag it out for years she took the money your mama told you all this said baker all the time said gret all the all the all the time it was like her favorite bedtime story when you were a kid even after what im saying is she told it so many times it put her to sleep laughing she snores like a pig what happened to the money lamar asked well lets see hmm oh yeah she drank away half of it the leftoveruh lets see oh yeah she smoked that away i figure there had to be more where that came from im owed so howd you know where to find jack jeffries a week before he was supposed to come i called the hotel and said i had a flower delivery for when he arrived they told me when to deliver howd you know which hotel i tried them and the loews vanderbilt where else is he gonna stay baker said did you try to see him personally gret grinned i didnt just try i saw him how went there got all dressed up pretty and waited in the lobby i had an iced teapaid ten bucks out of my own pocket to drink and sit there and watch rich folk finally he came out then he remembered something and started walking back to the elevators i rode up with him pushed a button on the same floor and pretended to be staying there we had a nice conversation about what first she said i sweettalked himthings like i recognized you right away you look just like you do on the cds which is bogus bullshit he put on like a hundred pounds and hes old but he liked hearing those lies everyone has their own favorite lies thats when i told him i was going to the songbird concertsinging backup for johnny blackthorn he said no kidding johnnys an old bud and we started talking music i know all about music its my life all this is in the hall lamar asked at his door i knew i could have gotten inside but i didnt want to hed try to fuck me and that would be gross gross because hes your father that for sure but also he was gross she stuck her tongue out so howd you get him over to the t house i told him id be singing and also helping out with the serving cause my daddy owned the place i told him he should stop by hear some good music if he wasnt too tired then i told him i was thinking about giving up music because the lifestyle was tough i told him i got into vanderbilt dental school maybe id do that why dental school cause it sounded educated jack was impressed and said that sounded cool then he said but if you really love to sing dont give up your dream you were getting him on your side said baker i wanted him to hear me sing cause im worth listening to gret said but i knew i had to be casual thats the way you got to do it with them them being men theyre like fish you cast the line wiggle the bait a little move it around real casual i figured hed show up and he did what time toward the end of my last set a quarter to quarter to midnight yeah shed told them around eleven fifteen eleven thirty the first time lying for the sake of it what happened then i greeted him like a longlost friend and sat him right in front i even gave him free tea and yellowraisin scones then i sang did a kt oslin and a rosanne cash finished with piece of my heart the janis way not what faith hill did to it he was listening then her blue eyes clouded over he just up and left i gave the bastard free tea and he didnt even have the courtesy to say goodbye just like he did to mama lamar thought so you went to the door and saw the rich bitch with the red mercedes my cars red too its my favorite color i could never get it to shine like that tossing her hair they talked like they knew each other didnt look so friendly then she drove away and he started walking reaching for her coffee she sipped um this is good and creamy thank you sirs baker said then what pardon what happened next nothing gret said lamar we found that knife in your purse it matches perfectly to the wound on jacks neck we also got your fingerprints on his clothes and his neck blatant lies they were days from processing all the evidence silence baker said i reckon you carry that knife because johns can get rough right right we can understand that lamar added a girl needs to take care of herself right so why dont you tell us exactly what happened between you and jack jeffries hmm she said finishing her coffee can i have another creamy latte theyre so expensive i cant afford to buy more than one a week they got her the coffee and a croissant she finished both and asked to go to the bathroom sure said lamar but first ive got to bring a senior csi technologist in to scrape under your fingernails why said gret to match it to jacks skin i washed my hands she said when right after i looking at the ceiling and toying with her hair and letting one hand wander to her right breast lamar said you need to finish the story gret we need to hear the whole thing i need to use the little girls room fondebernardi came in pretended to be a crime scene tech and did the scrape greta barline was accompanied by a female officer to the restroom and returned looking refreshed that was good she said focusing on lamar baker said please finish the story its not much of a story do us a favor and tell it anyway she shrugged i saw him walking and i went after himto ask him why he left without saying goodbye asshole gave me a funny look and kept goingignoring me he was all pissed offprobably because of that woman aint my fault but he took it out on me you know a whole different jack from the jack in the elevator i kept walking with him it was real dark but i could see the hostility in hismanner the way he had his arms folded in front of him looking straight ahead like i didnt exist that made me super pissed off because he wouldnt talk because he was being rude being rich doesnt give you any right to be rude uhuh no sirree mr jeffries the world dont work like that her second delusion the first was thinking she could sing baker said it sure isnt fair she looked at lamar he said downright rude i mean who is he thinking he is a big fat ugly gross disgusting person who used to be famous but now no one gives a shit about him whos he to go all silent and pissed and leave without saying goodbye still i minded my manners i said whats wrong did the tea taste bad lamar said he was being rude but you held on to your dignity exactly dignitys what its all about everyone deserves a little dignity right darn right baker said so then what happened he just kept ignoring me and i just kept walking alongside him we keep walking and walking and walking and then he stops again and makes a sharp turnlike thats gonna confuse me she let out a laugh except now he has no idea where hes going and he ends up in this empty lot i stick right with him he turns around not looking where hes going and his foot hits a wall he starts cussing and swearing and thenand then he starts screaming at me that i should stop stalking him can you believe that the detectives shook their heads she touched her hair licked a finger and ran it over her eyelids he sounded crazy i was scared i tell you detectives that old boy was on drugs or something did you try to leave too scared gret made her eyes go wide its all dark and hes going crazy on me he starts calling me horrible names a lyin notalent little bitch if you must know she sniffed grimaced and rubbed her eyes trying to dredge up some tears the floor had been dried since tristan poulsons sobfest it stayed that way it was horrible she said no one ever ever ever talked to me like that thats what i said to him trying to stop him from being so rude then i looked him straight up in the eye and said shut your mouth for a second and hear the truth im your daughter and you know what i dont even care about that it means nothing to me and you know what else im lucky you werent never in my life you dont deserve to ever be in my life you sorryass hasbeen motherfucker the room fell silent you told him off good lamar said wait wait it gets better then he gets this wild look this really wild crazy look gets in his eyes and he says youre lying its just another lie you been a lying little bitch since the moment i laid eyes on you and i say im the daughter of ernestine barline you knew her as kiki remember that night you fucked her all night the result is me she stopped panting sucking in breath finally the tears camea constricted trickle that ended with a gasp lamar said what did jack say to that his voice got real quiet and he gave me this look not the wildeyed one but a different one scarier cold real real cold like i was nothingbutdirt he smiled but not a nice smile an ugly smile then he said i dont remember her and i dont give a shit about you and even if i did fuck her no way you were the result know how i know she gasped covered her eyes lamar thought of patting her shoulder but hesitated baker reached over and did it for the both of them i didnt answer him she said but he told me anyway she shivered neither detective spoke grets hand dropped from her face for a second she looked young untouched vulnerable then the brown eyes sparked with fury the bastard touched me here gret fingered the bottom of her chin chucked it you know like i was some baby some stupid little baby thing another shiver if she was faking her emotion she was oscarquality then he said i know you didnt come from me because you got no talent you sing like shit and id rather listen to nails on a chalkboard than to hear you screech like a crow i knew janis and shes the lucky one being dead so she didnt have to be subjected to that sorryass ultrafuckedup abortion you did of her classic girl your voice should never be used except for talking and not much of that either she took awhile to catch her breath stared at both detectives as if shed seen the afterlife and it wasnt pretty oh man thats cold said lamar baker said god what a bastard sounding as if he meant it greta barline said hes saying those thingsthose horrible thingscutting mecutting my singingcutting my lifei cant even speak its like im bleeding inside she gnashed her teeth clawed her hands then he starts pushing at me pushing like to get away honestly i dont know what happened he was so big and im so little and hes pushing at me pushing at me i was so scared i dont know how the knife got into my hand i promise all i remember is him holding his neck and looking at me and making this gurgly noise then he fell down and made this thud noise and then he gurgled some more a strange distant smile skittered across her lips im just standing there and im thinking about that gurgly noise and i say out loud you dont sound so good yourself jack jeffries after that he got quiet the room felt as if all the air had been sucked out of it lamar waited for baker to speak but el bee had a funny look on his face kind of glassyeyed lamar said thanks for telling us gret now im gonna have to read you your rights just like on tv she said then she perked up so what do you think its selfdefense right lamar got home at four thirty am sue was sleeping but she woke up brewed some decaf and sat with him while he ate cold pasta a couple of hastily fried breakfast sausages and five pieces of toast the usual caseclosed munchies another one bites the dust she said congrats honey after he told her the details sue said the girls obviously disturbed but you can see her point about what she cut the poor mans throat for insulting her singing if what she said is true he was brutal honey just dumped on her dreams of course it doesnt justify what she did but still to be rejected like that she touched his face maybe im being a bleeding heart but i guess i understand her a little if its even true said lamar she lies about everything but he knew he was denying the obvious for all greta barlines lies he was certain shed spoken the truth about that final encounter jack jeffries had paid for it now greta barline was going to ante up theyd closed the case a highprofile whodunit theyd get their names in the paper maybe even be there at the press conference he shouldve felt more satisfaction sue said howd baker react to what the way it ended he seemed okay lamar immediately regretted the lie he was always honest with sue no reason to change that now actually he didnt react at all hon once she signed the confession and he made sure the tape had recorded he just left fondie called jones and jones called in to congratulate us and baker wasnt there to hear it maybe hes got a point lamar about what the business all those dreams a thousand people come to town nine hundred ninetynine get stepped on and shattered and the one who gets a chance doesnt last long either lamar didnt answer thinking about his own arrival in nashville fifteen years ago from new haven good solid bass player he had the moves extralong nimble fingers able to span eight nine frets a darn good ear too after a couple of listens to something he could often play it back noteperfect he couldnt invent but still an ear like that counted for something everyone back home telling him he was great in nashville he was good maybe even real good meaning not even close to good enough he felt cool hands on the back of his neck sue had gotten up and was massaging him she wore that old med center k commemorative tshirt and nothing else her smellher firmness and her softness pushing against him he said lets hit the hay thanks for the grub nurse van gundy anything for you favorite patient lets hear it for marvin gaye she laughed for the thousandth time at the injoke time for sexual healing lamar wondered if he should find some phrases that werent musicconnected sue didnt seem to mind she took him by the hand and laughed again by the time they reached the bedroom they were kissing deeply baker went home to an empty silent house popped a beer and sat in the kitchen with his feet propped up on the formica dinette table fiftyyearold table everything in this place was older than he was since inheriting the house hed bought virtually nothing hanging on to all the discountoutlet crap his parents had bought when they moved in danny and dixie when he thought of them that way they were strangers when he used their real names it was different danville southerby and dorothea baker had met when he was sixteen and she was fourteen singing in the choir of the first baptist church of newport tennessee the town nestled on the edge of the great smoky mountains was rich in music and folk art and memory poor in everything else dannys father barely broke even farming tobacco and dixie s daddy didnt do much better with corn singing hymns threw the teenagers together blinding love soon followed and within two months dixie was pregnant the child a small squalling pinkfaced boy they named baker was born three weeks premature one half year after a hastily arranged church wedding dixie bled a lot and the doctor told her shed never conceive again she cried as much from relief as regret like a lot of people in the church the teens were highly musical danny had a clear tenor voice played piano and organ and guitar without ever taking a lesson dixie was on a whole other level a mandolin prodigy with an astounding vibrato and some said technique better than bill monroes top of that her soprano always nice smoothed out and stretched following the delivery of her baby maybe singing to the cranky little redfaced tot helped or it couldve been one of those strange hormonal twists either way listening to her was a privilege the young couple lived on the corn farm with her family doing scut work and sinking low emotionally in their spare time when someone else would take the baby they sat and played and sang softly so as not to share the precious thing they had with anyone else it was the only private time they had in those moments each of them wondered if life wasnt slipping away but they never shared the thought with each other one night after dixies daddy scolded danny for indolence he got up in the middle of the night woke dixie and told her to get dressed she watched him pack a bag carry it out of the house then return for his guitar and her mandolin what he shushed her with a finger she got dressed followed him out to the old dodge his daddy had given him last year but which he never got to drive being stuck on the corn farm working like a mutt they pushed the car away from the house so as not to wake anyone when he got far enough he started up and hit the road dixie said what about the baby danny said they all love him maybe even better than we do for the next two years all their families got were postcards gaudy souvenir cards from tourists spots all over the south places danny and dixie never visited because instead of seeing the sights they were doing the roadhouse circuit playing onenighters mostly the new stuff called rockabilly but also bluegrass standards and gospel hymns when the audience was open to that which was almost never making petty cash but it was more than dixie s dad had paid them for working the cornfields which was nothing because they were supposed to be content with room and board top of that they were doing what they loved and getting paid for it meeting people all kinds of people having all kinds of eyeopening experiences that no way wouldve happened back in newport christmas they sent storebought toys to baker along with sweet notes in dixie s hand the baby became a quiet determined toddler unlikely to give up whatever he was working at unless forced to when he was three his parents showed up at the corn farm wearing fancy clothes and driving a fiveyearold ford van full of instruments and music and costume changes and talking about meeting carl perkins and ralph stanley all those other famous people in our world talking about colored singers doing that rhythm and blues sometimes you could be safe in those colored clubs and it was worth listening dixie s father scowling at that spooning his soup and saying i wont hold it against you running off like that and leaving your problem with us meaning the little boy sitting right there talking about him like he didnt understand be up tomorrow at five to atone we got a whole edge of the north field to do by hand danny fingered his leather string tie with the piece of quartz up near the collar then smiled and stood and laid down a fat wad of bills on the table whats that said his fatherinlaw payment for what babysitting back rent whatever winking at his wife she hesitated avoided her familys eyes then quaking so hard she thought shed fall apart she scooped up baker and followed her husband out to the van as the ford drove off dixie s mother said figures they never took their gear out the back baker southerby grew up on the roadhouse circuit learning to read and write and do arithmetic from his mother he picked things up quickly making her job easy she hugged and kissed him a lot and he seemed to like that no one ever talked about the time that she and danny had gone and left him she told him to call her dixie because everyone did and sweetie you and me both know im your mama years later baker figured it out shed been all of seventeen wanted to see herself as that pretty girl with the lightning fingers up on stage not some housewife when he was five he asked to play her gibson f mandolin honey thats a real precious thing ill be careful dixie hesitated baker stared at her with those serious eyes she ran her hand over his blond crew cut he kept staring all right then but im sitting right next to you want me to show you some chords grave nod an hour after he started he was playing c g and f by the end of the day he was coaxing forth a respectable version of blackberry blossom not at full speed but his tone was clear his right hand nice and smooth dan come listen to this listening to him watching how careful he was dixie was comfortable letting him play the mandolin without her hovering danny came in from the porch of the motel where hed been smoking and strumming and writing songs what just listen go ahead sweetiepie little man baker played huh danny said then i got an idea they bought him his own mandolin nothing highpriced a forties a they picked up in a savannah pawnshop but it had decent tone by age six baker had a trunk full of stageduds and a thirties f almost as shiny as dixie s f and he was a fulltime headliner the new act was officially the southerby family band danny dixie and little baker the amazing smoky mountain kid mostly there wasnt room for all that on any marquee so it was just the southerbys bakers chord repertoire ran all the way down the fretboard encompassed the majors minors sevenths sixths ninths elevenths and thirteenths along with diminished augmented and a whole bunch of interesting extensions he came upon himself that could be called jazz even though the closest they got to jazz was a few texas swing songs that always ended up sounding bluegrassy by the time he was nine he played cleaner and faster than his mother and to her credit she reacted with nothing but pride homeschooling though that concept hadnt been invented continued and baker was smart enough to get a year ahead of his age group at least according to the intelligence test dixie had clipped out of parents magazine baker grew up on fast food tobacco smoke and applause nothing seemed to alter his quiet personality when he was twelve a smoothtalking man whod heard them play at a honkytonk outside of natchez told danny hed give all three of them a recording contract make them the new carter family they went into the studio laid down five old standards never heard back from the guy tried calling a few times then gave up and went back on the road when baker was twelve he announced that he wanted to go to a real school danny said just like that you give it all up baker didnt answer wish youd talk more son kind of hard to know whats going on behind those eyes i just told you giving it all up silence dixie said thats what he wants maybe its not such a bad idea danny looked over her yeah i been feeling thats coming what has itching to settle down couldve done it years ago said dixie i was waiting for what she shrugged something they moved to nashville because it was in tennessee and theoretically not a big deal to visit their families the real reason was music city danny was still a young man though sometimes he felt like hed lived three lifetimes the mirror told him he looked sharp and his pipes were good guys a lot less talented than he were making it bigtime why not give it a shot he used some of the cash hed saved from years on the road and bought a little frame house in the nations nice white neighborhood full of hardworking people dixie wanted to play house that was fine hed be over on sixteenth street baker went to junior high and met other kids he stayed quiet but managed to make a few friends and except for math where he needed some catchup classes were pretty easy dixie stayed home and played her mandolin and sang just for the sake of it baker which is music at the purest right sometimes she asked baker to jam with her mostly he did danny was out most of the time trying to scare up a career on music row he got a few gigs playing rhythm guitar at the ryman when regulars were sick did some club dates paid his own money to cut demos that never went anywhere when the money ran low he took a job teaching choir at a baptist church after a year and a half of that over dinner he announced it was time to hit the road again baker said not me danny said i didnt mean you glancing at his wife she screwed up her mouth i put on weight nothings gonna fit thats why god invented tailors said her husband or do it yourself you used to know how to sew i still do she said defensively there you go were leaving on monday today was thursday dixie said leaving for where atlanta i got us a gig opening for the culpeppers at a new bluegrass club nothing fancy all they want is sos family talk for the same old shit meaning the standards danny seeing himself as a modern man had come to despise them just like that said dixie you made all the plans dont i always you might want to get some new strings for your plinkbox i overheard you yesterday the g and d are dead what about baker he can take care of himself right son hes not even fourteen how old were you when you had him talking about him as if he wasnt there baker wiped his mouth carried his plate to the sink and began washing it so said danny dixie sighed ill try to sew it myself from then on they were gone more than they were home doing a month on the road returning for a week or ten days during which dixie doted on baker with obvious guilt and danny sat by himself and smoked and wrote songs no one else would ever hear the summer of bakers fifteenth birthday danny announced they were sending him to bible camp in memphis for six weeks time to get some faith and spirituality son by sheer coincidence danny and dixie had been booked for a sixweek gig exactly during that period aboard a cruise boat leaving from biloxi hard to get phone contact from there said dixie this way we know youll be safe during the last week of camp baker ate something off and came down with horrible food poisoning three days later the bug was gone but hed lost seven pounds and was listless the camp doctor had left early on a family emergency and the reverend hartshorne the camp director didnt want to risk any legal liability just last summer some rich girls family had sued because shed gotten a bladder infection that developed into sepsis luckily that kid had survived probably her fault in the first place she had a reputation for fooling with the boys but tell that to those fancypants lawyers hartshorne found baker in his bunk room and drew him outside call your parents son so they can pick you up then start packing cant said a wan weak baker theyre on a ship no phone contact when were they figuring on picking you up im taking the bus all the way to nashville im okay lord thought hartshorne these new families well son cant have you being here all sick got a key to your house sure i dont mind nashville ill drive you in they started out in hartshornes white sedan deville at three pm made a single stop for lunch and pulled into nashville at nine fifteen lights out in the little frame house you okay going in by yourself baker was eager to get away from hartshornes bible speeches and the odors the reverend gave off bubble gum and body odor and for some reason an overlay of wheatena cereal sure okay then walk with the lord son yessir baker got his duffel and his pillow from the back and fished out his door key the cadillac was gone before he reached the door he walked into the empty house heard something not empty a burglar laying his duffel and pillow on the floor he tiptoed into the kitchen snuck all the way back to the laundry room where danny kept his pistol ancient colt danny called it protection for the road though the only time hed had to use it was when some klantype guys loitering near their motel in pulaski made remarks about seeing them going into a nigger jukejoint one flash of the colt and the idiots dispersed remembering that now recalling the power that came from a couple pounds of honed steel baker hefted the pistol and advanced toward the noise in the back his parents bedroom some kind of commotion behind the closed door no not completely closed the thin paneled slab was cracked an inch baker nudged it with his finger got a couple more inches of view space and aimed the pistol through the opening dim light one lamp on a nightstand his mothers nightstand giving off a pinkish light because of some silky material that had been tossed over the shade his mother on the bed naked astride his father no not his father his father was off to the side on a chair and another woman blond and skinny was astride him the man under his mother heavier in the legs than his father hairier too two couples panting heaving bucking his gun arm froze he forced himself to lower it backed away took his duffel and left his pillow and walked out of the house made his way to a bus stop and rode downtown and got himself a room at a motel on fourth found the marine recruitment office the next morning lied about his age and enlisted two days later he was on a bus to camp lejeune in north carolina it took another week for a panicky dixie southerby to locate him the marines told him to come back in two years and sent him home dixie said whatd you do that for baker said i got restless can i go to military school you dont want to live at home im big enough to go away danny said thats a mature decision son its time for your mother and me to hit the road anyway military academies turned out to be too expensive but fall river bible school and seminary in arlington virginia was flexible about tuition for students with spiritual leanings baker settled in met some nice people and was starting to think he might even fit in somewhere a month into the first semester mrs calloway the head counselor called him into her office with tears in her eyes when he got here she hugged him not customary for mrs calloway not much touching went on at fall river period oh you poor boy you poor lamb baker said what it took a long time for her to tell him and when she did she looked scared as if shed be punished for doing it the van had been hit headon by a drunk on i danny and dixie returning to nashville from a gig in columbia grand opening of a car dealership twohundreddollar fee not bad when you figured it was only a onehour drive all those years on the road without a mishap fifteen minutes out of town the van was turned into scrap both of them dead on impact their stage clothes strewn all over the interstate dannys guitar had sustained irreparable damage sliding around the rear of the van its soundboard crushed its neck severed and splintered dixie s mandolin its hardshell case covered by a newer mark leaf spaceage plastic supplementary case and swathed in three packing blankets the way she always wrapped it came out unharmed baker went and retrieved the instrument from the closet same way hed done so many times before stared at it touched the taut strings the ebony bridge the motherofpearl tuners with their goldplated gears not too many fs were goldplated or triplebound this one was and everyone whod seen it opined that even though it was dated not it was from the same batch as bill monroes monroe s had gotten damaged years ago the story that circulated was some jealous husband had caught the bluegrass king in bed with his wife and taken out his anger on the instrument stupid thought baker it was people who deserved punishment not things staring at the f and realizing what hed just told himself maybe he should smash this thing what did music bring other than sin and misery that poor girl that rich boy was he any better off maybe hed call that shrink delaware ask if he had any ideas about helping tristan nah the guy was long gone back to la by now and what the hell was it his business if the boy had emotional issues that mother of his hed done his job so why was it gnawing at him like the girl like the boy like everyone else in this goddamn world they were just people with their talents and their weaknesses and their heartbreaks and their egos people if there was a god he had one hell of a sense of humor or maybe there was wisdom behind it people able to change able to better themselves even though so many failed the people he and lamar met day after day maybe there was more hands mustve been his but it felt like they were someone elses lifted the mandolin out of its case the back all shiny those silky sculptural contours where some michigan craftsman had carved and tapped and carved some more under the watchful eye of the chief acoustical engineer a genius named lloyd loar loar had signed the instrument on march anything with his name on it was worth a bundle to collectors bakers fingers grazed the strings eadg perfect tune after all these years he knew because he had perfect pitch his left hand formed a g chord he told his right hand not to move but it did a resonant sweet sound rang out bounced against cold walls devoid of art or family mementos ricocheted against discountoutlet furniture and linoleum floors ended its flight and burrowed into bakers skull his head hurt his hands moved some more and that helped a bit an hour later he was still at it
