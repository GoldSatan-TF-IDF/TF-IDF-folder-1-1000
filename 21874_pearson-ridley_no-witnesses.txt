ridley pearson no witnesses one and now for the good part this was where lou boldt threw out all convention where the textbooks took a backseat to experience and where he found out who in the lecture hall was listening and who was asleep he raised his voice boldt was a big man and his words bellowed clear back to the makeout seats without the need of the mike clipped to his tie everything ive told you in the past few weeks concerning evidence investigative procedure chain of custody and chain of command is worthless a few heads snapped upmore than he had expected worthless unless you learn to read the crime scene to know the victim to listen to and trust your own instincts to feel with your heart as much as think with your head to find a balance between the two if it was all in the head then we would not need detectives the lab technicians could do it all conversely if it was all in the heartif we could simply empathize with the suspect and say yup you did itthen who would need the lab nerds a few of the studious types busily flipped pages boldt informed them you wont find any of this in your textbooks thats just the point all the textbooks in the world are not going to clear a caseonly the investigator can evidence and information is nothing without a human being to analyze organize and interpret it thats you thats me there comes a time when all the information must be set aside there comes a time when passion and instinct take over its the stuff that cant be taught but it can be learned heart and mindones worthless without the other he paused here wondering if these peachfuzz students could see beyond the fortyfouryearold slightly paunchy homicide cop in the wrinkled khakis and the tattered sport coat that hid a pacifier in its side pocket at the same time he listened to his own words reverberating through the lecture hall wondering how much he dare tell them did he tell them about the nightmares the divorces the ulcers and the politics the hours the salary the penetrating numbness with which the veterans approached a crime scene light flooded an aisle as a door at the rear of the hall swung open and a lanky kid wearing oversize jeans and a rugby shirt hurried toward the podium casting a stretched shadow reaching boldt he passed the sergeant a pink telephone memo a sea of students looking on boldt unfolded and read it volunteer park after class ill wait fifteen minutes d m volunteer park he wondered his curiosity raised why not the offices daphne matthews was anything but dramatic as the departments forensic psychologist she was cool controlled studied patient articulate strong intelligent but not dramaticnot like this the curious faces remained fixed on him a love letter he said winning a few laughs but not many cops werent expected to be funnysomething else they would have to learn volunteer park is perched well above seattles downtown cluster of towering highrises and the graygreen curve of elliott bay that sweeps out into the islandriddled estuary of puget sound a large reservoir acting as a reflecting pond is terraced below the parking lot and lookout that fronts the museum a building under reconstruction for months on its way to housing the citys asian collection boldt parked his aging departmentissued fourdoor chevy three spaces away from the red prelude that daphne matthews maintained showroom clean she was not to be found in her car the water towers stone facade rose several stories to his left wellkept beds of flowering shrubs and perennials surrounded its footing like gems in a setting the grass was a phenomenal emerald greenunique he thought to seattle and portland maybe ireland too he had never been summer was just taking hold every living thing seemed poised for change the sky was a patch quilt of azure blue and cotton white the clouds moving in swiftly from the west low and fast a visitor might think rain but a local knew better not tonight cold maybe if it cleared he spotted an unfamiliar male face behind the iron grate of one of the towers upper viewing windows and waited a minute for this person and his companion to descend and leave the structure once they were gone he chose the stairway to his right ascending a narrow chimney of steep steps wedged between the brick rotunda to his right and the riveted steel hull of the water tank to his left the painted tank and the tower that surrounded it were enormous perhaps forty or fifty feet high and half again as wide with each step boldts heart pounded heavier he was not in the best shape or maybe it was because she had elected to step outside the system and that could not help but intrigue him or maybe it was personal and had nothing whatsoever to do with the shop he and daphne had been close oncetoo close for what was allowed of a married man they still were close but mention of that one night together never passed their lips a month earlier she had surprised him by telling him about a new relationship after bill gates owen adler was the reigning bachelor prize of the northwest having gone from espresso cart to the fastestgrowing beverage and food business in the western region he leased his own plane owned a multimilliondollar estate overlooking shilshole marina and now quite possibly owned the heart and affections of daphne matthews had her note been worded any other way had she not chosen such an isolated location boldt would have been convinced that her request was nothing more than some lover butterflies in another two hours volunteer park would be a drug and sex bazaar despite its view the tower was not a place frequented by the pinstriped set she had clearly chosen it carefully daphne was not given to acts of spontaneity she desired a clandestine meetingand he had to wonder why he reached the openair lookout at the top of the tower it had a cement floor and evenly spaced viewing windows crosshatched with heavygauge steel to prevent flyers from testing their wings or projectiles from landing on passersby daphne held her arms crossed tightly accentuating an anxiety uncommon in her her brown hair spilled over her face hiding her eyes and when she cleared it he saw fear where there was usually the spark of excitement her squareshouldered assertive posture collapsed in sagging defeat she wore the same blue slacks and cotton sweater he had seen her wearing at work she had not been to her houseboat yet what is it he asked worried by this look of hers her chin cast a shadow hiding the scar on her neck she did not answer immediately its a potential black hole she explaineda difficult if not impossible case to solve and with political overtones and then he understood she had bypassed the proper procedures to give him a chance to sidestep this investigation before he formally inherited it at the cop shop why she would have a black hole in the first place confused him the departments psychologist did not lead investigations she kept cops from swallowing barrels and profiled the loonies that kept boldt and the others chasing body bags she assisted in interrogations she could take any side of any discussion and make a convincing argument out of it she was the best listener he knew she handed him a faxthe first of what appeared to be several that she removed from a briefcase soup is mothers choicenot always she told him that was the first threat he received adler boldt said filling in the blank she nodded her hair trailing her movements daphne matthews had grace even when frightened its an ad slogan they use innocuous enough he said she handed him the next saying yes but not for long suicide or murder take your pick no cops no press no tricks or you will carry with you the lives of the innocent it could be nothing boldt said though his voice belied this thats exactly what he said she replied angrily lumping them together boldt did not want to be lumped in with owen adler ill give you one thing when you say black hole you mean black hole faxed threats he thought in the top left of the page of thermal paper he read a date and time in tiny typeface to the right page of good luck tracing this he thought she handed him a third he did not want it quite a collection he said boldts nerves unraveled from time to time and when it happened he defaulted to stupid oneliners that seldom won a laugh if adler foods is out of business within days and all of the money is gone and you are dead and buried there will be no senseless killing the choice is yours how many days has it been it was the first question that popped into his head though it was answered by the date in the corner he counted the weeks in his head the thirty days had expired you see the way he worded it looking down at her feet she spoke softly dreamy and terrified her lover was the target of these threats and despite her training she clearly was not prepared for how to handle it the more common threat would be if adler foods is not out of business within thirty days you see the difference her bailiwick not his he felt tempted to remind her is that significant he played along because she had fragile written all over her to me its significant so is the attempt in each fax to place the blame firmly with owen its his decision his choice when she looked up at him he saw that she held back tears daffy he offered stepping closer owen and i are not going to see each othersociallyfor a while me being police and all she wanted it to sound casual but failed we have to take him seriously now boldt felt a chill do we she handed him another i am waiting i suggest you do not you will have to live with your choice others will not be so lucky its the first time hes mentioned himself boldt noted she handed him the last of the group that one was sent four days ago this one arrived this morning your indecision is costly it can and will get much worse than this below this on the fax was a copy of a newspaper article todays paper she explained the headline read infections baffle doctorstwo children hospitalized he read the short article quickly the girl is improving the boy is not she told him it can and will get much worse than this she quoted he looked up this is his offer of proof is that what youre thinking he means to be taken seriously i dont get it he complained frustrated why didnt you bring this in sooner owen didnt want to believe it she took back the faxes possessively her hand trembled the second one warns against involving us she meant cops she meant that the reason for them meeting here and not in the fifthfloor offices was that she still was not sure how to handle this an adler employee boldt said past or present an employee is the most likely owen has fowler working on it she meant kenny fowler formerly of major crimes now adlers chief of security boldt liked kenny fowler and said so better yet he was good policeor had been at one time she nodded and toyed with a silver ring fashioned into a porpoise that she wore on her right hand i misjudged him she said so quietly that boldt leaned in to hear as she repeated herself daphne was not one to mumble are you okay sure she lied a black hole absorbing energy admitting no lightpure darkness he realized that he had already accepted it and he wanted to blame her for knowing him so well talk to me he said nervous and irritated youre right about it being an employee thats the highest percentage bet but typically it involves extortion not suicide demands howard taplin owens counsel wants it handled internally where theres no chance of press leakage no police involvement nothing to violate the demands this sounded a little too much like the party line and it bothered him it was not like her to voice the opinions of others as her own and he had to wonder what kind of man howard taplin was that he seemed to carry so much influence with her thats why i have to be so careful in dealing with you taplin wants fowler to handle this internally owen overruled this morning he suggested this meetingopening a dialogue but it was not an easy decision we cant be sure this newspaper story is his doing boldt told her he may have just seized upon a convenient headline maybe she clearly believed otherwise and boldt trusted daphnes instincts heart and mind he was reminded of his lecture whats fowler doing about it boldt asked he doesnt know about this meeting not yet he like taplin advised against involving us hes looking to identify a disgruntled employeebut hes been on it a month now hes had a few suspects but none of them has panned out his loyalty is to the company howard taplin writes his paychecks not owenif you follow me boldts irritation surfaced if this news story is his doing id say were a little late im to blame owen asked me for my professional opinion i classified the threats as lowrisk i thought whoever it was was blowing smoke proper use of the language the faxes are sent by portable computer from pay phones fowler traced the last two to pay phones on pill hill thats a decent enough neighborhood what that tells us is that in all probability were dealing with an educated affluent white male between the ages of twentyfive and forty the demands seemed so unrealistic that i assumed this person was venting some angernothing more owen went along with that he put kenny on it and tried to forget it i screwed this up lou she crossed her arms tightly again and her breasts rode high in the cradle again she quoted it can and will get much worse than this her voice echoed slightly in the cavernous enclosure circling inside his thoughts like horses on a carousel a black hole his now you want me to look into it ill look into it he offered reluctantly unofficially you know i cant do that daffy please im not a rentacop neither are you were fifthfloor you know the way it works please i cant do that for very long he qualified thank you if either of these kids dies daffy he left it dangling there like one of the many broken cobwebs suspended from the cement ceiling i know she avoided his gaze youll share everything with me no stonewalling agreed well maybe not everything he corrected it won a genuine smile from her and he was glad for thatthough it deserted her as quickly as it had come his frantic footfalls on the formed stairs sounded like the beating of bats wings as he descended at a run the newspaper article had listed one of the hospitals for lou boldt the victim was where every investigation began two boldt stood at the foot of the bed in the harborview medical clinics icu ward slater lowry lay unconscious the repository of a halfdozen tubes the source for the weakened signals charted on a variety of green video monitors kiros morning news had picked up the story of a mysterious infection there had been no mention of owen adler or the threatening faxes the boy was a towhead with a short turnedup nose and monkey ears he would hopefully grow into the hospital gown fit him awkwardly riding up tightly against his neck boldt glanced toward the door then to the large viewing window and found himself alone with the boy he reached out and tugged the white seam to a moonlike crescent at the boys collarbone better now despite the childs beauty he did not sleep peacefully his was a tormented unconsciousness this room was too bright too clinical for a child more an operating theater with a bed in it too many machines too much tile and stainless steela place to die rather than to recover no window to the outside nothing human about it whatsoever it had been created to be sterile and had greatly succeeded hold on boldt whispered encouragingly willing him stronger unable to fight off the thought that this might be his own son just as easily that this condition had been inflicted on him by a complete stranger so repulsed boldt that he too felt briefly nauseated and sought a chair where there was none to be found miles his twoyearold all the cliches held true the sun rose and set on the boy the light of his life and what if what then how does a parent stand idly by at a hospital bedside and watch a child shrink from this earth who deserves that a sickening energy invaded him he shuddered and pulled at the gauze mask that suffocated him there was no consideration of ducking this one black hole or not it qualified as crimes against persons and as such was to be handled by homicide it was his he owned it he wanted this case noweager like a boxer climbing into the ring pressed into the wall concentrating on the boythe victima greenish haze clouded the room boldt had heard all the stories of cops who could place themselves into the head of the killer not him he was no mind reader but an observer an evidence hound his strength was not so much intuition as an uncanny ability to listen to the victim empathy in this regard he had what the others did not but for the moment he was stumped the victim typically brought along a crime scene a foundation of physical evidence from which boldt built a case slater lowry offered him nothing or did he the detective wondered stepping closer to the bed again true the crime scene was now well separated from the victim but there was in fact an intended weapon this bacteria or virus boldt called down to the basement of this same building and after a long hold connected with dr ronald dixondixiepathologist and chief medical examiner for all of king county a man recruited by san francisco los angeles new york at twice the salary twice the vacation a man who stayed at half the salary and half the vacation and ten times the friends boldt asked dixie to join him and without any questions dixie agreed there was quite possibly a crime scene somewhere somehow the food eaten by slater lowry had been contaminated intentional or not waiting boldt fell victim to his own active imagination he pictured a mans hands injecting a piece of fruit with a syringe he saw a fastfood chef worker squeezing several drops of fluid onto a roll he saw a cannery a thousand cans an hour whirling down roller chutes and a single square inch of a stainless steel cutter somewhere in the maze holding a green fuzzy mold that the swingshift cleaners had failed to notice it was this last thought that caught him what if adler foods was responsible what if these faxes were merely a ruse to cover up a massive blunder a contaminated producttheir own product what if daphne had been usedmanipulated what if she were the real victim suspicion he lived with it always casting as wide a net as possible encompassing every possibility distasteful or not he worked systematically methodically following up each thought each suspicion he processed considered weighed tested and then compared with whatever evidence was available its a strain of cholera it was dixies voice he was reading the boys chart a youthful face for a fiftyyearold somewhat oriental eyes dixie was a big man like boldt thinning brown hair juxtaposed by bushy eyebrows he wore a gold wedding ring and a black rubber watch wide shoulders that hunched forward from years of leaning over a stainless steel slab ive gotten a couple of calls about this he informed boldt they had worked maybe two hundred crime scenes together the girl lori chin is much improved shes going to pull through whos on this state health investigates infectious diseases cdc if its a real bastard its a real bastard boldt said staring at the boy its unofficial no its cholera cholera is quite official how did he get it boldt asked dixie referenced the boys chart they have names you know numbers really the strains they can be followed that waytracked boldt felt his eye twitch dixie continued its a particularly virulent strain this one whatever it is normally cholera responds to rehydration antibiotics can speed the recovery but this strain is resistant to the usual antibiotics theoretically he said sounding suddenly detached antibiotics are not necessary for recovery this boy is dying from shock lou his dehydration progressed too far and when rehydrated he showed a temporary recovery and then went into severe shock that has resulted in organ failure acute tubular necrosis of the kidneys which will result in renal failure and fluid overload and something called ardsadult respiratory distress syndrome which can occur in childrenalso the result of rehydration shock ards causes pulmonary failure hes going to pull through boldt stated emphatically dixie shifted uneasily returning the chart to a plastic file holder on the wall no dixie corrected hes not going to pull out of this lou boldt heard the words but would not allow them to register his eyes flashed darkly at his friend howd he get it boldt repeated teeth clenched listen there are bacterial outbreaks like this all the time maybe not cholera but plenty just the same you dont hear about most of them only the sensational ones typically it doesnt take state health very long to identify the source a restaurant a fish stand it goes down pretty quickly but this ones a bastard an uncommon strain of an uncommon bacteria theyre unlikely to track down the source before iding the strain what if i knew the source boldt asked what if i think i knew the source boldt modified dixie bore down on him intensely then weve got to move on this lou ill need some techs ill need a coversomething to fool the neighbors i can help with that dixie pointed urgently to the door he said after you boldt glanced back at slater lowry the nausea had grown into a knot three less than ninety minutes later at am a ridall pest control van turned left past a pair of green recycling bins into the driveway of cascadia dixie had arranged it state health used the van for lowprofile inquiries exactly like this boldt parked his chevy on the street he wore a ridall windbreaker and carried a brushed aluminum clipboard clasped in his big fist the neighbors were certain to have heard of slater lowrys illness this small effort to disguise police involvementan involvement that remained unofficial and went strictly against the blackmailers demandsseemed well worth the short delay it had caused inside the van four state health field technicians outfitted in what amounted to environmental space suits awaited a goahead from boldt he introduced himself to a strikingly handsome woman and displayed his police identification pointing to the logo silkscreened onto the jacket he explained just a precaution against curious neighbors a precaution against what she asked immediately suspicious if you have a minute she apologized and showed him inside she gave her name as betty closing the door behind him germanic ancestry in her late thirties she had boyish blond hair bright blue eyes and wore fashion jeans and a tshirt bearing van goghs irises she had small high breasts square shoulders and a straight spine a brave intensity flashed in her eyes she wasnt one to be pushed around he noted she showed him into a baby boomers living room hardwood floor cream canvas couches a brick fireplace surroundsound speakers she offered him tea and he accepted he wanted her comfortable he wanted her calm a few minutes later she returned with the tea and explained a man from the state health department called me late yesterday he asked a lot of questions which restaurants we frequented markets that sort of thing i can understand state health but whats the interest of the police the van in the drive he said its state health but you are not she fired back she looked up as she poured you visited slater this morning he nodded i keep track i dont want the press bothering him i have a twoyearold he said though it sounded stupid once he heard it why she asked sternly why the visit what are you doing here its unofficial my interest he explained this wasnt easy for him he wanted to break it to her gently but she was all business her boy was critical a cop was sitting on her couch how would liz have reacted her jaw muscles tightened and the teapot danced slightly under her direction he was relieved to see this the exterior was hard but the inside was human what department are you with sergeant there it was he thought shed gone and done it he could dodge itanswer a question with a questionhe knew the tricks most of them but he owed her homicide it came out more like a confession she blinked furiously placed the tea down and excused herself after several excruciating minutes she returned with reddened eyes okay whats going on she asked heatedly angry her eyes a hard blue ice we dont know bullshit hes my boy you tell me damn it you tell me everything she hesitated homicide she asked we investigate all crimes against persons that mayonly maybe what we have here she crossed her arms tightly meaning we cant confirm any of this any of what she fumed he explained it in general terms a company had received threats those threats included a reference to slaters illness there may or may not be a connection state health field technicians were on call in the van outside hoping for her permission to look for any such connection its entirely up to you but ill tell you honestly we need your cooperation and we need your candor we dont want anyone else joining slater in the hospital may i call my husband you may call your husband you may throw me out she rose and headed toward the kitchen door he hurried or you can give me a goahead it stopped her she looked exhausted all of a sudden you dont want me to call him i want to control this to keep it controlled if hes upset if he has to leave the office hell say something you see thats out of my control that worries me whats his name she asked your boy she moved back toward the couch she was distant dazed miles he answered i love jazz my wife and i like jazz yes she said theyre wonderful arent they children she looked up and they met eyes hers were pooled its a beautiful name miles the search was its own kind of terror the van disgorged the four technicianstwo women and two menwearing green jumpsuits plexiglass goggles and elbowlength orange rubber gloves with a spaceage silver material covering the palms and fingers to protect against sharpies they wore high rubber boots paper filters covered their mouths technomonsters lou boldt and betty lowry looked on as these aliens methodically searched and stripped the kitchen from the deep freeze to the dustpan the contents of every food cabinet the pantry and the homes two refrigerators were removed examined sorted inventoried or returned the occasional item was confiscated to a thick glassine bag that was then sealed labeled and placed inside a bright red plastic bag that read contaminated waste in a winding chain of bold black lettering the crews leader kept a careful inventory at a future date the great state of washington would replace or return these items what betty lowry was to do in the interim was not discussed a narrow bottle of horseradish a can of chocolate syrup two yogurts long past their sale date every toilet bowl in the house was wiped down with paper tissues bearing stenciled numbers each was bagged separately betty lowry cradled herself in tightly crossed arms as she watched the desecration of her home the crew worked silently and efficiently the effect disarming boldt experienced her sense of violation and wondered which side he was on the technicians spoke to each other using a clipped highly specialized verbiage that further isolated them the last kitchen item to be bagged and labeled was the electric can opener as they moved outside to work the trash they left behind a kitchen stripped of its character the teapot was gone from the stove the entire disposal unit had been removed from the sink along with a part of the faucet nozzle leaving the immediate need of a plumbersomething not discussed the salt and pepper shakers were gone the coffee grinder had been labeled and baggedremovedas if slater lowry had been drinking a cup of home brew on the day he took ill it suddenly looked like a real estate model home a distraught but brave betty lowry glared up at boldt blaming him he offered a look of concern but made no apology she stood away from him as they listened uncomfortably to the crews rummaging through the trash like a bunch of rats at one point she mumbled it was picked up a couple days ago they wont find anything boldt nodded but he didnt stop them they had been cued to pay particular attention for any adler foods products so far not one had been found fortyfive minutes after it had arrived the van drove away having cut a swath through betty lowrys home and her life taking off like a thief with oversize red bags of discarded garbage and leaving her with only a multipage yellow receipt bearing some scribbles and the familiarity of her own signature the last room to be searched was slaters bedroom boldt and betty lowry watched the van depart from this window there were sports posters and a welltraveled basketball a macintosh computer and a websters dictionary in the closet was a shoe box filled with army men and another filled with trading cards three pairs of sneakers and a pair of soccer shoes a model of the space shuttle incomplete she picked up the model and held it at eye level hell finish that one of these days boldt encouraged are you finished she asked angrily boldt detested these acts of violation he resented discovery of a victims closely guarded secrets the intensely private side of a persons life that often surfaced at death the drugs pornography handcuffs hidden bottles home videotapes and inappropriate phone numbers his detectives on the fifth floor got a lot of mileage out of such things finding needed humor wherever possible uncomfortable miles for lou boldt a victim surrendered all rights knowingly or unknowingly but it didnt make it any easier if he died suddenly he didnt want some dogtired detective discovering his manuscript and parading it about he knew damn well that the fifth floor would be tossing jokes around about johann sebastian boldt they would be humming mockingly he cringed when she opened the front door anxious to be rid of him boldt spotted the citys recycle truck blocking his car for a moment it felt to him like just another delay another hurryupandwait inconvenience a cops life at the last possible second he saw beyond all that he hollered at the workman interrupting him before he dumped the plastic barrel boldt hurried out to the street and plunged his face into the first of the three large containers he dug his way through the crushed aluminum cans okay he said giving this over to the worker and returning to curbside where a confused and bewildered betty lowry joined him in here she asked joining boldt in his search though unaware of what he might be looking for boldt noisily stirred the discarded jars with his pen they clanged like dull bells the worker hovered behind him and complained i cant hang here all day leave it boldt ordered waving the man off and adding at the last moment she lost her engagement ring good luck the man called back two of the jars near the bottom wore labels containing the adler foods logo and the script redi spaghetti boldt beside himself with excitement intentionally slowed down increasingly precise and careful this was where a cop made mistakesoddly enthusiasm was an enemy the third bin contained the lowrys discarded cans he dug down dog food clam chowder tuna fish green chilies he hooked a can well within the bin and carried it aloft on the end of his pen like a new years noisemaker he jerked his wrist and it spun the label came off like a colorful flag that same logo adler foods moms chicken soup ah he allowed in a moment of triumph soup boldt said it was cold over the weekend remember she reminded in a nervously apologetic tone slater loves all the moms soups she added sounding like an ad the can stopped spinning boldt felt hot all of a sudden he asked her hoarsely where did you buy the soup do you shop a certain grocery one in particular foodland she replied without hesitation it was the immediacy of her answer her certainty that pleased and convinced boldt most of all foodland he repeated it was a regional chain which one broadway youre sure it was the cop in him that asked that it just spilled out of course when when she asked the soup he emphasized oh god i dont know this week last week im in that store five days a week is that bad she asked catching his expression do you save receipts pay by check she slumped no to both boldt nodded its okay its okay evidence that was his only real thought evidence the fuel that drove the engine of any investigation he kept evidence bags in the trunk of his car he captured the cans and bottles into separate bags trophies he told her the crew would be back for the bins and reminded her one last time about the need for confidentiality she nodded and stuck her hand out for him to shake hers was icecold he called ahead to the lab on the way downtown but first and much more important he would have to convince the lieutenant four boldt dropped the evidence at the police lab on the second floor of the public safety building with specific instructions that the lab techs follow procedure concerning the handling of infectious diseases the anticipated difficulty arose when bernie lofgrin asked him for the case number no case number no lab work what if i recorded my costa for you you already owe me scott hamiltons radio city lofgrin wore thick glasses that enlarged his eyes he was balding both of them then plus hashims guys and dolls lofgrin grinned well go ahead and start the workup without the number but if you want the results ill be down with the number within the hour sure you will lofgrin replied sarcastically whats up boldt asked his friend shoswitz is on a tear rankin is all over him about the clearance rate thats my clearance rate boldt said knowingly or lack of it thats what im telling you boldt thanked him for the warning and hurried upstairs lieutenant phil shoswitz oversaw three squad sergeants of whom boldt was the most senior the most experienced and until recently had the highest clearance rate boldt had five detectives under him the other two squad leaders had four each shoswitz reported to captain carl rankin a political captain and a real asshole most of the time this kept the lieutenant ever vigilant his crew had homicides to work they tracked them in the book a cardboardbound thumbworn ledger that sat at its own table outside the coffee room with a pen scotchtaped to a worn string at its side when you were assigned a case it went into the book under your name when the case went downwhen it was clearedit received a check in the righthand column the sergeants job was to keep those check marks coming the lieutenants job was to ride the sergeants boldts squad had turned in an extremely respectable last year seventytwo percent of all homicides and crimes against persons investigated by their squad had cleared a clearance was defined as any investigation ending in an arrest a warrant for arrest or compelling evidence against a particular suspect whose whereabouts remained unknown the clearance rate had nothing to do with how many cases went to trial or how many of those resulted in convictions or sentences or how many of those sentences actually resulted in time spent in a correctional facility it was merely a yardstick of how well a sergeant and his squad conducted their investigations it was also the figure used for crime statistics and therefore a figure the public eventually took note of the last six months had not served boldt well there had been a double homicide down by the docksthree months now and still unsolved a black hole there was an apparent swan dive off the fremont bridge a paraplegic who no way in hell threw herself to her death a black hole there was a twoweekold torturehomicide that wasnt going anywhere another two hitandruns both in the same neighborhood a driveby shooting drugrelated all unsolved black holes boldts squad had drawn the tough investigationssometimes it worked out that way you answered the phone you took a call you took whatever case was there you signed into the book with his squads clearance rate in the low s there was hell to pay for boldt they needed a couple of domestics a suicide or twosome slam dunksand they might possibly pull that number up into the low s by christmas lately the other squads seemed to have the luck david pasquinis squad was batting an unbelievable mids and this with a couple of knucklehead detectives on his squad pasquini was strutting around like a peacock these days boldt on the other hand was spending a lot of time out of the office bringing an absolute surefire black hole to the lieutenant at a time like this was asking for it but boldt needed that case number shoswitz was having a tough ride with a bad case of hemorrhoids that everyone on the fifth floor knew about you have that fucking look in your eye shoswitz said his office was decorated in baseball memorabilia and cheap trophies he had big brown eyes a narrow face and the anxious movements of a usedcar salesman his shirt collar was a half size too big ive got a live one i need a case number for the second floor evidence dont tell me someone in your squad actually came up with some evidence he moved around the room judiciously boldt saw wednesdays paper on a chair he opened it to page and spread it on shoswitzs desk tapping the article shoswitz read adler foods has received some convincing threats part of the demands include our staying out of it boldt observed adler foods is huge shoswitz said the concern very real in his voice theres the very real possibility that these illnesses are our criminals way of making himself be taken seriously so we keep it out of the book shoswitz observed id like to be detailed boldt said requesting he be assigned solely to this one investigation and his other responsibilities reassigned i can justify that shoswitz was not going to fight him was not going to nag him about clearance rates or internal politics he was in effect throwing himself to the lions and doing so without complaint or comment youll want lamoia and gaynes so ill give the squad over to danielson that should starch some shorts danielson was a newcomer to boldts homicide squad and not particularly well liked though he had earned the support and respect of his sergeant and lieutenant how long can we sit on it boldt asked a day or two rankin will have to be told eventually and by then youll have to have something more than this he said pointing at the newspaper this is one time id really like to be wrong boldt said honestly a patrolman knocked on shoswitzs door and opened it informing boldt that the lab had just called up for him the lieutenant and sergeant met eyes and the lieutenant said plaintively tell bernie its not going in the book he has a problem with that he can call me the lab smelled medicinal with a hint of cordite and the bitter taste of shorting electricity lofgrins glasses gave him eyes that looked like boiled eggs sliced in half he had an oily face and wild hairwhat was left of it i need to know if any of the jars or cans had been tampered with boldt said following at a brisk pace across the lab the jars are out lofgrin declared explaining we would need the lids to detect tampering probably would miss it even then the cans he said pointing ahead are a different story can you test the jars for cholera can and will but it wont be today and honestly were unlikely to get much of anything the bacteria will not survive in a dry jar even in the soup it has a shelf life of only a few days at the outside but obviously well still try an early jump wont help with these when eight to ten working days five days at the earliest two weeks at the outside weeks boldt wondered he grabbed lofgrin by the arm pulled him aside and spoke in a whisper its not going in the book bernie its one of those i dont have weeks lofgrin searched boldts eyes and then fixed his attention on boldts tight grip which loosened immediately he said we may be able to get some help with this first lets see what weve got okay weve got two down that we know of alive but not well understood they each took a seat on a stool in front of the lab counter where boldts prized evidencetwo soup cans and a spaghetti jarawaited them a looseleaf reference manual lay open alongside the labels match no forgery or nothing theyre the real thing dimensions too he added tapping the reference book got the specs on everything from milky ways to lean cuisine in here adler uses the same size can for all his soups you dusted them boldt said noticing the white smudges on the outside of the cans dusted one but ill fume the others lofgrin said referring to superglu fumes that had been used for the last decade to develop latent prints on surfaces that offered difficult imaging nothing of interest he added smudges lets check em for continuity lofgrin delivered in his most professorial tone his initial inspection of the cans surfaces was accomplished with a magnifying glass seems archaic lofgrin said i know he used the glass carefully and methodically rotating the can slowly beneath a strong light when he placed the glass down and clipped a special set of magnifiers to his glasses boldt asked him got something hmm lofgrin answered pushing his face to the can may be carrying the can he led boldt to an elaborate instrument that turned out to be a microscope he spent several minutes setting it up then spinning the can slowly he raised the piggybacked pair of glasses and pressed his greasy face to the black rubber viewfinder boldt instinctively stepped closer lofgrin said to the machine hello there bernie he said softly theres a solder plug in the seam he reached up and spun a dial without taking his eyes away its small couple millimeters is all carefully done the color is off fda outlawed the use of lead in seams some time ago theyre all a ferrousbased alloy now this plug shows up despite the attempts to sand it smooth and blend it into the seam lofgrin looked up it would have been beneaththat is hidden bythe label drill it inject whatever your pleasure plug it reapply the label and youve got one hell of a surprise we detect the lead or the flux in a chromatograph if im right tampered boldt asked he offered boldt a look magnified to twenty times its normal size boldt could make out the slightly discolored plug of gray metal surrounded by obvious scratch marks from sanding hiding his work like thatthats thinking lofgrin said boldt did not want to face someone so thoughtout blackmail lofgrin asked boldt nodded thats why its not going in the book drilling tin cans and plugging them with solder you find this tin man i gotta think hes got some kind of background in microbiology or chemistry might be a jeweler might be in electronics it was customary to invent nicknames boldts stomach turned with the image of a person hunched over a soup can and injecting it with a hypodermic needle he poked the can with his pen this is what im looking for a soup can that looks like every other soup can im a big help arent i thats what they pay me for boldt did not want to face a grocery store full of foodshelves stacked high with cans any one of which might be poisonedbut that was where he was now headed the foodland supermarket on broadway where the hell are you going in such a hurry lofgrin called after him weve got paperwork to complete he objected boldt stopped and turned at the door far enough away that bernie lofgrin could not detain him never keep a crime scene waiting he said quoting one of lofgrins favorite expressions he finally had his crime scene five it was just after threethirty on that same june thursday when boldt pulled the worn chevy into the expanse of asphalt fronting the foodland on broadway before going inside he called state health and was told that a search of the second victims home had turned up nothing useful lori chins mother did remember serving her daughter soup but not the same brand and there were no adler foods products found in the home or in the trash boldt remained focused on the evidence connecting slater lowry to adlers chicken soup he climbed out of the chevy and locked it and walked toward the supermarkets automatic doors passing abandoned shopping carts that carried twocolor ads in their kiddie baskets announcing this weeks specials eggplant was nearly a dime cheaper per pound than where boldt shopped the sixteenounce spaghetti sauce was a bargain boldt did most of the marketing and all of the laundry he split the child care with liz who handled finances some ironing housecleaning and their social calendar he suspected this was a crime scene daphne had reached him on the cell phone only minutes earlier confirming that the productrun number stamped on the lid of the adler soup can found in betty lowrys recycle crate was indeed a valid lot number and one that would have recently been on sale in the greater seattle area the investigation was beginning to take shape in his mind which was a little bit like the morning rush hour on i too many ideas entering all at once and not enough lanes to accommodate them but the basic structure seemed clear enough either the blackmailer was working from within adler foods or from without both concepts would have to be pursuedeach differently and both quite delicately more important to the moment was that the blackmailer had managedin person or indirectlyto place a contaminated can of soup on a shelf in this store that much was fact boldt traveled the aisles of this store now first as the victim the unknowing patron on an afternoon shop betty lowry busily hunting down provisions and then again as the criminal alert for security cameras store personnel lines of sight and placement of product it was not so much an investigative technique as it was a result of his dedication to the evidence he broke out in a sweat as he threw himself fully into this identity even going so far as to carry a can of hormel chili that he intended to place among the shelved cans of adler soup just to see how difficult it might be to do so without being seen by human or camera he stalked the aisles aware of his own rapid breathing the sound of his synthetic soles on the vinyl flooring the slight chill from the stores vigorous airconditioning that conflicted with his own perspiration he was aware of each and every person immediately visible or not patrons employees checkers he passed the morning cereals where dozens of faces stared out at him sports legends cartoon characters the allamerican mom dinosaurs astronauts he the center of attention the focus of their combined sales efforts take me buy this one twentyfive percent more loud despite the insipid muzak the security cameras appeared tricky if not impossible to avoid there was a multicamera device over aisle with three lenses that rotated and then stopped every ten seconds like an inverted gun turret each lens slightly larger than the last and only one was recording at any one time made apparent by a red light beneath the lens the three combined to afford a manager or security personnel everything from a wideangle to a closeup on the various aisles two more such turrets oversaw the butcher counter meat display the wines and wall coolers respectively these units had clearly been installed with an eye toward the most expensive items which suggested to boldt that the soup aisle might possibly have less security boldt timed each of these other two camera turrets they were also on fixed rotations ten seconds apart but were not synchronized in their startandstop times difficult but not impossible for a fast hand to beat the trick was to find that moment in the pattern when view of the soup aisle number would be lost briefly to a blind spot after eight minutes of wandering the storehis attention split among all three like a jugglerboldt identified just such a moment eight minutes later the blind spot repeated clockwork predictable fallible enough time to plant a tainted can of soup foodland made sense as a crime scene large mirrors were mounted high on three of the four walls with the fourth given to glass overlooking the parking lot and admitting light boldt assumed the business office could be found behind one of these mirrors and if so then the blackmailer additionally threw himself open to being spotted as a shoplifter the concept of a shoplifter made boldt realize that the blackmailer would not be spotted as such would a customer returning an item to a shelf attract any attention customers changed their minds constantly shelves were cluttered with misplaced items it was a regular part of the grocery businessstraightening and restocking shelves he sagged slipping an item onto a shelf was unlikely to create any suspicion boldt rounded the corner taking in the registers and the glaring copies of the tabloids to his right bat has face of manstunned scientists say smart as a whip he checked his watch one minute to go until the blind spot he glanced up at the mirrors wondering if anyone had a clear look at the soups wondering once again if anyone would even take notice of a product being returned thirty seconds he turned down aisle the can of chili in hand soup everywhere the adler soup was up ahead to his right five seconds one quick glance over his shoulder a single shopper but she was facing away she would in fact screen any sight of him from the checkers and bag boys at the registers regimented rows of campbells soup cans lined up for andy warhol late afternoon there were some cans missing from nearly every variety which made boldt realize that time of day was important to the blackmailer adler soup a local product and an allorganic line was a popular seller and there were more cans missing from these shelves than any other brand time boldts heart pumped hardfor these brief few seconds he was the tin man and he found it unsettling he slipped his can of hormel chili into place alongside moms chicken soup he walked on blood pounding loudly in his ears heat prickling his skin he marched through a sea of yellowclad enchiladas wearing mexican sombreros that blurred past him like the sharpened points of a picket fence he had done it he had poisoned a person a stranger no connection to be made no one the wiser no witnesses lee hyundailike the car he saidwas the supermarkets day manager a man in his midthirties but already balding he squinted through a pair of wirerimmed glasses displaying a nervous energy that might not have been his natural temperament cops made innocent people nervous and guilty ones cautious it often interfered with boldts work it did now on the wall of boldts office cubicle hung a needlepoint that liz had given him for christmas in their second year of marriage when handmade gifts were all they could afford in blue lettering on a white background it read there is no such thing as the perfect crime there were those who could and did take issue with such a statementplenty of crimes went unsolved the book was full of black holes that never had and never would clear and yet he still clung to this as truth he relied upon it to see him through to get him out of bed in the morning a black hole was the product of his own vulnerability his own failures not the intractability of his adversarys powers there is no such thing as the perfect crime thought boldt hyundai educated him about the process of food distribution from the moment a shipment arrived in the store to the closing of the automatic doors soup arrived from a wholesale distributor in sealed cardboard boxes case lotsno partial cases hyundai made it a policy not to accept opened or damaged cases because it usually meant a dented can or two and he couldnt sell dented cans people are weird about even the slightest ding in something im telling you if it is not perfect it stays on the shelf cereal soup i dont care what it is are the cases stored somewheretemporarilyin a back room perhaps sure show me sure he led boldt through the store into a loading dock area that served as a staging zone meats and produce and dairy went to giant walkins some of which were built directly behind the shelved productbeer and soda mostly a conveyor system and dumbwaiter transported the nonperishables to an enormous basement boldt looked around stunned by the quantity he sawrow after row stacks of cases of every conceivable product i hate carrying this much inventory hyundai said cheaper in these quantities though some of these cases are open boldt pointed out quite a few in fact sure were constantly restocking boldt would ask for an employee list before he left not now but later when he would claim it was routine the list would be checked against adler employees past and present and against the criminal identification bureaus computerized database of state felons maybe the fbi would get a copy as well alone down here in this basement placing a tainted can would be effortless boldt assumed the employee list would draw a blankblackmail was rarely so simply solved how bad is your shoplifting he asked steering the man away from any thought of open cases weve hired a new security company all the latest stuff if the blackmailer worked for a security company he would know the stores surveillance weaknesses better than anyone where is he right now boldt wondered he questioned hyundai about his soup distributor wondering privately how hard it could be to open a case substitute a can and reglue it that kind of deceit was certain to go unnoticed he was told it was the same wholesale distributor he had worked with for years but that the distributor had switched truckers a couple of months ago boldt scribbled notes his thoughts and suspicions branching continually he tried to keep each thought separate to give each full consideration and yet never to lose that thread that might lead to another more promising possibility these mental gymnastics continued as did his questions he felt exhausted and must have looked it hyundai interrupted offering an espresso espresso in the grocery store boldt thought he said no he didnt drink the stuff tears a hole in my stomach too bad hyundai said its simpler boldt replied hyundai steered them toward the deli and ordered himself a tall double with shavings there ought to be a handbook boldt was thinking the man signed the receipt and handed it back to the attendant if i knew the nature of your investigation perhaps id be able to help more hyundai suggested boldt flashed a false smile that said answer the questions dont ask them hyundai received the message returning to a description of the surveillance system the name of the new company boldt asked shopalert boldt flipped another page in his notebook there was always a time in any investigation when he sensed the enormity of the case the limitless possibilities it was the first brief glimpse of the black hole opening up to swallow him hyundai knew his facts and figures average number of customers daily and weekly average purchase amount the demographics of his customers figures skewed by this particular neighborhood for it leaned toward the college crowd scribble scribble boldt caught it all useful or not he could and would throw most of it out later but not until he had taken the time to review it the veins of the leaf were many each required one or more detectives to chase down leads boldt would be awake a good part of the night writing it up up early to start it over somewhere in this city as boldt stood questioning hyundai the tin man could be twisting his drill into the seam of yet another can of soup somewhere a slater lowry was dying to eat it confused boldt asked the man about the numbers printed on the lid of the can and whether or not anyone in hyundais employ would catch it if a can suddenly showed up with a different number he was told they would not as long as the upc bar code remained the sameand it would from one product run to the nextthere would be nothing to alert them even a label change would be likely to carry the same upc code hyundai concluded a bell rang in boldts head a way to ensure that no more cans of tainted chicken soup reached the public tossed out insignificantly by hyundai it went into boldts notebook in thick bold letters a label change he was still writing this down when the bell tolled again causing a surge of excitement in his chest whats that repeat that boldt stuttered hyundai stiffened he didnt appreciate repeating himself i was talking about the automated checking system he said the registers itemize every sale i can tell you which brands sell on which days mondays for instance are big on dairy products wednesdays we do a lot of cigarettesdont ask me why and fridays we cant keep beer or fish in the store you said each sale boldt reminded let me get this straight i come in here and buy a shopping cart full of groceries and you track every item sure i come back three days later and you can tell me what i bought he was thinking right down to a can of soup sure no problem computers register tapes we got it and if i paid by check would you know it sure cash check credit card we keep records of all forms of payment sure boldt needed to know when betty lowry had purchased her can of moms chicken soup this would provide him a way to work backward with the distributor and even possibly the security companys surveillance videos timing was everything tracking bank checks and payment by credit card would also give him a chance to identify other customers who might have witnessed the blackmailer in the act this he realized was the trail to follow a crime scene boldt received a page and placed a call downtown dixie had come through state health had identified the particular strain of cholera and had traced it to the infectious diseases lab at king county hospital excited by this news boldt reached out and shook the mans hand vigorously anxious to be going a stunned lee hyundai was left standing there with a drained espresso in hand shouting after the detective what did i say what did i say six dr brian mann had an energetic handshake eyes glassy with exhaustion brown curly hair and a disheveled look to which boldt could relate he led the detective through the infectious diseases lab at king county hospital and into a small corner office littered with reading material a computer terminal hummed in the far corner boldt was overly sensitive to such noise there was also a phone its receiver discolored from activity neither of us has much time sergeant so ill get right to it you and everybody else would like to know where this strain of cholera originated and i can answer that now mann had pulled a twentyhour shift and he looked it he pointed into his lab were the only ones in the cityin the state for that matterwith that strain cholera this was what dixon had told boldt a single source for the offending bacteria another possible crime scene we believe these contaminations were intentional boldt said you understand the need for confidentiality exactly what the hell are you saying product tamperingfood product tampering it was a can of soup chicken soup protein base mann mumbled nodding and then to explain himself the cholera needs a protein base to survive soup would provide that he rubbed his eyes whats this world coming to boldt was thinking that this man could be the bastard behind it all his lab his cholera why not except that dixie swore by mann and that was good enough for boldt how many have access to the cholera to the lab he questioned too many mann said coffee no thanks anything tea would be nice give me a minute will you i pulled some stuff for you to read he stood boldt called out no cream no sugar be right back a lot of what boldt read was over his head but some was not he was distracted in part by the fact that this was a childrens research hospital in the last fortyeight hours he had seen precious little of his boy liz too for that matter when he was away from miles for too long he missed him in a way that until the boys birth he had never experienced and would never have expected it was a chemical longing like an addict after his fix make any sense of that mann asked setting down boldts tea in a styrofoam cup liz would not drink out of styrofoam cups anymore the tea tasted terrible but boldt choked it down for the caffeine if im the person doing this why do i choose cholera dr mann considered this a long time when he finally spoke it was cautiously a man unfamiliar and uncomfortable with being inside the mind of a stranger it depends on what you hope to accomplish i would guess he considered three choicesa poison a viral contaminate a bacterial contaminate the toxins the poisonsstrychnine or something like what we saw in the sudafed product tamperingcan and will be immediately detected in the blood of the victim if youre just looking to kill a few people then thats the poison of choice i would think most of your other choices if youre talking food products will give themselves away either by producing a gas you can smell or a taste that warns you immediately what youre into also all of the more common of these would be immediately detected in the state lab if it was me i too would choose cholera if available whats interesting about cholera is that labs around here once tested for it but many dont any longer this gets political im afraid this enters into health care and insurance costs and believe me you dont want to get me started but the point is this is the exact area where reduced health care costs are felt the lab has to cut something and they cut right here we see virtually no cholera up here dropping that test is justifiable at every level of bureaucracy dont tell that to these two kids mind you youd miss the cholera is that what youre saying it would take longer to typewhich is what happened if i wanted to make a few people real sick if i wanted to use something that would take awhile to detect confuse the authorities then id look to something like this strain of cholera a scare technique boldt took out his notebook and pen could be mann tasted his coffee he grimaced but drank it is it boldt did not answer make this company look bad mann glanced up again boldt did not answer which company or cant you say adler foods boldt answered he wrote the productrun number on a page of his notepad tore it out and handed it to mann theyre clearing the shelves of this productrun number as we speak the number will be announced on the news tonight and in the papers for the next couple of days at this point the public wont be told exactly why theres a recall why not tell them the individual has warned against police involvement and theres also a concern about copycats its the biggest risk with product tampering we want to keep the actual tampering the connection to these kids out of the press just as long as possible a lot more people are at risk if we dont we know that in a british foodtampering case after word of the contamination hit the press police faced fourteen hundred reports of similar tamperings mann winced fourteen hundred the two men shared an uncomfortable silence you wont hear it from me mann said boldt looked out the window at the crowded sea of houses how many cans of contaminated soup might they miss how many were sitting in a kitchen pantry ready to go off like time bombs ill need the names of everyone who has access to the lab boldt informed him one of my people mann asked defensively that strain is marked clear as day but a person cant just walk in and take it boldt suggested why not youre kidding i hope not a bit this is a university lab dozens of people pass through every day many of them complete strangers to one another students grad students researchers we get visitors from all over the world every walk of life every look you can imagine its a teaching hospital men women young old black white asian hispanic african middle eastern you name it every week of the year sometimes there are a halfdozen techs working in that lab sometimes one or even none just walk in and take it boldt asked astonished if you know what youre looking for i dont believe it try it what go ahead and try it mann pushed back his chair and came to his feet he eyed boldt as would a haberdasher not bad thats the look you need the rundown professor thing im telling you just go ahead and try it the doctor clearly said this as his chance to remove his lab workers from suspicion he grabbed his lab coat from a hook on the back of the door and offered it to boldt and boldt put it on it was a little snug mann said if you look like you know what youre doing youre in confidence is everything its in a halfsize refrigerator on the right if im your man i go in at lunchtime because the place is deserted at lunch its a little late for thatbut thats all the better for your test straight to the fridge youre looking for a petri dish he scrambled and found an empty dish by the computer that was filled with paper clips like this but containing a tan gelatin with florid spots youre looking for one marked cholera or v cholerae inaba strain and a number anyone asks you a question you say youre working the third floor youre looking for some vibrio cholera you watch theyll hand it to you if youre polite i gotta see this boldt said out through this lab down the hall first door on your right by the time boldt was in the hall he could once again feel himself as the wouldbe thief with each step he felt a little more nervous there were three people perched on metal stools working at the lab counter wearing goggles and plastic gloves they appeared focused on their work the place was littered with hundreds of glass flasks plastic petri dishes test tubes and other lab equipment a mess he headed directly to the small refrigerator stooped and pulled open the door no one said a word he caught himself expecting it but it never happened the refrigerator shelves were crammed with petri dishes he picked one up inspected it and dropped it as it came apart the woman nearest him glanced over at him an attractive asian woman in her midtwenties she smiled at him and returned to her work he returned the fallen dish and sorted through the others way in the back he found it marked with a black grease pen v cholerae he took it shut the refrigerator door and walked out just like that his heartbeat was back to normal by the time he reached dr mann well youre right if i hadnt done that myself i never would have believed it he handed mann the petri dish mann studied the dish spinning it in his hand and once he has it boldt asked removing the uncomfortable lab coat taking notes again not much to it he probably has some microbiology under his beltearly college level some agara petri dish containing a protein base some broththe book would have a recipe an incubatorbut could build somethinga light box might work doesnt need much im afraid its all pretty easy it looks real complex and the language is fairly complex but the actual mechanics of growing a culture are relatively simple its covered in both high school and college chemistry anything else i should know boldt tried limited shelf life not terribly choleras a pretty good choice salmonella would have been obvious to whoever opened the can because of gasesbacterial odor but cholera no odor or gases to speak of and if it isnt someone at the university someone who knows specifically about choleraand there couldnt be more than a handful who dothen this guy probably didnt know what a powerful punch it packed three ninetyfive is a resistant strain probably didnt know what he was getting and unless and until you do put this in the press he may not even be aware he may kill people with it boldt felt the wind knocked out of him kill its a research strain it doesnt react to the more common antibiotics thats why these kids became so ill its in the material he said indicating boldts pile of literature their youth may help themwere lucky there its lethal and its just sitting in there in a refrigerator i know i know but its true of much of whats in there this is infectious diseases were working to cure people here am i the only one who sees irony in that the lowry boy went critical a couple hours ago mann informed him again boldt couldnt catch his breath he could picture the boy as clear as day the sunken eyes the strange color to his skin it made him sick to his stomach he put down the tea sorry mann said ive got a twoyearold boldt explained me a boy five a girl three mann said pointing to color photographs by the computer were on the back side of the curve im afraid even with the research work on id like to tell you that they will be okay but i cant because it isnt necessarily true boldt said the girl is doing better mann said we get lucky now and then he hesitated theres something else you should knowyour lab people should be aware of this but in case they are not vibrio cholerae degrades rather rapidly at room temperature it will die on the shelf inside these soup cans with a high enough inoculum there should be sufficient organisms to cause disease for the first five to seven days after that the organisms will die which means they may go undetected by your lab just so you know youre telling me these are time bombs with a shelf life we wont be able to prove they were contaminated not after the first five to seven days after that the bug is dead and your tests will return negative the doctor added the bright side is that after a week on the shelf it wont harm anyone boldt was devastated by this providing evidence of the contamination in a court of law might prove difficult if not impossible he thanked the man for his time and they shook hands on his way out boldt leaned his head into the lab and looked down at the halfrefrigerator unlocked and available for the killer this triggered a thought and he returned to mann who hung up the phone he said will you lock that refrigerator for me just arranging that he pointed to the phone as boldt passed the lab a womans voice called out did you get what you need it was the young asian woman her eyes stretched open by the clear safety goggles a wire loop held in her hand and sparking in the flames of a bunsen burner yes he said with a slightly raised voice loud enough to carry above the whine of a centrifuge good she said brightly not really boldt replied he turned and left negotiating his way through a labyrinth of hospital corridors so similar in appearance that someone had painted color bars on the floor to direct youonly boldt didnt know which colors led where like this case he finally reached the main lobby and then headed off at a run out into the parking lot out into the unexpected rain pouring rain buckets of rain out without an umbrella or even a newspaper to hold over his head sometimes he hated this city seven the meeting with owen adler was due to begin promptly at three for the sake of security and privacy it was to take place aboard adlers yacht earlier that friday morning boldt had assigned detective john lamoia to obtain a list of manns students and faculty who had regular access to the infectious diseases lab he also asked for employee lists from foodland shopalert security and wagner wholesale the distributor that supplied lee hyundais foodland store in an attempt to link motive with opportunity these lists would be crosschecked with that of adlers employees shilshole marina was a clutter of masts alive with the clanging slap of nylon line on hollowcore aluminum wind whistled across the steel stays stinging rain struck the launchs plexiglas shield and drummed on the blue canvas awning as the craft carried boldt and daphne through choppy water to the waiting motor cruiser it was temporarily moored in the lee of the gray stone boulders that created the breakwater protecting the manmade inlet from the sound the multidecked fiftyfivefoot cruiser could have made a landing at the dock but adler was taking no chances that he or any of his passengers might be seen meeting with the police it looked so nice earlier she called across the noise of the twin engines she was not herself nervous perhaps to see adler professionally and in the company of others is he crazy boldt shouted her eyebrows danced she knew whom he meant she hollered back hes disturbed she reached up and took hold of her hair keeping it from whipping her face we want to look for suicides when we get this employee lista spouse a relative and bankruptcy those are his immediate demands its personal he asked love money and revenge she said quoting the three most common reasons humans killed each other we may have a possible paranoid schizophrenic on our hands she warned and then again he may be a coldblooded psychopath the wind suddenly felt colder to boldt id like to bring in dr richard clements hes bsu she meant the behavioral sciences unit of the fbi boldt knew she had used clements in past investigations he had never met the man the low charcoal clouds grew oppressively lower boldt loosened his collar and chewed down two maalox you all right she crossed unsteadily and flopped down onto the cushion beside him her hair whipped in the wind are you okay she asked more intimately pressed up against him the boy is worse i hear he said she reached out and laid her hand gently on the lower sleeve of his sport jacket and squeezed his forearm the launch engines slowed and as the launch pulled alongside a woman crew member tossed a line daphne climbed the ladder followed by boldt the launch sped away cutting into the angry green water ripping open a crease of white foam lousy weather the woman offered she was in her twenties with an athletic figure nice legs and quite crisp green eyes she wore khaki shorts white and blue canvas deck shoes and an aquamarine tshirt damp on her shoulders they descended into a spacious wellappointed living room owen adler stood to the side of the steep ladder and offered his hand to daphne to guide her down the steep steps welcome aboard he said to boldt adler was a boyish fortyfive with graying hair at the temples wirerimmed glasses french cuffs and silver cuff links he stood just under six feet but carried himself much taller he wore soft brown italian loafers linen pants and a faint pink pinpoint cotton shirt with a starched collar his handshake was firm his dark eyes attentive adler and daphne sat on opposite ends of a small chintz couch adlers attorney and chief operating officer howard taplin took the cushioned chair to adlers immediate right taplin was a wiry man with drawn features a trimmed mustache and intense gray eyes he wore a gray suit and black wing tips and the kind of high thin socks that required garters boldt sat between taplin and kenny fowler fowler had once served on the police force in major crimes working the gangland wars boldt saw him occasionally at the big joke where boldt played happyhour piano fowler carried a deliberate intensity in his eyes he wore his dark hair slicked back and kept himself impeccably groomed he fancied himself a ladies man though the rumors had always been that he chased the cheerleading age boldt knew well the mans reputation for an explosive disposition and frank honesty fowler shook hands strongly with boldt and asked him about liz and miles he always remembered to ask he had a couple of new teeth in front and a tiny scar on his lower lip boldt wondered what the other guy looked like fowler was the workout type and wore tailored clothes to prove it as adler opened the meeting the cruiser left the protection of the jetty entering some rougher water but as the speed increased the ride smoothed the cabin was impressively soundproofed a male crew member delivered a pitcher of iced tea and extra glasses with sprigs of mint and wedges of lemon a plate of cookies circulated adler said we want to welcome your assistance and expertise sergeant this is a horrible situation and we will cooperate in whatever way required to resolve this just as quickly as possible i want to say right up front that were aware we may have impeded your efforts by waiting to contact you as we did he glanced at both daphne and howard taplin and i should add that we still feel strongly about keeping the involvement of the police as lowprofile as possible with these contaminations whoever this is has proved he means business and we would just as soon be perceived as adhering to his demandsall of his demands agreed boldt replied where do we stand with the recall weve issued a full recall for the product run in question kenny is continuing to quietly search for a possible employee who might carry a grudge you two will want to coordinate on that im sure we will not give in to terrorism taplin interrupted adler did not appreciate the intrusion what tap means he said addressing boldt is that we would prefer to catch this person than enter into negotiations and some of us would prefer to keep the police out taplin said nothing personal he added coolly passing boldt the most recent fax the choice is yours more sufferingand worse unless you obey do not clear the shelves and no police or press or hundreds will die been to portland lately portland boldt asked worried we have calls in to all the hospitals fowler explained daphne took the fax and reread it saying partly to herself partly to the gathering hes getting more wordy thats a good sign hes opening up the others listened boldt felt cold she reread it yet again no contractions hes well educated and he uses the word obey not cooperatethats interesting taplin said you see our position damned if we do damned if we dont fowler said what do you advise adler asked we will cooperate however we can we would like to place another run of soup back out therebut not if were risking more poisonings can you keep the chicken soup off the shelves but stock them with something else boldt inquired its our highestvelocity product taplin complained my take daphne offered is that we should accede to the specific demands while taking every precaution possible to prevent this from happening again what about product redesign boldt explained if the blackmailer is working in one of your production facilities a label or product redesign might tell us so if heor shehas access to the new materials then we know its inside work he added and it doesnt go against any of the demands way ahead of you taplin crowed six to eight working days to print new labels if we already had a new design which we do not two to three weeks for a new design in terms of container redesignmoving to something tamperproofwere looking both domestic and abroad but best guess is anywhere from two to twenty months to facilitate such an overhaul fowler contributed were aware of the producttampering cases that have lasted years lou kay but from what i can tell they seem to always involve extortion these are strange demands were getting and with the time limit already exceeded it somehow doesnt seem too real that this nut house is going to hang in there for all that long you follow whatever hes got cookingyoull pardon the puni dont think we can wait around a couple months to put the soup in jars or something kay so i advised to move forward with the new labels but not to hold our breath or nothing what about changing the glue to waterinsoluble boldt suggested this guy is drilling the cans beneath the label if we make it impossible to soak off a label and yet he is still able to contaminate the cans we narrow the field of where to look inside your company fowler said it would have to be someone stealing labels from or working on the line exactly thats very good exclaimed adler jotting a note onto a legal pad and its a simple change he said to taplin who nodded as few people as possible should know about the glue change boldt encouraged we can arrange this with virtually no one involved adler said we might piss him off fowler cautioned hes threatened hundreds if we challenge him taplin reminded boldt considered how much to reveal and then informed them the lab tests suggest that there is no direct evidence indicating that the label was either soaked or steamed off the can theres a high probability that the blackmailer is working with fresh labelsnew labels and that means the production line the loading dock or the printers fowler offered storage boldt asked taplin answered were a justintime operation printing inventory is kept to a tenday lead time making a note fowler said it should be added to the list adler addressed boldt if its all right with you sergeant i think kenny should handle all the inhouse aspects of this investigation we operate on a family concept police would be noticed and would be talked about immediately and given his threats we certainly dont want that daphne agreed fowler said weve had some employeerelated thefts lately i can use that as an excuse for asking around they all agreed on this the police would remain involved but well in the background if were to meet again adler suggested addressing boldt and daphne i suggest we arrange it by fax and not telephone and that we stay with remote locations how soon can you make the glue change overnight a day at the outside taplin said his mood improved is there anything else that might help us boldt asked adler glanced over at taplin who glared back at him adler said to daphne perhaps you could show the sergeant the rest of the yacht a few minutes is all there was an awkward moment of hesitation after which the two stood she led boldt forward through a deck dining room to a trio of private quarters and adlers floating study equipped with both cellular phone and fax machine whats going on in there he asked owen can smooth over any flap give him a few minutes tell me about taplin bright protective loyal longtime friend of owen runs a lot of the daytoday owen credits him with much of their success but that says as much about owen as it does about howard taplin its owens baby always has been he noticed a callerid box connected into the fax machine line the device would display the phone number of any incoming fax fowler boldt said pointing it out its a good idea isnt it if he shares the results with us boldt said adding which i somehow doubt taplin would clearly rather handle this without us and as you said taplin is the one writing kennys paychecks owen will give you anything you want lou is that the inside track she did not like his comment time she declared she guided him back to the meeting where the others were waiting boldt and daphne sat down adler said we had a scare in the mideighties not cholerasalmonella but it was our soup line a scare boldt asked not an intentional contaminationnothing like that some bad poultry in our soup but four people were hospitalized and there were lawsuits taplin added let me clarify we were not held liable it was not us but one of our suppliers it was a state health department matter i see no reason to make any comparison boldt said well want any files youve got on this adler said of course but taplin stiffened he opened his mouth to object and adler interrupted him saying to boldt whatever you need eight dressed in a dull green surgical smock and wearing a white paper mask over his mouth and nose boldt took up a vigil at slater lowrys hospital bedside his presence approved by both the medical staff and the boys mother whose mask was damp with tears below the eyes the boys father had collapsed an hour earlier when slaters condition had been downgraded from serious to critical and was presently under sedation in a room down the hall the womans green surgical smock was wrinkled from where her husband had clutched it for hours slater lowry was dying of organ failure it seemed impossible to boldt that with the boy having been admitted to the hospital with his having been diagnosed and treated that his condition could degenerate so quickly gunshot wounds knife wounds strangulations and burnsboldt had learned to live with all of these over his twentyplus years of police service but he did not accept what was happening to this boy he felt hypnotized by the steady drip of the iv by the peaks and valleys of the green lines crawling across the monitors slaters skin was a pasty white and a light sheen of perspiration made it glisten his mother dabbed him dry but it did not last long slater lowry was burning up with fever despite the fluids and antibiotics slater lowry was leaving if we could only trade places the woman had mumbled to boldt an hour earlier he knew that she meant her son and her though boldt thought she might have wished that he could switch places with herthat this would be his son miles lying there and she the visitor since that comment not a word had passed between them the glances they shared needed no explanations she blamed boldt for this without meaning to and without meaning to lou boldt accepted it as the hours passed as friday slipped into saturday as the doctors and nurses came and went boldt imagined this boy a young man the young man an adult he envisioned the successes and failures the joys and heartbreaks that compromised his own life and he loaned these to slater lowry believing that a borrowed dream was better than none at all at two in the morning the father returned to the room dulled and incoherent in his few attempts to share boldt rose to leave them but the woman said stay if you want and boldt sat back down he was not certain what drew him to this boy or this woman or this room and he knew firsthand the trials of taking a personal interest in the victimsa detective needed a certain degree of distancebut he kept his seat and stayed for some reason he found it impossible to leave at twoforty several of the electronic monitors sounded alarms at once and boldts pulse quickened as slater lowrys faded a team of nurses and physicians swarmed the boys bedside their work silence the alarms and twenty minutes later with the boy stabilized the doctor held a private conference with the parents after that boldt remained outside the room viewing the boy through the glass window that communicated with the nurses station where the monitor signals were repeated on small television screens tucked beneath the counter inside the room there was only enough space for three chairs and boldts was now occupied by a woman minister who prayed quietly her chair pulled close alongside the bed the boys limp hand clutched between her own her lips moving in silent prayer boldt realized there were to be no more beaches for slater lowry no more latesummer nights no more smiles or complaints or singing or trading football cardsno more birthdays the nurses offered boldt a seat and offered him coffee when a third woman reminded him the cafeteria was open twentyfour hours he turned and snapped its him that needs you not me and there was no time to apologize to her for the monitor alarms called out for a second time ringing in boldts ears like church bells the moment of death recorded as am saturday june played out before boldt in an eerie and hollow silence the monitors cried out the truth though boldt clung to hope he encouraged the boy to recovery a spectator rooting from the sidelines the nurses and doctors once again rushed to revive the boy but for all their efforts all the technology there were no miracles left the parents hugged tightly in terror the minister stepped out of the way and closed her eyes in the midst of a silent scream betty lowry glanced over her shoulder and met eyes with boldt through the window and though only a fraction of a second he saw that her pain and hope had given way to the disbelief of acceptance the boys final heartbeat was followed by a series of straight green lines in a race across the screenschasing the next patient the doctor turned and offered apologetic eyes filled with sympathy and compassion boldt imagined this boy huddled over his model of the space shuttle eyes curious and sparked with challenge he imagined the excited expressions in his own sons eyes and hoped never to lose him never to count him among the statistics no more boldt whispered aloud his promise fogging the glass his right hand gripped in a fist a promise made from the most sincere the most private place in his heart a promise soon to be broken boldt arrived home sometime after four his entrance awakened miles liz rolled over in bed and admonished you caused it you handle it she gathered the sheets around her like a cocoon and her head sank back into the pillow and he felt a desperate urge to make love with her to erase the death of that young boy for fortyfive minutes miles would have nothing of going back to sleep he finally did so clutched in the warm arms of his father who subsequently fell asleep sitting up on the living room couch at sixthirty boldt was once again awakened this time by his son struggling to be free late he rose quickly from the couch and crashed to the floor when his legs and back failed him miles ran into their bedroom liz appeared in her underwear and said in a groggy voice if youre alive please move your right hand she pulled off his shoes rubbed his feet and helped him to stand he made coffee and toast for her and poured himself a bowl of granola waiting for his pot of tea to steep miles was assisted by his father in smearing part of a banana and some instant oatmeal over most of his face liz appeared at twenty to eight wearing jeans and a tshirtweekend clothes boldt felt tempted to explain his evening to her but didnt know where to start he was a mass of confusion fatigue and frustration he glanced at the wall clock late i miss you he heard her say sometime during his frantic efforts to change shirts and shave he had been a lousy father and an even worse husband these past four days and though he wasnt keeping score he feared maybe she was back in the kitchen with her the two of them talked over each other as they hurried through a running list that included shopping that had to be done oil that needed changing the plumber that had overcharged for shoddy work a dental appointment boldt had missed and then dropped as a bombshell liz said im two months late late my period im two months late months he asked stunned thats the usual way it happens two months late he made it a statement liz wiped her sons chin and boldt asked and what when are you going to the doctor im going to buy one of those inhome kits first when are you going to do the test he had unknowingly stepped closer to her they stood only inches apart their voices gentle he took her by the waist the world seemed a miraculous place to him a place where one child lost was so quickly replaced by another when would you like me to she asked will you wait of course i will ill bring chinese her favorite and beer he added better make it nonalcoholic i cant believe this im thirtyeight love its a long road between here and there it may be nothing dont forget i love you he said those are nice words to hear he squeezed her waist i miss you too you dont look very good she said honestly she meant that he was old for this she meant that he belonged behind a desk with regular hours or maybe she was suggesting that he might have to quit the departmentagainif a child came never felt better he lied go on she said amused shoving him gently toward the door chinese he reminded her seven oclock ill call like last night she obviously couldnt resist saying this and he couldnt blame herbut he did ill call i promise her eyes apologized to him and there seemed in this expression of hers an appreciation of himof their shared feelings of their mutual efforts to define and maintain some semblance of a life together and perhaps even for his part in creating the child that might be within her at this very moment seven she confirmed and if its a boy boldt added i have a name for him following the eight oclock shift change when boldts skeleton crew weekend squad replaced pasquinis inheriting a gang shooting and an assaultwithintent in a barfightturnedknifing boldt was officially detailed to the tin man his duties as squad leader were to be passed to chris danielson his squads newcomer boldt needed lamoia and gaynes for his own purposes frank herbert was available to danielson guccianno was on vacation leave for another ten days they called danielson hollywood because of his vuarnet sunglasses and ostrich boots he was a handsome black man who carried a chip on his shoulder the size of rhode island because he owned the highest individual clearance rate ever recorded in the books danielson kept to himself rarely socializing in any of the cop bars or at functions he was ambitious maybe too ambitious for his peers the complaints were that he avoided the phone avoided the book allowing others in the squad to pick up his slack pasquini had passed him off to boldts squad for this very reason but boldt was glad to have him danielson liked black holes he thrived on attempting to clear those cases where others had failedand he was good at it which also accounted for his unpopularity a newcomer beating the veterans at their own game id rather be assigned to whatever it is youre on sarge he complained im giving you the entire squad boldt said dont want it you got it boldt informed him sternly you could use me on this danielson attempted danielson had no way of knowing what case boldt was being detailed to other than by rumor and this attempt to milk the sergeant for information fell on deaf ears youre a problem solver chris we all are but you especially some guys come by it naturally women too gaynes is a natural you pick up the black holes other people dropsome of them you even clear well now you get all the black holes you want and a lot you dont you run a squad and every case is yours you problem solve on a magnitude on a level that i think is important for you to see whats more important solving this case of yours or shuffling a lot of paper you need me sarge this is my kind of case this one youre on danielson had a nose for it that was all he understood the look in boldts eye and he knew from the hours that boldt was keeping from the long meetings with shoswitz behind closed doors and most of all from the lack of any entry in the book that this was one of the ones that came around once in ten years this was a career maker boldt could tell all this by just looking at him its a ballbuster chris he advised him this is one of those that if you dont clear it it breaks you you put a month six months a year six years into it and it never goes down guys eat barrels over cases like this believe me ive had them before cross killer danielson said he knew all of boldts cases knew them so well it bothered boldt it embarrassed him sometimes you get lucky you could have made captain in two years after that case danielson observed reminding boldt of lizs arguments but instead i took a leave of absence that should tell you something you took two years thats hardly a leave my point exactly the squad is yours the shiteating clearance rate is yours do with it what you will i dont want it he complained knowing there were others who would kill for it maybe thats why its yours danielsons eyes registered disgust and contempt someday youll thank me boldt said danielson hesitated and cautioned ominously someday ill outrank you but may i remind you that you dont today detective boldt handed him an enormous stack of files and said careful of your back theyre heavy boldt spent the rest of his saturday trying to shake the memories of slater lowrys death and to organize the manpower and paperwork necessary to compare the adler employee lists to the various other lists he had requested at that evening with the smell of egg rolls and ginger sweetening the air liz came out of the bathroom sobbing and carrying a long plastic tab with what looked like blue litmus paper glowing on its tip that strip of plastic seemed strangely removed from the real world it existed someplace that boldt did not im sorry he offered gathering her in his arms he swallowed away the lump in his throat and tried to think of something positive to say anything but his voice remained silent she pressed her face tightly into the crook of his neck and he felt her shake her face was warm her breath blew hotly against his neck im pregnant she informed him sobbing as it turned out for joy she waved the plastic strip like a flag announcing her motherhood boldt kissed her fingers he kissed her forehead her nose and found her lips she walked him awkwardly to the bedroom and nudged the door shut with her toe miles was lost in a set of wooden blocks maybe we should practice once just to make sure boldt suggested she said something into his ear but he didnt understand it over the roar of his own heartbeat by the time they got to the egg rolls they were cold and the fake beer was warming but there were smiles all around for these brief few minutes boldt forgot the tin man but not for long he was working through his third report by the time he realized liz had gone to bed interrupted by her crying he saw the bedroom lights were out and it quickly registered that these were clearly not tears of joy as boldt went in to comfort her he wondered at the obsessed man he had become and if he would ever be any different im here he whispered sitting down beside her laying a hand upon her back i dont think so she answered her face aimed away from him but you were for a while i was for a while he agreed though it pained him to do so its a start he tried but they both knew it was not they had been here before they had never left im scared me too but for different reasons he thought she fell asleep with silver tears still clinging to her reddened cheeks and boldt slept beside her that night still dressed in his street clothes snuggled in tight where the warmth of her filled him with an allencompassing peace nine this is the last time owen adler whispered in the dark the bed and the houseboat shifting imperceptibly on sunday mornings lake union was active early seaplanes and outboard engines competed noisily in the distance it really is it has to be his voice was sad i know daphne rolled over pressing her bare chest against his and curling onto him like a snake onto a branch and kissed owen wetly on the mouth i hate it she confessed she knew that this time it was for realwith her being police they could not risk violating the demands maybe she told herself it helped explain why the sex had been lifeless maybe it offered her a way for her to win access to his files she told him i would like to take a look at your files the new leaf contamination you told us about tap will help you with that she did not want to involve howard taplin or any other adler employee she did not want any filters between her and the information and besides she thought such involvement presented too great a risk the thing is she explained within your company howard taplin is as highprofile as you are if he goes requesting a bunch of files and the blackmailer is an insider we take too big a risk that he or she might cotton on to police involvement and i imagine that if taplin gets a file himself rather than asking his secretary for it that would raise as much suspicion probably right and now that this person has proved what hes capable of i have no desire to test his threat of killing hundreds we cant afford any hint of our involvement in the investigation she allowed this to sink in and suggested i was thinking i could go in after hours nice and quiet all alone when no employees are around get what i need make copies and get out whatever you want he held her tightly and she could feel his fear in the embrace i want it over she said a long time passed before he said you dont expect something like this and when it comes you wonder why you ever bothered with any of it a month ago you and i were so close and now i feel a distance in youi feel your professionalism not that im complaining you cant believe what a relief it is to have you working on this to have the police finally involveddespite the threats i waited too long i made mistakesand i do not want to hear you blame yourself againthats not what i mean belief in my own instincts is what built this company when those instincts fail you it rattles the foundations selfdoubt is destructive you cant dwell on it you cant help but dwell on it he said wind whistled through the houseboat sometimes that noise sounded peaceful to her but today it sounded ominous she heard a light chop striking the pier and in the distance the hum of traffic on the interstate do you think its an employee she asked im afraid its one theres a difference he added and it frosts me because as cliched as it sounds were a family and this kind of betrayal is the worst kind imaginable but the evidence certainly seems to point that way i think its connected to new leafto these salmonella poisonings she told him thats the psychologist speaking she said id like to run away with you he confessed leave it all wake up on some island and make love and drink beer youd last about two days when was the last time you took time off thats what i mean you dont know how to take time off you could teach me she wormed her way fully atop him and slid slowly against him until he was aroused we could teach each other she said im a quick learner he kissed her and she felt herself responding to him there were times he made her body feel seventeen again the way it reacted her desire had little to do with penetration or frictionshe wanted inside his skin she wanted some kind of union with his soul it was a feeling she did not fully understand and that somehow made it all the more attractive to her too often she understood too much she said quickness is not something that could be stuck on you you are anything but quick do you honestly think i would choose work over you im not sure its your choice a persons behavior can changebut im not sure the person ever does he took the lobe of her ear in his lips and nibbled there ill send you flowers every day he promised and every day ill wish i were here and as soon as this is over ill leave corky with mrs crutch and well hole up in a hotel somewhere and make up for lost time thats quite an incentive program they made love after thata quiet peaceful union that made up for their earlier frenetic effort there was nothing frantic about it but instead it felt to her that they briefly found one anotherpurelythe way she hoped for her dreams were peaceful for the first time in weeks and when she awakened he was gone having left behind a heart drawn in lipstick on the bathroom mirror and the scrawled words miss you already there had been a time in her early twenties that such sugary sentiments would have provoked an uncomfortable reaction in her but on this day both older and wiser she relished them there was nothing quite like the feeling of being wanted and needed she decided not to clean the mirror until this investigation was overher own childish reaction this would serve as her reminder her purpose in the kitchen she found his master key and his note to her explaining the mansions security system including the code needed for the keypad she picked up the key and it felt cool in her hand as it warmed she felt convinced of its importance ten boldts attempts at sleep proved restless and unforgiving his appetite abandoned him and he found himself back on a routine of antacids and warm milk on the fifth floor he was the recipient of cautious looks and deliberate avoidance maneuvers he thought of the child on the way to the grave he thought of the child inside his wifeand none of it made any sense to him where he strived for order and understanding none was to be found at the office the initial reports were not good using computers the adler employee lists had been electronically compared to those of foodland and shopalert in hopes of finding a disgruntled employee who had switched jobs and was now repaying adler but no overlaps were found every detective assigned a black hole hoped for a lucky break an unexpected quick solution and boldt was no exception it was not something he talked about but nonetheless this hope was harbored secretly inside him with this news coupled with the loss of slater lowry any such hopes were abandoned this negative news was soon balanced by something more promising cash register receipt tapes from the broadway foodland supermarket that included purchases of adler soup products had been sorted and printed out for the twoweek period prior to slater lowrys illness these cash register tapes were shown to betty lowry who despite the loss of her son or perhaps because of it seemed eager to help hours later she notified boldt that she recognized a receipt that included the purchase of soup soy sauce and a wooden spoon it was the wooden spoon she remembered most of all the receipt indicated payment in cash which also fit her buying habits using the date and time from this receipt boldt notified shopalert security and requested they search their store surveillance videos for the twentyfourhour period prior to and including betty lowrys purchase of moms chicken soup redmond washington a fortyminute drive from the city in good traffic was home to microsoft and other technocracies its boom in the eighties was partly responsible for the unwanted californication that had spawned the unprecedented traffic fastfood joints air pollution and armani suits shopalerts interior appeared to have been constructed of materials found at saturdaymorning hardware store sales all artificial everything faux wood paneling adjustable trugrain shelves overhead fluorescent lighting caused human skin to take on the pale green hue that boldt associated with tainted meat the individual office cubicles were cramped and dark despite the lighting in part because of a brownpurple carpeting that absorbed light like a black hole and he thought that it was dirty enough that heretofore undiscovered life forms probably lived down inside it money saved by this tacky interior had been spent instead on stateoftheart electronics heaped and stacked and connected in a spaghetti of multicolored wires keyboards and screens boldt had already forgotten the name of the computer nerd who had met him in the lobby ron somethingor was it jon he was a particularly unattractive human with no social graces so stereotypical that boldt hated himself for having expected someone like this he talked through his nose and blinked continually maybe it was don he looked to be about twelve years old his loafers had tassels and he had a motorola pager strapped to his belt it made boldt want to throw his own away foodland is part of our stoplifters program let me explain when we receive the videos from our stoplifters stores stores like foodland before we analyze them we transfer the data to om diskoptical magnetic kind of like cdrom only more flexible to our needs that allows us to turn over the videotapezero it and send it back out there for use in one of our clients systems while we retain the original images phase one of our analysis is handled here he said directing boldts attention to a dozen young people studying blackandwhite television screens showing store interiors reviewing the instore images alert for shoplifters or taggers taggers pricetag switchers it used to be pulling a price tag off of one lesservalued item and attaching it to another of higher value the tagger pockets the difference in savings because of nonremovable and now optical pricing systems the taggers are more sophisticated than they used to be they arrive instore with preprinted upccode labels on their person they attach these fraudulent pricing mechanisms to the package of their choice and leave the store having paid a serious discount usually only on one or two bigticket items mixed in with many smaller purchases this makes it difficult for the checkers to spot the game thats what we call any of these techniques games original boldt thought another benefit to our clients of our transferring the tapes to om disks is that we are able to catalogue months even years of a stores history making it possible for us to present a very serious legal case against repeat offenders typically they move from store to store too smart to keep hitting the same place but the advantage of being a shopalert stoplifters client is that were essentially building a database of offenders giving us a much better shot at moving these offenses past the probationary sentence and really slamdunking these bastards ill never use that expression again boldt thought he said what have you got for me don led the detective over to an unoccupied viewing station amid the others where a folded piece of paper with the handscrawled word reserved had been placed he sat boldt down in the chair directly before the large monitor don explained a real advantage of the om disk format is taking the signal digital we can not only enhance and zoom but we have the ability to instantly jump position without suffering through fastforward or rewind if you think of it as picking up the needle on an lp record and moving it to the song you want to hear and comparing that to a cassette tape where you have to wait for the thing to fastforward youll see what i mean we can jump an hour a minute twenty seconds ahead or behind by simply dialing in the specific time request we can cut and paste to other disks and build the records of these offenders i was talking about or we can highlight a particularly vulnerable area of a store by clipping together shots of lost angles its really very versatile im not buying anything boldt reminded him right he turned a vivid red and toyed with his smudged glasses whats your name again boldt finally asked gus gus thats right gus sat down alongside boldt he worked a computer keyboard as fast and as delicately as boldts grandmother used to knit your request was easy he bragged you told us which aisle and what to look for without that it might have taken us a day or more i think i may have your offender although im not familiar with this particular gameplacing product onto a shelf whats your interest in this anyway corporate espionage boldt lied making it up on the spot and feeling selfconscious until the technofreak grinned enthusiastically as if hed been let in on something cool he said what ive done is catalogue the images i have found so far and placed them in chronological order heres the first image in the progression this is the entrance door to foodland as caught by one of our cameras on the screen was displayed a slightly fuzzy blackandwhite image that showed a pair of automatic doors the left door swung open admitting a person wearing a gimme cap and a dark jacket medium height and weight he she turned into the store and walked off the screen thats our first look gus muttered not much the bottom right of the screen was date and timecoded the suspect had entered foodland at pm on june clearly a busy time of day for the store and late in the day when the shelves were more likely to have room for the killers substitution boldt experienced a pang of anxiety was this the tin man our next decent hit is three minutes later and you should know something here lieutenant boldt didnt bother to correct the mistaken rank your average shopperyour innocent shopperends up all over these videos but except for a flash here and there this mark has avoided the cameras for nearly three minutes and thats not easy granted shopalert didnt install the foodland systemwe only analyze their images and it isnt the greatest system but even so to avoid these cameras is something of an art form it requires prolonged study of the facility and even at that a hell of a lot of luck of course dress has a lot to do with it youll note the dark clothing and the hat dark clothing in saturated blackandwhite videoin this kind of light as you can seetends to absorb too much light throwing off the grayscale balance on the areas immediately around it causing a graininess like a shadow that renders the image difficult to evaluate the dark clothing makes it difficult to see her face her boldt asked she looks a little androgynous to me a woman i think so yes gus consulted a time log on a clipboard in front of him then keyed in a set of numbers for the time being were going to jump ahead two minutes and fifty seconds to show you this he hit the enter key a new image appeared ran for only half a second and then as he struck another key was freezeframed it was this same person in another area of an aisle the persons head turned slightly which was where gus stopped it im going to zoom and enhance now it takes a second or two for the screen to refresh at each phase using a computer mouse gus dragged a box around the face this box then filled the entire screen box by box the electronically enhanced enlargements continued and the suspects head grew ever larger the tighter the image the fuzzier it grew because enhancement cant keep pace with enlargement as gus explained by the time the process was completed much of what was on the screen was only made discernible by boldts imagination and the images that had come before he wasnt even sure what he was looking at lower head and neck boldt guessed exactly right lieutenant the boy sounded impressed he typed additional instructions into the machine and sat back now lets run that again he ran it several times like instant replay before boldt saw it the bounce to the hat boldt asked its oversize and the way it bounces means theres a lot of hair up inside there youre good at this boldt complimented we spend enough time at it gus drew a box around the womans ear and the computer began a series of enhancements at the same time the sequence played in slow motion backed up and played again repeatedly gus slowed the motion even further there he declared excitedlyand a little too loudly for boldts ear its our only real chance to see it he pointed to the earlobe where a square black mark winked at them boldt studied the repetition for several passes and gus had the good sense to keep quiet and let the detective have some room boldt finally tested a freckle a mole im not sure i see the importance lower earlobe the boy hinted this was a contest pierced ears boldt said loudly briefly drawing the attention of the other video attendants in the room no earring but thats a hole in the ear even so that hardly indicates a woman added to the height of the individual and the apparent weight of hair inside that hat it may be a woman boldt stated ill give you that although this shattered his image of the tin man whom he had assumed to be male i need to follow her every movement the technician showed him all the images in which the female suspect was captured by the cameras at no point did she reveal her face heres where we vote her allpro gus said there are only a few shoplifters as good note her position to the camera shes in aisle four soup and vegetables positioned this way she fully blocks any chance we might have of seeing her specific actions she checks her watchsee that he replayed the moment and now shes gone from our view for over seven seconds by the time we pick her up again she has moved quickly down the aisle she bumps into that man with the cart theresee that and by the time we pick her up again she is paying cash head still down for a candy bar and shes gone the thing is checking her watch she had the cameras timed a woman boldt asked uneasily the tin man he wondered now check this out this is beautiful the technician said enthusiastically the screen blanked to a deep blue when an image reappeared again it showed aisle the technician blocked a segment using a white box tripped a key and leaned back the area zoomed and enlarged several times the shelves moving increasingly closer the productssoup cansmore easily identified adler soup cans this is where the woman was standing he explained he split the screen into two similar images and said before and after see the difference shes not a lifter after all weve got nothing on her the righthand screen showed five soup cans that were not present in the earlier image five boldt asked in a panic something wrong the young man queried shes not a lifter at all he repeated is it possible boldt muttered five cans of soup the young man asked misunderstanding the question you should see some of the clothing thats been used the amount of stuff they can hide we offer a seminar on clothing used in shopliftingyou wouldnt believe some of the stuff boldt could only account for two possibly three cans the chin girl and slater lowry so where were the other three cans listen up boldt announced to his squad lamoia gaynes danielson and frank herbert herbert fifty stood five feet five with a pot belly that made him equally wide his balding head was spotshined lieutenant shoswitz stood by the door homicides situation room contained a halfdozen formica desks a retractable projection screen and a large wipeit board that at the moment contained several profanities and a graphic cartoon boldt briefed them on the case taking them through his visit to shopalert and the discovery of several unaccountedfor soup cans he had been on the phone the entire afternoon his voice was hoarse or maybe that was nerves were missing two to three cans lori chins mother doesnt have any on her shelf so im guessing there are still three at large the surveillance video has given us a window of time during which the suspect was inside the store making the drop boldt continued thanks to a computerized cash register system we can identify any bank check or credit card purchases and then trace them back to whoever made that purchase weve identified thirtyfour people who we know were shopping inside this foodland supermarket at the exact same time as our suspect we have also identified eleven customers who purchased the adler chicken soup within the twentyfour hours that followed the contaminated cans being placed on the shelves heres the drill first ive attempted to contact these eleven individuals but i only reached three your job is to do a followup you proceed to their homes collect any canstreated as evidence dont forgetand conduct a thorough interview to make sure no cans were given away or placed somewhere thats been forgotten about boldt said if we get luckyif we locate these extra cansthen beginning tomorrow morning i want each of you to contact and interview these thirtyfour others who were present at foodland during the time of the drop he added as a footnote obviously this case gets our priority although technically youre not detailed to it so youll have to stay current on the book as well its a lot of work i know he continued these shoppersand anyone they were withare all potential witnesses and should be dealt with as such we contact them first by phone and with the hot ones we conduct followups interviews are taperecorded where we can get permission i want you keeping good notes he glanced at shoswitz okay questions shoswitz said lets go eleven at sevenfifteen that monday evening beneath a heavy blanket of cloud that accelerated the early summer dusk daphne let herself into the adler mansion using owens master key she closed and locked the door behind her if she were to go undetected in her efforts then she knew she must key in the security code within the next thirty seconds to prevent a silent alarm from sounding the mansion corporate headquarters for adlers global business occupied a large corner lot in the old part of town adler incorporated owned the rest of the buildings on this block as well all nestled under towering trees but the mansion was special for its victorian grandeur and charm three full stories and a converted basement four chimneys eight fireplaces mustardcolored siding with white shutters and white trim ornately carved fascia a glorious series of roofs aimed to the heavens and topped with lightning rods like exclamation points she had decided to break the law in her mind the choice was quite clear warrants need more than suspicions in order to be issued and suspicion and curiosity were all she had children were dying there was no time for lengthy debate with judges and prosecutors added to this was a nagging doubt that howard taplin intended to cooperate fully and provide her with all the files concerning the new leaf contamination intuition a psychologists instincts during the meeting on adlers boat she had witnessed his cool resistance to the topic of new leaf it was clearly not something that he wanted discussed or investigated why she wondered the meeting had taken place late friday afternoon the monday business day had now passed without any mention any offer of the files to the police she believed that to officially request the filesfor a second timewas likely to get them shredded regardless of adlers permission to be here she felt that if she were caught in the act if taplin knew how serious she was about investigating new leaf that any and all files pertaining to the previous contamination would start disappearing quickly and quite possibly forever more important the threats under no circumstances could she allow herself to be discovered her identity revealedthe involvement of the police found out the possibility of a disgruntled employee remained at the top of their suspect list word would travel fast within the company the police raided our files last night the faxed threats made it abundantly clear that police interference came at the price of more lives if she made a mess of this there would be more killing she searched for the security device on the wall of the pantry through the swinging door now to her rightwhere adler had told her to look she pushed through but found it too dark to see well and with activity in a few of the other nearby adler buildings she decided against turning on a light the warnings against police involvement kept her anonymity of foremost importance nonetheless she took that risk she wanted a look at the files alone by herself without the editorial screen of howard taplins watchful eye the fact that adler foods had been involved in a contamination incident several years before offered daphne matthews forensic psychologist the possibility of a real and potent motivation and whereas a large percentage of crimes against persons were seemingly committed without an identifiable motivation judging by the use of language in the blackmail threats she believed this crime different fifteen thousand sixteen thousand she counted off as she waved her hand in large arcs on the wall desperately searching for the security device while her eyes continued to adjust slowly to the darkness there behind the door a mahogany valance enclosing it she pulled the cover open a red light at the bottom flashed ominously her middle finger sought out the raised bump on the number key she entered the code and the red light stopped blinking replaced by green she entered the security number a second time rearming the device as adler had advised her ensuring both her privacy and that the building would not be broken into while she was downstairs in the files she had only been here a few times always in the day always when the building bustled with activity she found the neartotal silence the slight hum of ventilation somewhat haunting it was a big place and the old wooden floors complained underfoot and a big grandfather clock in reception tolled out the seconds sounding like someone chipping ice living alone for as long as she had she felt accustomed to solitude but the unfamiliarity of her surroundings coupled with the clandestine nature of her mission here instilled in her a sense of foreboding as if someone might be hiding around the next corner hello she called out tentatively in case she was wrong about being alone judging that she was in fact all by herself in this museum of a placeevery piece of trim every piece of furniture restored or reproduced to match the original erashe returned into the back hall and stood at the top of the curving back staircase that led down into the converted basement she hesitated only briefly before taking the plunge and descending step by cautious step into an increasing darkness adler had described the layout of this sublevel secretarial pool to her and the location of the file room but it did not make voyaging down into the darkness the unknown any easier she wanted those files but more than anything she wished now that she had not come alone the drumming in her chest increased with each stair step her breathing quickened to sharp gasps she nervously fingered the two keys like worry beads and twisted the starched ribbon that bound them in the faint red glow of a pair of lighted exit signs daphne saw that the secretarial pool housed five computer workstations isolated from each other by office baffles there was a string of clocks high on the wall displaying the proper time in rome london new york denver seattle and tokyo a pair of erasablepen board calendars hung on the same wall cluttered with lines arrows and notations the file room marked private was to daphnes right the second key opened this door she had prepared herself for a vast room containing row after row of gunmetalgray filing cabinets instead it was a simply appointed small office space containing a pair of largescreen computer workstations constantly running that occupied a narrow counter space two copiers a color laser printer and a pair of color scanners on the left wall hung a shelving system that housed a dozen inboxes all labeled the wall to her right held more shelving and two large green plastic garbage cans labeled b w recycle and color recycle below the computers were several drawers containing optical disks in plastic jewel boxes they resembled small cds and were numbered through with plenty of empty slots yet to be filled the room was windowless daphne switched on the overhead lights pushed the door partly shut and sat down at the righthand terminal the two computer terminals appeared to be identical both the keyboards and monitors bore the boldly printed name edifiselectronic digital filing system adler had cautioned that many of the more confidential categories were security protected and had provided her with a credit cardsize plastic pass bearing a magnetic strip that once read gained her the highest level of access she pushed the proper function key for security clearance and ran the card through a slot on the right of the keyboard she was inside she quickly navigated through a series of menus to an alphabetized index that was organized into four separate databases category subject date and author the indexing system felt familiar like one used by the public library downtown she moved deeper into the increasingly specific indexes edifis was a paperless filing system that called up the images of the scanned documents the index whether by general category or specific title referenced one of the numbered optical disks an a in parentheses indicated that an archived hard copy existed offsite insurance listed seventeen subheadings she scrolled through them slowly several listings caught her eye among them executive protection package and another catastrophic with additional subcategories branched beneath it catastrophic act of god criminal environmental disaster health the word criminal caught her eye she selected this was prompted to insert the proper optical disk and having done so was faced with yet another menu several case histories were listed including one called policy amp coverage with an a indicating an archived copy she selected this option and was subsequently presented with a scanned image of the actual policy page of it read in the bottom corner she selected a computer icon that resembled a magnifying glass and the document enlarged becoming more readable the opening pages dedicated great verbiage to defining criminal activity both within and without adler foodswhat legally constituted it and what did not she was no attorney and this was an attorneys world to be sure but extortion and blackmail if certified by law enforcement whatever certified meant appeared to be fully coveredup to and including a ransom sum of five million dollars the number swam around lazily in her head five million dollars third paragraph page consumer product tampering she swallowed dryly and glanced around the room to make sure she was still alone gooseflesh ran up her left side and across her chest and down into her stomach which fluttered nervously a long definition followed by more legalese it seemed to say that all costs of advertising development distribution promotion production and publicity to reintroduce any discontinued product line that was pulled as a direct result of internal or external criminal activitysee abovewere to be paid in full up to and including the sum of eighty million dollars she gasped aloud and reread this number eighty million dollars under criminal attack adler foods was to be compensated in order to return its goods to the marketplace it occurred to her how it might be possible to misuse this reimbursement in order to redesign repackage and reintroduce a product or an entire line with the insurance company footing the bill it would require convincing the police a crime had taken place and it would require paperwork from police files supporting this such paperwork existed already no doubt thanks to her enlisting the help of lou boldt and the company had already issued one recall of moms chicken soup which taplin had claimed would cost the company a quartermillion dollars but according to this document it would not cost the company at all so why had taplin lied about the cost to the company a hollow sinking feeling stole into her her mouth went dry her palms grew sticky she loosened her scarf it did not help she backed up in the indexes she touched n in the general index and found an entry for new leaf foods the original company name that adler had operated under until his reorganization several years before she found the appropriate disk and inserted it into the machine hit the enter key and was faced now with yet another index she browsed a variety of categories astounded by the wealth of information and how easily available and accessed it was she browsed new leafs legal documents and used a hypertext search function to locate all documents containing the word contamination she took another ten minutes to narrow the result of this search down to several business letters and memos sent between new leaf and the washington state health department all of these documents were shown in the index to have archived hard copies the first of these letters documented a phone call from the state health department alerting new leaf to a possible contamination of their soup products this and all subsequent correspondence was handled by howard taplin who judging by the tone had been cooperative but denied any wrongdoing on the part of adler foods a product recall had been issued the dates of the correspondence were filed chronologically in the middle of the electronic stack daphne discovered a copy of a state health lab report that showed a technical analysis of new leafs free range chicken soup the details of slater lowrys death did not escape daphnes attention the psychologist in her suddenly had not only a possible motivation but a convincing similarity between the two crimes she anxiously hurried forward in the correspondence searching for further explanations memo after memo blurred past too many to read thoroughly but she scanned them all she resorted to the find function searching first for chicken and faced with dozens of documents changed the search string to poultry which produced only six hits she viewed the documents individually reading each one carefully on the third document she read the name longview farms a rural route address was listed in sasquaw washington she wrote this down including the phone number and continued to speedread the rest of the documents lawsuits and countersuits had been filed state heath had charged longview farms with the contamination clearing new leaf her eye caught the slight uphill angle of a typed word salmonella she zoomed in on the image daphne would realize later that had the lab report not been scanned into the computer had the image not been placed on a large screen that allowed her to zoom in with the magnifying glass icon she might have missed this and the other changes that appeared to have been made one of these changes was the dateseptember which appeared slightly askew imperceptibly misregistered on the line with the rest of the typewritten data over the next fifteen minutes she scrutinized this document studying all the vital information and discovering what appeared to be five separate changes six or seven possibly at last she leaned back in the chair studying the screen and released a huge sigh that she had unknowingly been containing it seemed possible that this lab report had been altered why and by whom and what did it mean two thoughts occupied her she wanted a hard copy to show boldt and othersperhaps even owen adler she wanted a look at the archived copy to study its condition and if possible to run it by the second floor for lab tests the new leaf salmonella contamination gained weight in her mind as having some bearing on the present blackmailing of adler foods excitement surged through her right or wrong she had to prove this to herself with the document on the screen she selected the print icon but a message returned to check the printer she had not thought to switch it on she did so but the switch did nothing the machine was not responding she traced the printers power cord back to the wall socket discovering a device unfamiliar to her it appeared to be an ac power outlet that operated off a key a metal box with a single keyhole that physically locked the printers plug inside the device and prevented any power reaching that plug without the right key she tried the key adler had given her but it didnt fit had he simply forgotten to give her this or had he not wanted her gaining a hard copy without first asking she snapped her head toward the door left ajar believing she heard something on the far wall of the secretarial pool a red light blinked twice she squinted and studied the box from a distance it was a security keypad identical to the one she had used upstairs this one located next to one of the downstairs exit doors she was familiar enough with security devices to know that this red blinking signal represented an entry by window or door somewhere in the building someone was inside someone with a key a moment later the yellow blinking light turned green this person had keyed in the proper code and reset the security she returned her attention to the computer screen whoever it was she didnt want the person finding her and seeing the new leaf lab report on the screen with the printer message still on the screen she attempted to close the file but the screen responded with a second overlapping message that she had requested to print the document and that the printer wasnt responding verify printer operation the dialogue box told her she selected cancel but this only removed the second dialogue box it did not clear the printing error the lab report remained on the screen staring back at her how long did she have until she was discovered as if to answer this the tiny strip of light at the bottom of the door blinked as whoever had entered the building had used the upstairs switch someone was headed downstairs the screensaver graphic patterns at work on the other terminal were designed to protect a monitor from burning in by keeping images moving on the screen and were timed to take over the screen after a designated period of inactivity at the keyboard daphne had no way of knowing what amount of time had been selected for the screensavers to take over but she realized immediately that one possible way to mislead whoever was now heading downstairs was to allow the screensaver to kick in it would hide whatever document lay beneath it and she could not close the lab report because of the printer error interrupt she could keep trying to close it but to do so would involve the keyboard and would further delay the screensavers furthermore she realized that even if the screensaver kicked in a single keystroke afterward would eliminate the screensaver and return the lab report to the monitor giving away her snooping worst of all this screensaver idea required her to do nothingto sit back and be careful not to touch any key awaiting a screensaver that might not appear in time she took her hands off the keys and began softly encouraging the screensaver to hide her efforts while glancing repeatedly toward the door and the view of the secretarial pool it occurred to her to lock the file room door in order to buy herself time but she decided against it believing this would require its own explanation and might raise the curiosity of whoever was approaching the lab report lingered on her screen the screen of the terminal nearest the door continued to splash shooting stars at her she knew that the time out interval for screensaver software could be one minute five minutes or even ten or twenty minutes she had no way of knowing what it might be on these terminals if the intruder was just a security guard she decided she had nothing to worry about it was doubtful a security guard would pay any attention to what was on the screen if it was an employee however it presented her a far greater problem such a person could be counted on to see and identify the document that a stranger had called up from the files the lab report continued to glare at her no matter how strongly she willed it to vanish it remained on the screenyou piece of shit she hissed tempted to put her foot through the monitor but the psychologist took over hoping to buy time for the screensaver to engage she leapt up from her chair and swung open the door crying out as she unexpectedly collided and tangled with a man she broke loose shoved away and looked into the face of kenny fowler woh he said adjusting his suit jacket you he inquired glancing furtively toward the file room door we got an alert that someone had entered owen gave me his key he didnt want to attract attention his key fowler asked the files i thought howard i didnt want to bother mr taplin he nodded but he did not appear convinced again he craned his neck toward the file room door you werent on this evenings log he explained no one was authorized for the mansion with all this trouble weve cracked down on authorization your entry raised the curiosity of my guards she cast him an intentionally suspicious look it sounded to her as if he were making this up she didnt know what to believe i was in the area he clarified for her knowing what she must be thinking i took the call he tugged on his shirt cuff he was nervous she decided you headed straight downstairs she pointed out remembering she had not turned on any lights had not given any indication of her whereabouts the security system is a good one he said she took that to mean that he had known someone had penetrated the file room was he protecting the building or protecting access to the files you need help with the file system he asked attempting to ease his way around her in order to get a better look at the file room i can manage kenny fowler would report whatever he saw to howard taplin she was certain of that the two seemed to work in concert anything on any of the employees she asked knowing that by agreement with owen adler boldt had assigned the inhouse side of the investigation to fowler this eliminated any police presence at adler foods or their suppliers and the chance they might alert the blackmailer to the bigger picture were working on it he replied taking yet another step forward so hes giving you keys now he sounded almost jealous they looked at each other suspiciously she felt both combative and defensive if the lab report were still on the screen then he was going to see it because she fully understood now that fowler was going into the file room with or without her blessing maybe because he felt it was part of his job maybe because he was curious maybe because howard taplin had told him to he had known someone was in the file room even before he had got here it made sense for security to be protective of the company files and she knew fowler to be a thorough man maybe that was all it was she did not want to believe that howard taplin would invent a crime in order to obtain insurance money that might allow the redesign of the entire adler product line why go to such lengths it made no sense unless the underlying economic strength of the company was a mirage were they in financial trouble had owen hidden this from her but no matter what she felt she could not dismiss it without further investigation the form she had seen on that screen implied tampering with evidence in an earlier contamination she wanted answers and for the time being she wanted them kept all to herself fowler stepped past her and pushed through the door she glanced in time to see that both screens showed the shooting stars of screensaver software for now she was safe fowler slid into the seat in front of the first screenthe terminal she had not been usingtouched the keyboard and the screen cleared showing the opening menu you havent gotten very far he said maybe i can help i dont think so her attention remained riveted on the keyboard to his right if he touched one of those keys if he bumped the mouse the screensaver would vanish replaced by the altered new leaf lab report what was it you wanted he asked blazing through a series of menus security has its own files terminal he said answering her astonished look at how fluent he seemed to be some privacy she answered annoying him thanks but no thanks kenny what what is it what do you mean privacy were on the same team here remember whatim not one of you because i left the force for better pay whatthats a crime just some privacy is all i know what you people think of me thats absurd is it he asked you think i copped outno pun intended took the bucks instead of the responsibility well fuck you kenny i dont think that ive got no grudge against your decision the others do you know im right all i want is a look at some of these files ill help you thats what im saying ill help i know the system as distracted as she was by the proximity of the adjacent keyboard and fowlers tendency to animate she found it hard to concentrate at last she gave in hoping to be rid of him requesting a look at the employee records of all collegeeducated males with access to the moms chicken soup production facility it seemed like a legitimate request to her though a second too late she realized it crossed over into fowlers domainthe very area of his half of the investigation but he did not protest the request he typed furiously and quite competently and within a minute or so called up the respective files can i get a hard copy of those she asked hoping to trick him into turning on the printer for her tapping the locking device fowler answered immediately not with this box you cant he felt under the lip of the counter searching out a key she had not thought to do this and felt angry at herself and frustrated that she actually might need fowler after all if i know suzie he said abandoning his search and heading into the secretarial pool she heard but did not see him open a drawer in the other room he called out to her the trouble with corporate security is that its only as smart as your employees as he appeared in the doorway his pager sounded the key to the printer dangled from a small key chain held out like a carrot in front of her she wanted to snatch it away from him i gotta answer a page he said catching her eye he glanced at the key then back to daphne he tossed her the key the key flew through the air toward her on a flight path headed straight for the keyboard to the second terminal if she missed it it would hit the keys and reveal the lab report hidden behind the screensaver she took quick measure and swiped the air attempting the catch and miraculously snagged the key just inches above the keyboard but her elbow thumped against the computer mouse poised alongside the keyboard and the screen came to life the altered lab report glaring back at her the sound of fowlers voice electrified her she was caught then she realized he was not talking to her but was on the phone in other room glancing between fowlers back and the computer screen she shoved the key into the printers security box and twisted it the printers amber power light flashed the machine hummed and the computer screen blinked a new message appeared daphne did not read the message all she saw were the words cancel this print job yes no she zipped the mouse into place and clicked yes the printer error message vanished from the screen she pulled down the file menu fowler said okay and hung up the phone her heart in her throat fowler now approaching daphne clicked the mouse through a series of steps file close menu main her full attention on the screen and the task before her the lab report left the screen replaced by the main menu kenny fowler stepped through the door pretty easy once you get the hang of it she said her face felt burning hot her fingers were trembling would he notice thanks she said trying to get rid of him you okay here he asked i gotta look into something fine key goes in the center drawer second desk over he added im going to have to do something about that no problem she said but her voice broke and he looked at her strangely he glanced over at the two screens and she thought that he must have wondered why she was not sitting at the first terminal but he did not say anything kenny fowler instructed her use the same security code when you leave he turned and headed up the stairs a few minutes later with the file room door locked tightly enclosing her the first pages of the state health department lab report for new leaf foods slid out onto the printers plastic tray daphne wasted no time in folding them and slipping them into her purse twelve at seven oclock tuesday morning daphne faxed owen adler at his home with the words the eighteenth step eight oclock knowing he would recognize the shadowed heart that she drew on all her notes one of the benefits of intimacy she thought is that shared experiences need only reference not explanation they had visited the locks on their first date at eight oclock beneath a canopy of steelwool clouds and chilled by a temperature too cool to possibly be june daphne parked her honda on the north side of the locks here where the darkened waters of lake union spilled into the estuary of puget sound the us army corps of engineers had built a set of locks to account for and correct the difference in elevations between the two bodies of water overcoming what previously had been a minor set of waterfalls daphne hurried through the verdant park barely taking notice of the sweep of green lawn and the colorful beds of annuals the dogs out on their morning constitutional with owners in tow continuing past the refurbished administration buildings that offered postcards and maps in the lobby inside the lock a thirtyfoot ketch by the name of heather was being eased lower as the water beneath it was evacuated at the far gates line was fed down as overhead the lock attendants kept the craft secure while a handsome young couple monitored the bumpers and tracked the descent daphne crossed at a brisk gait the narrow footbridge with its chain handrails not noticing that she turned the heads of several of the male attendants who then eyed one another with lustful expressions she continued past the fixed floodgates following signs to the fish ladder below to her right silver streaks sliced through the turbulent green water like knife blades in bright light followed by an explosion of white foam as the salmon leapt and tumbled three feet out of the water a cascade of brilliance before crashing back to the surface and disappearing she descended the stairs past various platforms of the fish ladder turned and entered the bunkerlike cement viewing station where a prerecorded female voice said through thin speakers this is the eighteenth step owen adler dressed in a dark blue business suit and wearing a pink shirt with french cuffs stood alone before the viewing glass where an enormous salmon slowly waved its tail and maintained a stationary hold in the strong current the narrators voice droned on overhead but daphne tuned it out she approached him and they kissed not as lovers but as acquaintances this bothered her not followed she asked no not that i could tell you no so he said its good to see you how did it go last night did you get in all right fowler found me out she explained her interruption in the file room i have to ask you a few things she said that are not easy to ask but they need answering they need honest answering and if the answers arent what i hope they will be then i want you to know that i would sooner leave the case even leave the department than betray your confidence i dont know how you find it but its hard for me owen to be divided between work and you this way divided arent we working together perhaps you should ask those questions he said revealing his concern she nodded glancing briefly at the lumbering salmon nearly three feet long whose journey had carried it from the ocean to this fish ladder and soon beyond into the waters of lake uniona long arduous journey she said the company is insured to the tune of eighty million dollars in the event of product tampering how stable is the company financially is there any chance that anyone around you might have created this incident in order to win enough insurance money to redesign or remarket your product line to her relief the shock and astonishment that froze his features confirmed to her that he had never heard of had never considered such a possibility he finally managed to say is it that much eighty is that your answer financial stability were an international corporation now daphne we have assets and liabilities that are managed and juggled and manipulated to please those who issue us our credit its unprofitable to make too much profit so you leverage your profits for more credit to expand your business and you go deeper in debt its a huge wheel my job is to keep the wheel moving for its movement that sustains growth and therefore an everincreasing asset base at any one time were seriously in debt if thats what youre asking but the product line is both well designed and marketed and i for one cant see any reason to change that and to go to such lengths to change it is absurd if you wanted to redesign the line could you afford to right now is that what youre asking were moving into europe at this very moment our resources would be a little slim has anyone made such a suggestion within the company were always getting those kinds of suggestions listen we invented a market niche the lowfat organic ingredientwholesome soups frozen dinners desserts for a while we existed there in a vacuum we owned that niche not so anymore were under attack from every major out there theres always someone within our ranks who thinks weve got the wrong look or that were missing a major play that could be accomplished by a few subtle changes i encourage that kind of independent thinking there are some who want a more unified labeling to our products others who understand the success of our diversity inventing a new look for our cans you name it i have heard about it he studied her youre suggesting that meeting my resistance someone may have gone to this kind of extreme to see their ideas through to fruition i dont believe that for a second absolutely not weve lost market share sure we have this push into europe has strained our pocketbooks no question but resort to something like this forget it another large salmon entered at the left of the window and swam forward crowding out the one that was resting and sending it out of view off to the nineteenth step they watched it the narrators voice going on about breeding grounds tell me about longview farms she said facing the plexiglas viewing window but alert for any other earlymorning visitors the tourists wouldnt get here until midmorning and if it rained maybe not at all thats going back he said did you dig up that name in the files she did not answer she saw how scarred and beatup this latest fish seemed to be and thought that the sea was a much more hostile environment than she had envisioned it the jaws of the big fish opened rhythmically followed by a fanning of the gills a supplier back in our new leaf days a family venture poultry farm good people to work with good product tainted product he nodded youre speaking of the salmonella contamination he stated so you were able to find that were you thats what you wanted right he asked reproachfully honestly that surprised me at the time mark meriweather produced good birds ran a solid operation thats why i used him in the first place that was also chicken soup owen and thats the kind of coincidence that cannot be ignored a company put out of businessbankruptedby a series of lawsuits directly connected to your former company owen i need an absolute pointblank answer she waited and then asked are you aware that the state health lab report that blamed the longview farms poultry for the salmonella contamination may have been altered come again altered forged changed the blank expression on adlers face was all the convincing she needed she felt the knot that had formed in the center of her chest loosen as a drip of perspiration skidded coolly down her ribs sending a chill down her side she told herself that he did not know anything about this his lips moved but no sound came out i dont have proof she said not yet she stepped closer to him but if someone at state health altered that report in order to frame longview farms then we have some serious motivation that may help to explain or even identify your blackmailer she added even if there was only the perception that longview farms was unjustly accused it could be enough to set someone off that was four maybe five years ago part of the thrill of revenge is in the plotting the planning strangely enough the execution of the plan is often a letdown its one of the reasons the individual will stretch it out given half a chance revengemotivated crimes are unpredictable that way a young couple entered hand in hand daphne studied the transparencies of the varieties of fish that might be seen in the viewing window the woman said to her pretty neat isnt it daphne mugged a smile and waited the full five minutes until the couple left alone again she approached adler she said i need access to the new leaf archivesthe hard copies of what i saw on the computers at the mansion i need the original of that lab report what about getting it from state health if someone at state health altered the file id rather know that before paying them a visit we may get some arrests out of this and if we do we may get some answers the big salmon grew active as smaller fish crowded the tank after a few minutes they settled down their mouths moving as if talking as if mocking daphne matthews and owen adler she thought can you get me in she asked hmm adler was lost in thought without a lot of hassle of course i can without howard taplin knowing she clarified but you dont think dont ask she interrupted its part of my job to be suspicious not that i always like it i suppose it ruined meriweather something like that busted him probably what about the wife he asked where did she end up in all of this daphne hesitated a second reluctant to answer but then decided that honesty was a twoway street and that she owed him hers at the top of my list she said the salmon turned viciously and bit one of its smaller cousins the water clouded with an explosion of activity and when it cleared again the big salmon was all alone and the bench at the viewing station was empty thirteen at eightthirty daphne arrived at the public safety building flush with excitement over her discovery of the state health lab report she grabbed boldt firmly by the arm and without another word dragged him into her office kicking the door shut behind them standing close to him she searched his eyes and said five years ago new leaf foods was accused by state health of selling contaminated chicken soup lab tests placed the blame with a poultry company called longview farms out in sasquaw she passed him the photocopies of one and then a second newspaper report she had gleaned from a computer service since her meeting with adler longview farms went bankrupt and folded as a result of lawsuits brought against it as he shifted to the second article she narrated for him its owner mark meriweather went off snoqualmie pass in his ford pickup the fatality was ruled accidentalbut what if it was suicide boldt looked up are we supposed to believe theyre coincidences chicken soup a suicide especially when you add in this she handed him the laserprinted copy of the state health lab report she explained what it was and informed him of her suspicions that it may have been altered a copy wont prove that i know that im working on it she searched his eyes again and said you like this dont you very much boldts mind was racing if they went bankrupt then tracking down whoever once worked there may be tough i put meriweathers widow on the top of my list loses her husband their income she sours and hires someone to threaten owen do we have her no i ran her through dmv no current operators license no current vehicle registration i thought id ask lamoia to try his contacts at state taxsee if we can find a paper trail a knock on her door was followed by the head of one of the civilian staff sergeant were holding a call from gaynes for you says its urgent the call was placed from nulridge hospital hearing boldt answer the call detective bobbie gaynes said in a frightened voice sergeant ive got two more nulridge hospital was the kind of small community hospital that was unlikely to survive health care reform it had not been remodeled in years though it felt clean and well kept gaynes explained that via a credit card payment she had traced one of the foodland receipts to a woman who had purchased adler soup on the same day as the lowrys the womans husband and child had recently been admitted with what she described as the stomach bug but the symptomssevere diarrhea headaches and mental confusionmatched those of slater lowry boldt spent the next forty minutes attempting to convince the supervising intern to test for cholerathis while also avoiding any direct mention of a product tampering the doctor refusing to be told his job by a gumshoe remained hostile and distant until boldt connected him with dr brian mann after which point his attitude changed completely the senior kowalski was responding well to fluids but his teenage daughter already weakened from a twoyear battle with bulimia was listed as serious there was seemingly nothing to gain from visiting the two patients but boldt stopped in on the father the man was lethargic and untalkative but he was alive which put him well ahead of slater lowry the daughter was unconscious her medication being changed as boldt arrived the doctor caught up to boldt in the hall apologized for his earlier attitude and thanked him adding at least we know the enemy now the irony of which was not lost on the detective at eleventhirty that night the anonymous state health van pulled in front of the kowalski home once again boldt ushered the field agents inside the home and stood by as an exhausting search so familiar to him from the lowrys began anew at am summoned back to the office boldt met up with daphne whose frantic behavior unnerved him as she explained longview farms has long since defaulted on their property taxes but from what i can tell it hasnt changed hands its vacant its worth looking into but its well outside of our jurisdiction and the widow im working on it lamoia got the property information but he doesnt have anything on meriweathers wife or the longview business what i want is an employee roster that sounds like a better shot than driving a twohour roundtrip out to a vacant farm you stay on the widow meriweather ill ask a local uniform to check out the farm boldt contacted one sheriff turner bramm within whose jurisdiction longview farms was located he sounded like a smoker and maybe a drinker too i dont appreciate being woke up at three in the morning its urgent boldt informed him it always is im not on call tonight sergeant i know that sheriff but this cant be entrusted to anyone but you i need this done i need it done right and i need it done now its an active homicide investigation with a repeat offender at large i got me deputies for the graveyard shift what the fuck do you suppose theyre there for im not kcp boldt reminded him bad blood existed between king county police and some of the local law enforcement of the smaller municipalities within king county it stemmed from a budgetdriven decision that required payment for kcps services or the establishment of an independent police force dont give a shit you are or you arent sheriff bramm said you got any errandrunning need done this time of night then my deputies do it period he said he hung up boldt called him right back youre pissing me off bramm said answering without waiting to find out who had called him you get your butt out of bed and over to longview farms or youll be answering to klapman boldt warned referring to the state attorney general im trembling all over the line went dead when boldt called back for a third time the line rang endlessly bramm had unplugged his phone lacking any jurisdictional authority in the area boldt returned a call to the sheriffs office and politely solicited the cooperation and assistance of one of bramms wetbehindtheears deputies he wanted the local buzz on longview farms and he wanted this deputy personally to inspect the premises getting the names of anyone and everyone currently or formerly associated with the property and the business conducted there he tried to impress upon this deputy the urgency of his request he needed this done immediately not tomorrow or the next day sure the man replied listlessly boldt hung up the phone anything but convinced some days his own people were his worst enemies when boldt arrived at work the following morning he was briefed by shoswitz on an agreement reached with state health should the kowalski illnesses become the focus of media attention the statements to the press would be that the symptoms were consistent with e coli contamination the early symptoms were in fact similar which precluded the necessity to lie outright and the city had been through a bad spread of e coli the summer before lessening the alarm caused by any such statement the first telephone call boldt made was to sheriff turner bramm from whom he had received no report the phone was answered by the same gruff raspy voice boldt reintroduced himself and asked for an update on longview farms bramm informed him impatiently listen tommy did a driveby last night didnt see nothin gone sick with a summer cold now so im what you might call shorthanded sergeant i got me a grand theft auto and the dea telling me i got a crack house operating in my village you hear me a crack house out here in the goddamn nowheres you think im running errands for you city boys keep on dreaming and as for waking me up last night a driveby boldt interrupted a driveby is all more than you shoulda got more than you gonna get you hearing me a grand theft auto boldt inquired perplexed im talking about murder one a repeat offender at large im trying to stop a killer sheriff he said through his teeth managing a modicum of control in his voice a killer who may or may not have a connection to a residence in your jurisdiction i need someone to knock on that door and ask some questions and if youre not up to it then im going over your head and getting permission to send one of my own people out there and do it is that registering with you im not looking to make you any trouble but i will in a heartbeat if youre going to go on playing southern cracker with me southern cra final warning boldt said interrupting loudly and drawing shoswitzs curiosity which focused onto him boldt was not one to lose his temper either you knock on that door and ask questions or one of my people does i am not inviting you out here the sheriff made clear its going to mean trouble for you boldt warned in an ominous voice that rang with authority silence on the other end it lasted so long that boldt finally said sheriff thinking he had been hung up on again give me your phone number the sheriff said ill call you right back ten minutes sheriff then i move without you give me your fucking phone number the man hollered into the receiver when the sheriff called back ten minutes later boldt couldnt help but wonder if hed taken a drink of something his mood had changed so noticeably you coulda told me who you were the sheriff said he claimed to have made a few phone calls i did boldt reminded no i mean who you were the sheriff attempted to clarify fuck it it doesnt matter you need a hand you got one i didnt know thats all youve got my respect boldt thats all im trying to say i didnt know it was you get it maybe not boldt admitted thinking that the man probably had him confused with someone else but appreciating the change of tone and not wishing to challenge it but if youll help then thats fine ill head right over there right away while the coffees still warm right check the neighbors first huh maybe the postman and a good cop to boot surprise sounds good boldt said be back to you by noon that okay with you just right boldt answered the sooner the better fourteen the wind blew swiftly from the southwest changing the way the air smelledor perhaps daphne told herself it was just that she had not been out to whidbey island for a long time she had driven here after work on a wednesday no less she felt irresponsible for having agreed so quickly and spontaneously but owen had that effect on her he and corky had arrived via his yacht making it virtually impossible for him to have been followed the home belonged to a friend of his it was a splitlevel modern in the school of frank lloyd wrightflagstone and glass cut into a carpet of green lawn that spilled down to the shoreline the beach was steeply inclined and consisted entirely of fistsize smooth rocks huge cedar logs had been rolled up and deposited by storm tides creating an obstacle course that corky used for hiding places we keep saying we cant do this and yet here we are again she observed its only for the one night and besides corky insisted owen adler explained she wants to invite you to her party and there are some things a father cannot say no to regardless of the socalled rules he added not my rules anyway precautions not rules truthfully i think shes more excited about monty the clown than the party who its an icecream bar with a gimmick is all the kids love it he sounded like a marketing executive do you want to talk about the investigation no its what i came to get away from fair enough in the morning if its necessary its not she said the water shimmered and she could make out several sailboats in the distance motoring with the sails down but it was the lawn and the woods that called her having grown up in riding boots she said the way youre keeping track of corky the way youre always watching her always attentive to her needsthats part of you who you are you do that for me too not enough yes it is enoughthats what im saying its a quality in you its not something i measure or keep track ofi dont think of it like that in a selfdeprecating tone he said i dont always pay attention i leave you in the lurch i get thinking and suddenly i realize ive left you out of my thoughtsand thats a criminal offense in any relationshipfatherdaughter lovers it doesnt matter its a selfishness and im often guilty of it i know its the kind of thing that eventually destroys relationships youre doing it again she warned him am i youre trying to give me a way out mark the exits but im not going owen im here like it or not im in this i like it and youre rightthats exactly what i was doing he hesitated and allowed privately thats what you give me what she encouragedthis was the great puzzle for her insight he pointed out a flight of birds in the distance you call me on my games you see what im up to when im not even aware of it that doesnt sound so good she admitted i dont want to be a psychologist i want to be a companion but it is good i need both i think youre not afraid of meyou cant believe how many people act afraid of me i hate it it happens so much so often and it affects meand its terrible she collected her thoughts youre nervous he observed a little uncomfortable she admitted the thing is this is your private time your family timeyou and corky it feels different than when were at the house it is different like im intruding not at all you know that maybe i dont she added quickly and im not fishing she attempted to clarify i have a hard time knowing whats going on inside of you they skirted one of the large timbers and then another corky slipped over a log and ducked low out of sight owen adler said well pretend we dont see her okay act surprised right the child erupted with a boo coming to her feet and waving her arms then threw herself into hysterics at their reactions and buried her face in her fathers stomach and laughed to that point where she was forcing it owen pushed her off teased her and sent her on ahead of them when they were alone again he admitted i hide toojust like that she allowed him time to think about this have you always hidden no this seemed to encourage him the result of something recent or something old both maybe as a child i hidphysically hid from my father he had a short fuse he drank too much on the weekends and hed want to play with me he said drawing the quotes in the air which amounted to playing too hard wrestling some punching he hurt me often enough that i learned to hide there was a place in the woods i would stay there but truthfully im not sure its that as much as when connie died he said referring to his sister we were best friends and she was the last of my family he went quiet for a time after that interrupting the silence with im willing to work on any of this if it means the difference between losing you and keeping you its me who needs the work owen corky hid again but she gave up impatiently and chased something imaginary down the beach of rocks im afraid to commit fully to this daphne admitted i see you tiring of me leaving me and that keeps me an arms length away most of the time it happened to my parentsthey never divorced which is worse they just grew bored with each other bored and old and despondent i dont want to bore you of course youll bore me and ill bore you too but that doesnt have to be the permanent state of things he said softly corky drives me crazy sometimes so what if were ready for that stuff were okay if were wearing blinders were in trouble he added are you worried well end up like your parents i see it around me all the time happily married boredom i am not charming and entertaining every second of my life and i am honestly she asked yes im never bored with you thats a big part of it they walked for a while longer corky up ahead chasing the birds off the logs and running after them his throat sounded constricted as he said i think maybe ive created an image of me rather than risk showing you the terrified boy whos actually inside here i dont want to bore you she confessed they caught hands and they walked until the water turned gray and the wind slowed to a calm he said if this is going to happen the work is ahead of us not behind us agreed and youre prepared for that he asked probably not but i want it you know what were saying he challenged she did know she squeezed his hand he held hers tighter im terrified he admitted me too she answered uncle owen corky wore a pale yellow nightgown she had always called him this though owen had confessed to daphne that he hoped to hear the d word one of these days yes love corky was halfperuvian previously owens niece and now his legally adopted daughter owens sister and her husband had met an eighteenwheeler in the passing lane of i five miles outside of bliss idaho my sister died in bliss owen had said the driver of the truck who had started his run in chicago was discovered to have been pumped full of amphetamines but apparently not enough he had fallen asleep at the wheel with a trailer of washing machines driving him through the guardrail in time to find corkys parents passing an rv his brotherinlaw had left no clue to his past in peru claiming once while quite drunk that his family had been butchered because of politics but never saying anything more adler his sisters closest friend and confidant had put up a fight to keep corky when it had been discovered no legal guardian had been named no will left he had won by taking the case to the idaho supreme court and had adopted the girl on her sixth birthday im going to bed now the girl said not without a hug youre not the terrace stones were still warm from an afternoon in the sun and felt wonderful on daphnes bare feet the pool would be warm too and she had an urge to take her clothes off and go for a swim corky tiptoed over to owen and gave him a warm hug and kiss somewhat nervously she asked daphne to tuck her in which daphne took as a great honor do you like it here corky asked her as they reached the childs room i like being with you and your dad i mean herethis house its a nice house i like it because owens different different daphne stood by as corky brushed her teeth and washed her face she was a little adult the way she tended to herself then the child dove into bed pulled up the covers and said at home hes tired isnt he daffy she felt a lump in her throat as she answered yes cork hes very tired he works very hard i can tell because he doesnt play with me as much but he loves you as much i dont like it when hes tired no she gathered up all her courage and asked are you coming to my birthday party if you invite me i will im inviting you now in that case i would love to come thank you promise as close to a promise as i can monty the clown is coming she informed her as an added enticement well then how can i resist corky liked that she squinted and blushed daphne stroked the childs hair wondering if she would ever have any children of her own wondering if she had the strength and courage for it the hair felt soft her skin smooth and creamy daphne returned to the patio and without a word began to undress things are looking up owen said looking him over she said yes they are arent they she enjoyed that her body had such an effect on him she carefully laid her blouse and pants and bra over the chair by the time she stepped out of her underwear the air felt chilly to her and gooseflesh raced over her skin she ran across the lawn to the pool hesitated at the pools edge and dove in the sensation was astonishing for a moment there was no outside world no poisonings no job to return to in the morning he caught her from behind and she spun around and wrapped her legs around him and they hugged tightly i feel like were hiding from the parents she said owen felt very strongly about limiting corkys exposure to the physical side of their relationship daphne was a friend not a lover and though she understood this she questioned both its sincerity and her own position in owens life he met eyes with her and asked do we do it her throat caught and her eyes stung this question had nothing to do with his arousal which was substantial at the moment it had to do with permanence and commitment with promises both kept and broken heartache and joy a lifetime together the question seemed to have escaped him spontaneously and she worried he might be flooded with regret he rarely spoke spontaneously she allowed him time to retract the question but he made no attempt to do so his hands held her firmly on her hips he had his own way about doing things he had nibbled around the edges of proposal several times testing the water and she had been conveniently noncommittal believing that that was what he wanted of herand seeing the fallacy of this always in hindsight tonight she braved to be honest she held her breath their buoyancy seemed to rely on her answer for a moment all the world was perfectly still despite the electrifying shrill of the chorus of summer insects they never took their eyes off of each other and neither blinked daphne nodded and said softly yes we do it good he said the moment felt awkward to her he looked as frightened as she felt it was done she was engaged she realized she did not squeal and hug him she did not kiss him it was not the way owen adler sealed a deal and she wanted this deal consummated her left hand grabbing for the pools edge her legs still locked around his waist she pulled from his careful grip and leaned far away from him precariously offbalance and quickly extended her hand to him he saw it and grinned with both of their heads beginning to sink in the water with both of them laughing and their eyes like alligators barely breaking the surface their right hands found each other and they sealed a life together with a handshake she let go her left hand and together they sank holding hands bubbles rising from their laughter her legs still entwined around him she thought that happiness was like this pool of warm water that the water enveloped them both and that to be submerged in this kind of shared happiness even for a moment made all the other moments insignificant and as they broke their hold and exploded to the surface grabbing for air she was glad for the water and the darkness for together they combined to mask her tears fifteen aint no skin off my neck the man with a bad limp said the freight elevator clanged loudly to a stop and he slid a steelmesh accordion grate out of the way oblivious to his own impairment he towed his left foot behind him like an unwilling child the sole dragging on the warehouse cement sounded like fingernails on a blackboard daphne fought off the chills mr taplin posed to be here he stated firmly hes coming she lied besides mr adler she emphasized said it was all right you want me to get mr adler on the phone no need for that the guard said they rode the rickety freight elevator three stories up mr taplin posed to be here he repeated unlocking and throwing open the heavy door for her she had to get in and out of here quickly and without being found out in her mind someone had altered the state health lab report and she intended to find out who and without their knowledge it was an enormous room partially lit by an eastfacing row of towering fogged safetyglass windows that reminded daphne of her gymnasium lockerroom door in junior high this being the top floor of the warehouse the ceiling was vaulted the ridge twenty or more feet overhead rain fell on the roof noisily like pebbles on sheet metal the air smelled heavily of paper and ink and moldstale like an old attic but metallic like the inside of a refrigerator she heard the groaning of some machinery that she identified with the odor in the dry air made aware of the environmental controls that sought to preserve the rooms contents this was confirmed when the guard explained gotta keep the door shut because of the dehumidifier adding you want me to tell mr taplin youre already up here when he comes no she said lets surprise him i wont tell if you dont tell mr taplin dont like no surprises he flicked on the lights and pulled the door closed with an authority that made daphne flinch alone in here the room felt about the size of a football field row after row of steel shelving about half of which was stacked high with cardboard boxesall carefully labeled the boxes were ordered chronologically and arranged alphabetically within the year new leaf foods being the original company name was likely to be among the first archived material the very first boxes she encountered were labeled nlf ad nlf eg on and ontwelve boxes for the first year at the far end of the enormous room in aisle she discovered a specially designed rolling ladderpart ladder part scaffoldingcontaining a batteryoperated platform lift with locking wheels she moved it down to locked the wheels and climbed up unsure where to begin c for contamination s for state health l for longview farms she could spend hours in alone and looking down the row of years she saw more boxes labeled nlf in as well she would need extended hours alone in this room should she jump ahead to figuring that this contamination occurred near the end of what was new leaf foods and the start of adler she remembered the date september but not the year ten minutes later she stumbled onto a set of files labeled corporate security and a light went off in her head by job definition kenny fowler would have been involved in any possible contamination investigation it seemed like a legitimate place to start she pulled the box off the shelf balancing it on the mechanical lift when she stood she thumbed quickly through the material heart beating strongly a tingling on the back of her neck confidential re salmonella contamination confidential re salmonella confidential re state health investigation all signed by fowler the mother lode fowlers investigation of the contamination might provide leads or insights it seemed exactly what she was after an electronic pop went through her system like a gunshot as the freight elevator engaged she jerked slightly and felt the box going over only it was too late the file box was midair before she reached out to grab for it as she did she knocked the file she was reading off as well the box tipped fully over and spilled its contents her corporate security file went airborne as well the uncountable sheets of paperwork floated down and blanketed the cement floor the elevator hummed she panicked slipped and fell catching a hand on the top rung and dangling from the mechanical loader she kicked out and hooked a foot around the rail and hauled herself back aboard the ladder tearing the armpit out of her jacket in the process the elevator continued its noisy ascent and she hoped that it might stop at the floor below but it did not it continued up and this was the floors only room it seemed impossible that so many papers could have been inside a single box they littered an enormous area below her she scrambled down the ladder collected the papers in big sweeping armfuls attempting both to find the fowler letters and get the edges of the piles straight enough to fit back into the box which she quickly uprighted and began to fill paying no mind to order or classification she crammed the pages into manila folders and stuffed them into the box she spotted a fowler memo and separated it from the others then another and a third but only one marked confidentialthose she wanted so desperately scoop stack stuff she went dizzy with the task papers were sideways upsidedown dirty folded wrinkledwrecked crawling on hands and knees she made herself dusty working her way around the large loader scooping under it looking everywhere for the adventurous piece of paper that had managed to travel great distances in free fall bang the freight elevator stopped daphne briefly quit what she was doing and listened the sound of the metal grate coming open it was definitely on this floor furiously she returned to her task abandoning making any edges straight and instead cramming the paperwork into the box as if it were a trash can she thought she had them all she thought that was it she forced the flimsy top back on banging all four corners and crushing one footsteps there was no time to climb the ladder to return the box to its proper place instead she shoved it into a vacant spot on the bottom shelf freed the locked wheels and ran the ladder down the aisle she failed to look behind her to where she had left the fowler papers she had set asideon top of a box in the shelves opposite a key in the door no voices it wasnt the talkative guard it was either taplin or some other adler employee think she negotiated the huge rig around the corner to aisle locked the wheels and scrambled up the loaders ladder yanking the first box onto the platform and opening it while attempting to contain her frantic breathing the box was dated it appeared to be engineering specs and floor plan blueprints she would have to think of something fast if she were to explain her interest in this the door pushed open grabbing daphnes attention boldt stepped inside and shut the door hastily weve got to hurry he said anxiously owen adler saved our butts he called downtown in a panic you evidently tripped a security device taplin and fowler are both on their way over only then did she take notice of the box with the flashing light behind the door she hurried over to it keyed in the same number she had used at the mansion and the code took damn it she said were out of here boldt said she understood that determined look of his as she ran back toward and the new leaf files she said you believe me dont you following her boldt said about longview being part of this yes and id just as soon no one be wise to that except adler himself i think we want to contain this thing as much as possible lets get out of here in her excitement she had forgotten about the letters she had set aside and began searching the box she had stuffed impatiently missing sight of them entirely boldt rattled the keys attracting her attention ive got to get these back to frankie frankie were on a firstname basis hes big on cop shows he promised to keep our visit quiet but only if i got his keys back to him pop the elevator could be heard descending boldt snapped his head in that direction lets go the lab report daphne said running down the aisle help me with this no time he objected help me she leaned her weight into the loader and heaved she glared at him together they wrestled the loader around the corner and raced it down the aisle the hum of the descending elevator pressing them on i think we should leave it boldt said nervously technically we should have a warrant we have owens approval she reminded him scrambling up the ladder to a line of boxes marked nlflegal even so boldt said the boxes were alphabetized and daphne was forced to make a choice c for contamination l for lawsuit s for state health she chose sz tearing the lid off the box and searching its contents the hum of the elevator grew distant it was nearly down leave it boldt encouraged no way she clicked her index finger along the file tabs and there it was state health she yanked the entire file returned the box and skipped steps coming down the ladder the elevator stopped its opening grate echoed up the shaft and pop it began its ascent give me the keys daphne demanded of him she snared them in one quick swipe get this back around the corner and then get out of here meet you at the bottom of the stairs without further explanation daphne ran out of the room crossed the hall pushed through the exit door and descended the stairs two at a time determined to keep taplin from knowing about her search of the files this being a threestory building she had only the one floorthe secondto pass the keys the elevator opened from either side and she knew from her ride up that after entering it the passengers stood facing away from the gate that accessed the room to the adler archives she cracked open the door to the secondfloor hallway and peered out the elevator was just reaching this level at first she saw the backs of three heads frankie the security guard taplin and fowler now their shoulders the elevator climbed pressed against the wall she hurried toward them the elevator was moving too fast to offer her more than one attempt she closed the distance fifteen feet ten five their waists the backs of their legs the elevator was dead even with the second floor it continued to climb daphne reached the stationary floor gate diamonds of accordion steel by contrast the elevators gate was slanted slats of wood in order to pass the keys into the elevator daphne would have to negotiate both patterns at once her plan was to toss them inside and duck out of sight at which point frankie could claim he dropped them the floor of the elevator ascended past her ankles she held the keys debating when to throw them started to but stopped lifted her arm frankie turned and looked right into her eyes he must have sensed her for his attention fell immediately to her handthe keysand without thinking she lunged her arm through the steel grate attempting to pass them for daphne all motion slowed hell of a rain frankie said to taplins bald spot taking a step back his fingers twitching behind him for the outstretched keys give me them this hand seemed to say but as the elevator continued its steady rise the pass became impossible and worse daphne suddenly realized her arm was in too far the bottom lip of the elevator could take off her hand at the wrist like a paper cutter taplins bald spot moved as he swung his head to speak to frankie daphne ducked from sight her arm high overhead the steel lip of the elevator heading for her forearm like a butchers cleaver her watch caught on the diamond steel gate trapping her hand inches to go she tossed the keys jerked her hand hard and broke her watchband the keys splashed to the floor of the elevator daphne flattened onto the floor something thumped softly onto her back her watch frankie had kicked it out of the elevator while bending to retrieve his keys man but im clumsy she heard frankie say his voice rising with the elevator damn near lost these doesnt matter taplin said ive got my key with me all for nothing daphne realized heading back to the stairs and descending quickly boldt had the file and she was anxious to see what it contained when she reached her car she leafed through the file quickly nervously eyes alert for the document that had become so familiar to her buried in the middle she found it the state health lab reportand by the look of it this was no copy sixteen the hours passed slowly while they awaited the initial results of the lab tests on the state health document the interviews with the foodland customers dragged out and those reports boldt did receive suggested to him that too much time had passed people simply did not remember much about grocery shopping several calls placed to sheriff turner bramm went unanswered and unreturned infuriating boldt as boldts shift came to an end replaced by deangelos squad there was a good deal of mumbling about what boldt was really up to danielson had cleared a hitandrun and they had leads in a liquor store assault but it was clear to all from looking at the book that most of boldts squad was admittedly or not detailed to whatever consumed sergeant boldt danielson was running a oneman show lou boldt in effect was running a small task force on friday morning with the discovery of three hospitalizations in portland that matched the symptoms of cholera boldt flew down for an eleven oclock meeting with the portland police department at the same time because the crime had now crossed state lines the local field office of the fbi was alerted and two special agents attended this meeting fortunately for boldt and the investigation he knew both agents personally and there was a good deal of mutual respect between them in an act of cooperation the fbi field office deferred to boldts request for advice and assistance but not intervention for the time being the bureau agreed to stay on the sidelines offering its services but not its leadership the spd would continue to run the investigation with the ppd and the fbi as silent partners the fbis hoover building lab was made available and boldt passed along daphnes request that the bureaus behavioral psychiatrist dr richard clements contribute to a psychological profile this was met with enthusiasm by four oclock that friday afternoon some of the energy and urgency of the tin man investigation had begun to dissipate because of general inactivity and a lack of leads shoswitz settled back into his normal routine and left for home with the shift change lou boldt did not once again he telephoned the office first and then the residence of sasquaws sheriff turner bramm on the sixth ring the mans wife answered boldt had a brief conversation and hung up he felt as if the wind had been knocked out of him detective john lamoia entered boldts office cubicle saying narc narc anybody home feel like a pizza lamoia in his late thirties was a twelveyear spd veteran and had spent six years on boldts homicide squad he stood six feet one with curly brown hair a mustache and had a drawn face high cheekbones and large brown eyes he wore pressed blue jeans that carried a heavy crease down the center of both pant legs he worked out and had a reputation for being a womanizer everyone liked lamoiafrom the meter readers to captain rankin he brought humor and sparkle with him and he effortlessly crossed the line between the uniforms and the detectives sarge lamoia was one of the more observant detectives he never came home last night boldt mumbled whos that boldt said ill pull the car around you call kcp and let them know were heading out to sasquaw if theyve got somebody in the area we may want backup backup lamoia asked curiously but boldt did not answer him he was already off across the fifth floor at an allout run by the time boldt found the farm it was dusk they had become lost twice and lamoia had demanded they drive through a mcdonalds using the cell phone boldt obtained a telephone warrant from deputy prosecuting attorney michael striker and district judge myron banks giving him authority to search the premises his mouth full of hamburger lamoia said youre starting to worry me sarge boldt answered id doublecheck my piece if i were you lamoia tended to his weapon immediately a group of farm buildings spread out below the county road barely visible in a determined starlight lamoia switched on a flashlight aimed it directly at boldt and said you should have eaten something you look like shit i sent a local sheriff here to nose around boldt explained he hasnt been seen since lamoia switched off the light in the silence they could hear the hum of the overhead power line the two hung their shields around their necks on thin black strings and lamoia crossed himself and no one made any jokes boldt thought of miles and that if he never saw him again there would be no way to explain the reason a cop had kicked in a door in the middle of nowhere and then he thought of sheriff turner bramms wifethe fear he had heard in her voiceand he opened his car door and headed toward the farmhouse the two men walked in silence their city shoes juicy in the mud but neither complaining they walked to the powder river gate and lamoia opened it quietly closing it again behind them there were no lights on in the house though it didnt mean anything the driveway showed signs of recent use a mercury light filled the distance between the house and outbuildings with a garish glare that seemed brighter than arizona sunshine with the shades up there would be plenty of light inside with which to see they were sitting ducks out here boldt threw a hand signal at lamoia indicating the dark side of the house and the detective squatted and slid off into shadow where only the owls could see him deafened by the pulsing in his ears boldt slowed his advance buying lamoia a few needed seconds and forcing himself to think this through once again a missing sheriff a deserted farmhouse his twoyearold son waiting at home he withdrew the weapon from his holster engaged the recoil and the safety and gripped the stock between both hands a bead of sweat trickled down his chin his mouth was dry so maybe liz was right about a desk job so what there was nothing to do about it now his police vest was in the trunk he should have thought to put it on he walked faster now his system charged with adrenaline cutting quickly across the brilliantly lit farmyard and reaching the door to the farmhouse a building in total disrepair the white paint was coming off like sunburned skin the windows were gray with grime and the brownbristle welcome mat had disintegrated at the center leaving a frayed ropeweave underpinning boldt held his breath to allow him to hear the slightest sound then knocked loudly paused and knocked again the wind blew high in the cedars and the mercury light hummed sounding like a huge bug boldt peered through the gray glass at the inside of a cluttered kitchen although clearly well used this was the back door he circled the house locating another door and knowing lamoia would be keeping him in sight he knocked waited nothing a wave of the hand brought lamoia out of the dark they checked the ground floor thoroughly and found it tightly locked up we could kick it lamoia suggested not without a damned good reason boldt clarified not outside our jurisdiction boldt turned around and faced the five outbuildings a series of muddy tire ruts led into the compound some of them made recently try them first lamoia inquired yup boldt said they crossed the farmyard to the first building lamoia pushed open a huge steel door that ran on rollers boldt switched on the flashlight and scanned the interior a long narrow corridor faced them hundreds of tiny wire cages stacked floortoceiling on either side of the wide aisle it smelled dusty there were white yellow and brown feathers everywhere boldt experienced a similar nausea familiar to some homicide crime scenes you feel it he hissed hoarsely his throat dry lamoia nodded gravely he pulled the door shut again maybe we should call in that backup but they did not they walked side by side silently through a patch of weeds that invaded boldts socks prickling him the air smelled sour and then suddenly sweet they stopped in front of the second building a modified quonset hut you okay lamoia asked no open it go ahead the door squeaked on its hinges boldt painted the inside with the harsh beam of the flashlight more of the same hundreds of poultry cages several rows of highintensity lights hung from the ceiling studying the coop lamoia said this must be the laying coop they use the lights to trick the birds into producing more feels kind of like a ghost town boldt said i know what you mean they moved on by its outward appearance the third structure suggested a different usea tool shed or equipment barn as they neared its doubledoor entrance boldt stuck out his arm and blocked lamoia before he stepped on the disturbance in the mud activity boot prints and a series of tire tracks pretty recent boldt said observing their clarity the summer rains of the past week would have softened the impressions they avoided the disturbed area cutting around the side of the structure boldt leading them with the light he was already thinking ahead to lab crews and photographers plaster casts of the boot and tire impressions go with your instincts he had told the students in the lecture hall his own told him that daphne was right about a connection between longview farms and the adler threats he had nothing more than a sour spot in his gut and a few unexplained tire tracks upon which to make this bet but if challenged he was prepared to bet it all there was no entrance on the side but at the far end they found a locked door and a reinforced glass window that had been spraypainted from the inside they teamed up boldt training the flashlight under the crack in the door and lamoia searching out irregularities in the hasty paint job his face pressed to the glass to the right more he directed there he said it took several blows with a length of scrap iron to punch a hole in the reinforced glass as they stepped inside boldt asked do you know that smell a nose like yours you oughta be in perfume smell it i do know that smell lamoia admitted thats paint thats right the building was hot and stuffy it had a cement slab floor with large drains and an overhead conveyor mechanism with metal hooks lamoia said knowingly this is where they butchered them yup boldt walked a bit faster approaching the sheriffs car gloves he said they both snapped on pairs of latex gloves the flashlight caught the windshield and mirrors and bounced light around the cavernous structure in sparks and flashes the words sasquaw sheriffs department wrapped around a gold logo of justitialady justiceon the drivers door the vehicle was locked boldt shined the light into the backseat no body force the trunk he instructed lamoia searched out his scrapmetal pry bar while boldt fully circled the vehicle ending up at the trunk boldt said clean too clean for all this mud he wiped it down his heart pounded painfully in his chest dead he had sent sheriff turner bramm here had berated him until he accepted the job he felt that he and he alone was responsible for whatever had happened here maybe he just parked it here so it wouldnt be seen lamoia said reading his thoughts working the pry bar the sheriff im talking about maybe he and some farm girl are shacked up in the house doing the business is that all you ever think of boldt said a little too harshly lamoia did not answer he caught the lip well put his weight behind the effort and popped the trunk no body lamoia said relieved no vest either and theres a shotgun clip on the dash empty and no police radio he said torn right out from under the dash we gonna kick it now lamoia asked of the farmhouse you bet we are boldt replied the flashlight strayed to the cement floor and caught a blend of yellow blue and red spray paint edged by a hard line where a drop cloth had been lamoia went down on one knee he sniffed the paint closely theres the source of the smell boldt followed the paint with the light it formed a large empty rectangle on the cement floor spraypainted a car lamoia said a truck boldt corrected with these three colors lamoia put his shoulder into it for a third time and the kitchen door came open the air smelled of food gone bad and windows left shut the kitchen was small and tidy dishes drying in a rack and dry fresh fruit in a bowlslightly withered a door immediately in front of them perhaps leading to the basement was padlocked shut with new hardware using hand signals boldt indicated for lamoia to search the first floor he boldt would take the upstairs the sergeant passed through a mustysmelling living room and climbed a flight of creaky stairs police he warned we have a warrant to search these premises he continued his ascent flashlight in his left hand his right hand hovering cautiously near the stock of his weapon below him something moved lamoia slinked silently past disappearing into a different room the unusually white light of the farmyard mercury lamp played against the downstairs walls boldt ascended unknowingly holding his breath the staircase led up the center of the house leaving rooms ahead of him and to either side police he called out again though with less authority he passed through a pocket of foul odor and stopped dead still his neck and arms alive with goose bumps he knew that odor and he identified its source as the room to his right his senses warned him again that this was indeed the home of the tin man the closer he drew to that door the greater his apprehension police he repeated his weapon already in hand im coming in not wanting to make a target of himself he shut off the flashlight and pocketed it he gently rotated the bedroom doorknob and toed the door open cautiously greeted by a darkened room police he repeated yet again reaching for the light switch an empty room the room had been recently lived in he smelled dirty laundry mixed with that same odor of spray paint once again he was struck by the incredible neatness of the room that neatness troubled him an ordered mind compulsively neat he was afraid despite his training he wanted out of here a noise like a tiny bell he knew that sound hangers banging together ding they rang again the closet was on the far side of the bureau someone was inside that closet a sudden scratching on the ceiling caused him to jerk his weapon overhead and he almost fired rats or bats he realized as he turned to call for lamoia a rustling sound came from the closet preempting him he leapt forward and yanked the closet door open the hangers rang again a cat leapt off the shelf and onto boldts shoulder so quickly that boldt went down with the contact empty the closet the other roomsby the last of which lamoia had joined him nothing the detective said theres that smell in the hall boldt said leading lamoia back to the top of the stairs any homicide cop knew that smell they both spotted the laundry chute at the same time that would be the basement lamoia said the padlock boldt reminded him and the look they shared silenced them as they hurried back down the stairs and into the kitchen using a butter knife that he broke twice in the process lamoia removed the hinge pins to the basement door before boldt had thought how to deal with the padlock the door came open backward and lamoia tore away the lock doorjamb and all and deposited it in a crash to the floor it was dark inside and it smelled of death lamoia reached for the light switch boldt caught his arm shook his head no electing the flashlight instead wanting control over the environment darkness closed in around them as they descended the steep stairs boldts flashlight beam directed his attention a washer and dryer a soapstone sink a laundry line a pottery kiln otherwise it was black down herethe windows boarded up and painted shut they moved slowly through the laundry room and into another mustysmelling room formed of concreteandrock walls a room stacked high with secondhand furniture and rusted gardening equipment rocking chairs babys toys pine dressers clothes inside clear vinyl hanging bags mattresses and headboards it smelled faintly of mothballs and cat urine a hard box of white light framed the edges of a crude door leading into another room the closer they drew to this door the more pungent the feculent odors boldt drew a box with his finger he and lamoia carefully searched the door frame with their gloved hands lamoia said got it and pointed to a delicate stretch of monofilament that crossed the gap in the door frame just above the rusted hinge the trip wire was not entirely taut lamoia peered inside ceiling balloons he announced its rigged for arson we back out slowly john now and we keep our eyes open there may be others meoow it came from behind them drawn by the fetid odors of early decomposition it came hungry and it wanted through that door both cops understood the threat it represented without a word between them boldt stooped and said here kitty as lamoia groaned oh shit maneuvering to box it between them good kitty boldt tried it stopped and stared up at thema mangy cat with a curiously distant look in its eye it meowed yet again and lamoia creeping up on it said to boldt blind it it shied away from both and boldt could feel the tension set into its hind legs as it hunkered down prepared to spring ready boldt asked the flashlight held tightly in his sweaty hand ready lamoia echoed go boldt aimed the beam of the light as he would the bead on a barrel directly into its eyes it froze lamoia took one long stride hands outstretched and the cat sprang through them like a bar of wet soap fast little silent footsteps before either man could react the wooden door creaked open as the kitty nosed and nudged it lamoia dove and snagged the cat but his shoulder brushed the door and threw it fully open sheriff turner bramm hung suspended by his wrists from an overhead pipe his uniform seemed motheaten with holes where his captor had burned him with cigarettes his shoes were off and his ankles wired to his thighs so that the full weight of him fell to the wire wrapped like bleeding bracelets around his wrists his death mask was one of pure horror frozen in a wretched spasm of agony there was a workbench its surface clean and neat boxes stood beneath it a string of as many as twenty balloonsall sagging filled with gasolinewas suspended in rows from the ceiling as the detonator took in an extreme slow motion bright orangeandblue flames chased through the string of balloons running like water down a hill lamoia was already up clutching the cat sprinting for the storm cellar door only feet behind boldt lamoia shouted something but it seemed slowed down to boldt and he didnt understand boldt felt the strong wind in his face as he followed lamoia up the concrete steps on hands and knees wildly racing for survival the igniting of the balloons drew air from every crack and crevice creating a choir of singing voices the force of the subsequent explosion propelled boldt out of the storm cellar as if he had been shot from a cannon followed a fraction of a second later by a tunnel of yellow flame that curled to the sky like a crooked finger boldt scrambled to safety unaware his jacket was afire until lamoia tackled him and threw him upsidedown into the mud the house went up like kindling a bonfire of epic proportions the volunteer fire department arrived in time to declare it a complete loss and to take several pictures for the time being boldt and lamoia identified themselves only as passersby keeping their occupations silent there was no mention of a body in the basement and the fire remained far too hot for its discovery the sergeant and detective lingered nearby protective of their crime scene fire marshals were due on the scene early morning at am boldt telephoned bernie lofgrin of the police lab awakening him at home by the time the fire cooled sometime around sunrise boldt wanted an id crew available to sift the ashes lofgrin complained about jurisdiction and that he was still owed the jazz tapes boldt had promised boldt said he would take care of both and even though lofgrin knew there was little or nothing boldt could do about the jurisdictional conflict he agreed to have a crew available seventeen a man was following hershe was convinced of it she would have to lose him or miss the emergency meeting she was already late monday mornings were always a nightmare the meeting had been hastily arranged by fowler and was to be held at a neutral site they were all to arrive within a few minutes of one anotherboldt fowler adler taplin and matthewsall having used different modes of transportation or at the very least different entrances to the seattle center the idea was to make it impossible for one manfollowing any one of themto connect them to this meeting a pair of fowlers undercover security people were to keep adler under constant surveillance while watching for someone keeping him under surveillance if such a person were identified a police patrol under the direction of phil shoswitz was prepared to detain him or her if adler was free of any surveillance then the meeting would go ahead as planned but now it was matthews not adler who was being followed or so she believed and there were no contingencies for this at first it had just been a sixth sense a bout of intuition a feeling as if one too many buttons were undone and every male on the street had his eyes on her or maybe her wraparound skirt was not fully wrapped only she was not wearing a wraparound skirt today but a pair of forestgreen denim jeans and the oversize white buttondown oxford was properly buttoned right up to her collarbone with the shirt collar flipped up to help hide the scar that had been the gift of a psychopath some years before the westlake center was just down the hill now she had been assigned the monorail she debated taking a quick detour through eddie bauer a chance to waste a few extra minutesshe was always early to everythingand maybe even a chance to ditch or identify whoever was back there she could not be sure she was right about this in the back of daphnes mind always lingered the possibility of retaliation of becoming a target of one of the criminals she had helped to convict as the departments forensic psychologist she saw more of the witness chair than many of her colleagues did testifying ninetynine times out of a hundred that the suspect was legally sane and therefore able to stand trial such testimony carried longrange implications if and when the suspect was subsequently convicted and sentenced the sentencing time for a suspect deemed mentally healthy was specified as hard time instead of the more gentle hospital time given to those identified with psychological problems for those serving the time a big difference indeed to make matters worse she knew that the cases involving her services were for criminals with unstable personalities or perhaps she thought her being followed had to do with her current effortsthe breakins at the mansion and the archives the tin man himself or at least the new leaf contamination she did not get a good look at him and that worried her all the more because he was good if there was someone back there he remained well back and seemed to always anticipate her inquiries the very first time she turned she had seen a reaction in a man about a block in back of her but the next time she looked he had stopped nonchalantly turned and walked away from her quickly rounding a corner twice more sensing his presence again she stopped cold and turned around abruptly but both times she failed to identify any pursuer even so the feeling once inside her did not go away and she was talking no chances she passed over the eddie bauer idea deciding instead to make her move once inside the westlake center which was the departure point for the monorail the tourist crowds were large this morningthere were two conventions in town a greeting card sales conference and a water sports equipment showand fifth avenue teemed with coffeecarrying cameraladen tshirtclad enthusiasts a swarming hive of middle america in search of retail therapy the westlake center was just what such people were looking for a minimall that included some impressive anchors as well as decidedly upmarket outlets for everything from jelly beans to threehundreddollar fountain pens it had size without losing its substance it catered to the gold cards leaving the discover set to find their thrills out on the streets amid the homeless and seattles unpredictable weather daphne headed straight to fireworks not only because she enjoyed the often bizarre merchandise but also because of its central location and floortoceiling glass walls that enabled her to keep a close watch on both the escalators and the people emerging from the buildings only elevator she declined the assistance of an eighteenyearold windup barbie doll whose exposed cleavage was enough to keep any warmblooded male shopping for hours and confined herself to the front shelves that provided her the perfect location for her vigil she had the monorail timed perfectly in five minutes she would head two floors upstairs buy her ticket and board after her first few minutes of observation she began to doubt herself she saw no one who even vaguely reminded her of that man whom she had seen duck around the street corner she of all people knew the power of imagination the power of the mind and she too knew the dangers of paranoia she could not allow herself to be convinced of anything without solid proof she could tolerate suspicion but only for so long just as she nearly had herself convinced that this was nothing but delusion she saw him how he had reached the westlakes metro level she had no idea but there he was below herat least the back of him she had yet to see his face but the clothes looked familiar as did the general height and size of him and he had that bloodhound body language about himattentive to the crowd around him but not the stores maybe he had taken a bus and entered through the metro tunnel she had been watching the streetlevel entrances but what sense did that make how could he be following her if he rode a bus to get here was there more than one man involved she willed him to come closer to turn around and face her but he continued away from her and as she glanced at her wristwatch she saw that she had run out of time less than two minutes until the monorails arrival there was no decision to makeshe was expected at this meeting she left the store dodging a final attack by the bouncing barbie who nearly caught up to her at the door her attention remained almost entirely on the man who circulated on the floor below her she gripped the handrail and moved slowly toward the ascending escalators he wore a khaki windbreaker blue jeans and boat shoes but so did half the males in seattle this time of year he wasnt alone in this look even in the westlakeand again she found herself mired in selfdoubt another man perhaps not the one she had seen earlier as she took her attention off him to board the escalator she suddenly felt his eyes find her she strained to lean over the escalator and look downto confirm thisbut in those few spent seconds he was gone try as she did she could not locate him with this man in sight she had felt okay but now that she had lost him her paranoia returned and she punched her way rudely up the stairs of the moving escalator as if running from someone she could not see get hold of yourself she cautioned internally knowing the dangers of such behaviorfear fed on fear and could run out of control in situations like this but she felt him back there like her brother chasing her as a child like her drunken uncle chasing her around her bedroom reaching out for herand she could not help but experience the terror of being caught wild with this fear she charged out of the escalator took the corner and ran to the next and final escalator up knowing somewhere within herbut not realizingthat the more she ran the more attention she drew to herself the easier a target as she entered the ticket line for the monorail with her heart in her throat she knew she wasnt thinking clearly she bought a roundtrip impatiently checking over her shoulder and then moved on to join the waiting crowd the monorail surged around the bend and slowed for its arrival her agitation increased with each passing minute the two train cars pulled to a stop and a handful of passengers disembarked a moment later she and the others crossed the steel catwalk into the train and took seats no one in a khaki windbreaker she realized to great relief the sliding doors clapped shut and she exhausted a huge sigh she moved forward to the lead car where there was more room instinctively distancing herself but the doors previously shut hissed open admitting three latecomers including a man in a khaki windbreaker whose back was already to daphne by the time she realized these others had boarded when she spotted that jacket she nearly let out a small scream but muzzled herself and faked a sneeze to cover she could not allow herself this kind of fear she knew that once a cop allowed him or herself this kind of paranoia it was difficult if not impossible to stop it you saw the faces of killers you had helped to convict in every crowd on every street you imagined where no imagination should be allowed she felt through her purse at her side to the small policeissue handgun it contained she collected her strength stood and walked back to this other car her full attention on the khaki windbreaker she passed the circular bench took a handhold on an overhead rail and turned to face him she stared at him until he finally looked up he was a small man midforties with a tiny scar by his left eye with boyish curiosity he said hi do you know me she asked not knowing where the words came from not recognizing him i think id like to he said why are you following me she asked he looked around nervously at the people around them all of whom daphne was using intentionally confront intimidate he could not do anything to her here what he replied if he was acting he was quite good go away she said or ill have you arrested she took one step away and then added as an afterthought if you know anything about me you know im capable of delivering on that listen he said but she would not give him any chance at an explanation the worst possible thing she could do she had just done responding to emotion rather than logic if he was for real she should have played him out should have arranged to have him followed to turn the tables on him to get something out of it instead she had felt the need to prove herself and had blown whatever advantage she might have had over him she handled this all wrong she knew all this and yet she felt satisfied as she sat back down because it had taken nerve to do what she had doneand right then she had needed proof of that nerve now she did not but now it was too late the monorail came to a stop after its brief trip to the seattle center she wandered the center for longer than she had intended keeping an eye on this man who paying her no mind whatsoever headed straight to a crafts show confusing her all the more with this confusion charging her system she headed toward the crafts fair at a full run to hell with the meeting she would follow him she would call in backup and stay with him but he was gone she spent ten minutes searching the grounds the rides a few of the displays he had disappeared again as quickly as he had at the westlake or maybe she thought glancing around quickly he was once again watching her only this time more cautiously this time vowing to make no mistakes the felt board outside the seattle centers planetarium was the kind used in hotel lobbies for seminar announcements it read next show noon with a listing of the planetariums regular summer schedule in a smaller white press type below the center was mobbed with families overcome by the interactive science exhibits providing the exact cover that boldt had hoped for in calling the meeting here boldt discreetly showed his badge and gave his name to a security guard who stood sentry by the planetariums door and getting the nod let himself in taplin and fowler were already waiting boldt had to convince adler to pay the extortion money he expected the man to flatout refuse the room was a twentyfootdiameter circular enclosure its perimeter entirely surrounded by a padded couch in its center was a large fixed desktop covered with an abundance of graymetal projection gear that looked to boldt as if it were straight off the set of buck rogers the room had only one entrance and it was soundproofed the two qualities that when combined with its extremely busy public setting made it the perfect location for a covert meeting boldt had seen the real show a few months ago while here to meet a snitch who had whispered right over the words of the collegeage woman with her redlight pointer narrating a voyage into the night sky pretty good show at thatterrific for the undertwelves miles would need a few years before he could get anything out of it you look a little whipped fowler said coming over to him taplin an open briefcase next to him was focused on a stack of papers on his lap youre supposed to sleep every week or so whether you need it or not fowler quipped glad to be out of it boldt asked am i out of it i feel like youre keeping me out of it he complained i didnt mean it like that i meant the department hang on fowler said pressing his finger into his left ear only then did boldt notice a tiny fleshcolored wire running from his shirt collar the boss is here fowler had his people in the area and as a result felt in control it bothered boldt who was accustomed to running things the padded door opened and adler entered howard taplin put the paperwork aside and stood he appeared to have lost another five pounds emaciated by stress and fatigue adler crossed the room and shook hands with boldt you look about like i feel he said sympathetically im not sure how to take that here comes trouble fowler announced and way off schedule i might add daphne entered looking frayed fowler locked the door behind her if youve got problems with your watch fowler said nastily well get you another i was delayed daphne said i was supposed to be tenminute intervals fowler reminded her you were due here before boldt i was delayed she repeated glancing at boldt who sensed immediately that something was terribly wrong lets get started taplin complained irritably we have a lot of ground to cover he handed both boldt and matthews a photocopy of a fax this is the first of the two faxes we received two boldt asked reading you broke the rules you have only yourself to blame i said no cops and i meant it fowler said ive got a staff of fifteen in a twoshift rotation three of the guys wore badges before this weve got experience weve got the best gear basically i think what mr taplin is thinking is that we should take over we cant risk any more killings youre trying to fire me boldt asked taplin daphne asked disbelievingly owen admonishing fowler adler said were here to discuss this no decisions have been made you cant fire the police boldt explained angrily he did not want to be forced into telling them about the murder of sheriff bramm longview farms had once had direct links to adlers former company though boldt was waiting for the lab report on the state health document before informing any of these three if we need to take additional precautions to prevent leaks we will it goes well beyond that taplin protested youre going to have to shut down your side of this investigationwhatever that entailsand turn it over to us mr fowler has been handling the details of our side of this investigation and has not involved the police once to my knowledgeso the leak certainly did not come from our side adler complained to his counsel lets dispense with this partisan attitude tap i dont like it one bit boldt saw no way around exposing the murder of sheriff bramm it was the only way to settle this were investigating the homicide of a law enforcement officer who may have been a victim of your blackmailer the murder occurred at longview farms sometime early last night adler fowler and taplin all shared expressions of shock no one spoke until boldt broke the silence i want to remind you that the evidence collected from the poisonings suggests an adler foods employee but this murder is now being investigated as well although we have no evidence yet to corroborate this we have to consider the possibility that a former longview employee or someone hired by one of the meriweather family is currently on your payroll and is perpetrating these crimes the point being that he killed a police officer whom we asked to look around the farm for usand that is what this fax is in reference to why werent we informed of this taplin complained we just were adler interjected losing his patience with his attorney his eyes betrayed his anger with the man what about your side of this boldt asked fowler have you gotten anywhere with possible employees past or present why havent i seen any reports ive got all that for you fowler said defensively pointing to the attorney he explained mr taplin was just going over it nothing looks very good i gotta tell you i was focusing on guysokay and then you throw this curveball that its a girl were afterthat foodland videoand there i am starting all over it takes time to do this without attracting attention you know that fowler asked what about the longview investigation matthews is continuing to look into the possibility of a longview connection boldt replied fowler glanced over at daphne and nodded if you need my help he offered thanks adler instructed lets show them the other fax howard boldt noted the harsh tone of voice and the use of taplins proper first name instead of the nickname tap the tension between these two was palpable another fax daphne questioned a second fax on the same day she attempted to clarify fowler shifted restlessly youre seeing em in the order we did boldt read mom s home recipe in pacwest by friday or hundreds will die sent to the same fax machine boldt asked adler confirmed with a disappointed nod boldt asked fowler what about callerid i take it you got a number a pay phone in the u district by the time we reached it whoever sent thishe she was long gone we should have been informed kenny boldt chastised furious to have been excluded thats what we have patrol cars for you didnt notify the police why wasnt he notified adler inquired he was doing a fair job of keeping his cool but he seemed right on the edge of losing it it was a matter of reaction time fowler explained i make the phone call boldt notifies dispatch dispatch notifies the radio cars ive been there sir he grimaced boldt got the feeling kenny fowler did not appreciate calling anyone sir the fastest most efficient way of handling this he said playing to adlers priorities was to jump right on it and handle it ourselves well it failedhows that for efficient next time adler corrected the police will be notified immediately are we all in agreement on that fowler flushed with embarrassment he did not like reprimands either boldt felt the meeting falling apart all three men seemed ready to go at one anothers throats boldt asked daphne what have we got it uses the same languagethis threat to kill hundreds it has to be taken seriously boldt knew her well enough to sense something troubling her but he was not going to push given their present company what bothers me adler said is that it seems such a chance to take just to send these faxesso why send two why not combine them maybe fowler theorized the extortion is what has been planned all along and it just took pushing him over the top to trigger the demand he put daphne on the spot by asking were the poisonings the setup first prove his power then move in for the real hitthe extortion daphne chose her words carefully glancing quickly to boldt and then back to fowler she repeated the extortion threat must be taken seriously this opening line is another reference to moms soup which fits his earlier style i think he means business my advice if thats what youre asking for is to pay the ransom demand taplin said out of the question we will not give in to acts of terrorism to adler he said sternly we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere boldt hurried to interrupt he asked fowler what about the bank account we havent done an end run on you concerning this bank account if thats what youre asking sure i could find out the particulars of the account through my contacts but i lack the kind of access you enjoy at these corporations so im leaving it to you boldt did not believe any of this adler and his company had more than enough banking contacts to endrun the police he assumed fowler was already looking into it and simply wanted to avoid the legal problems of admitting it boldt saw the incredible opportunity this extortion presented to the investigation realizing the importance of convincing adler to reach into his pockets and play the game he realized the current indecisiveness between taplin and adler could be made to work to his advantage and he believed adler would listen more closely to daphne than anyone in this room meeting eyes with her he asked how do we interpret this she stared at him briefly and answered its his first serious mistake he has allowed greed to cloud his agenda i disagree with mr fowler i dont believe he had this in mind all along i would say this came as an afterthought perhaps faced with a violation of his demands he realized he had one of two choices kill hundreds or turn up the heat i think he has elected the latter and in doing so i think what we learn from this is that he is indeed reluctant to deliver on this more serious threat of mass killings either he doesnt have the means to do so or hes lacking in will my interpretation is that he blinked we should take quick advantage of it if hes greedy enough we can use that against him taplin insisted we are not going to pay this company will not be held hostage besides we very well may have cut him off at the knees by changing the glueswhich admittedly we have you to thank for sergeant the product codes on the portland contaminations were all for cans produced prior to the glue change to date we have seen no contaminated cans post glue change this extortion attempt is nothing but an act of desperation hes out of bullets daphne said we dont know that he could easily have a stockpile of soupa hundred cans or morein which case the new glue means nothing the other thing of interest is this bank accountan established bank account hes not asking for a paper bag filled with cash for a dead drop in the bus terminal this bank account indicates premeditationa professionalism that must be taken seriously the demands have continually escalated are we seriously willing to challenge this person i would warn against taking such an action at this point in time pay the ransom play him out the fbi would tell you the same thing taplin stood rigidly tall and said in a cocky defiant voice and if we pay what happens if this is just the tip of the iceberg it often is she answered i dont have to explain to you that these producttampering extortions can continue for years im sure youve researched your position the h j heinz baby food case in england went on for over two years thirty thousand british pounds were paid out before they caught the man im familiar with the case taplin conceded it is exactly what we want to avoid toying with his threehundreddollar fountain pen the attorney said at some point enoughs enough this is not that time boldt cautioned turning his plea to adler if anything its just the opposite this is when to play along he met eyes with taplin and then adler you are both men who clearly understand opportunity you dont have your kind of success without knowing when to play and when to fold this isnt just another threat he said indicating the fax its an invitation hes handing us a realworld link to himself its exactly what weve been lacking a way to lure him in forget the glue and the soup and the bacteria hes requesting currency which by definition moves you move it into the account and he has to move it back out and when he does were waiting its that simple he can wire it boldt interrupted cutting off taplin before he constructed a compelling argument he probably thinks he can but well follow it this is the computer agehe cant do anything with that money without our knowing about it look he has made himself vulnerable this is our first decent chance at him dont take that away from us to adler he said excitedly hurriedly if you dont pay him all were likely to have is more killingsthats what hes promised us if you pay we have a trail to follow taplin complained if you give in to a demand like this and the press gets hold of it youre seen as weak these people never stop coming after you never its over adler appeared to be deep in concentration boldt elected silence adler met eyes with boldt and he seemed to be searching for the right answer the sergeant said if you give me the choice id rather follow a money trail than a string of slater lowrys adler checked his watch turned to taplin and said you know who comes to a place like thisa planetarium kids kids like my corky like your peter and emily kids like slater emerson lowry what if we push this guy over the top what if there are a couple hundred slater lowrys that were directly accountable for how do we live with something like that taplins expression was sullen i dont have an answer for that owen i do adler said he said kenny boldts right fowler answered to taplin he said i understand where youre coming from with this we do open ourselves up to all sorts of nightmaresbut they are financial nightmares not human ones its just like boldt says hes giving us the chance to switch tracks money instead of lives i think we jump on that kind of opportunity so do i adler agreed taplin a look of resignation overcoming him shuffled papers into his briefcase and snapped it shut refusing to meet eyes with boldt ill arrange the necessary deposits we should start small fowler said directing this to daphne half maybe make him keep the communication coming i can support that she agreed ill speak to the bank boldt said he thanked adler adding its the right decision adler rocked on his heels and said well see eighteen boldts hopes rode on a meeting he had set up with pacwest bank perhaps in setting up this bank accountwhich for good reason was presumed to be a dummythe tin man had inadvertently left them a clue to his or her identity it was for this reason that boldt invited daphne along to look for psychological clues in the facts of a bank account application as agreed they all left the seattle center separately boldt met daphne at her houseboat where they shared a pot of tea and planned the bank meeting boldt filled her in on the burning of longview farms i can hear it in your voice that you blame yourself for sending him there you cant do that lou we need you at a hundred percent something bothered you about the second fax youre changing the subject the subject is lou boldt what was it he asked refusing her it was a little thing no placing of blame all the others made a point of putting the blame back onto owen not this latest one and thats significant the assumption of responsibility is extremely significant yes he or she doesnt want to assume responsibility for these poisonings they are owens fault as long as they remain owens fault they can continue strangely enough the day they stop being owens fault were in trouble the guilt for these deaths could unravel him we dont want that to happen and you think this fax indicates that it has already happened he made it a statement she did not want to commit herself she blew on the tea and looked out her window at lake union and a pair of windsurfers like butterflies on the surface i think that receiving two faxes on the same day with one of them significantly different from all the others may just be enough to attract the interest of dr richard clements and if it does only that then were all better off hes the best lou we could use him theres something else he said noticing that look of hers which one of us is the psychologist is that an answer ive changed my mind about the wife she certainly didnt kill sheriff bramm and from the way you describe it that wasnt the work of a hired gun that was someone extremely angry a male yes you knew that she stated yes someone with a personal stake absolutely she moved restlessly on the stool chances are when he killed the sheriff he was symbolizing on owen it shows us the kind of anger were dealing with it shows us how volatile he is he wants to see him dead lou hell stay with this until he doesor until we catch him she looked away not wanting to show him her eyes maybe the bank can help us boldt said razors going to join us that should be interesting prosecuting attorney michael striker was of average height but he looked small because he had a small head and a small mouth he might have had his ears pinned as a child but they were fanning back out in middle age bent like leaves stretching for the sun people called him razor because his voice sounded like someone humming into wax paper wrapped around a comb at the end of his right arm he carried a metal claw that served as his hand as a barroom stunt razor would stack matchsticks into fourinchtall wooden chimneys using only his prosthesis when he was nervous it chattered involuntarily sounding like an eggbeater hitting the side of the bowl the support of the prosecuting attorney was critical to any investigation a pa did not run an investigation but he steered it in the necessary legal directions that winning convictions required the lead detectivethe primaryand the pa formed a team that was sometimes comfortable sometimes not most warrant affidavits went through the pa or were hotrodded directly to a judge with the pas approval being around michael striker when he was nervous took some getting used to as did adjusting to his volatile temper but boldt enjoyed the man he was among the top five pas in king county and some people had him picked for a superior court appointment within the year boldt matthews and striker were escorted to an elevator and shown up to the sixth floor where a set of fake trees and the faint twinge of disinfectant welcomed them to an executive wing lucille guillard a creamskinned black woman in her late twenties with a glorious french accent an exceptionally long neck and penetrating black eyes wore a blue linen suit and white blouse combo that could have been stolen from lizs closet an overriding confidence permeated a smile that was at once both expressive but controlled she shook hands all around offered them seats and got right down to business an assistant delivered three photocopies of the computerized account information a woman daphne was the first to notice boldt felt as if the wind had been knocked out of him the shopalert video had suggested the involvement of a woman but the torturehomicide of sheriff turner bramm had convinced him that he was after a man no such address striker declared ive got a cousin who lives in the fiftyninehundred block on the evennumbered side theres a park across the street from him theres no such number as to guillard he said sharply do you people ever check these things guillard bristled i am not new accounts she clarified as if it were a banking disease well lets see the original application were a little rushed strikers prosthesis began chattering were okay razor boldt said trying to calm him guillard reread her copy of the computerized sheet this account was opened last week that means that the original application would be destroyed by now destroyed striker inquired leaning forward in his seat what the hell do you mean destroyed razor boldt said he could feel the man about to explode she complained pacwest is a paperless workplace were all email and voice mailboxes around here not that i like it the bottom line for you guys is that the original application would have been scanned and downloaded to the mainframe in san francisco five working days after the account opened i can get you a facsimile of that originalthe quality is exceptionalbut not the original itself im afraid fucking bean counters striker complained you cant develop latent prints off a copy lady you know what were up against here a facsimile you think a facsimile is going to help the sergeant boldt said it was a long shot anyway mikey this is hardly ms guillards fault we had expected a bogus address a bogus name i would doubt that guillard said to striker she said sternly the applications are checked out striker objected you want to know what youre looking at here ten to one this name belongs to a recently deceased female the false identity gives this person a social security number that matches the name just in case your bank actually does run a checkwhich i still doubt federal agencies have taken steps for years to automate and crossreference their orbit databases in order to prevent what we call mortuary fraud but like banks they are a bunch of bureaucrats and they move about as fast as slugs and are about as intelligent daphne interrupted she would need a current mailing address wouldnt she for the statements absolutely if more than two statements are returned to us we suspend the account immediately for boldt guillards french accent turned her words into whipped cream but that means she has two months before you close the account daphne pointed out striker said thats what im telling you slow as slugs his right hand sounded like a fence gate in a strong wind if this address is fraudulent as mr striker is suggesting we will cancel the account today no boldt cautioned you mustnt do that guillard eyed him curiously confused daphne explained if an exception can be made we would prefer the account remain open i dont understand guillard complained of course you dont striker hollered jesus boldt grabbed striker by the arm and led him into the hall shutting the office door enough razor im sorry lou his metal claw ticked loudly you can see what she is a foreigner a minority a womanthats a quota position for christs sake shes an executive vice president razor one of twelve youre way out of line here striker was breathing heavily he nodded things have been shitty for me at home lou youre probably right why dont you talk to legalsee if we cant get any documentation on this account without jumping through the hoops and be professional about it razor we need these people yeah okay apologize for me striker headed to the elevator without another word boldt returned to the office and apologized profusely to ms guillard he said its personal problems we all have them guillard replied understandingly still i am glad he is gone she allowed a warm smile her eyes met the two of them this is something serious is it not for the moment im afraid youll have to go mostly on faith he hesitated and then informed her im with homicide mr striker is a prosecuting attorney and ms matthews is the police departments forensic psychologist were after a person who is committing particularly heinous crimes and this is the person youre after this sheila danforth possibly boldt conditioned we dont know that for certain she appeared more than a little overwhelmed in her smooth french accent guillard said very well how may i help you the application was made in person boldt asked hopefully checking the printout guillard said no by mail mail daphne asked it is done all the time nothing unusual there avoid the cameras daphne said to boldt exactly he answered then inquired of guillard and the opening deposit she located a code on the document and used her computer terminal to look it up postal money order daphne said difficult if not impossible to trace she thought of everything and this number boldt asked leaning over her desk and pointing it out to guillard a credit card if it was a credit card the charges could be tracedjust the kind of paper trail he was hoping for no it begins with the digit eight that is an atm card she replied she ordered an atm card boldt said uneasily by now she has it guillard informed him our latest marketing campaign have you not seen the advertisements we guarantee an atm debit card within two business days of opening a new account no usage fees no service fee for the first six months our competitors take several weeks to issue the cards and most charge a variety of fees two days daphne questioned two days if you pick it up at a branch office that is part of the marketing you see it provides our customer service representatives an opportunity to crosssell it has been an enormously successful campaign boldt knew that unlike retail outlets bank video surveillance systems worked on continuous twentyfourhour loops erasing the last twentyfour hours as they wentstopped and reviewed only in the event of a security problem the timing of the application the pickup of the atm card and the threat sent to adler all ensured the establishment of an anonymous bank account and a way to get at the funds that seemed to the layman nearly impossible to stop there have to be thousands of atms boldt let slip what is it guillard asked boldt rushed his words well need a full accounting of the atm card activity and the cards personal identification number he added quickly do we know if the pin was generated by your computers or selected by the customer she referenced her computer terminal typing the request an atm card seemed to boldt an ingenious method of collecting the ransom because they would have so little time to locate and prevent the withdrawals and with this thought came a sickening feeling in his stomach that boiled up into his throat and forced him to excuse himself and seek out the bathroom when he returned to guillards office he felt no better and he knew by daphnes troubled expression that he must have been very pale he lost more of his color when guillard informed him that she did not have the pin information immediately available its time boldt said daphne understood immediately she said to the woman ms guillard we need to tell you something in the strictest of confidence when we asked to see an account executive that eventuality was made perfectly clear so obviously you are a person to be trusted or your name would not have come up before we go any further however you should know that by coming into our confidence you are by default committing to what may be a longterm assignment possibly with a great deal of hours involved long days long hours theres no way to know but thats how it looks boldt said if you would preferfor any reasonfor us to work with someone else at the bank now is the time to say so you should think about this carefully youre with homicide she directed to boldt he nodded and youre a psychologist dealing with the criminal mind thats one aspect of my work yes daphne conceded she felt like telling her i try to keep the burnouts from eating their barrels i try to keep the marriages from falling apart and i try to help the junkies and alcoholics to save their badges she continued right now im trying to piece together a possible profile of whom we are after i will help you said the french woman west indies perhaps boldt thought youre sure he checked one last time this isnt murder she wrote this can get ugly daphne nodded briefly it seemed to him that none of them was breathing i want to help it is either a ransom or an embezzlement or a suicide am i correct or maybe all three daphne said may i he asked indicating the door he didnt want anyone to overhear what it was he had to say lucille guillards face registered shock concern and terror she hung her head and then looked at him with impassioned eyes and said shes going to get her ransom through the atms unless we use the atms to catch her boldt proposed the womans eyes began to track behind her thinking she did not look too convinced can we do that he asked daphne asked can she withdraw enough money for this to make sense she has one thousand dollars in her opening balance that does not qualify her as a personal banking customer mind you with this ransom demand of one hundred thousand dollars on deposit she will qualify for personal banking pbcs have a userdefined daily atm ceiling the card is really a debit card withdrawals are made against the account balance withdrawn from the same machine boldt asked the same machine yes the same transaction no do you see the difference the physical limit of any one transaction at an atm is four hundred dollars thats all four hundred that is not something we can override but is imposed by the manufacturer of the machine for a variety of security reasons so per transaction a total of four hundred but the number of concurrent transactions is dependent entirely on the imposed ceiling or the account balance depending on the type of account so it is possibletechnically possibleto get at the ransom through the atms boldt verified if the account is structured properly quite possible yes thousands a day i suppose if the customer set it up that way the highest daily ceiling that im aware of is ten thousand dollars that was requested by a rug merchant who uses the card for international buying in his case however he uses the machines infrequently its used more as a cash advance card and tracking the individual is that possible it is quite complicated the atm network do you know anything about it im afraid not boldt said daphne shook her head we can tell you where withdrawals have been made yes but realtime tracking poses significantly greater problems if she stays within the pacwest atm network perhaps we can identify fixed locations but if she accesses our network from another networks machines then the request is handled by the regional switching station here in seattlenetlinq by the time we see the request you would have no more than a few seconds in which to react a few seconds boldt echoed crushed by the news sounds like wed have to have a person watching every atm how many are there pacwest operates three hundred and seventy in the state roughly half of those are concentrated in an area within an hours drive of the city including downtown the number of machines handled by netlinq she asked opening a drawer and referencing a file she frowned and boldt felt it coming netlinq handles over twelve hundred machines between seattle and everett roughly five new locations are being added every two weeks an army boldt was thinking twelve hundred surveillance operatives at the peak of the green river killer investigation one hundred and forty law enforcement personnel had been involved it made his team of four look pretty damn small it made his stomach burn he popped two maalox some of our atms are equipped with cameras maybe that would help you still cameras and video it depends how many boldt asked hopefully more than half i believe and more in the metropolitan areas than in the country and we are installing cameras at more than three a week it is a top priority for us half it wasnt enough daphne sensing his despondency suggested a meeting with whoever was in charge of netlinq that would be ted perch guillard said he is not the easiest man to deal with especially for a woman you understand then i think ill pass daphne said she told boldt ill be at the office then home guillard said delicately i will call and see if he will see us let me explain something sergeant it was sergeant wasnt it perch delivered boldts rank as if it were one of the lower life forms as if he deserved much better we have always cooperated with law enforcement in the past and were happy to be of whatever assistance we can be butand boldt had heard the word comingif we interrupted the network for every extortion for every threat for every counterfeit card operation we might as well go fishing instead clear boldt had said nothing of the case he was on perch reminded him of a man who played racquet sports he had fast eyes that preferred lucille guillards hem length to boldts cool exterior brown hair that was washed too often and an athletic bag snugged up to his desk where everybody could see it the office was unexceptional except for a pair of watercolors of the san juans and an unspectacular view of i and a marina on lake union that almost counted as a water view perch had telephoned shoswitz in order to verify boldts identity he called lucille guillard lucy and he said it a little too smugly as if she considered him an intimate friend which she clearly did not from what guillard had told him boldts realtime tracking could only be accomplished through a coordinated effort between pacwest and netlinq this is not your everyday extortion boldt said ive worked with freddie guccianno a couple times perch admitted freddies not working this case boldt said freddies good people boldt hated that expression what is important ted lucille guillard said smoothly is that the bank and the switching station come up with a realtime environment that makes it possible for sergeant boldt to track certain withdrawals i understand that lucy but what im trying to point outto both of youis that realtime monitoring just isnt possible across the entire network no such software existsnot that i know of its just not something were set up to do what what lucy why are you looking that way at me it is something you must do at the moment sergeant boldt is asking politely none of us the police the bank wants to initiate legal steps the idea is that we cooperate ted perch looked a little hurt she knew more than he did and he did not like that and if he tried to look up her skirt one more time boldt was going to say something about it he nodded slowly at her made a sucking sound in his teeth and directed himself to boldt the way the system works is this sergeant the account in question is with pacwest clear if a pacwest atm is used to access this account as im sure lucy explained to you then that request goes directly to their server several verifications are made almost instantaneously the server okays the withdrawal and instructs the atm to dispense the cash whambam thank you maam but in the case of a pacwest customer using say a first interstate atm thats where we come in first the pinthe personal identification numberis encrypted by the machine so as it travels along these phone lines no one can grab it next the account number and a bin numberthe bank identification numberare routed directly on to the first interstate server in california which recognizes that the bin number is not theirs and they then route the request back to us our computers reroute the new request according to the bin numberin this case to pacwest pacwest confirms the account information and approves the withdrawal routing the approval and an individual authorization code through us back to first interstate which then instructs the atm to dispense the cash in some cases the request may pass through a national switch first and then be routed to us back to the national switch back to the bank in question at any rate this entire process ive just described takes threepointtwo seconds there are fourpointone million credit and debit cards in use in the northwest aloneand eighty million in the us and to give you an idea of volume of usage of the number of hits we receive atms in washington and oregon alone process one billion dollars a month that works out to somewhere around twenty million dollars a day during the short weekfifty million dollars a day friday saturday and sunday thats four hundred thousand hits per day and you want us not only to pull an individual hit on this system but pull it realtime are you beginning to see my problem his intention had been to mow boldt down with the facts and figures and he did just that four hundred thousand withdrawals a day the number fifty million rang in his head have we met before perch asked as if boldt had just walked through the door no you look damn familiar to me do you play racquetball piano jazz piano a club am i right the big joke exactly i knew id seen you before to lucille guillard he said hes good to boldt he said youre very good happy hour right boldt thanked him and pointed out that he had to drop the piano when a case like this came along a case like what youre not fraud are you sergeant not unless you just transferred i know the guys from fraud believe me homicide boldt said it was a word that hit most people sideways and ted perch was no exception he actually jerked his head back as if hed been struck the big leagues he said just another division what is this thing blackmail no extortionright right bet someones dead perch guessed or what would you be doing here someones dead boldt confirmed maybe others if we dont hurry if peoples lives are at stake thats different we need your help lucille guillard said earnestly the problem is that by the time a realtime system identifies a hit sergeant boldt has about ten secondsor lessto apprehend this person boldt added and thats not enough not even close slow down the entire system perch queried a its not possiblenot that i know of and b i would be hanged if the system goes down for five minutes it makes the news these days people have gotten used to atms they expect them to work twentymillion a day dont forget does it have to be the whole system couldnt we isolate just these requests boldt asked it doesnt work like that sometimes there are two three even four atms installed right alongside one another whats this person going to think when his transaction takes forever and the guy next to him receives service as usual let me tell you something people have builtin clocks when it comes to atms they know how long a transaction is supposed to take the average transaction takes twelve seconds you stretch it to forty and a guy like this someone jerking the system around is going to notice plain and simple hes gone boldt was glad that perch had the gender wrong guillard said but if the whole network were to slow down or at least every request in the city what then ted so it makes the papers for a couple of days boldt agreed oddly enough that kind of publicity might help us might convince him its a regional problem help you maybe itd get me fired i can tell you that but its all moot anyway ive never heard of such a thing you cant just slow down the network by flipping some switch that is what i told the sergeant but i was hoping you might know more than i do she hit perch right where he lived he wanted to know more than she did and he didnt see the trap she had laid for him we have some software techs i could ask them our people are looking into it too she said adding a sense of competition ill need permission from the nationals perch said already a step ahead there would be some serious explaining to do were long on people capable of serious explanations that shouldnt be a problem boldt offered perch suggested let me circle the wagons how soon you need this lucille guillard recrossed her legs and perch didnt even notice that was when boldt knew he had him nineteen someone was watching her daphne had studied enough paranoids had worked with some and knew the symptoms well symptoms she now displayed a heightened nervousness the constant checking over her shoulder insomnia loss of appetite the suspicious pauses to stop and listen but it was an energy and she understood energy an energy focused on her and if she were imagining this then she intended to compliment her imagination because this was like nothing she had ever experienced back there somewhere over there she wasnt sure it seemed at times to be all around her at others to be in a specific placeyet when she checked no one it made her skin crawl this feeling and it wasnt just while out on a run which was where she was at the moment it was in the bedroom in the carshe felt it when undressing even in the bathroom which is where she changed clothes the rest of her houseboat made her feel naked before she took off a thing this filled her with a nauseating fear a sense of violation she had not known was that the same car she wondered it looked awfully familiar had it been parked across from the dock entrance to the houseboats what was it japanese detroitjapanese she wished she were better with cars it was the same color she thought same size dark blue small nondescript just the kind of car one would use for surveillance just the kind of paranoid thinking that could get you in big trouble conspiracy visionthere were all sorts of slang terms for it oliver stone disease she had once heard it called and that one had made her laugh no longer she broke with her regular tuesday evening running route and turned right up galer and right again onto eastlake a procedure similar to the consecutive four righthand turns used to spot moving surveillance when in a vehicle she glanced over her shoulder watch it a voice cried out inside of her that was symptom number one she ran another quarter mile and literally leapt into the air when a blue car overtook her from behind a different blue car she realized quickly enough upset with herself she turned around cutting short the run it was dusk it would be dark by the time she got back and whereas normally her run would take place after work and therefore under the streetlights tonight the idea bothered her it cut her run nearly in half but she could make up the difference tomorrow daphne ran hard working up a good sweat pushing herself to go a little harder today since she had cut it short her gymnasiumgray tank top was soaked dark below her breasts and down her back her hair stuck to her neck and her white wristband was damp from sponging her brow typically she used her runs as meditationsa quiet break devoted to nothingness to thinking as little as possible she waved to a walker thankful for a familiar face and the woman waved back at her with a broad smile although they had never formally met she knew all about this womanthe houseboat community was like that the woman was an md who volunteered her time at a local clinic for the poor her husband was a former minister turned author they lived in a small houseboat though it was one of the more charming oneswith very few pretensions and they waved at you when out for a walk a scruffy dog crossed the road lazily either not seeing or not caring about a sleek black cat that sat atop a shingled mailbox house at the end of pier she walked the last hundred yards peeked into her mailbox for the second time today and headed down the dock halfway down the long dock her skin crawled and she blamed it on a light breeze off the lake and the slight chill it induced whether attributable to caution or paranoia she took inventory of her houseboat as she approached it was tiny less than eight hundred square feet but with the proportions that created an illusion of a house twice its size from behind her came the constant drone of traffic from the interstate distant but intrusiveit seemed so much closer at this moment edges and corners seemed sharper her motion seemed to slow despite the quickness of her heartbeat this increased awareness had come all of its own and yet daphne matthews the psychologist knew better something had triggered thisnothing came all of its own the cop she worked with in a survivors clinic described similar sensations moments before a firefight but boldt would talk instinct daphne would talk reflex she had caught something out of place perhaps a sound a smell an image she fell victim to this stimulus misinterpreted or not the air smelled of charcoal she heard a seaplane taking off in the distance and much closer the nauseating laugh track of a television show her face felt hot from the run her skin itched her mind worked furiously trying to sort things out at the same time she began an internal dialogue chastising herself for being such a paranoid what a baby she also wrestled with the internal voices of several friends lou boldt among them who had once attempted to talk her out of buying a houseboat the investment had silenced her criticsthe place was worth a fortune now and her timing couldnt have been better but it was an isolated location and tonight in particular it felt just a little too removed get in the house she told herself she bent to retrieve the key that she had tied to her shoelace get in the house her mind repeated more loudly she unlocked the door leaving it slightly ajar until she got the light on and hurried to the nearest lamp on the entrance table along with her purse inside the purse was her gun this thought did not escape her the light flashed brightly and diedthe bulb had blown she felt a gust of wind at her back the front door thumped shut of its own accord startled she leapt over to it and swiveled the dead bolt locking it issuing darkness nothingnot even the pitch blackwas going to convince her to open that door again safe she inched carefully forward the picture of the downstairs emblazoned in her mind directly ahead the living room a center post in the middle of the room a small sofa and end table a rocker the wood stove to her right the narrow ladder ascending to the tiny bedroom and its balcony to her left the small galley demarcated by a blue tile countertop with two ash stools looking across the jennair range around the galley the head to the leftand opposite this a small hall flanked by two closets and the back door directly ahead her eyes beginning to adjust she reached out and found the arm of the rocking chair good she knew exactly where she was some light off the lake found its way through the window behind the sofa though not enough to help the room oozed with a gray ghostly paste she inched ahead and slightly to her left and brushed up against the rough wood of the rooms central support post small waves lapped against the pier sounding like an animal licking the floats the refrigerator hummed loudly the lamp she sought remained a few feet to her right and then directly ahead its fuzzy image loomed before her she crossed the room just as she reached the lamp she heard a board squeak it came from the back of the house past the galley by the head she reminded herself that the houseboat was always making such noises on any other night she might not have noticed a squeak but that particular sound was as individual as distinct as the voice of a friend a year or so ago rain had leaked in under the back door and had warped the floorboards when stepped on one of the wide pine planks and only one chirped like a birdthe sound she had just heard with her thumb on the lamp switch and her voice caught somewhere between hello and a scream she froze it must have been something else a voice inside her reasoned its nothing right but the voice warned a person has to step on that board for it to make that sound her heart hurt in the center of her chest her ears burned im overtrained she thought as a dozen instructions from her police training flooded her head noisily paranoid is all each idea separate and individual she processed them differently sorting out contradictions as best she could get out of the building call someone seek help turn on the light and see its nothing go for the gun then turn on the light her gun was in her purse and her purse was on the table by the front door indecision plagued her she despised herself for just sitting therea policewoman frozen in fear she crouched held her breath and switched on the lamp she didnt look toward the source of that noise first she looked toward her purse she processed more information a few steps to get there a few added milliseconds to flick the safety off and load one into the chamber from the moment she made her move to having a functional weapon in hand perhaps five seconds an eternity if someone is inside this house a lifetime a good cop could not afford indecision and if that was the only measure of a good cop then she was not a good cop indecision had provided her with a fourinch scar across her throat she hated that scar not only for its appearance but because she wore it like a flag indecision at this point all she wanted was to prove herself wrong that squeak had been nothing she wanted a hot shower a warmedup dinner and a glass of pine ridge on the deck after that a good book with every door and window locked tight tomorrow a security system courtesy of kenny fowler her feet felt nailed to the pine planks the light which had been on perhaps two seconds went out she grabbed for it and threw the switch nothing silence she thought not even the refrigerator was running the power was out the board squeaked again she moved fast two quick bounding steps she planted her forehead smack into the center post and went down hard and fast head swimming nauseated and dizzy she imagined dinosaurs in a tar pit struggling to get out sinking deeper black and gooey she didnt know how much time had passed if any she struggled to her feet and clawed her way over to the gun she announced in a slurred voice im armed i have a weapon go away now training arms sagging with the weight of the gun her head swimming go away now she mumbled she fell to one knee and struggled back up to standing feeling a thousand pounds heavier her head complained with the slightest movement she inched her way forward her right toe feeling in front of her go away now she repeated in an unconvincing voice that sounded to her like someone else talking her left hand searched out the flashlight that she kept in the kitchen drawer with the knives she plunged her hand inside the drawer shit she said as she caught a knife blade on the tip of her finger and yanked her hand out quickly instinctively delivering the cut to her lips and sucking on it she switched on the flashlight its beam a white tunnel splashing a large circle on the walls but her vision was all wrong sweating heavily heart beating furiously she staggered uncertainly out of the galley and pivoted left bracing for a shot no one slowly she lowered the intense beam of light until it illuminated the warped plank responsible for the bird chirps she gasped as she saw beads of water catching the light like jewels this was not her imagination someone was inside assess the situation she had a percent chance the intruder could be to her left hiding in the head or to her right down the small hall about to go out the back door she hadnt heard the back door open or close and although it wasnt a terribly noisy doormight have been opened and closed without her knowledge the intruder goneshe didnt believe this think but she could not im armed she repeated this time more strongly her strength returning she leapt ahead spun completely around and slapped her back into the cornerthe head now to her right the back door nearly straight in front of her no silhouette she shined the flashlight there no one hiding in one of the closets or is he gone did he get out without me hearing she summoned her courage maintaining a firm but awkward grip jointly on both the gun and flashlight she spun to her right first aiming into the headnothing and then in selfdefense spinning fully around and covering the closets the quick motions drove her to the edge of vomiting the intruder made contact from behindpushed her hard she screamed loudly as she lost her balance her furtive glance into the head had been too quick he must have been standing in the tub she realized as she struck the opposing wall facefirst she heard two heavy steps the back door come open and then two more footsteps in her minds eye she could see the intruder leaping to the next platform the adjacent house then no doubt the next after that and the next too fast to be stopped in the shadows too dark to be seen she clambered back to her feet and surged forward and out the back door handling the gun with great care she knew she had lost him but her training and her nerves required her to determine the area was clear she made no attempt to try to follow or catch up her intention was selfdefense the area was clear there was enough ambient light here to see she reentered the house shut and locked the back door and hurried to the front door which was still locked she found the flashlight shook it several times but it did not respond dark trembling her heart now running away from herslipping into shockshe came around the corner found a chair that offered her back against a solid wall her eyes on the front door the back door down the short hall to her right and she dragged the phone toward her by its cord twenty minutes later she unlocked the door for boldt as she heard him running down the dock shining a flashlight on her he said jesus daphne said the fuse box is inside the closet by the back door i wasnt about to go back there a moment later boldt called out do you have enough coats it made her laugh made her feel better so did the light coming on the refrigerator growled back into operation a digital clock on the microwave blinked clock at her boldt came around the corner wearing her faux leopardskin hat salvation army time if you ask me daphne laughed it hurt her head he noticed her wince gotta get you some pictures taken he said meaning x rays id rather have a glass of wine he poured her one he said im not going to harp on it but i do think you should have that looked at maybe later okay its your call you must make a nice husband she said she did not mean anything more than to give out a compliment but the comment made boldt uncomfortable anyway it made him think of liz and miles at home where he had left them with barely any explanation it made him think of owen adler then he looked at her forehead again and said did he get anything havent looked she said she locked eyes with him and stated it isnt your standard breaking and entering not when they pick a cops house it isnt i dont mean like that she tried the wine it tasted good she drank some more then how do you mean it im being followedstalkedi dont know someones out there another sip that someone was in here im sure of it he did not argue he did not question he went to work for boldt it was sometimes the only thing he knew boldt conducted a thorough search of the house daphne was a compulsively neat person so he assumed it would not be difficult to spot a burglars handiwork the bedroom was tidy the galley he had already seen he checked the bathroomthe headand the back hall and closets daphne sat all the while a bag of ice pressed against her forehead the wine in the glass getting lower his second time through the house gloves on he opened drawers checked shelves and closets he had not done any robberyburglary work in years but it came to him naturally he had searched too many homicide crime scenes to count the third time through the residence he concentrated on minutiaelooking for smudges on the glass of doors and windows crawling hands and knees across floors alert for everything from bodily discharge to spilled change or a receiptor even pet hair daphne did not own a pet if she were being stalked by a parolee it meant one kind of danger if it was someone attracted to her looks another entirely for reasons that went mostly unexplained washington state and the greater seattle area in particular attracted more than an average share of what the papers called psychos daphne and her colleagues used different terms but to boldt it all boiled down to the same thing sick people often violent often targeting women and when they snapped their crimes were among the most heinous it was during this third inspection that boldt discovered the charred electrical outlet in the head and the small drops of water next to the sink without telling her he checked the toilet thoroughly as well as the showertub stall in case the stalker had used these masturbation was often the last step prior to the acting out of whatever violent act was planned when boldt had completed his search he pulled up a chair alongside daphnes and said why dont you tell me about it she chuckled nervously you sound like me thats how i often get a therapy session going he waited her out he knew she had to be terribly afraid no matter what exterior she presented after a difficult silence she encouraged him why dont you go first please your visitor knew your schedule well enough to enter while you were on your run she looked goodtoo goodin the tight jog brahalter top and shorts but he said nothing they could deal with what she could do defensively later a baggy tshirt and running pants was a place to start you cut your run short he said this comment snapped her head toward him how did you know that she asked incredulously to put it bluntly if he had meant to harm you to assault you then i think he would have tried we both know that you can hear a person approaching right he was already in the bathroom where are you going to head after a run he asked rhetorically so all he had to do was wait youre not going to carry a weapon with you on the way to the shower but he wanted out see thats why after your description i thought it was a burglary maybe a wellplanned one it would fit with your feeling of being watched he determines your schedule times your run and breaks in after a few days of sizing you up but you surprise him by cutting your run short when you open the front door he freezes then he decides to get the hell out of there the door moved she interrupted remembering the front door moved closed he told her yes but how in a place this small and relatively tight when one door opens it moves air it moves doors or a curtain in a window i think i knew that instinctively when it moved i was scared i locked it immediately he was trying to get out but he looked backhis eyes were more adjusted than yours theres a nightlight in the head there you go he looks backhes left something next to the sink he doesnt want you to find it he didnt move after that he stood very still just inside the back door which explains the small puddle of water if you had come looking he would have been out of there in a flash but if he could pull it off whatever he had left was worth going back for i think we can be quite sure of that but i didnt come looking i tried to find a light that worked exactly and so he seized the opportunity he stepped back into the house and you heard him i hate this guy she crossed her arms fighting a chill as you tried to find a light the intruder crossed back into the bathroom i heard the floorboard exactly and i turned on the light you can imagine his panic but hes a fast thinker theres a basket of bobby pins and whatnot on the bathroom counter hes wearing gloves we know hes wearing gloves because he takes the bobby pin spreads it reaches around the corner into the hall and puts the bobby pin into the live wall socket hes lucky this is a small house and he shorts out all the downstairs outlets including the light you turned on the place goes dark again again he makes for the door i hear him and i run she felt suddenly colder perhaps it was not the sweat boldts descriptions enabled her to visualize the intruder she felt violated she felt lucky to be sitting here drinking wine but he hears you smack into that beam fall over the chair he hesitatesjust an instantunsure what to do youre too fast for him suddenly youve got a gun its doubtful he has one the law views breaking and entering without a weapon so much more leniently but in any case he didnt come here to be shot or to shoot you things are definitely looking bad and now here you come shouting your warnings as you said you did and hes in troublea cornered rat and all that but the point is he caught himself are you okay youre a little too good at this she said it wasnt you was it she forced a smile but winced with the pain it caused her well you know the rest she stood out of her chair and faced boldt arms crossed he knew that same look in liz need a hug she nodded he wrapped his big arms around her and pulled her tightly to him unreservedly unashamed unconnected to their past and that evening when they had done this without clothes she did not want to cry she returned the hug and buried her face her hair smelled like sweat a boat motored slowly across the lake she thanked him he said softly why dont you point me toward a newspaper you get yourself showered and dressed lets get you settled okay id like that but i hate to take your time after that we need to talk some more she nodded do you want to report this officially i mean i dont want to discourage that you have every right no lou no thanks ive been there youre asking do i want to stay up until two in the morning do i want to answer a hundred questions id rather not do i want to make a huge scene all in order to never catch this guy i dont think so still its not right of me to discourage you i can do that all by myself youre sure absolutely im a big girl now but if you would stay have you eaten we eat early miles he explained right id like to use the phone if its all right she nodded she went upstairs and he heard her undressing and he thought maybe he should go but he did not a few minutes later she descended the ladder stairs with an unavoidable amount of leg showing and headed straight to the shower without comment boldt sat with her as she ate warmedup leftovers and drank another glass of wine she glanced up at him occasionally and smiled through her eyes while chewing i feel kind of silly she said you sure you wont have something tell me if youre ready id like to hear she set her fork down took some more wine and nodded he saw that she was going to have a bruise on her forehead though maybe not too bad and if she kept up the ice as she was the lump might not be there in the morning sitting this close to her both on stools at the galleys food bar he could see the dozens of flecks of gold and red in her otherwise brown eyesmagical sparks that seemed to increase in candlepower with her enthusiasm she had a ferocious amount of energy of reserve power that at times seemed boundless she stepped him through her experience leading up to the monorail ride it took boldt some getting used to that the planetarium meeting had taken place only yesterday if he had been told a week he might have believed it she also described how she had lost the man in the crafts fair she told him about the blue car she had seen what seemed like one too many times and then she confessed her general state of paranoia over the last few days i dont know that a man can understand it she said women come to feel when they are being gawked at it is something society condones men undressing women with their eyes call it a zipless fuck whatever the term when youre on the receiving end from the age of twelve or thirteen on you develop a real sense for itat least i have the thing of it is i feel as if the person can see whats underneath the clothing does that make sense i feel violated more than once ive felt like just ripping my shirt open and getting it over with the fifth floor is the worst present company excluded i find cops the worstand im surrounded by them but the point is i know when someone like michael striker is looking down my blouse and thats the way i have felt for the last three or four days just like that as if someone has a pair of binoculars trained on me as if someone is in the room with me when im undressingwhen im in the showerall the time like im being stalked thats the only way i know how to explain it someone back there someone creepy someone all over me like an oil you cant wash off and then the car and yesterday morning and now this i know it looks like a burglary lou especially from a male point of view but i dont think so i cant tell you what i cant tell you why i wish to hell i could tell you who but someones out there and hes got my name written all over himher voice crackedand i want it over with her eyes were pooled she pushed her plate away her appetite ruined boldt felt responsible in a strange way he even felt responsible for what was happening to her i know i havent got a shred of proof she said reading his thoughts you confronted the guy on the monorail yes and what did your feelings tell you then id like to tell you that i felt as if i were looking into the eyes of jack the ripperbecause ive seen those eyes before i know that look and there is often a look but truthfully there wasnt in this one he seemed embarrassed put on the spot weird thing is for a moment there i even felt as if i knew him as if wed met but thats the thing about a stalker you seeabout the good ones the ted bundysthey know how to project that air of safety old friends good buddies hop in the back of my van and ill rape and murder you ill tear your liver out and eat it for dinner good friend you know what shoswitz would ask boldt said am i overworked under stress sure i know and if it wasnt me id be sent to me for a little chat to see whats up but it is me and i am under stress and i am overworked but no i honestly believe it has nothing to do with that good enough for me it is daphne said probably not for him i know but its you i care about anyway boldt asked do we talk about what neither of us is comfortable talking about that this may be related to your new leaf work i want another glass of wine but if i have one im likely to start belly dancing in the living room or maybe ill just pass out ever carried a woman up a ladder ill leave you on the couch he said standing and bringing the bottle of wine over for her anesthesia youre allowed this once in a while he poured it really sucks that im not allowed to see owen i feel real sorry for you he said sarcastically jealous maybe i am just a little her eyes warmed those flecks sparkled and she was about to say something but she caught herself he wanted to hear it but he knew it was better that he did not he felt no confusion about his emotions or desires but that did not mean he could not love this woman just a little more than was acceptablenot as long as he kept it to himself and maybe she kept it to herself too he reminded you first sensed this three or four days ago you said to both of us that feels more like a week do you remember back three or four days ago can you separate it out were going to talk about it she said their exchanges suddenly quicker yes he affirmed we are you think its connected to my work on new leaf i think it may be i think its worth exploring she ran her hand through her hair in a nervous manner someone knows what im up to and doesnt like it is that it is that how it goes several people know what youre up to many more may suspect it maybe that guard at the archives said something maybe kenny or taplin saw you pass those keys but hasnt said anything maybe theres an employee who figured it out an employee involved in the original fraud its serious stuff what youre suggesting people would have positions to protect do not bring owen into this i didnt say anything he protested he waited a second and said what he had to say what had been on his mind for several days now was adler in on it has he said anything to you she gasped and the warmth in her eyes froze over she stiffened and nearly spit at him some things need not be asked she averted her eyes and said do you think i would keep something like that from you how can you possibly think that i think it would put you in a difficult position you wouldnt indict him without some damn good proofnot if youre human and maybe youd look elsewhere for the proof if things got a little too warm where you were looking and maybejust maybe is allyou would ask him at some point and he would say that hed rather you didnt and what then where does that leave you she softened some well it hasnt happened like that its longview farms im focused on he confessed the new leaf situation is of interest to me only insofar as that if it proves truethat state health or someone at new leaf deliberately altered records to throw blame onto longviewthen theres all sorts of places i can run with that weve talked about it and what happened out there yesterday bears it out i think and maybejust maybewhoever was involved in document tampering at either state health or new leaf if anyone is also involved in this present situation crime makes strange bedfellowswe both know that more than one person theres a woman involved weve all but confirmed that is she alone in this is she working with a boyfriend a lover the sheriff said the psychologist i just dont think a woman would have done that not what i saw those burns she said he nodded his genitals no his face yes she considered this the face i dont like that not for a woman id have to agree you may be right where the hell does that leave us i can put someone on you he offered changing the subject watch for someone watching she said sarcastically with the dozens of people at your disposal you have to spare who do you have in mind sergeant or maybe fowler could if you asked adler hed do it she finished for him is that what you think youre probably right she admitted but theyre rentacops for the most part if there is someone watching meand mind you i hate that ideaand we scare him or her off then weve lost whatever we had but on the other hand he countered if they caught the person and we could have a little chat we might be lightyears ahead point taken she said i could fax owen and ask he offered her an expression that said i would if i were you and meanwhile sergeant we tear into longview farms physically we already have the lab is busy on a dozen fronts but i mean historically we find the wife we find the people who worked there we chat up the neighbors the meat inspectors the ups driver anyone and everyone my bet is that thats where were going to find our boy boy he mocked you get this feeling when youre a homicide dick and new leaf yes i think we keep going you keep going if youre up to it we want that connection if its there from where im sitting we want whatever the hell we can come up with the sheriff she said coming back to boldts nightmare police involvement he warned us and i blew it you didnt blow anything he gave her a look enough was enough he knew what he knew you okay he asked coming off the stool fine get out of here she teased you sure go he leaned over and kissed her on the cheek she blew him one back she stopped him when he reached the door just one thing sergeant he turned to her you might want to take that hat off before someone sees you he felt up there realizing he had been wearing itlooking stupidfor the better part of two hours jesus he said throwing it at the rocking chair you could have said something yes i could have she admitted laughing and wincing with the pain twenty on wednesday morning two weeks since daphne had involved him in the case boldt was in the midst of dealing with the first atm withdrawal when lamoia arrived and made his announcement this first hit had come at eleventhirty the night before twelve hundred dollars had been withdrawn in three consecutive transactions the nearest surveillance personnel had been eleven blocks away by the time this undercover cop reached the first atm a second machine was hit this time another ten blocks away the dance had continued for ninety minutes at the end of which thirtysix hundred dollars had been withdrawn the police never anywhere near a transaction it was an embarrassing display of boldts lack of manpower shoswitz was chewed out by captain rankin and in turn spoke his mind to boldt they would have to do better boldt thought one answer might be the atm cards pin number lucille guillard the pacwest bank executive had informed him that the pin number had indeed been requested by the account holder people requested specific numbers because they were easier to remember and they were easier to remember because they held some significance to the account holder therefore boldt reasoned this numberheld some significance to the killer it was a piece of evidence that boldt intended to follow data processing was presently searching these four digits against phone numbers drivers licenses vehicle registration numbers social security numbers other credit card pins active credit card account numbers and bank account numbers he even went so far as to request a list from the washington state department of revenue for all individuals born on august or january the postal service was to provide the names of any individuals owning post office box number he used the tax assessors office to generate the names of residents at any addresses that included somehow this number meant something to the killer and boldt was pursuing every possibility lamoia charged through the security door that accessed the fifth floors homicide unit looked around quickly and shouted to boldt i found a witness boldt led him around the corner and into the privacy of a tiny interrogation room that smelled like sweat and cigarettes when lamoia became excited his brown eyes grew large his face thinned and his voice cracked okay so heres the thing im doing an interview right i mean typical wasp housewife volvo hardwood floors you know the type and when i introduce myself at the door she kind of sags right like shes seen cops before maybe too often im thinking her husbands a drunk or a gambler or is a regular at vice or maybe hes using or dealing or something and shes worried sick we get talking about foodlandbecause shes one of the ones shoppingone of the ones on the list of thirtyfourand shes noticeably upset right and she is a major strikeout i mean before i can ask her the question this one is already shaking her head at me and glancing toward the door you know the kind she wants me gone im thinking maybe the husband is expected home early then im thinking maybe its hermaybe shes getting some on the side what do i know but shes a mess and then i hear the back door and the mother practically does an exorcist thing with her necklike an owltrying to cop a look into the kitchen but i beat her to it right and who do i see but her her boldt inquired our vidqueen miss foodland the one with the floppy hat and the pierced ears her boldt repeated excited now youre thinking theres no way i could make her considering we hardly got a look at her in that videobut what im telling you you know me right i know women what can i say weve all watched that video how many times and this macnamara girl had the exact same moves right down to the way she turned her head when she saw her mother talking to me and another thing she knew i was a cop you know what im saying you can feel it she knewand she wasnt sticking around to small talk did you interview her hell no a minor the mother seeming the protective type figured youd want to maybe try for a warrant see if we could turn up the clothes we saw in the video wed never get a warrant boldt said the detective reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a sheet of paper striker took care of it said because shes a minor and wed never get a look at her record without someone like him requesting it her record a minor boldt asked shes a klepto seven arrests for shoplifting in the last six months and i mean klepto drugstores department stores hardware storesyou name it bigticket items stuff its damn near impossible to get out of a store without getting caught so maybe its a game for her but if shes a kleptomaniac boldt began then chances are she was lifting not putting poisoned soup onto the shelves which means shes not our suspect but she may have seen him the timing is right after all theres only a sevensecond envelope during which someone put those five cans of soup onto the shelf when can we interview her do we know that the girl will be home shes on a juvenile homerelease program summer school and not much more comes home from school and stays put at least shes supposed to that foodland tape is timestamped holly was a bad girl she wasnt supposed to be in that store boldt explained if shes been picked up for shoplifting this many times a quiet chat in her mothers living room is not going to get us anywhere youre probably right lamoia agreed what id like to do is hit the house hard a really thorough searchsomething to shake her up something she hasnt seen and i want her watching i want her there then we bring her up here to the box and let razor read her the gospel then i chat her up and hopefully she sits up and flies straight and if she doesnt we book her on violation of home release we print her and stripsearch her and toss her into a jumpsuit and let her spend the night in the juvenile pen then boldt said we go at her again youre certainly in a charitable mood lamoia replied within the hour boldt sat down with one mildred macnamara mother of their possible witness boldt held up the large clear plastic bags containing her daughters clothing and if the mother had herself been a detective assigned to the fifth floor she might have also noticed that the various labeling of the bags lacked a case numberthis because the adler blackmail was still not in the book was still in many bureaucratic ways an unofficial case this hat and jacket were found in your daughters wardrobe why arent we on the juvenile floor she asked because im homicide and im running this case and your daughter is a possible suspect dear lord she broke down boldt slid a box of tissue in front of her what about her attorney as lead detective im in a pretty unique position ms macnamara what i say goespretty much anyway which means that if i say holly walks out of here with no charges then thats what happens i dont understand i need to talk to your daughter as an adult on her own have you ever known an attorney to simplify a situation think about that they may help you but they always complicate matters in matters of juvenile crime there are so many gray areas right nowlegalisticallythat if we bring in the attorneys were both going to be here for a month of sundays and chances are im going to be required to charge your daughter just in order to speak to her i dont want that holly doesnt want another charge on her pink sheet and i have a hard time believing you would either of course not but how holly violated the terms of her most recent sentencing we have proof of that and as ive read it that was pretty much a last shot for her the woman confirmed this with a nod so basically all i have to do is charge her and eventually ill get my interview with her but cards out on the table i cant wait until eventually so what im asking for is written permission from you for me and some of my colleagues to ask her a few questions it isnt much from your side of thisi know that all i can do as a parent is give you my word that if theres any way to avoid charging her then thats the way itll work out but there are no guarantees he added reluctantly honestly came at a price there was no need to tell her that the search of her daughters belongingsan exhaustive onehad offered no proof of any connection to pacwest bank or an atm account the search had however uncovered a hidden stash of stolen goods from cds to jewelrythe knowledge of which boldt kept to himself to be used as a crushing blow should he need it this single lack of discovery seemed to support lamoias theory that holly macnamara had been in that aisle within seconds of the drop having taken place but was not herself responsible may i call my husband boldt told her she could do whatever she pleased but repeated to her what he had told betty lowry two weeks earlier that the husband might overreact and if so hollys chances for clemency were lost i dont know she gasped and broke into tears again boldt found room to really hate himself he waited her out and when he saw the faintest of nods slid the minors consent form in front of her and asked her to press hard its in triplicate he said like everything else around here hoping to win back a smile but admitting to himselfcorrectly as it turned outthat there was little hope of this i dont like you sergeant and if youve lied to me if youve tricked me she said pushing the form toward him then youre no better than the people you go after boldt took the form and hurried from the room holly macnamara sat quietly with daphne on the other side of the cigarettescarred table in interrogation room a boldt and lamoia faced them and everyone sat in uncomfortable straightback metal chairs the large plastic bags containing the hat and the dark coat with the hidden pockets sewn into its hem were in full view like a thanksgiving turkey boldt switched on the tape recorder named those present and stated the time and date striker joined them a few minutes late his prosthesis clicking nervously and boldt added his name to the tape too holly macnamara met boldt with a steelyeyed determination that he hoped miles would never adopt too hard for her young age too brooding too suspicious and far too selfconfident given her present situation she had dark eyebrows high cheekbones and long dark hair she had some acne that she hid with cosmetics and her bottom teeth held a retainer a child in a grownups game she wore silver studs in her ears and was quite confused when boldt opened the discussion by asking her to remove them it didnt help boldt to connect her to the woman in the video but it served to disarm her and set her slightly offbalance which was extremely important to the interviews boldt said on the twentyfirst of june during your house detention instore security cameras captured you at the foodland supermarket over on broadway you were dressed in clothes similar to these he said pointing to the bags and your behavior suggested you were trying to avoid these same security cameras so holly macnamara asked daphne who would play the role of friend for this interrogation advised her you dont have to answer anything you dont want to but its best just to go ahead and answer the easy stuff maybe you were shopping with your mother lamoia suggested giving her a way around the implication of criminal activity you were in the soup aisle do you remember that i dont remember try to remember holly daphne encouraged soup she asked i dont think so boldt nodded to lamoia who turned on the sony trinitron and ran the video that shopalert had dubbed for them they watched it together holly watching the screen the police watching holly when it was just at the point where she crashed into a cart being pushed by a man or a womanit remained impossible to telllamoia stopped the tape holly boldt asked maintaining her suspicions of all of them she glanced toward daphne who nodded gently boldt clarified we dont want a madeup story from you we want and need the truth strikers hand ticked several times as he told her if you cooperate there will be no charges against you stemming from this discussion its like immunity you know what that is i dont have to explain immunity to you whatever you tell us is off the record and just between us but sergeant boldt is right we need the truth you should also know that were prepared to play tough if thats the way you want it boldt said you saw something just now that made you remember the thing of it was she began in a flurry of words like maybe id taken some betterveggiethe drink you know like maybe i was thinking about buying some of that boldt conveyed his doubts with a single penetrating look so maybe i wasnt going to buy it she admitted i wasnt id lifted three cans and id lifted some fruit salad and something elsei dont remember like there i am pretty loaded up and im thinking about some v which is the same aisle as the soup but its a hard grab because of that overhead eye and then theres this guy she caught herself and stopped boldt felt the hairs on the back of his neck go erect go on he wanted to scream what guy as if hearing him she met eyes with him and said this guy came out of nowhere i hit his cartreally hit it you know and this look he gave meright through me you know like he knew everything and im in his way like hes a lifter too or else a security guy and im thinking im busted but all he wants is me out of the way and like im gone but i look back you know and whats he do he drops a couple cans out of his coat into his cart walks a few feet and puts them on the shelf so like im thinking oh shit there is a security guy nearby hes dumping his stash and if hes dumping his stash then im sure as hell dumping mine she winced taking them all in clearly fearing she had gone too far its all right holly boldt assuaged her youre doing fine doing real well striker echoed daphne asked do you remember anything at all about this man start general work specific it had been several weekshow much could they expect you mean like what he looked like she asked nervously no way his clothes lamoia suggested you say he dumped his stash out of a coat the streetwise lamoia used her language making it sound as if it were his own a raincoat its summer she reminded them you only lift when its raining cause like where are you going to stash it when its hot out lamoia said a raincoat she nodded boldt wrote it down its a start what kind of raincoat hip conservative khaki black the detective asked green maybe long like those guys in westerns you know young kids made some of the best witnesses the girls recalled clothing down to the buttonsmale and female the boys remembered a girls face and her body shape a green greatcoat lamoia repeated a greatcoat yeah i didnt see his face a hat lamoia asked there had been a glimpse of this individual in the video though it blurred in freezeframe yeah baseball cap i think kinda like mine how bout his shoes lamoia tried boots she spurted out not shoes the way it flew out of her boldt trusted this boots he repeated making note of it cowboy boots she said and blue jeans she announced proudly somewhat surprised with herself like mine lamoia asked showing off his tony lamas and his pressed blue jeans no they were worn jeans she said like frayed at the bottom you know and brown cowboy boots muddy maybe im pretty sure they were brown maybe they were work boots hiking boots i dont remember mud boldt thought recalling how thick the mud was at longview farms he caught daphne looking at him her eyes flashing with a heightened energyshe believed the witness she thought they had a live one lamoia asked jewelry tattoos scars a limp anything distinguishing the boots she repeated proudly i sort of remember the boots did he say anything to you did he speak to you no way but that look he gave me was heavy like he was going to kill me for running into his cart did you see him again anytime after that daphne asked holly macnamara shook her head take your time lamoia encouraged in line maybe she said to the detective the checkout line he was buying something she said definitively you always buy something do you remember what he was buying boldt asked im sure she said sarcastically i dont even remember if i saw him in line she admitted i was in a hurry i just wanted the hell out of there boldt leaned to daphne and whispered get her started on the employee photosadler foodland shopalert then mug shots data processing had compiled dmv photographs of the foodland employees the other companies had their own for security reasons the video boldt thought was one of the shopalert security cameras aimed down the line of cash registers what was that guys name don dave ron gus at shopalert the redmondbased security company that handled foodland greeted boldt as if he were an old friend he escorted him quickly to the back room and the plethora of electronic equipment the minute i got your call i started running the data looking for the guy you described been at it for the better part of an hour hes good lieutenant very good he triggered a key and a screensaving pattern left the monitor replaced by the shadowy blackandwhite flickering image of a tall man wearing a mariners baseball cap and a greatcoat this is about all we have of him and if you watch him closely he said allowing the image to advance in a broken mechanical movement you see hes using the person at the register in front of him as a shield from the camera see he moves right along with this heavy womanso the camera doesnt catch much sight of him he knows what hes doing like i said hes very good two aisles behind the suspect boldt caught sight of holly macnamara though she too was screening herself from the camera what about his face we never see it ive tried some enhancement i tried some of the other time sequences but we hardly ever see him he knows this system well too well an employee boldt let slip his mind whirring or a regular gus hypothesized or a guy whos studied the hell out of it done his homework boldt wrote down the exact time that was electronically stamped into the lower corner of the screen register six he noticed six seven and eight are foodlands express lanes gus confirmed shoplifters like express lanes using this time stamp boldt hoped it might be possible to crosscheck the register tapes and identify the exact items made during this particular purchase when he returned to the public safety building he assigned bobbie gaynes the task and two hours later she entered his office cubicle announcing that with the help of lee hyundai she had found the cash register receipt in question she handed him an enlarged photocopy grainy from the enlargement the computerized lettering angular and spotty but still legible it listed four items purchased at foodlands register of the four items listed as candy and icecrm three were preceded by a fourletter producer code that boldt had long since come to recognize adfdadler foods adler candy bars he whispered under his breath maybe he intended to eat them sergeant gaynes said optimistically we dont know for certain what he has in mind for them yes we do boldt replied ominously im afraid we do twentyone at five oclock thursday july bernie lofgrin poked his head into daphnes office waving a plastic bag containing the state health document you win the kewpie doll matthews this report is one legalsize piece of bullshit he looked more closely at her what did you do to yourself a box fell off my closet shelf and got me that was a heavy box he said she caught sight of a man just over lofgrins shoulder and asked can i help you chris she was asking danielson who seemed to be loitering within earshot danielson fumbled with his words claiming to be reading the bulletin board just outside daphnes office but to her the excuse fell short she waved lofgrin inside and asked him to shut the door ive got a better idea the ecstatic lofgrin said you come down to my office and ill show you my etchings he winked which with his magnified eyeballs felt to her a little bit like a cameras flash going off a few minutes later lofgrin eased his office door shut through the large window the lab was mostly empty of workers at this hour the office was its usual mess like what ive done with the place he asked as daphne moved two stacks of papers in order to win a seat you mind he put on a jazz tape and set the volume low helps me think he said grinning widely lofgrin had a contagious enthusiasm when he was happy and he was happy whenever the lab results gave him conclusive findingswhich filled daphne with optimism it has been altered she repeated a lousy job a bunch of amateurs they used witeout and typed over it at least someone was smart enough to use the same typewriter to make the changesbut the carriage alignment of those changes ran fractionally on an incline just as you spotted lofgrin explained the witeout was old and at one time it probably approximated the paper color quite well it was an enamel and therefore bonded well to the documents pulp and fiber content rendering it virtually impossible to remove using solvents without risking the unintentional destruction of the primary surface thereby losing indentations caused by prior impacta typewriter keystroke for instance his eyes moved like overinflated beach balls in a light wind our interest of course was archaeological in nature what lay beneath the witeout that was so important to cover up the cities of troy if you will okay she said witeout is of course opaque im afraid that our efforts to use illumination to develop a printthrough were a failure he handed her one of the labs efforts a heavy sheet of photographic paper the bulk of the document text was fuzzy for it had been photographed through the existing paper of the document by shooting strong light at it while negative film was placed underneath it the spaces where the changes in the text had been made appeared as black strokes revealing nothing of what words had once existed beneath the witeout the way we got to it lofgrin explained enthusiastically was by using a longwave light technique commonly used in the detection of counterfeit currency the enamel is porous of courseopaque only in the light of certain frequencies what we did was analogous to taking an x ray where the enamel witeout is the skin and the words beneath it the bone if you will and we developed this he said offering her yet another sheet from his file folder she had rarely experienced one of lofgrins detailed explanations in personhis sermons as lamoia called them but she knew that such explanations were to be expected the lab man never never simply handed an officer the final results he put on his jazz leaned back in his chair and he talked he detailed each and every step of his arduous journey so that the peace officer would understand just what a superhuman job had been done this latest document was a negative indeed reminding her of an x ray but in the spaces where earlier there had been just one word now there were two typed one on top of the other creating in all but one space a mishmash of hieroglyphics impossible for her to decipher not exactly readable lofgrin admitted but the first and perhaps most important step to discovering what someone did not want read he leaned back in his chair and it squeaked as he gently rocked himself the rhythm conflicting with that of the sax music the typewriter used a tencharacterperinch courier typeface a few years back we would have located a similar typewriter and typed over the top letters using a white ribbon in order to remove them but computer graphics enhances and speeds up that process considerably amy chu spent the better part of the afternoon drawing out the top layer of typed letters he handed her yet another sheetthis one computerprinted and this is what you get in each of the areas where changes had taken place now only flecks of characters remained looking a little like chinese characters or in a few cases worse like paint splatters not the easiest thing to read lofgrin confessed and thats because the letters often overlapped significantly so when you took out the stem to the letter t you might also erase the letter i beneath it but if you think about it there are only two charactersa number and a letterthat are interchangeable on the standard typewriter keyboard he allowed her to think about it only briefly before he answered for her not even zero and o capital or lowercase duplicate one another daphne answered like the good student the number one and the lowercase letter l gold star matthews he chirped which means all other letters and numbers essentially leave their own fingerprint if you will whether a serif or a loop a dot or a stem he stopped rocking computer scanning technology gave us something called ocroptical character recognitionsoftware the computer knows all these individual characteristics of each letter for each typeface and using logarithms is able to predict within an error factor of only a few percent what letter is on the page you scan a document and its a graphic you run ocr on that graphic and its converted into a text format that can then be manipulated bottom line he said we ran ocr on this jumble of flecks and spots and asked it to guess what it was we were looking at he held the final sheet in his hand but he would not pass it to her it took amy seventeen passes with the ocr because even for the computer there just wasnt enough there to work with and its error rate was atrocious but here you go all the names the date the information they tried to hide he said proudly the truth they tried to hide the document was indeed restored to its original form lofgrin said you put me on the stand and ill say the same thing to the jury or judge heaven help us daphne thought she ran her finger down the form comparing the altered document to the one she now held her curiosity driving a trickle of perspiration down her ribs and there was the box she had most wanted to see field inspector walter hammond alongside was hammonds legible signature that for the past several years had been covered by witeout more shocking to her was the cause of the contamination listed not as salmonella as it had been on the altered document but as staphylococcus knowing exactly where her eyes were on the page lofgrin said staph is a contact infection passed from human to human an entirely different animal from salmonella it all but confirmed her suspicions longview farms had been improperly accused of a contamination for which it was not responsible walter roy hammond lived in what daphnes friend sharon called a dieslow community pontasset point called itself a progressive community and consisted of doublewides with postagestamp lawns that someone else mowed there was a community center a shuffleboard court three tennis courts and a poolall next to the hospice a shabbylooking halfway house nursing home that probably struggled to meet the state minimums hammond wore ceramic teeth a pair of pink miracle ears and carried a lifetime of french fries and shortorder cooking like a backup parachute at his belt line apparently if he dropped something he left it there indicated by the existence on his nutbrown carpet of a wide variety of pens candy wrappers and two spoons that would have to wait until his girl came to clean the tv which was the size of a refrigerator and which fully blocked one of the rooms only two windows ran loudly even after daphne asked that they turn it off you wouldnt be carrying no tape recorder would you the man had steely blue eyes the color of deep ice and big stubby hands with wrinkled agespotted skin his fingernails chewed grotesquely short no tape recorder she answered is this what youd call off the record it can be she allowed her heart beating more quickly why did he want that i think that be best lady he said fine off the record then what exactly is it you want daphne sized up her opponent and played him against himself what is it you think i want mr hammond call me roy everyone else does he liked her looksthere was no missing that glint in his eyes and it disgusted her she wished she had worn a jacket no clue he answered none you teasing me up until four years ago you worked as a field inspector for the state health department matter of record does the name longview farms mean anything to you his swollen neck moved as he swallowed dryly failing in his attempt to portray a man bored with her line of questioning every place i inspected on a regular basis means something to me lady part of my route you understand part of what i did for a living what exactly was it bout longview you had a question bout exactly this she handed him two photocopiesbefore and after again the boa constrictor in his neck moved and he blinked repeatedlyboth signs to her of an increasing anxiety he switched off the television and adjusted both hearing aids one of which screamed a high pitch while he toyed with it his white scaly tongue worked at his crusty lips but his mouth remained bonedry is there a question to go along with this he asked why the difference between the two he considered this for a moment his eyes darting between daphne and the two documents dont know where you got this one he said of the document as it had existed before the changes but this one here he said shaking the salmonella document is dated later and therefores the one the department would go by but honestly lady i dont work there no more and i think youre asking the wrong guy the original document she emphasized lists you as the field inspector she added in the later one the names been changed you know he said his face reddening and his nostrils flaring i do remember this one terrific she said flatly letting him sense her distrust once upon a time we had a good department lady then they started making us hire all the different colorsthe united states government didand things went straight downhill and women daphne pointed out girls too yeah thats right not that i got anything against girls but you do when it comes to different colors aint none of them smart is the thing i got no tolerance for people with their hand in uncle sams pocket you know theyre just plain stupid take jake jefferson okay youre asking about the longview okay well it was that jefferson who got things wrong in the first place and made the rest of us have to work to fix it a lab report got everything wrong he did and then refused to admit it nothing worse than a nigger who thinks hes right i dont care for your language mr hammond well pardon fucking me he said angrily its a free country lady in case you was off smoking pot while the rest of us was defending it just my luck to get the flying nun you know theres a mariners game on the tv that id rather be watching if were all through here he heaved himself out of his soft throne with great difficulty and shuffled over to pour himself a double wild turkey with two cubes of ice the cushion where he had been sitting remained dished in a deep crater he mumbled a steady stream of unintelligible dialogue with himself daphne looked toward the door to make sure it was close by and she kept a very close eye on roy hammond as he opened and closed some kitchen drawers why did your name get changed on that report why he asked his back turned and she could sense him vamping for time he returned to his lazboy swivel recliner and drank an enormous amount of the liquor without batting an eye he toyed with it clinking the rapidly melting ice cubes against the glass she added the man whose name replaced yours a mr patrick shawnesea does apparently not live in this state any longer that makes it difficult for us to locate him for an interview harder than you think lady pat shawnesea is long dead lung cancer and he never smoked a single cigarette in his life radon i heard it was living atop a hot spot makes sense the wife died of woman problems two years and change before pat cut everything off her and outta her and she still up and died on him she thought that maybe shawneseas death explained the change of date on the document for it had been backdated eleven days and that had been bothering her the whole way out here why backdate a document unless you need a window of time in which pat shawnesea was still working so that the only person who could answer important questions was certain not to be available she had a few nuggets of what she wanted though the mother lode still avoided her let me see if i have this right she said slouching her shoulders forward involuntarily because of this mans insistence on fixing his eyes on her chest shawnesea took this case over from you eleven days before your initial investigation began he decided the illnesses had been caused by salmonella not staphylococcus which was the finding of your investigation let me explain something please do she interrupted they wasnt my findings the way you saythey was jeffersons hes the one done the tests okay and as for pat i dont remember exactly what he had to do with any of this but its his name on this second documentthe altered document i understand that lady but it dont necessarily mean it makes sense now does it but you knew mark meriweather sure i did and mr shawnesea what do you mean he knew mr meriweather too he inspected longview too well he must have now mustnt he i thought you said longview was part of your we picked up each others slack but did you investigate this new leaf contamination or mr shawnesea i remind you that your signature is clearly visible on the original document i did the man looked confused how many years that been there one of them statues of elimination on this thing or what in another interview daphne might have cracked a smile but hammond disgusted her and she immediately felt tempted to lie what the general public failed to understandto their loss she thoughtwas that there existed no code of ethics or other formality instructing or limiting law enforcement officers to speak the truth except while under oath no place was this more evident than in the boxthe interrogation room where police officers commonly invented any truth that helped their cause and their cause was to put criminals away the best liars were the best interrogators and daphne matthews was considered close to the top the only real difference she could see between an interrogation and an interview was the location of the discussion what hammond did not know was that she was out of her jurisdiction and had made no formal application to conduct this interview with king county police meaning that everything either of them said was off the record from the moment she first opened her mouth to speak meaning also that she could tell as many lies as she wanted and could act on anything hammond told her but could use none of the interview itself in a court of law these thoughts circulated through her conscious mind before she answered untruthfully i believe the statute of limitations has expired on the longview contamination i dont believe theres any way we can prosecute anyone for what happened to this document but to be honest i dont really care its the truth i want mr hammond a man may go to jail for a very very long time if we cant find the real truth about longview there was a joke that lived on the fifth floor that she heard circulate year in and year out whats a chinese court deputy say to those in the courtroom at the start of every trial all lies that boy harry he said yes harry she repeated her heart backfiring a real troublemaker harry was got it in his head all wrong and wouldnt have it any other way disappeared as fast as he arrived called me a liar to my face stood there looking me in the eye and called me a liar what did you say his last name was she asked quickly hoping to trick it out of him i didnt say i got no idea seeing people around a place and knowing them is two different things lady i regularly inspected seven dairies five bird operations a rabbit farm a goat cheese outfit and eleven food manufacturers more some years people like mark meriweather i had a business knowing but his hired hands some drifter who thought he was gods gift to chickens hang it up and yet by this very statement hammond revealed he knew more about harry than he had first let on i understood that he was college educated she tested was going to take over for hank russell when hank stepped aside surethat was the story anyway mark spent too much time and too much money on that boy you ask me treating him the way he did just a nogood drifter and mark goes treating him like a son he mixed the boy up is what he done went to jail or something i heard she carefully wrote down jail mr russell was parttime was he hank russell he ran that place lady was foreman for half a dozen years damn fine operation too she pretended to check some papers i dont show any record of a henry russell what kind of record taxes ill bet he laughed and had to wipe his chin afterward pay uncle sam not hank russell my guess is that he worked it out with meriweather just like when he was over to dovers butterbreast before that roof over his head some food some cash under the tablethats hank for you part of the family im confused about something she held up one document then the other was it a staph or salmonella outbreak hammonds eyes were glassy from the booze of which he took another long swallow as he stewed on this boiled was more like it she thought his adams apple bobbed as if food were going through the boa his left hand gripped the arm of the chair in a choke hold she felt him on the verge of opening up to her when his throat cleared he said i got nothing to say to you lady take it somewhere else why dont you its just that he interrupted her with a bonenumbing delivery that drove his face scarlet and overfilled a blue vein in his long pale forehead to where it jumped right off his face i said take it somewhere else get outta here you get outta here now fore i make you pay for that comment she was up and out of her chair struggling with her briefcase i dont want to talk no more he said he turned his back on her snatched his nearly empty drink from the side table and headed back for the tall bottle that awaited him she was out of there in a matter of seconds in her car and down the road exhausted and still tense from the encounter she drove until the phone cooperated and placed three callsone of them downtown one to the owner of dovers butterbreast turkey farm and the third to a tiny farm up the road toward sammamish after telling the farms owner that she worked for publishers clearing house he claimed that hank russell was out in his trailer watching the game i think she disconnected the phone placing it on the seat beside her and drew in a deep breath she shifted gears took a curve suicidally fast and whispered under her breath the punch line to that jokeall liesa wry smile twisting up the edges of her lips where her color had finally returned wheres your jacket pardon me hank russell was short and solid he looked like a fiftyfiveyearold rodeo riderjeans dusty cowboy boots and an azure blue work shirt with a western yoke and snap pockets he had a silver belt buckle the size of a salad plate and when he turned around to silence the television with a remote she saw that on the back of his brown leather belt it read simply hank in big embossed letters his twangy voice sounded like tires on gravel them publishing house clearance folks got them blazers like i seen on the tube you aint one of em are you no sir she liked his smile immediately you lied to me young lady yes sir i did youre too damn pretty to be a tax lady and its too damn late at night tell me youre not a tax lady god help me im not a tax lady his relief was genuine some unknown relative of mine died you look more like an attorney than a tax lady im not an attorney either she told him im a policewoman mr russell i think harry may be in trouble harry caulfield again well jezus he swung the screen door open wide come in come in he zapped the tv this time killing the picture as well she thought of cowboys and sixguns and now they used remotes how about some lemon pie he asked with a twinkle in his green eyes made it myself its the best damn pie youve ever ate she and boldt wandered his small backyard side by side the sergeant stopping every now and then to pick up one of the brightly colored plastic toys that were scattered about everywhere last name of caulfield she said harry caulfield wandered onto the farm at seventeen wouldnt talk about his past not to anyone worked hard learned fast everyone treated him like family the owner meriweather made him earn his high school equivalency if he wanted to stay on at longview sent him on to college after that paid for everything for the boy here boldt asked briefly pausing in their slow stroll she nodded thats how the foreman remembers it the university studied sciences he said like microbiology could be she agreed it would help him with the poultry businessthe diseases the doctoring its him worked back at the farm summers and on breaks evidently loved the work named a bunch of the hens really took to it and came down hard russell says someone got paid said there was a breakin about a week before state health shut them down but that nothing was taken and they blamed it on some kids and paid no attention never reported it someone doctored their birds boldt speculated she nodded set them up they never saw it coming about the time the infection spread the state health inspector hammond shows up and shuts them down that very day it happened real fast too fast for hank russell thats how he claims he knew it was rigged the farm was ordered to destroy the birds and the boy was there back from college meriweather wasnt himself his wife got into the booze the people who got sick threatened lawsuits he was going to lose it all and worse he and the boy both knew it russell says meriweather wasnt sleeping couldnt think clearly he refused to poison the birds so instead they butchered themall of them all in one day over a thousand birds by hand the boy tooharry russell says hes never had a day like that in his life ankledeep in blood covered in it a mountain of headless birds he said and another pile of just the heads and mark meriweather and harry caulfield crying the whole time crying for sixteen hours while they slaughtered those birds and put an end to the farm the psychologist in her said they should have never involved the boy boldt stopped and rocked his head back toward the moon and his voice cracked as he tried to say something to her but stopped himself when he did manage to speak he said i dont know that i can go on being a parent he picked up another piece of plasticit looked like a bridgeand stacked it with the others maybe they combined to make a fort or a house she could not tell which the lawsuits did come and on an icy fall night meriweather drove himself off snoqualmie pass for the insurance money the wife ended up committed the way russell described it it sounded like wet brain ownership of the farm was never worked out meriweather owned it outright and the wife was still living so it just rotted away according to russell and our friend harry wouldnt speak after meriweather died nearly starved himself to death by not eating russell said he was hospitalized for a while and that when he got out he came to russell with a plan to prove they had been framed boldt sat down into one of the midget swingset seats and stretched his legs out the swing set was bright blue in the moonlight with a yellow wrapping like wide ribbon daphne took the swing next to him but was afraid their combined weight might break the set so she stood up and held the chains feeling awkward but russell didnt want any of that boldt guessed hank russell is what you might call the original honest outlaw hes simply not in the system doesnt drive doesnt pay taxes i dont think but he knows livestock and he seems to have been around every kind there is if you believe him and you do i do so harry launches his own crusade against owen adler no she corrected this is several years ago when harry gets this idea i dont get it boldt said looking over at her russells story stops there he heard the boy had gotten into some trouble but never knew what it was jail hammond mentioned jail i didnt call in a request because i wasnt sure about using the radio you did exactly right this pulled boldt out of the swing and to his feet so we check corrections the kids a mess lou the kid is killing people daffy you want me to feel sorry for him she did not answer maybe i can see it he said maybe someday even come to understand it on some level but ill never condone it ill never forgive him for slater lowry its not him doing this dont start with me its not lou yes it is daffy he is the one doing this dont kid yourself you found him daffy you identified him you did it you should feel proud about that well i dont she said following him toward their cars boldt too elected not to use the radios to take no chance whatsoever that the name harry caulfield might be overheard by an eavesdropping reporter instead he and daphne returned separately to the fifth floor and immediately sought the mans prior convictions and outstanding warrants through boldts computer terminal the search for h caulfield produced a single hit harold emerson caulfield boldt read to her from the screen twentyeight years old a narco bust arrested and convicted four years ago for possession of two kilos of cocaine paroled four months ago home addressget this sasquaw washington he looked up at her excitedly and confirmed thats our guy he took her by the arm pulled her down to him and kissed her quickly on the lips their faces just inches apart hers alive with excitement there was a brief moment in which he felt confused but he let go of her arm in time to allow the sensation to pass she smiled and laughed somewhat nervously well she said letting out a huge sigh come on he encouraged tugging on her hand lets pull the file they hurried across the floor in brisk elongated strides that neared an allout runwhich at that early hour of the morning caught the attention of the few members of pasquinis squad who were at their desks wheres the fire one of the men called out another answered in their pants and laughter erupted all around boldt knew it probably looked that wayrunning off together to find an empty roomand this once he did not care the discovery of caulfield made him feel drunk there was only one elevator in use this time of night and it was a long time coming so daphne suggested the stairs they raced each other down in the middle of which she called out to him i want to run this by clements if its all right with you is he here arrived this afternoon theres a meeting called for tomorrow any objections none at all it will help with his profile no objections he repeated winded already they reached the basement floor and started first at a walk and then broke into a run simultaneously all police of the rank detective or higher possessed keys to the three file rooms and boldt used his to open first the door and then the interior chainlink gate this basement room was nicknamed the boneyard and contained the files for all cleared cases three to seven years in the past twice a year the oldest of these files were removed to a permanent graveyard for police files in a warehouse off marginal way there were thousands of files contained in row after row of graymetal racks all colorcoded with the same system used by doctors and dentists the lighting was dreary the files thumbworn and the organization miserable but the colored stickers marked by alphabetical reference made it easy to find cau boldt had to pry one file from the next they were crammed in so tightly daphne lent a hand opening a space between files so that boldt could read the case number and name he made one pass then another he glanced down at hershe was standing on her toes to reach this shelfand said i dont see it you hold she instructed and they switched jobs she became somewhat frantic on the fourth pass it has to be here it isnt misspelled maybe boldt checked the tattered ledger by the door leafing through the scrawled listings of what files had been signed out and by whom it was an archaic system where half the entries were illegible not here he called out at daphnes frustrated insistence together they spent another ten minutes leafing through all the files beginning with the letters ca and found no file for harry caulfield at the end of which daphne was out of breath she blew on her bangs to move them off her forehead but the hair was stuck there and she brushed it out of the way they stood in an uncomfortable silence staring at the towering wall of smudged and ragged files both of them seething with anger the room seemed the size of a football field to boldt and the records on caulfield could have been misfiled someone took it boldt finally said voicing what he knew she too was thinking she looked up at him so frustrated that her eyes were brimmed with tears and she said in a tense and raspy voice what do you want to bet that whatever went on with longview farms reached further than state health im not a betting man replied lou boldt twentytwo its no secret that some of you consider this voodoo the renowned forensic psychiatrist and fbi special agent dr richard clements said in a deepthroated voice that filled homicides situation room thirty minutes into the evening shift lamoia and gaynes were already on atm watch as were a total of eight other police officers boldt shoswitz rankin and daphne matthews were all in attendance for spd they were joined by two plainclothes detectives from the king county police a homicide lieutenant and two detectives from the portland police department the special agent in charge of the fbis seattle field office and two fbi public information officers dr clements looked a little green under the artificial lights he wore a plain gray suit white shirt with a loud abstract tie and black wing tips he had long gray hair wild over the ears and steely dark eyes and looked like someone who ran a museum for a private foundation he never blinked wearing halfglasses he read from a dogeared folder and made notes with a black mechanical pencil as he went prior to the start of this meeting he had complained to boldt that he would rather be back in virginia mowing his lawn and drinking a sloe gin fizz this boldt assumed was his attempt to give a romantic impression of himself boldt knew all about dr richard clements dr clements had interviewed the most vicious mass murderers and serial murderers in confinement in the united states as well as several overseas countries including the former soviet union and had compiled a psychological overview of these killers that later led to the now commonplace practice of criminal profiling for four of the reagan years he had been adviser to the secret service analyzing both real and perceived threats to the presidents life according to rumor on three occasions he had accurately predicted where to find the wouldbe assassins just days before the attempts he had come to work with daphne matthews as an adviser while serving as a special agent on the fbis behavioral science unit during the seattle police departments attempt to apprehend the cross killer an eccentric he was the stuff of legend in law enforcementthe einstein of the criminal mind he lectured at yale and johns hopkins regularly and had authored several books including a textbook in use in nearly every criminology course in the country it was said that extensive scars barely visible above his shirt collar but more obvious at the cuff of his left sleeve covered most of his upper torso and had been given to him by mad dog a swedish inmate who had nearly devoured the man before guards saved him there were other stories about dr clementssome even about these same scarsthat boldt had heard over the years some of them flattering some not until today he had not believed them now looking at this creature he was not so quick to rule anything out in appearance dr clements had been around mass murderers for too long he was wideeyed and given to explosive bursts of animation followed by eerie stretches of silence and contemplation that one dare not interrupt perhaps this science is part voodoo sometimes the profiles help sometimes not what i am going to tell you about this manoh yes a manis intended merely as a reference point a fallback that hopefully may help guide you toward a better understanding of this individual or even possibly predict his future behavior he addressed captain rankin a big burly man of irish coloring my job is part science part invention but like you i take it seriously and i ask only that you give me serious consideration and your undivided attention first a point of business at my suggestion sergeant boldt has instructed adler foods to begin a quiet recall and subsequent destruction of all its candy bars as you may know an individual believed to be our suspect has been identified as having purchased several such candy bars and it is my contention that he intends to poison them this is a substitution recall onlythat is all such products currently on the shelf will be replaced with fresh product and random testing will be conducted on recalled product in this way we do not violate the demands but we serve the public interest now as to the larger issue the individual in question goes by the name of harry caulfield he is single twentyeight years old despite a possible residence at longview farms i believe he has recently lived within a twomile radius of the broadway foodland supermarket he may be cohabitating though i doubt ita loner is more likely he is or was recently employed in a bluecollar job or jobs that involve manual labor this employment may have temporarily included adler foods or association with adler foods though it is my contention he was never on the payroll i can see captain rankin that you are skeptical of my assessment rankin shifted uneasily in his chair i can explain some of this the first two faxes that mr owen adler received some months ago were pasteups not computer faxes like the more recent threats your lab identified the source publications for these pasteups as including typography from both playboy and penthouse as well as a local shopping giveaway the two skin magazines help us define his demography the giveaway helps narrow his current or former place of residence because the publication does not enjoy wide circulation he also clipped both sports illustrated and a national bluecollar rag called heartlandthese identified by our hoover labwhich further narrows his demographics and suggests the likelihood of manual labor we dont dream this stuff up he smirked but who is he he continued he is a loner a possible insomniac the actions he is taking are histhat is he is not some hired gun but instead his own man he may or may not have a background inhe held up his fingersmicrobiology animal husbandry electronics or food production he believes his cause righteous and as far as we are concerned that makes him extremely dangerous and he is to be taken at his word he believes he is doing what he has to punishing adler foods or owen adler himself for some grievous wrong committed in the past technically clinically he went on he is assumed to be a paranoid schizophrenic he is really two people if you willthe evil person committing these crimes and the voice he hears both encouraging him and warning him of the severity of his actions there is a voice of reason within him hence his ability to organize and seemingly remain one step ahead although schizophrenic hes not crazy in the way you think of him he addressed to rankin not organically hes disturbed certainly but there is a vast difference no drooler this man he is to be taken seriously he is to be feared if he says two weeks then two weeks it is if he says hell kill a hundred then it shall be no less clements scanned the room and continued he does not believe he can be caught you snicker captain but it is the truth he believes himself smarter than all of youall of us combined i promise you that he monitors the media closely for signs of his success or failure your ability so far to disguise his acts is to be commended as i understand it you were concerned about the proliferation of copycat crimesa legitimate concern but worse this is a man who will try to outdo his own headlines rankin still not convinced asked where does the extortion fit in the extortion demands its a complex issue clements answered it appears he has a grand scheme a grand design in mind perhaps from the beginning three phases a warning phase an attack phase a final phase if you will i believe we have moved into the attack phase he has not seen the results he had hoped for but he was prepared for this all along he has shifted from the larger demands that even to him must have seemed unlikely for him to win to the more specific monetary gains of these extortion demands and the final phase one of the portland cops asked reluctantly phase three is to deliver on his promise to kill hundreds i would assume do not doubt it it is not inconceivable that he has devised a plan in advance to accomplish this in the event of his arrest as an aside he said with an individual as seemingly capable as this nothing is inconceivable he allowed another wry smile and his glassy unflinching eyes sparkled in the harsh light dr richard clements was enjoying himself twentythree that same thursday night lamoia pulled up in front of boldts house knowing the sergeant was expecting him still tucking in his shirt boldt came out the door with his coat slung over his arm a cloud of moths fluttered overhead surrounding the porch light another group enveloped a street lamp above the car lamoia met him on the porch and handed boldt a scrawled note containing an address that was surprisingly close over by greenlake on seventyfourth it was a neighborhood boldt remembered well from another case and one he would have just as soon forgotten dixie on his way his people will meet him there razor left your cellular number with him lamoia handed boldt his cell phone and boldt absentmindedly slipped it into his coat pocket he patted his side his gun was there its a tough break sarge boldt doublechecked the front door the two men hurried to the waiting car who called it in boldt asked who else would land this kind of black hole hollywood sarge he said answering boldts blank expression danielson a second later from inside the car lamoia shouted you coming boldt stood frozen with his hand on the door daphne had mentioned danielsons eavesdropping boldt did not like it sarge boldt climbed inside you okay step on it ordered the man who liked to drive under thirty at all times the house was a twostory shake closely situated to its neighbors on both sides the street rose up a hill and so lamoia cut the wheels into the curb and let the car settle back a set of cement steps carried boldt up to some wooden steps that led to a landing and to the front door where danielson sat on the stoop bernie lofgrin and his id crew remained below for the moment waiting to be summoned the mes chuck wagon arrived nextan unmarked limegreen van a color green no one could possibly like usually reserved for cadavers but sometimes used to transport the field technicians boldt saw the scene they were creating and told lamoia tersely to spread out some of the vehicles to try to lessen the attention drawn to the scene we want this done as quietly as possible if the neighbors do get involved no one answers any questions and i mean no one got it lamoia answered he saw to it and returned to join boldt as he was preparing to enter boldt and lamoia donned latex gloves boldt tried the front door but it was locked he signaled bernie lofgrin and a few minutes later one of lofgrins assistants had used a speed key on the back door boldt motioned for lamoia to go first the young detective pushed open the door leaned his head inside and called out honey im home boldt felt a depressing weight in the air it was not the smell of vomit that triggered ithe smeared some vicks under his nose and took care of that and he passed the tube to lamoia who did the same the weight was the result of a sense of failure that would not let go of him four more lives four more slater lowrys uncharacteristically philosophical boldt said to lamoia death touches us all but murder affects people permanently twenty years later the average guy will have forgotten some of the ones who died but not the ones who were murdered im sure thats right lamoia said unsure how to answer if it would do any good to swear to you that these are the last were going to see i would if you had those kinds of powers youd be wearing a turban not a badge the table was set for fourbut it looked like breakfast not dinner it looked as if someone had reset the table ready for a morning that never came the stove top was clear and there were dishes inside the dishwasher that would be analyzed by the lab the two bathrooms downstairs and upstairs were ugly people had been real sick and in the end no one had taken the time to clean up boldt could imagine them awakening with bad stomachsfirst the kids then the parents two to six hours after the meal dixie had told him and as the reaction worsened the parents would have become scared would have discussed the idea of the hospital guts wrenching children screaming from the pain in their abdomens he could not imagine that kind of fearthat moment when one of them realized they all had itwhatever it was projectile vomiting diarrhea slamming headaches the father or mother running for the car thinking about but deciding they could make it themselves but they did not make it on the very top of the tincan recycle bag in the pantry boldt found two crushed cans of adlers homestyle hash evidence for lofgrins id crew that would follow into here shortly here was a crime scene that seemed bound to hit the press the deaths of an entire family could not be contained boldt was already working on a believable story that dixie and state health could feed the media the family was believed to have eaten out at a restaurant as yet unidentified the symptoms observed in the deceased do not conflict with those found in other e coli contaminations at face value the truth the only way he could see of keeping the real truth from the public in order to protect it from even more such poisonings the seattle community was numb enough from earlier e coli contaminations to accept the explanation he could not buy forever with such a story but a few daysa week if he were lucky the girls bedroomhe could see that they shared the roomdevastated him a raggedy ann doll sitting in a low wicker chair it was the way the bed linen was folded backa mother helping her child out of bed but they were out of bed dixies office had them in black plastic bags zippered down the middle their breakfast table was set but within a few minutes breakfast would be in plastic too boldt had tried to help an injured sparrow once as a child but it had struggled in his hand and he had broken its neck and it had died he remembered holding it outstretched in his open palms and tossing it into the air encouraging it to fly picking it up and tossing it until his mother weeping caught up to him and stopped him though she had tried to convince him otherwise he had killed it trying to helpand this was how he felt now as he sank down to the floor of this small pink room and pushed the door shut in a vain attempt to make his peace striker arrived late looking and smelling a little drunk waving his pager at boldt he slurred fucking things a piece of shit its him boldt said indicating the house mr caulfields work right striker said for what its worth i think all women are shit another adler product hash this time boldt realized he was not getting through they yank your chain they mess with your brain a family of four all four died razor strikers prosthesis clicked violently died he was only half there all four waited too long before going to the emergency room the mother did okay for a while but they lost her they say grief maybe they say it can do that the wrong people always die striker complained you know what im saying no boldt answered honestly well fuck you striker said he passed boldt intentionally bumping him with his shoulder and went inside the house boldt waited fifteen minutes under a low overcast sky that threatened rain a gang of uniformed patrolmen held back the reporters and cameramen he heard the words e coli on the tongues of the spectators so far so good boldt thought growing accustomed to the lies and hating himself for it stinks in there striker said on his return same old same old we need a mug shot or file photo of caulfield department of corrections should have one you dont need me for that it would be easier i want everything they have on caulfield and id rather they dont connect the request directly with me or the fifth floor your office makes those requests all the time ill have it for you by morning striker made a note it was the first sign of sobriety been hoisting a few razor hey im not on call shit elaines never home why not just dont go picking any fights striker had a reputation for challenging thirtyyearolds to onehanded fightsand winning and sometimes there was no challenge just an explosion and striker was on someone well there he is he said noticing danielson glaring at boldt from the parked car that warrant must have done the trick huh which warrant boldt asked holly macnamara the klepto hell no i mean his danielsons the ws on longview farms i had to bitch and scream to get you those fucking tax boys have assholes as tight as squirrels boldt did his best to hide his shock he looked away as if still interested in the house the ws he repeated right going after the longview employees thats how you got caulfields name right and all thanks to yours truly and danielson too maybeor was he just your goboy on that he poked boldt a little too hard with his metal claw you can thank me i wont complain yeah thanks razor boldts words barely left his mouth you dont have to sound so overjoyed striker stabbed sarcastically no i appreciate it really boldt said sounding stronger his attention focused across the lawn on danielsons profile the longview tax records he repeated damn straight you ought to try going up against the tax boys sometimes it aint all fun and games believe me boldt had lamoia drive him downtown he left the car before it came to a full stop and hurried to the door with the detective shouting loudly from behind him wait up boldt was not waiting he took the stairs two at a time descending into the basement he had his key out for the boneyard before reaching the door through the door then the chainlink gate he found the light switch without looking several long strides down the second aisle around the corner to the shelf so familiar to him cau and there it was the arrest file for harold emerson caulfield exactly where it belonged twentyfour armed with a variety of mug shots including those of harry caulfield that had been given to her by boldt daphne approached holly macnamara the following friday morning before the young woman left for summer school holly was dressed in blue jeans a white tshirt and black running shoes the mother continually tried to push herself on them and to prevent her from interfering daphne and the young woman sought privacy in hollys bedroom the walls were covered with posters of grunge bands the bed was on the floor and the room smelled of incense you see what i live with she asked daphne mothers can be harsh daphne agreed yeah my mother was a real jerk when i was in high school she thought i was going to get pregnant and become a junkie you me she answered she placed the first series of mug shots in front of the girl withholding caulfields for the third or fourth group she wanted to get her acquainted with the process before risking their prize but more than that she wanted to help this young woman if possible holly macnamara studied them all carefully picked one of them up placed it down and shook her head not here she said the thing is daphne told her the more time i spent at home the worse it was because it seemed like everything i did was wrong my mother wanted me to be her cute little girl she couldnt handle that i had breasts and my period and that i was curious to find out what drinking beer was like none of this reflected her high school years in the least but she had studied the holly macnamaras and she thought she knew the general situation well enough to establish a rapport talk to me same with you absolutely daphne laid out another set of four mug shots how about these she asked holly was not looking at the photographs but at daphne instead the thing is she never lets up and all i want is for her to chill and give me some space you know she doesnt have a clue who i am maybe a clue daphne said but not much of one exactly daphne indicated the photos for a second time and holly studied them carefullyperhaps more carefully daphne hoped than had they not had this conversation no i dont think so holly said make sure no definitely not daphne picked up these but waited before placing down the next for the photo of harry caulfield was among these she said i volunteer at the shelter the place for runaways yes a close friend of mine is the spokesperson and i put in about eight hours a week thereevenings mostly have you ever considered volunteer work me i know its not the same as hanging out at the mall as hanging out with your friends but the girls are about your agecloser to your age than mine thats for sureand more than anything they need contact with people they need to find a base to get themselves centered again volunteers do everything from serve meals to change beds to just sit around talking what i was thinkingyoure kind of in a bad scene here your sentencing requires you to stay home but this is where a lot of your problems seem to stem from what if i could convince the judge to allow you to spend some time volunteering at the shelter maybe the same hours im thereat least at first would you have any interest in that i could try it is that a yes holly studied daphnes face yeah thats a yes good daphne said grinning she laid out the next series of mug shots first one then the second then harry caulfield then a fourth what about these she watched the girls face carefully as hollys eyes moved progressively down the row when she reached caulfield her eyes widened and she bit her lip then without saying anything she looked at the fourth in the line let me ask you something holly macnamara said daphne nodded if i did recognize this guynot that im saying i dothen i become involved right i become a snitch her voice changed driven by anger you know how much trouble ive gotten in because someone ratted on me do you know what that feels like and now you expect me to rat on some guy do you see anything wrong with this picture im going to tell you something that im not allowed to tell you im going to tell you because i trust you never to repeat it if you were to repeat it you could get me in some serious shitmaybe even cost me my jobits that secret i dont know you well holly but i like youand this is one time i had better be a good judge of character she hesitated to allow this to sink in i know what youre saying about snitching i think i understand where youre coming from and i can see how it would be hard for you especially if you were turning in a shoplifter shoplifting is nothing to be proud of holly but i can see how that would be difficult for you but the person were after is not a shoplifter caulfield stared back at her from the mug shot he was cleanshaven dark eyes with an average face of average looks he was mr anybody he might have been a waiter or an attorney or a cop dark hair a firm jaw line and strong eyes he was a multiple murderer and he seemed to be looking right at daphne with an expression of smug contempt and hatred i hate you all his eyes said daphne continued the man were after is no shoplifter he killed a boy young enough to be your little brother he killed a family of fourtwo little girls and their parents hes put other people in the hospital he has threatened much worse and we take those threats very seriously we believe time may be running outand we need to know if were after the right person or not we have a suspect but no one that we know of has seen him but you if you are able to identify him then we know where to focus our investigation we just may stop him in time she pointed back to the line of mug shots do you see him holly is he any of these men without any indecision holly macnamara reached down and picked up the photograph of harry caulfield this is the man i saw at foodland bernie lofgrins magnified eyeballs looked fake like a pair of joke glasses won at the ringtoss at an amusement park his office was crowded with stacks of reading material and reports vying for chair seats and rising like teetering skyscrapers from the office floor a cup of steaming coffee sat by the phone and he waved a bic pen in the air as if it were a baton boldt set the jazz tapes down on the mans cluttered desk moved a stack of printed matter and took a seat across from him well ill be damned lofgrin said holding the cassettes close to his face so he could read the titles that boldt had written on them uhhuh he muttered and repeated with each new discovery quite pleased youre a man of your word he said peering more closely he added enthusiastically jumping off a clef chet baker and red rodney too terrific lofgrin liked the trumpet an added bonus for my tardiness boldt said you mind lofgrin got up shut the office door and put the trumpet tape into a boom box and turned it on setting the volume low for boldt the jazz improved his mood immediately and he was glad it was as familiar to him as it was because it did not distract him stealing his attention the way unfamiliar music did we checked out all three atms last night no latents no evidence whatsoever while boldt had been investigating the poisoning of the mishnov family three atms had been hit for another twentyeight hundred dollars again boldts surveillance team had been nowhere near the atm locations hit bernie lofgrins forensic sciences squad had dusted for prints and inspected the sites for any other evidence lofgrin said one thing bothers me weve seen four atms hit right and according to atm security people some fifty percent of the machines are equipped with optical surveillancecameras so is this extortionist of yours just lucky or what it bothers me too bernie it gives you the feeling someones got a hand in your back pocketknow what i mean i know exactly what you mean ive got some ideas i get the hint weve got other things to discuss the longview farms evidence boldt reminded as lofgrin sat back down we focused on that basement room as you asked worked closely with the fire marshal peter kramer and also fergus in their lab because a total burn is really its own science and there is a lot of work yet to go im afraid some of which weve shipped off to washington thanks to your agreement with the bureau boys there just isnt a hell of a lot left after a fire like that where we got lucky is that the workbench under which all these boxes were stored was topped with sheet metal the weight of the collapsing building combined with the limited protection of this layer of sheet metal compressed the contents of some of the boxes and there just wasnt enough oxygen for it all to burn so we have small clusters of flaky carbon kind of like the layers of french pastryextremely fragile sensitive still to oxygen and yet basically intact we shipped a lot of this off to the bureau because we want to get it right and evidence this volatile only allows you one shot exposed to air it literally turns to dust before you can work with it how long the bureau is thorough they can and have taken weeks to get back to us id say two weeks is average weve asked for a rush but everyone does so i doubt it means much they do know about the case though and that helps my guess is that it will get some kind of priority which may mean a week or ten days if were lucky we dont have ten days i understand lofgrin said sympathetically im just being upfront with you its out of my hands so we wait for the real detail work we do the specifics that may turn this thing on its ear oh check this riff he leaned back a pair of trumpets soared on an unpredictable harmony and fluttered to a gentle landing lofgrin sighed as if he had just finished a good meal what we have for you is not the best news the lab man said sitting forward again the boxes beneath that workbench contained varying sizes of thin sheets of paper printed matter color probably labels the detective said yeah labels im thinking but who knows could be any printed matterchurch programs political flyers we didnt get a good look at any of them because of the decomposition during oxidation and thats what were hoping for by sending them out some kind of positive identification for you to work with boldt took notes despite the knowledge that bernie lofgrin would provide him with a copy of the preliminary report lab reports were overly technical and therefore difficult to interpret as far as youre concerned the most disturbing news was the detection of strychnine boldt shouted involuntarily what in a basement we expect the presence of rodent poisonsanticoagulants mostly but strychnine has no business being down there especially in the proximity of the workbench which is where we detected it we picked up traces in some of the ash samplesparts per million mind you trace amounts is allbut there was definitely strychnine in and around that area cholera if it was there the bacteria were sterilized by the fire were pretty damn sure that what remained of the electrical gear we found could have fit the parameters of a light box of the kind dr mann described to you and weve detected abundant amounts of melted polymers plastics specific to the manufacture of petri dishes so it was a home lab boldt stated lofgrin nodded sure could be his eyeballs seemed to be on springs why strychnine boldt asked himself quietly though lofgrin answered jim joness koolaid jamboree lofgrin reminded the guyana massacre the sudafed case here the tylenol tamperings poison of choice for tampering he explained tasteless odorless easily blended a mass poisoning boldt questioned reminded of the faxed threats with cholera lofgrin said if its identified and treated properly the patient stands a good chance of recovery not so with strychnine its extremely fasta few minutes is all theres your primary difference a few minutes boldt repeated reminded of caulfields threat to kill hundreds lofgrins phone rang he turned down the music answered the phone grunted and placed it back in the receiver matthews he informed boldt she says shes got some good news for you its about time someone did do we dare release the mug shot to the press boldt asked buoyed by macnamaras positive identification daphne told him i think not if he sees his own photo on the news two things are going to happen one hes going to go undergroundwe lose any chance of catching him at the atms two hell feel betrayed and may attempt to deliver on his larger threat let me run this by clements hell have an opinion for us boldt mentioned the strychnine and they discussed possible psychological motives for a more deadly poison and again she deferred to dr clements leaving her boldt made himself a copy of the face and left the original with one of the civilian office workers asking that it be photocopied and made available to all patrol personnel a be on lookout was issuedcaulfield would be detained and brought downtown if spotted boldt spent the afternoon distributing copies to the atm surveillance team moving between the various locations where his people were in position they had a face now and boldt considered it their first decent break kenny fowler lived in a deluxe apartment managed by inn at the market with maid and room service he seemed both proud and embarrassed by it as he showed boldt inside located directly above campagne restaurant the corner view looked out over the red neon signpublic market centerand across elliott bay and the slowly moving lights of seattles commercial shipping traffic the first room encountered housed a wet bar two couches a pair of overstuffed chairs a coffee table and a small dining table off of this was a studio kitchen a single bedroom with a water view and a luxurious bath that boldt knew liz would kill for boldt needed a favor and he did not enjoy coming to kenny fowler with his hand out he did not feel he could trust fowler fully for although they both wanted to see an end to the tampering fowler wanted credit no doubt motivated by a corporate hierarchy that encouraged competition he was also likely to want something in return for boldts request and boldt could not be sure he could or would grant any such request facing the picture window fowler said must be something important to bring the mountain to mohammed then he continued his nervous orbit of the room pouring himself a gin and tonic and joining boldt in the sitting area i need your help boldt announced once fowlers back was to him it caught the security man by surprise and he left his glass at the bar and returned to his seat without it im listening one of my people is exhibiting some peculiar behavior i need a background check maybe some surveillance and i dont want to involve internal affairs fowler nodded puts you in a bad position hes on my squad kenny its chris danielson danielson are you saying you think hes involved in this somehow have you spoken to him not yet i want this background check first what exactly has he done i need your help kenny maybe we should leave it at that everything everything you can get without it getting back to him that youre interested the discussion made boldt feel ugly and dirty at the same time he knew this was not the way it was supposed to be done and yet it seemed to him the most efficient use of manpower and time you think chris danielson is maybe drilling these soup cans fowler became crimson beside himself with confusion no i dont but im a little short of explanations of how the extortionist is never near the atms were watching fucking a danielsons giving out your surveillance information i dont know what hes doing but i want his dirty laundry if hes got any its that simple fowler took some notes saying aloud finances travel bigticket purchases he glanced up at boldt then returned his attention to the notepad family background maybe full background check college record all of it as much as you can give me fowler had that deerintheheadlights look about him what boldt asked fowler nodded am i to assume this conversation never took place that i found out about danielson poking around and decided to sit on him cause i can do that for you if you like i got a shitty memory lou thats the truth it wont come to that lets hope its all a big dead end but if it does if it does i dont want any lies you sure fowler tested it could mean your badge if it comes to that you realize that dont you im telling you i got a bad memory save it for when you need it ill make note of this meeting so that at least youre covered my idea my responsibility whatever this felt like criminal behavior to boldt and he blamed the sensation in part on fowler and his dramatics because the man had a wormy quality to him technically within certain parameters surveillance was not an illegal act but the background check was and both men knew it the truth was that people in fowlers position were paid under the table for such background checks all the time boldt knew there was no new ground being broken im not comfortable asking you kenny ive got to be upfront about that im here lou im part of this i know how the department feels about the kenny fowlers of this world its not that of course it is i steal a lot of your best people away from you i offered you once lou and you know that offers always open starting pay would be twice where you are with your three stripes i know boldt cut him off he had no use for another fowler recruitment pitch thanks listen the man said honestly i shade a lot of the laws theres a reason police drive blackandwhites you know kay so i live in the gray so what and i live better than any of you guys and maybe theres just a touch of resentment there no triplicate forms no bullshit we do our job and we collect big paychecks for our services and maybe our job takes us a little outside the code so what civil libertarians screwed the code up years ago anyway am i right kay fucking sandbaggers have more rights than a badge does any day so the system is set up to favor guys like kenny fowler and now you need me and im not going to bullshit you it feels good lou this is a day ill remember but maybe not for the reasons you think this just settles some of my own shit boldt had feared this exact lecture having to sit there and eat crow while fowler gloated and if he knew the man the quid pro quo was right around the next corner his piano time with miles the lecturing and now stepping outside the system he held dear despite his frustrations with it little pieces of boldts life were slipping away and the little pieces added up to the whole and it terrified him where this might be headed he worked on a pair of maalox its expensive what youre asking fowler said reading boldts mind although its adlers money and he wants this thing wrapped upobviouslyso what the fuck we can do it i cant help you there kenny you know the way it is im not talking about money lou you know what im saying i was hoping maybe adler wasnt the only one who wanted to see this thing wrapped boldt tested fowler offered a wooden smile and boldt felt his bowels stir sure sure he said he carefully measured his words we would like to be part of the extortion surveillance lou adler taplin mewe dont like you guys being the only ones looking out for mr adlers money you know how it is we have access to some super technologies stuff that theres no way you guys have we can tie all your operatives together restrict access use gps location devicesadlers pretty much given me a blank check these last couple years weve got the latest shit lou my hands are tied kenny you know that we dont include privates in our surveillance work it just doesnt happen thats bullshit lou come on who you talking to its me kenny shoswitz eats out of your handyouve been all but running that department for years you get what you ask for thats not true it is true all im asking is to protect my clients interests kay to be kept up to speed to help out you include us in the surveillance i can throw maybe ten guys your way i can loan you guys access to my dispatch center theres any number of ways i could help out youve gotta see that you cant tell me you got enough guys on this hell you guys are still using openchannel radiostell me you arent im decades ahead of you on this all our shit is digital fully restricted and encoded we can help in a big wayim telling you boldt suddenly understood the pitch he felt stupid that he had missed it at first youre already watching the atms arent you boldt inquired rhetorically just the pacwest machines or others as well youre trying to avoid possible charges later by making yourself included am i reading this right lou how many machines kenny what kind of access to the system do you have fowler would not look at boldt he rose crossed the room and finished pouring that drink for himself to the mirror behind the wet bar he said a list would do lou just the list of the atms you people are covering no reason to have two guys playing second base kay spread out the team i know you wont let a private in on the surveillance i accept that but me and my peoplemy resourcescan help out we can cover the areas that youre not kay you see that dont you is that wrong or is that cooperation coordination i want to help and no one including you will fucking let me what kind of fucking assbackwards sense does that make am i talking nonsense here tell me am i the drink was mixed and he carried it over to his chair and sat down carefully so as not to spill it because he had poured it tall my guys are good louyou know some of them as well as i do they were your guys not long ago hal fredricks jonny chi mac mackensiequality guys with me and my guys working some of the atms you get more coverage isnt that what you want he met eyes with boldt how about this you supply me with a list of the atms your guys are watching just the list lou thats all so we dont overlap he sipped the gin while boldt considered the deal you keep me current on that list and ill give you danielsons deepest darkest secrets he waited how bout it boldt attempted to gain some air the apartment despite its substantial size despite its stunning view suddenly felt claustrophobic to him he weighed his choices if he wanted the book on danielson fowler could have it for him nearly overnight was it so stupid to avoid duplicating surveillance of the atms he clarified i need the background work on danielson done quickly i need the surveillance conducted without his or anyone elses knowledge no slipups no risks that could jeopardize that i understand lou i understand fredricks chi mackensiehed recognize any of them somewhat angrily fowler said i can run a surveillance friend would you be asking if i couldnt what the hell do you think we did in major crimes eat pizza all day and talk sports it was a stab at the fraud division but boldt let it pass the sergeant asked matthews was going to ask you for some help got her place wired up good and tight nice stuff she wont be having any more prowlers he added in a bellicose fashion we take care of our people someone has a problem we fix it thats what were here for its a lot simpler than wearing that badge of yours believe me boldts cell phone rang and for a moment he did not know the sound was coming from his own pocket i think thats you fowler encouraged him boldt feeling selfconscious was not terribly comfortable with the device and he thought that fowler probably sensed this as he turned it on his awkwardness seemed to lend weight to fowlers claim of technical superiority and this bothered the sergeant he spoke in blunt terse acknowledgments grunts as he did fowlers phone rang though the security man did not move he watched boldt intently allowing an unseen answering machine to take the call boldt shut off the phone and said you want some involvement he was already out of his chair weve got an atm hit going down there was no hope of catching the extortionist during this first withdrawal but if this night were like the others there would be a second hit boldt wanted to be there he was on the phone with lucille guillard at pacwest bank by the time he ran the red light on first avenue fowler secured his seat belt they ran another light heading north toward queen anne and ballard the first withdrawal had been made in the u district lucille guillard was playing percentages believing a cluster of four banks on north fortyfifth street presented the next closest target how many people do you have in the field fowler asked the blue light of the dashmounted police bubble played off his face doing cruel things to his looks we have three roamers kcp has loaned us another fivetheyre at fixed locations eight people fowler gasped eight fucking people to cover every atm in the city youre fucking kidding me fowler confessed i have four stationaries they are each within a twoblock distance of three or more separate atm locations i have another four people on unmarked patrol but with very definite territories all told i figure ive got somewhere around thirtyfive of the fifty most active atms in the city covered but i bet youre covering some of the same ones boldt withheld comment fowler was organized well financed and obviously had a reserve of manpower on which to draw for someone in boldts position it was discouraging the second atm hit occurred at position according to the police dispatcher whose constant running commentary and absurdly calm instructions could be heard from beneath the dash on the offchance that a savvy reporter had figured a way to eavesdrop on this or any of the other secure radio frequencies the surveillance team was utilizing these reference numbers fowler spread it open on his lap he studied it a moment and said north fortyfifth street boldt turned right passing the waiting for the interurban sculpture and fowler said nice system nice and private i like it do you pretty much stick with this or mix it up were going to start mixing it up boldt informed him this is all i need lou you give me this map and at least we wont be stepping on each others toes hang on boldt interrupted recognizing adrian walcotts voice as he announced his location as north fortyfifth and latona boldt put his foot down hard and blew past traffic he turned left on stoneway ran two lights while sounding his horn and skidded the back end of the car through a yellow light at fortyfifth as fowler pointed right walcott announced in a harried voice im stuck in traffic fowler said to boldt friday night fortyfifth streetits a good place to disappear in a hurry if you have to a good place to lose the cops the maximum amount of time boldt could hope for was fifteen to twenty seconds per transaction he estimated that this time was about up confirmed when the dispatchers voice said transaction is complete repeat transaction is complete im going on foot announced an anxiousvoiced walcott passing meridian three blocks to go thought boldt are you there lucille guillard asked over the cell phone right here thats twelve hundred we could still see more from beneath the dash a winded adrian walcott announced im at position thirtythree theres no one using the machines boldt pulled over slammed the car into park taking the key and cut through the stalled westbound lane of traffic car horns sounded fowler cut to the right increasing the distance between them face after face of what were mostly young college students streamed past seeing his intensity these kid strangers looked away uneasily he encountered no sixfoot male wearing a greatcoat he caught up to walcott who sweating shook his head and cursed fowler said eagerly to boldt lets stay with this dodging traffic the two men ran back to the waiting car boldt grabbed the police radio handset he was willing to play a gamble cover the banks to the south and lets make sure our patrols are aware of the be on lookout for that mug shot dispatch acknowledged what about the north fowler asked do you want my people south boldt insisted the density of the atms favors the city thats a hell of a chance to take fowler objected boldt rudely handed him the cell phone tell your people to cover south of the bridge broadway and east of i ill keep our people west of the interstate he was in effect giving in to exactly what fowler had suggested the security man looked a little stunned but he made the call quickly before boldt changed his mind the radio began to sparkle with the new deployment boldt headed toward the university as he drove past the ramp to i fowler coming off his call queried where the fuck are we going back to square one why exactly boldt said swerving to miss two kids on mountain bikes who had disregarded a crossing light he came around the block and parked in front of the meany tower hotel at eleventh avenue ne because this offered him immediate access to the u districtand the ability to block the most predictable route the extortionist would take back to i the entrances to which were only two blocks away fowler scratched at a stain on his pants boldt explained softly so as not to cover the dispatchers voice if im this person i want it as crowded as possible as confusing as possible friday night this is where you come a couple of the malls maybebut theyve got cameras everywhere i hit the ave then i go out fortyfifthits close its quick and easy i head back to the u because it offers me everything im looking for and it worked the first time i was there i dont know fowler disagreed broadwaywhere your people areis my backup choice again lots of weekend activitya difficult area to police and only a few he was interrupted by the dispatchers bizarrely calm monotone position fourone all field operatives position fourone is active repeat active checking the map an excited fowler said its a pacwest its right around the fucking corner boldt stuffed a radio earphone into his ear and was already out of the car and on the run ten seconds active the dispatcher announced the average atm access time from keying in the pin to the atm card being returned to the account holder ran eighteen seconds no operatives in the immediate vicinity the dispatcher announced into boldts ear boldt had neglected to make his own position known and therefore dispatch remained unaware of his presence ten thousand eleven thousand he counted in his head natalie smith normally assigned to spds sex crimes checked in she had been crossing montlake bridge when the hit was announced now she was on her way back a minute away an eternity fourteen thousand fifteen thousand transaction complete dispatch announced boldt turned right took an immediate left through a parking lot and broke around the corner the blueandgreen pacwest bank sign hung over the sidewalk twenty yards ahead boldt said six feet tall maybe wearing a greatcoat he signaled fowler across the street boldt took this side moving quickly toward the sign and the entrance to pacwest kwikcash the sidewalk was mobbed he searched for caulfields face in the crowd the effect of the kids flowing past him was dizzying he reached the pacwest sign through the glass window he saw three atms side by side one was in use by a young redheaded woman a short womannot a sixfoottall harry caulfield boldt tugged on the door it was locked a small sign indicated how to use ones cash or credit card to gain entrance boldt slid a cash card into the slot and the door opened she glanced quickly at him but displaying none of the fear or concern he might have expected of a guilty party someone just left he interrupted her transaction showing her his badge she squinted that girl a girl boldt questioned recalling the account application weird chickshe was wearing a motorcycle helmet she nodded toward the door just left she said echoing him just now back out on the sidewalk in a teeming horde of college students boldt searched left right he saw the glossy dome of a motorcycle helmet on the opposite side of the street heading away from fowlers position not wanting to shout not wanting to alert the woman he signaled fowler making a motion around his head attempting to indicate a helmet and he pointed down the street fowler saw her boldt crossed the street just as natalie smiths tires yipped to a stop in heavy traffic a horn sounded the helmet turned sergeant smith yelled loudly from her car the helmet broke down an alley at a run fowler sprinting to catch up boldt pushed through the melee of teeming students and headed down the adjacent alley suddenly overcome with the stench of urine he jumped over a pair of legs at the last second and turned to see a man sleeping next to a bottle the helmeted figure blurred past the intersection with another alley heading to boldts left another blurfowler in pursuit boldt ran fast and reached the corner which he rounded in time to see fowlers back turn down an alley parallel to his he rounded this next corner as well and when he came to the end of the alley he faced another street teeming with hundreds of students kenny fowler was doubled over winded clutching the knees of his pants he gasped to boldt i lost her boldt searched the crowds for another half hour he issued a be on lookout for a motorcycle with a black helmet and female rider frustrated and out of his element a failed lou boldt returned to where he had last left fowler but the man was gone back at the car he found a business card on the seat where the surveillance map had been the map now belonged to kenny fowler with this one agreement boldt effectively doubled his surveillance manpowerand yet he did not feel right about it he did not feel entirely right about fowler something he attributed to fowlers having left the department to seek his fortune or maybe it was just the man unceremoniously direct and brusque he flipped the business card over where fowler had written thanks partner he pocketed it and drove straight to the big joke twentyfive a latenight talk show was playing on the television in the living room as bear berenson unlocked three locks and admitted boldt to his upstairs apartment kill the fatted calf berenson said admitting his friend and locking the door behind him whenever he heard a lock turn boldt felt he was somehow failing in his job liz is pregnant do i congratulate you or offer my sympathies miles gets a sibling boldt said elated congratulations thank you as usual the place was a mess berenson lived the quintessential bachelors existence he termed it magical realism because lately he was reading latin american writers boldt called it hedonism enhanced by a generous consumption of marijuanahence the magic bear stood just under six feet he was stocky with dark arabic features and intense brown eyesoften bloodshot he owned the big joke the bar restaurant and comedy club immediately below them where boldt often performed during happy hour i thought id find you downstairs the standup is awful i booked the wrong act place is pretty full no accounting for the taste of the public berenson punched the remote killing the television went channel surfing instead you know what i think all this information superhighway shit bunch of crap even with thirty channels theres nothing on i mean i have a hard time believing that but its true crap to the right of me crap to the left of me five hundred channels give me a fucking break five hundred times zero is still zero they sat down bear rolled a joint the policeman in boldt felt tempted to ask him not to but not tonight im kind of at wits end boldt said seriously bear nodded they were the kind of friends where boldt felt no need for apologies or approval they had beenand continued to bethere for each other through as bear called it the good the bad and the ugly im right back into it solid work leaving liz and miles and you and others in the lurch in to the point i cant get out buried in it along with a few victims do you want out i need outtheres a difference for me its this damn club the irs had shut down the club and seized much of its property about a year earlier and bear had stood up and fought them and had won now he had the place back though at times he complained about it are we talking about freedom or escape breathing room to be away from death more than my three weeks a year three weeks i never take i love this workthats the thing he lit the joint so do you hate it or do you love it im exhausted i say stupid things when im exhausted you say stupid things all the time he grinned pleased with himself and smoked more of the joint he stubbed it out gently in the ashtray holding his breath for an interminable amount of time when he exhaled surprisingly little smoke escaped boldt said i think ive got a bad apple one of your own squad boldt nodded that hurts another nod a guy i like and what do you do about it i hide the truth from him i sit back and watch boldt informed him someone broke into daffys maybe following her this guy of yours hes moved to the top of my list hes got good taste if hes after daffy then berenson added just kidding what do you do if you suspect a bartender is robbing your till boldt asked i watch him i lay a trap for him and does it work sometimes sure its a funny thing with the people who cheat they get numb to it you know they talk themselves into things if its petty stuff if i just want to stop it i confront the person if its the bigger shit i lay a fucking minefield and blow a leg off like this he said he turned the television back on and switched channels the screen showed a blackandwhite image of inside the cluban area immediately behind the bar including a close look at the cash register and several of the stools he said no one knows its there are you so sure its funny you should say that some people obviously feel the thing you know look right at it they cant see itits behind a beer mirrorbut they feel it that thirdeye thing yet after a while they stop looking numb just like the thieving bartenders he said maybe youre just numb lou maybe youre looking into the mirror a little too hard maybe youre stoned no maybe about it im roasted he waited a minute and asked whats your excuse im thinking so thats what that is i always wondered what that looked like shoswitz had ordered boldt to take the weekend off the city and department had rules about consecutive hours on the jobrules constantly broken but easily enforced if someone like shoswitz felt the necessity to do so nevertheless boldt spent the early morning at the kitchen table doing paperwork theres a mercedes out front and i think its for you elizabeth boldt announced from where she stood parting the front curtains who is coming by unannounced at eightthirty on a saturday morning and me looking like this boldt had been up for the last hour tending to miles and working at the kitchen table with a baby spoon in one hand and a pencil in the other he had had four hours sleep and felt it liz wore a white satin robe tied tightly around her waist open in a long v of bare skin at the chest stretching from her neck to her navel and black chinese flats for slippers that lent a further touch of elegance her dark hair was pulled tightly off her sleepy face held back by a turquoise rubber band and she had silver studs in her ears i think you look fantastic he told her handing her her first cup of coffee and stealing a look for himself oh shit boldt seldom cursed and this caught his wifes attention lou its adler hurrying toward the front door to open it boldt defensively apologized i did not schedule this im gone his wife said beating a hasty retreat miles caught a glimpse of his mother and complained for her attention as she dashed into the bedroom all satin and skin not now sweetie she told the child although this communication only added to the childs longing boldt yanked open the door said inside and closed it just as quickly so that adler never broke his stride what are you doing here his eyes bloodshot his skin an unhealthy gray adler wore a wrinkled aquamarine polo shirt stonewashed blue jeans and leather deck shoes with leather ties his arms were hairy his watch was gold he needed a shave im folding the company he declared i thought that you should be told before the press conference boldt felt like throttling the man on the spot but maintained his composure boldt offered him coffee and adler accepted too nervous to sit down adler faked a smile at miles and paced the small kitchen toying with whatever he found on the counter mumbling he said its all over the newsthis family dyingalthough theyre claiming its believed to be e coli its not e coli right the first thing you have to do is settle down boldt advised sternly i know thats easier said than done i thought you wanted us to pull our product have you eaten anything eaten are you kidding what would you recommendsome soup maybe have you slept adlers eyes flashed anger this isnt about me this is about that poor family its about tap and i trying to stay in the market because once you leaveespecially in a situation like thisits damn near impossible to get back market shares its about greed sergeant and egotrying to hold on to something we fought hard for and its over and are you going to kill yourself that stopped adler from fiddling he looked over at boldt who said because thats the second half of the demands i dont know what im going to do hello it was liz she who had apparently dived into a pair of jeans and a tshirt barefoot a hint of lipstick nothing more she introduced herself to adlerreintroduced as it turned out for he recognized her immediately as being connected to the bank lizs bank had partially financed adlers move into the european marketplace something she had never told her husband because she took client confidentiality at face value wisely having taken one look at the man she made no attempt at small talk she said why dont i take over duties here pointing to her son whose arms were begging for her boldt led adler back into the front room liz stopped adler on his way by and gently took the serrated bread knife from him he seemed embarrassed to be holding it as if he did not know how it had gotten there boldt guided him onto the couch and placed his coffee down for him sounding on the edge of tears adler said no more deaths boldt had no intention of babying a man like owen adler adopting a businessasusual tone of voice he said if you intend on shutting down your business theres little i can do to stop you but i would caution you against it and although i strongly objected to keeping product on the shelves during the initial contaminations i dont see any way around it right now boldt understood then that he had no choice but to take adler into his confidence and though he would have rather checked with daphne before doing so he could not allow adler to risk the lives of hundreds by panicking we know who the killer is adler too stunned to get a word out cocked his head at an unusual angle and glared at him his name is harold caulfield he worked for mark meriweather at longview farms but why wasnt i boldt interrupted we think he blames you for the longview salmonella contamination he wants to see you bankrupt and dead just like mark meriweather daphne is the one running with this but i have to tell you that it was my decision not to inform you or your company we have evidence that the state health department altered at least one lab report crucial to the placement of responsibility for the new leaf salmonella contamination it seemed to me unlikely that a state government employee would take such an action without an incentive the who when and what of that incentive remains in question this news clearly struck a blow to adler looking ill again he sank back into the couch too dumbfounded to speak boldt continued in the short amount of time ive known you youve struck me as being straightforward so thats what im being with you whether youre an honest man i cant say but whatever you or your people may have done to mark meriweather its insignificant when compared with the lives of slater lowry and the mishnovs if you or one of your people was behind that altered state health report boldt said i need to know right now i have no idea what youre talking about people could lie and boldt in his role as a homicide cop had sat across from some of the best of them and could often spot them but to his knowledge a person could not intentionally make himself pale much less pale to the point that the skin seemed green and the lips looked like those of a cadaver he believed adler i wont pretend were close to apprehending this man but we are closer and if you shut down your company now theres no predicting his response we believe that the atm surveillance offers us the fastest most predictable way to apprehend caulfield even if he is using a runner which remains a strong possibility that ransom money is our way back to caulfield shutting down your company pulling your product is likely to have an adverse effect on him change his agendatake his attention off the money and put it back on the mass poisoning at the moment he seems reluctant to deliver on his larger threat and i for one have no intention of testing his resolve of pushing him over the top i want to know everything there is to know about this longview farms incident adler said too calmly he appeared to be in shock what exactly do you know sergeant we believe the contamination was not salmonella but staphylococcus staph is most commonly transmitted by physical contact which suggests maybe one of your workers forgot to wear his gloves your product went out on the shelves and people got sick good god he gasped we believe there was a coverup to keep new leaf in the clear and that it involved altering documents to place the responsibility on bad poultry at longview farms this is why daphne wanted access to our files yes it is boldt added your cooperation your confidence is crucial to the success of this investigation as difficult as it may be you need to continue on as if you knew none of this at the same time your cooperation in proceeding with the investigationhelping daphne get what she needswould be a welcome asset the man nodded slowly his eyes in a fixed stare at someplace over boldts shoulder are you telling me that these killings all of this suffering is the result of some misconceived attempt six years ago to keep us out of trouble boldt nodded they saw it often enough in homicide the biggest crimes are often committed trying to hide the smaller ones on sunday morning he and liz and miles drove up to the lake because liz asked him to and he had no desire to fight her as well another member of their family was on the way and yet the very family this child would soon join seemed fragmented and in a fragile condition the lake cabin always helped no phone no radio a game of scrabble maybe some chores some reading a fire if the evening was cool enough a swim if he was brave enough to endure the coldness of the lake water but boldt did not sleep and somewhere in the night he strayed out into the darkness in a plaid bathrobe with worn elbows after a commune with the flat blackness of the lakes starlit surface he migrated toward the car where he had left his briefcase and his papers when liz rose to a cold bed at four in the morning and found him by a small fire going through his papers she said nothingthough he knew he had ruined their stay at dawn he did swim and it chilled him to his bones and liz was there with a towel when he came out she was quiet on the drive back miles was noisy they had to leave by six in order to make work on time and they beat most of the bad traffic after forty minutes of following license plates and sitting tall so that his visor blocked the morning sun boldt reached for the radio knob in order to catch the start of morning edition liz reached out and stopped him i try not to involve myself in your cases she said quietly not looking at him even cases like thisthe ones that seem to kill youbecause there is so little i can do so little i know that might help and i believe it important that at least one of us be rooted in some kind of reality to help the other find ground he could think of nothing to say to that an eighteenwheeler passed them he noticed that it was a poultry truck and this serendipity did not elude him the chickens were stacked in ventilated crowded cages some feathers escaped and caught in the slipstream were carried along behind the trailer like a bridal train i think i may be able to help she offered but im afraid to because in a way it violates the parameters of this relationshipand that frightens me when i am crazy at the bank you are my anchor and i would like to think that the same is true for you and i fear that if i become involved even in the smallest most insignificant way that in effect that sets us adrift that joins the two of us but separates us from any tie back to reality does this make any sense sure but he knew he did not sound convinced i am a banker love as in atm machines accounts withdrawals loans now does it make sense he did not answer you have explained this case to meat least some of it the atm partand yet you never asked my advice the one area i know something about and you didnt ask i didnt think no you didnt she interrupted in order to make her own point and i didnt know if it was because you didnt want my input didnt want to cross that line we keep so delicately stretched between us or because it never occurred to you to ask boldt did not like car discussions and his wife knew it he had to wonder why she had waited until now to start this conversation they had just spent twentyfour hours in the solitude and quiet of the lake and she waits for the morning commute that affords no eye contact no real contact at all to launch into this youre upset she said the timing is all car talk right but its easier sometimes for me can you see that for all the reasons you dont like it it makes it easier for me i can avoid those hard looks of yours even though i feel them i never mean to exclude you from anything he apologized i know that you do it but i know you dont mean to and i can use all the help i can get thats all i needed to hear she said and she reached for the radio knob this time boldt stopped her are you going to tell me i need to make some phone calls research a few things but i didnt want to put the time into it i didnt want to do it if it was something that might cause us problems we have enough of those boldt took his eyes off the road briefly and met hers he went back to the dotted lines and the turn signals but that look of hers hung like a transparency through which he saw all else she was as terrified of their future as he was and for some inexplicable reason he found this comforting he slid his hand down onto the seat and inched it over and found hers and they rode down into the citys sparkling skyline hand in hand miles grunting and fidgeting from his car seat part of boldt wished he could just keep on driving it was clear from looking at her that daphne matthews had not taken the weekend off i spent most of saturday and all of sunday and sunday night with dr clements going over the profile hes upset about those two faxes coming in on the same day and the lack of any attempt to place blame in the extortionists demand so you were right about that he reminded her trying to cheer her up but it was not the opinion of dr richard clements that was troubling her it was the fax she handed to boldt this just came in she told him having a craving for sweets mother warned that candy is bad but you do not listen do you you will wish you had boldt reread the message several times though there was no need to do so she pointed out that in this fax the placement of blame had returned and she did so in a forceful way that carried a subtext that she failed to explain to him caulfield bought those candy bars at foodland for a reason he said he had sensed this from the moment of discovery but had hoped differently they substituted all their candy products she reminded though she gave away her own fears in the tight knitting of her brow and the way she entwined her hands in a squirming knot he told me about your conversation youve seen him boldt protested no not in the flesh but we call each other both of us from pay phonesits really a perfect arrangement she snapped sarcastically dont worry sergeant she said caustically annoyed with him were taking all necessary precautions she added and let me say that i consider my private phone calls my own damn business i respect that i certainly hope so she was clearly miffed her exhaustion hung over her face like a veil hes incredibly angry over the possible coverup he offered to help get any paperwork we need but i told him that we were more likely to subpoena what were after from here on out so that we kept it admissible i can see youre worried but let me tell you something owen adler can handle any amount of stress and keep a poker face through any dealings we dont have to worry about him lou hes not going to give any secrets away i know this must be hard on you he offered its hard on all of us but thank you yes it is she still was angry though less so perhaps with him or with the situationhe was not certain he placed the fax down onto his desk i would hope that weve learned enough from his earlier threats to issue a second recall immediately threat or no threat freeze all sales at the retail level and try to trade out product again restock the shelves overnight and hope that harry caulfield doesnt hear about it she agreed that he should fax adler with the request immediately you know what really ticks me off boldt said another couple of days the new soup labels will be ready to go and now he goes switching products on us and more curious to meis he just lucky or does he know which atm machines weve got under surveillance on his desk were field reports for the atm hits that had occurred both saturday and sunday nights a combined amount of fortytwo hundred dollars had been withdrawn no agent had been within ten blocks of the atm machines chosen for the hits he did not tell her that fowler now had a copy of the surveillance map and that they had effectively doubled their team because to include her was to involve herand if it went up in flames he did not want her part of it boldt said hes got over ten grand already not bad for less than a week of work a little more than my takehome he won a slight grin from her though it did not qualify as a smile so we wait for him to kill someone he asked he reminded himself that adler had offered to pull all their product and that he boldt had talked him out of it he reminded himself of the labs discovery of strychnine in the longview ashes bernie lofgrins reference to the jim jones tragedy and his reasons for convincing adler not to panic but it was lou boldt who now felt in a state of panic call clements he told her passing her the phone ask his opinion about pulling the candy bars immediately instead of waiting until tonight and see what he would think about putting out the recall on the newsabout warning the public about this she looked as terrified as he felt she dialed the number from memory to the room and was put through they talked for the better part of five minutes in the middle of which she shook her head at boldtclements was advising against violating the conditions of the threats she hung up and said hes taking caulfield at his word but its still your call he tasted biting sarcasm on the tip of his tongue but kept it in he kept in his fear as well as best he could over the next few hours the clock hands actually seemed to slow down and it seemed incredible to him that these were the same minutes by which he lived his life they seemed hardly related at all he willed his phone not to ring and yet heard the endless ringing of the phones around him in a way he had never before experienced there was rarely a moment of silence on this floor there always seemed to be someone talking a phone ringing a door shutting a shout a reprimand a curse he wanted to yell for them all to shut up each time a phone purred he thought it signaled the end of a life and many of these calls did even though they had nothing to do with the work of harry caulfield the business of homicide went right on without lou boldt the teenagers the lovers the drowningsall required investigation pasquinis squad was up to their waists in new cases but the departments only black hole belonged solely to lou boldt and the fax staring back at him was a signpost of what lay around the next curveand boldt had no desire to get there he mentally backpedaled knowing full well it was as useless as swimming from a waterfall at a few minutes past six oclock owen adler instituted the second secret recall of all gobars and mochalatte peanut crunches a costly timeconsuming effort that boldt feared would prove too late to date as far as boldt could tell caulfield had only sent a threatening fax once the contaminated product was in someones hands he could envision the man as he stood around and watched as he inspected the shelves periodically to see if his prize had been taken lamoia brought boldt some thai takeout before heading out on atm surveillance duty he offered it to both daphne and boldt but neither touched the food boldt had not eaten all daya day that dragged interminably into evening when phone calls did come boldt answered them tersely prepared for the worst more cholera more illness more people clinging to their lives he answered them rudely hung up quickly and he found it difficult if not impossible to get any work done but you do not listen do you you will wish you had he thought many times of his conversation with adler of his efforts to convince him to allow the product to remain on the shelves even with the support of dr richard clements he could only see this now as a huge mistake he prepared himself for nearly every eventualityexcept the one that finally came he noted the time of the callout of habit and out of habit he checked for his weapon for his identification wallet and for the keys to his car there were two boys deadstill up in their tree house he was told by the dispatcher not cholera no chance for emergency rooms or resuscitation without any pathology report without a lab test or a professional opinion of any sort boldt knew both the murder weapon and the cause of death a chocolate candy bar and strychnine twentysix the bodies had been discovered in wedgewood in the backyard tree house of a home in the thirtyonehundred block of northeast eightyfirst street the hysterical mother explained to the dispatcher that the boys had not responded to her summons to come inside theyre just sitting up there she had sobbed over the phone just sitting there because it was a death by suspicious causes the call was first relayed to wedgewood authorities then mistakenly to king county police and finally because of an astute switchboard operator to boldts office phone boldt arrived reluctantly not wanting to get out of his car as in one of his recurring dreams he had a longing to turn back the clock to that moment immediately before the incident and to be there to save these victims the evening sun worked unmercifully to blister the tree houses cape codgray paint an old wooden ladder with initials carved into the stock stretched up into the darkened hole above the tree house itself was not like the ones boldt remembered from his own childhood it appeared more the product of a catalogue purchase he elected not to speak with the hysterical mother but headed directly to the crime scene instead there would be time later for talking too much of it as far as boldt was concerned a uniformed officer stood at his side and she knew better than to say anything boldt had a reputation as a loner at homicide crime scenesand every uniform was aware of it dixie was on his way as were bernie lofgrin and his id crew it was all being done as quietly as possible though this time there was sure to be press and this time there could be no stretching the facts to include e coli contamination certainly caulfield knew that the press and the police had to be involvedand this above all else terrified boldt the most caulfield no longer cared something inside him had changed facing the press would not require the public information officer to make any mention of adler foods or for the time being the candy bars that boldt felt certain to find in the tree house above him the press would be told that the case was an active homicide and was under investigation no more no less he looked up the long stretch of ladder once again up into that dark mouth in the floor of the erector set tree house she handed him a flashlight without a word and he reminded himself to get her name later and to thank her for her professionalism a few more cops arrived in the backyard but seeing boldt at work they left immediately and kept others out only boldt and his uniformed sidekick remained he climbed the ladder slowly not wanting to see the first true homicide crime scene this case had presented him again there were no witnesses to the actual crime and again lou boldt would have little to go on boldt recalled explicitly his promise to slater lowrys mother that the boy would be back to finish his model of the space shuttle there would be no such lies to tell this woman inside this house she had been up this ladder first one of the boys had made for the hatch for the ladder but had come up short he was facedown his arms outstretched as if reaching for a ball the other was curled into the fetal position in the corner wearing a death mask of pure horror as if in the middle of a scream it was a small room it was going to be hard on all the technicians the weakened flashlight beam illuminated a pink plastic squirt gun sandwich wrappers and comic books a deck of cards the small white skull and part of the spine of a mouse kept as a game trophy a stephen king paperback on the rooms only shelf its pages curled there was a candle on the shelf as well its wax puddled at its base a baseball with a tangle of autographs a poster of dinosaurs and another entitled the marine life of puget sound boldt could imagine them talking up here the laughter quiet now the first candy bar he saw was halfeaten in bold excited letters the wrapper read ironically new good for you it was an adler foods granolaandcaramel gobar poisoned boldt recalled the grainy image of caulfield at the foodland checkout counter he recalled the register tape listing three candy bars and some kind of ice cream he recalled his diligence in convincing adler to keep the shelves stocked he apologized to the boys and he caught himself dragging his sleeve across his eyes and could feel that uniform down there looking up at him wondering what he was doing get out of here he shouted down at her and she hurried away before he could stop her before he could apologize to her as well he wondered what had become of him and turning back to these two fallen victims whatever became of a childs departed soul twentyseven come up the park steps to the guest house no lights ill meet you there click daphne hung up the phone checked the clock twelve midnight owen had risked a call that alone told her enough about his state of mind the palpable fear in his voice told her more than she wanted to know she jumped up off the stool quickly buttoned her jeans and left her project on the counter it was the affidavit requesting the new leaf bank records that she had meticulously reviewed with striker over the phone in order to mark where she had left off she pointed the lead of the pencil to the word intractable leaving the houseboat she took special care to arm the alarm system locked up and hurried to her car made somewhat frantic by that tone of voice of his she drove around the lake crossed at the fremont bridge and took leary and market out to shilshole marina entering the park and winding her way up the series of switchbacks until she reached the picnic ground on the left she parked deep into the area and it was not until she climbed out into the darkness the traffic below whining eerily that she became aware of her isolation she took her bearings allowing herself a quick pang of fearthe woods were dark and she was still far below the estate her fears were only partially alleviated by the presence of her handgun she had never seen a handgun as any kind of solution had there been any choice she would have gladly entered through adlers front gate but adler could not be seen having any contact with the policethe threats were adamant in that regardand so she felt obliged to approach the estate from the back side as he had asked of her and to do so secretively without being seen she had been on several long walks with owen during which they had descended through the forest trail to this same picnic area and farther down to where the same road looped back around and lower again to the condominiums that lived uncomfortably like unwanted inlaws on the shores edge bordering the marina she had never hiked it in darkness never by herselfhad never climbed the trails precipitous steps but only descended her key chain carried a strong penlight and despite owens instructions to the contrary she felt tempted to use it she always carried her small handbag with her because of the weapon and identification it contained it usually hung at her side suspended by a thin strap but it was also capable of being secured to a belt europeanstyle which was how she presently carried it this the parks steepest and longest stretch of steps had not been maintained since the city park system citing budget constraints and angry over adlers challenge of a rightofway across his property had abandoned its maintenance several years before for his part owen claimed they had closed the stairs after settling a lawsuit out of court the result of this abandoned maintenance was an impossibly steep and dangerous set of rotting railroad ties engulfed by untold species of junglelike plants at a few of the more treacherous switchbacks the route offered an occasional steelpipe handrail though they were not to be trusted she entered the trail and began the arduous climb finding more light than she had expected the going was slow and she stopped repeatedly to catch her breath and contain her frantic heartbeat halfway up she wished she had made other arrangements it was during her third rest break that she at first sensed and then heard movement deep within the woods realizing to her considerable alarm that she was not alone hello she called out reflexively then chastised herself for doing so despite her suspicions over the past two weeks she still failed to think like a victim ever a cop never a victim within seconds of her outcry she began moving again aware that an object at rest offered an easy target it occurred to her that it was faster to descend than continue to climb but the sound had come from below and to her lefton the trail itself and not very far back she moved quietly her ears alert telling herself that a deer a dog even a squirrel might cause such sounds she stopped again and there it was but this time above her and to her right nearly the opposite direction as before struggling against the idea she convinced herself that someone not something was out there and he or she knew that she was on this trail the psychologist in her realized that fear could be dissipated only by acceptance not challenge to challenge fear was to succumb to paranoia and terror both of which she had experienced in the last several weeks she focused on turning off all thought and allowing the fear to rise in her chest there was no choice but to take this back route tempted to cry out she channeled this release into her legs and bounded up the trail at an allout sprint on the run she reached into her purse removed the handgun and with the touch of a finger ensured that the safety was engaged she welcomed the weapon defensivelya scare tactic if needed finding her pace she moved fluidly following the steep switchbacks her eyes now fully adjusted she kept watch for a place to duck off the trail and hide deciding it would be foolish to lead a possible pursuer to owens guest cottage she had three strong candidates for who was back there firstand the most likely it seemeda reporter second whoever had been following her third harry caulfield but it was a possible combination that charged her with energy had it been harry caulfield following her and watching her her foot punched through rotten timber and she fell hard looking out at a short level stretch of trail connecting to another set of steps hearing her pursuer even closer she ducked into the woods she was quite near the top as little as forty yards to go the surrounding terrain quite steep the trail wedged between a v of rock and offering the only clear way up she hid herself against a cedar tree and muted her keys as she sought them from her pocket interested solely in the penlight attached to them below and to her right her pursuer approached up the trail not twenty yards back she visualized the area through which she had just passed settling her nerves with deep breaths and planning her actions like a hunter in a blind the next thing she heard was ragged breathing and the rapid approach of footsteps and then complete and total silencethe drumming of blood in her ears her hands shook belying her selfconfidence again she trained her fear into the center of her chest allowing it a physical presence in her like some kind of demon and her hands steadied how close was he no sooner had this thought entered her mind than the looming shape of a man appeared within a few feet of her stealthily moving up the trail he too appeared on edgehe had lost track of her she sprang with incredible force and speed driving her heel into the side of his knee her right shoulder into his left and propelled him to the trails dirt floor in this same steady motion she delivered her words loudly and with great authority police i am armed do not move the flashlight came on brightly under her direction and found him facedown his hands were empty of any weapon instead clutching that painful knee he moved his arms slowly for her like the wings of an awakening bird easy he announced im on your side she knew the voice though she could not place it the light followed his motions mackensie formerly detective mackensie of major crimes recruited bymac she asked again though it was clearly he she staggered back a step and made her weapon ready and returned it to her purse why are you following me following you mackensie inquired adding his own emphasis working his knee carefully and sitting up dont compliment yourself trying his knee again he said jesus matthews you coulda broke it what are you what am i what are you doing here im perimeter patrol kennys got one of us on all four sides of the estate youre lucky it wasnt dumbo you tried that onheda broke your collarbone and then some patrol he is the boss matthews the ceo hell he doesnt even know were out here but here we are he stood up and brushed himself off whats left of us he said sarcastically in case you havent been paying attention theres a wacko out there drilling holes in his soup cans its our job to make sure he doesnt try to drill a hole in the boss comprendo kill owen its one of his stated aims right or are you going to try and throw some psychobabble shit at me that says this boy is going to play by the rules dont do that okay not with me play dr ruth with someone else mac mackensie was so much the opposite of what she had expected that she felt momentarily speechless fowler had stolen him away from the department less than a year before for a huge salary a company car and six weeks paid vacation mackensie was a good copor had been he was a prime example of the brain drain being effected on spd by the private firms what exactly are you doing here he asked in a lower voice touching her hand and convincing her to extinguish the flashlight i mean i know you two you know but i thought i was under the impression that its not that she fired back at him realizing that sex was the only possibility in mackensies perverted mind its an emergency she explained he wouldnt say what and if you make a crack about that ill snap your other knee if you tell anyone about this he warned defending his manhood testing his knee and finding it sound ill make some serious trouble for you matthews and thats no shit go lift your leg on a tree mackensie im terrified she added do not follow me any farther and broke off at a run as she approached the summit she wondered why she had failed to consider the possibility of an attack on owen why this had not come up in her discussions with clements had it been kept from her because of her personal connection to adler she moved faster her imagination explaining the reason for owens call had there been an attack she ran now was that why mackensie was patrolling the woods the thought of losing owen terrified her and this fear of losing him seemed to further define her feelings to illustrate to her just how committed to him she was since the start of their relationship she had taken on more work hiding afraid to get too close her volunteer work at the shelter her contact with her girlfriends had suffered as well she thought about him all the time and she ran from those thoughts but now she ran toward him terrified by the thought of a world without him she swung open the cottage door and spotted his distinctive silhouette against the blank pane of a darkened window hurried across the room and threw herself into his arms thank god she said he held to her tightly and said how nothing was worth their separation how worried he was about losing herand she laughed that they could be thinking the same thoughts perhaps she thought she finally knew love after several minutes of holding each other they settled into a comforting stillness and a satisfying warmth later they untangled themselves and she said selfconsciously you didnt call me for this its nice he admitted then what he called me he stated this so matteroffactly that daphne nearly missed the content she studied his face in the ambient light from the main house that penetrated the large window i wasnt sure what to do called you although she had clearly heard his words the professional in her vied for time attempting to fit this behavior into something she understood i answered the phone and there was this silence on the other end its funny because i normally would have hung right upwrong number prank call one of corkys friends too bashful to speak a phone solicitation but i didnt hang up somehow i knew dont ask me how she studied his face to measure his state of mind how far could she dig he seemed rattled but okay this was her chance to hear the truth his mind would betray him his memory less clear embellishments omissions she faced these with all witnesses adler said its me he said the one youre after the faxes and i couldnt speak i froze ive been in dozens maybe hundreds of complex negotiations and ive never frozen like that his next words came out with difficulty he said that i took everything he loved away from him that i had ruined everything that i had lied and cheated long enough he told me that i could stop it and that if i failed to he would take everything away from me he said something like how simple it is for you to stop it and yet you wont will you and you know why dont you we both know why adlers voice caught and he looked away in doing so his face was blanketed in shadow and she could not make out his features only the top of his head which he hung in shame owen he called me a cowardwhich i am of course thats absurd and you know it he asked if i had heard the late news he said it can get much worse it will get much worse time is running outyou know that dont you tic tic tic tic tic he made noises like a clock he said it will be too late to stop it and he hung up strange thing isi never said one word he might have been talking to a babysitter for all he knew a cold penetrating chill started at the back of her scalp are you sure she asked never a word she grabbed on to his shirt slid off the couch and pulled him to the floor with her daffy he protested but she quieted him with a shh and led him crawling across the floor and into the windowless bathroom she pushed the door shut locked it and turned on a pale nightlight that colored the white walls cream her clothes were damp from the exhausting climb up the trail what are you doing he asked tenderly grinning amused with her fingering a lock of her hair that hung in her eyes she glanced at him hotly afraid fumbled through her small purse and pulled up the antenna on the cellular phone she questioned how did he know it was you on the phone owen she keyed in the phone number too hastily and made a mistake forcing her to cancel several digits and reenter them angrily she asked how did he know adlers mouth slacked open did you come by the tunnel she asked again he failed to answer adler had purchased two waterview estates on loyal and had connected them into one the former landowner a product of the paranoia of the early sixties had installed a bomb shelter in his backyard at great expense with an underground tunnel connecting it to the main house owen now used the bomb shelter as a wine cellar and had also connected the guest house to it via a tunnel so that guests could share access to the fine wines and more important avoid the miserable rains when going back and forth between the two houses it was a gimmick and used rarely because owen adler rarely entertained overnight guests with his busy schedule still he loved showing off both the tunnel and his extensive wine collection and he used the tunnel whenever possibleeven in nice weather did you yes the tunnel he managed to say boldt was not home she apologized to liz for calling late hung up and called boldts pager number keying in her cellular phone number when the recording asked for it for two minutes she and owen adler sat shoulder to shoulder in an awkward silence on the bathrooms tile floor her cellular phone chirped and she answered it instantly its me she told boldt im at owens he was here loucaulfieldhe may still be here what adler exclaimed right she said into the phone were in the guest house well wait corky adler said thinking of his daughter he came to his feet but daphne caught hold of his shirt she disconnected the call still holding him back she told her lover ill go adlers face contorted here she spoke rapidly he knew it was you on the phone owen you said so yourself she waited briefly for this to register but adler was a mass of confusion she said impatiently he knew because he was lookinghe was watching you adler sprang for the door but daphne blocked him with a straight arm and ordered him to lock the doors behind her its you he wants im going for corky to hell with that he said shoving her aside abruptly he threw open the door and ran for the tunnel daphne followed but failed to catch him the concrete tunnel consisted of two long subterranean passages that met outside the wine cellars vaultlike steel door the passage to the main house was noticeably older its lights more widely spaced and therefore darker when she did catch up to him he was in corkys room his arms wrapped around his elevenyearold who was caught halfway between waking and dreaming corky wrestled loose of her fathers constraints jumped out of bed and assaulted daphne leaping into her arms daffy she exclaimed using boldts nickname for her that followed her everywhere carrying the heavy child who hung from her neck awkwardly daphne edged to the windows and pulled the drapes seeing this adler helped her and the darkened room became darker still what now he asked her helping corky off her you stay right here daphne said defiantly ill get the lights and lock up this time adler nodded are you cooking breakfast corky asked her this was the euphemism they used when daphne spent the night no not tonight daphne answered she met eyes with owen his eyes were filled with tears boldt understood immediately the difficulty he faced if he descended on adlers estate with ten patrol cars and the entire lateshift id unit and if the estate were being watched the involvement of the police would be rather obvious on the other hand if the tin man were somewhere on the property and boldt passed up an opportunity to contain him and apprehend him then he was throwing away innocent lives he checked his watch his squads shift had ended at midnight fortyfive minutes ago he reached lamoia at home and ten minutes later bobbie gaynes at her apartment he tried danielsons apartment failed to reach the man and had the dispatcher page the detective hoping for a call back on the cellular he called in five patrol cars each with two uniforms and deployed them roughly around the perimeter of adlers estatenot an easy task given the terrain and layout of the loyal area one officer from each team was to stay with the car the other to make ready to work his or her way toward the main house if requested he roused shoswitz and prosecuting attorney michael striker and informed them of the developments it was during his conversation with shoswitz that he learned that two different atms had been hit that night and yet another three thousand dollars withdrawn boldt arrived at adlers ninethousandsquarefoot home ahead of either of his detectives he pulled daphne aside and the two talked over boldts plan for several minutes its pretty lowprofile at the moment boldt explained in case things change and we need it shoswitz is arranging for komos traffic chopper for air surveillance the news radio chopperits services often lent to spdwould also carry a swat sharpshooter but boldt left that part out daphne abhorred the entire approach of swatshoot first talk later he was shown to adlers sumptuous office which was hidden behind a moving bookshelf the decor reminded boldt of an english manor home the office window faced out to the water and the precipitous terrain leading down to daphnes unseen car parked far below in golden gardens park the only point of view into this office boldt observed would be from the lawn or one of those trees they looked out at the broken teeth of the jagged horizon in private daphne told boldt about her encounter with mackensie in those very woods and boldt weighed what to do about it as gaynes and lamoia arrived separately but nearly at the same moment boldt was on the phone to fowler the security man dodged any direct answer about the estates surveillance and said he would look into it boldt furious advised that he look into it quickly were going into those woods with our safeties off boldt explained you had better get your people out of there by the time a nervous and perspiring boldt had quickly briefed his two detectives kenny fowler called back theres no one currently deployed fowler told him but we have a slight problem on this endmight be technical might not be we cant seem to raise mackensie with daphnes help they searched the house thoroughly checking every possible hiding place and then locked it up tightly and armed the security system outside lamoia took the high ground assigned to check the gardens and shrubs and landscape the three of them used secured policefrequency radios that connected them to one another and with the perimeter patrol personnel who were put on an armedanddangerous alert boldt and bobbie gaynes took the hillside while daphne patrolled the homes interior they started down the steep hillside trail together but quickly separated because it became obvious that the only trees offering a view of adlers office were perched near the very top of the incline boldt went left gaynes right he checked behind him frequently watching for the beam of her flashlight as it swept the trees and ground cover from training he mentally divided the area into a number of grids and approached his search as he would a homicide crime scene methodically he moved from grid to grid patiently alert for some sign of recent activity he found just such a sign about twenty yards into the thicketdeep enough that when he turned he could no longer see the light from the efforts of bobbie gaynes the stems of a large plant were crushed and a few feet farther along he noticed a skid mark where a boot or shoe had recently kicked a rut into the fallen brown pine needles beyond this he encountered yet another swath of broken twigs through a thicket it smelled moldy deep in the woods it smelled of decomposition and too much moisture and not enough sunlight boldt used the radio to softly announce that he had picked up signs to follow he advised gaynes to return to the main trail and descend slowly alert for indications of where the man may have departed from it lamoia was to stand guard at the top of the trail in case they flushed the suspect boldt moved slowly now painfully aware of the easy target he offered by carrying a lit flashlight within a few yards his trail ended at the trunk of an extremely climbable tree the bark was scarred pale where a clambering shoe had scraped it clean boldt shined the light up the tightly spaced branches considering himself too big and too clumsy for such acrobatics boldt nonetheless snapped his weapon in tightly stuffed the light into his coat pocket so that it aimed up illuminating his ascent route and began to climb he did not have to climb far fifteen feet up he got his first look at the house he could see lamoia pacing impatiently at the top of the trail steps near the guest house he climbed up higher and discovered a large heavy branch that ran nearly level and probably offered a fairly comfortable perch the flashlight revealed that here the dark tree bark was excessively shredded yellow someone had spent some time here he did not climb up onto the branch for he wanted to leave it for id who were waiting for a call while parked only a few blocks away but there seemed to him little question as to the quality of the unobstructed view this offered of adlers home office he aimed the light back down to the ground with a little voice calling to him never to look down and experienced a brief sensation of vertigo but it was as he was planning his descent through the branches that his eye caught the flash of something bright suddenly his planned route meant nothing to him he descended out of the tree as effortlessly as would a chimpanzee from above they had looked like yellow pine needles and yet unnatural and misplaced boldt counted three of themnot pine needles at all each chewed to a pulp on both endsdiscarded as the tin man had sat patiently up in this tree biding his time waiting to place his call toothpicks three of them freshly cheweddamp to the touch at one end dry on the other the radio spit static and the urgent voice of bobbie gaynes said sergeant i need you down here im about thirty yards lower than where we split up im waving my light boldt covered his own flashlight and saw the beam from hers reflected in limbs of the trees ive got you he took note of his surroundings so he could find this same spot again he contacted bernie lofgrins id crew and told them to come onto the property and to wait with lamoia at the top of the trail lamoia copied boldt contacted daphne and asked her to relay to prosecuting attorney michael striker that they needed an immediate access to the calling logs of all the area cellular phone companies if it had been caulfield in that tree and if he had made the phone call from up there then it had to be from a cellular phone if caulfield had a cell phone then he had an account if he had an account he had a mailing address striker was to contact boldt the moment he located a record of any such call the park trail was rough going at a run boldt punched through a railroad tie crashed and recovered himself but not without winning some bruises to show for it gaynes was fifteen yards off the trail into the woods in an area that seemed to boldt nearly directly beneath the observation tree as boldt approached she asked did you have dinner no well youre lucky i just left mine in a bush over there boldt did not think of gaynes as having a tender stomach he reached her he could smell the metallic bite of fresh blood in the air well before he saw the body she lowered her light onto mackensies corpse the branch that had been used to cave in his face was lying a few yards from the twisted wreck of a body and boldt thought that the man might have survived that blow had his hands not been cleaved from his arms at the wrist with something incredibly sharp but there they layat the ends of his arms looking like a pair of deerskin gloves mac mackensie knocked unconscious by that branch had bled to death his face now the color of a bedsheet a few minutes later when lamoia arrived he said to gaynes come on help me i think we should give him a hand at three in the morning boldt drove daphne down to where she had parked her car in the picnic area youre awfully quiet he said daphne nodded youre just tired he tried its late im wide awake she answered she could not think how to explain what she felt to another person she barely understood it herself as a psychologist she wanted to be strong and able to quickly overcome such painto adapt but as a woman a human being she ached not for mac mackensie but selfishly for herself then she thought that lou boldt of all people would understand five minutes either way she whispered hoarsely her voice giving her away boldt pulled the car next to her honda and left it running and it would have been you he said she nodded and she felt the choking sensation in her throat she felt the tears and she hated herself for this reaction she leaned forward and boldt put his big hand on her back and rubbed her there and it comforted her that was too damn close for me she said sobbing now and its me i care about not mac mackensiecan you believe that and you know how he went out he went out being a jerk a real goddamn prick and thats the last thing he ever wasa jerk a real jerk listen to me he continued to rub her back and when his hand reached her neck she felt the tension spill out of her and she found her selfcontrol again sorry she said whenever a copsomeone i knowgoes down my first sensation is gratitude glad it wasnt me my turn i always felt guilty about thatuntil now ive never talked about it with anyone never shared that part of me not even with liz my second thought is for the deceasedits not that i dont care but my first reaction is a huge sense of relief i dodged another onesomething along those lines i was there she said softly i heard someone in the woods first to my left then below me then later to my right i heard two people not one he was there for all i know he was coming for me when mackensie caught up to me for all i know he was right there she looked over at him then with surprise in her eyes for all i know its been him following me all along or mackensie for that matter boldt suggested no she said mackensie was just doing a job after he left me he didnt make it far he probably heard something wandered into the woods caulfield jumps up and hits a home run into the side of his face the hands were an afterthought i think maybe mackensie tried for his piece maybe he grabbed for a radio or something i think harry used the hands to buy himself timeno time to tie him up so he cuts them off something that simple the question i have to ask is what the hell kind of knife is he carrying around youre trying to say there was nothing i could have done youre trying to make it right it wasnt you who disobeyed the signs boldt pointed through the windshield to where the headlights caught the parks department sign it read for your own safety please stay on the trail daphne parked her car down the street and across from the houseboats in a space for which she paid seventyfive dollars a month it was a welllighted lot which lately made her appreciate it all the more she turned off the car locked it and made the trip to the houseboat at a brisk pace it was after threethirty in the morning and all of her neighbors were locked up and dark she reached the door unlocked and opened it and headed directly to the home security box that she found flashing its violation indicating her entry she rekeyed the device locked the front door and turned on more lights than necessary keeping her purse at her side while she made a full trip around every room checking coat closets even under the bed and confirming to herself that she now qualified fully as a paranoid she convinced herself that at this hour any sane person would head straight to bed but on this night it was not for her she considered a bath but not tonight sleep would not come for another hour or so and to try to force it would only delay it more she unbuttoned and unzipped her pants slipped off her bra without taking off her shirt washed her hands twice in a row and poured herself a glass of pine ridge she set down the wine pulled out the stool climbed up onto it and let out a long and meaningful sigh she was in the middle of a second sip when her heart fluttered she felt her eyes go wide and acting on instinct she was suddenly off the stool pants still unfastened over to her purse her shoes the alarm out the door lock it feet not fully in the shoes running shoes flapping refusing to look behind her running up the gangway past the mailboxes down the street toward her car a dog lunged from a shadow and daphne screamed at the top of her lungs and ran faster faster into the parking lot straight for the car unlock it inside relock it start the engine she pulled out of the lot spinning gravel behind her tires and fastened her seat belt on the fly ran a red light horn sounding ran another she would take a hotel room charge it to the department for that matter she would not return to her own home until it was light again she would not tell anyone if she did not find some other piece of evidence and perhapsshe allowed herself to believe now that she found herself in the safety of the vehicleperhaps she remembered wrong but the image in her mind stung her with certainty she had left the mechanical pencil pointing at a word what was the word what was it intractableshe remembered and now that same pencil was sitting alongside her papers pointing nowhere which was not how she had left it and that was wrong twentyeight boldt stood before the bathroom mirror shaving when he heard liz climb out of bed miles was still asleep as he shaved she slipped off her nightgown and pressed her warm sleepy body against him honey he said cautiously i have something for you she reached around him grabbed a hair band and put her hair back she meant business elizabeth did not let her hair down before sex but put it up instead reaching around him she unfastened his pants im going to cut myself he warned be careful she said teasing his chest in a way she knew he liked i have something for you she repeated he dropped the plastic razor into the water and it splashed into the islands of shaving cream she led him over to the counter sat up on it and wrapped her legs around him come and get it she said later she leaned her head back against the wall but refused to let him go she was sweating and her eyes looked dreamy she allowed them to separate then and her legs sank down but she did not move until boldt finished shavingand then only once she had talked him into running the shower for her drying her hair in the living room a white terrycloth robe cinched tightly around her waist and watching her son who was now awake she said to boldt they had a similar case in london which won his attention who did the london authorities a kidnapping ransom by atm machine i told you i had something for you i thought you meant no she corrected that was for me liz they paid out one hundred and eightyfive thousand pounds over a tenmonth period if your case goes on for ten months i figured we would end up divorced so it was in my best interest to get to the bottom of this he moved closer to her she smelled good from what i can tell it was incredibly similar to what youre facing the guy moved from one atm to another one town to another making withdrawals and no matter how fast the police responded he was always long gone thats us exactly boldt replied anxiously awaiting whatever else she had to tell him elizabeth could not be rushed she had her own timingin everything at one point if im right about this they had over two thousand police watching atms they still couldnt catch him but there was a reason of course the average atm transaction is only a matter of seconds its what makes it such a clever way to collect a ransom demand and they found a way around that obstacle boldt speculated seeing that sparkle in her eye yes they did a couple of brilliant computer hackers were called in they devised something they called time trapssoftware that slowed down the entire system we talked to the switching station here about doing just that slowing down the network but starting from scratch they claimed it could take months theyre right it did take months but it has already been done all these networks all these systems speak the same computer languagethey have to in order to interface in order for you to make a withdrawal from an atm in paris on your seattle account so it seems to me that whatever timetrap software they came up with should be easily adapted for use here if not right up in redmond we have some of the brainiest software wizards in the world they should be able to port it for you time traps boldt repeated you slow down the system and buy yourself time to catch this guy another thing that occurred to me she asked rhetorically are you aware that some atms can be instructed to eat atm cards they use it to pull the counterfeit cards and bad accounts off the market we thought about that too but we want him to have the card that card is how we catch him but these time traps go she said anticipating his apology before he ever spoke it you sure its my idea go he grabbed his weapon and his badge wallet and literally ran to the back door the last thing he heard from her was and catch the bastard we could use a little peace around here boldt exchanged a dozen phone calls with his wife each bringing him more encouragement at twelve noon pacific timeevening in londonin an amazing show of technology the timetrap software was beamed by telephone company satellites via computer modem and downloaded by technicians at ted perchs netlinq atm switching station the entire transfer took twentytwo minutes with an open phone line to london netlinq technicians worked furiously to install the software which crashed the first time online freezing twelve hundred cash machines for over fifteen minutes at pm july perch authorized the activation of the software networkwide for a second time and for seventeen minutes it held the second crash involved a cluster of first interstate machines which was later deemed something of a success by five oclock sharp with percent of netlinqs directly controlled atms timetrap operational the first effort was made to place a sixsecond drag in the transaction time these intervals of delay were quickly tagged wotsfor window of time the sixsecond wots were placed between the customer entry of the pin number and the appearance of the first transaction menu remarkably the system held for cash machine customers a brief but effective test pause had been created in their transaction virtually unnoticed by any of them but sending up a cheer at netlinq that was heard all the way to london through a series of conversations boldt encouraged perch to increase the number of machines that were timetrapped but perch was reluctant to risk a third crash in a single evening i would like to be working here tomorrow he teased boldt but boldt hounded him by another commercial banks network had been added to the core group leaving percent of all atms in washington state and western oregon under the direct control of timetrap software boldt spent the early evening at netlinq monitoring the effectiveness of the new software and congratulating the crew for their efforts the ransom account had never been hit before eight oclock in the evening leading boldt and others to suspect caulfield might be holding down a day jobalthough ted perch pointed out that late evening made sense for such hits many banks restocked their cash machines at the close of business if an extortionist wished to avoid being seen by bank employees then at the very least he or she would wait until after the close of businessas late as pm at some branches the netlinq operations room was an impressive collection of high technology and reminded boldt of what he had seen of telephone command centers it was nearly pitchblack the focus of the room being three enormous flatscreen color monitors that visually mapped all atm traffic in the netlinq region the floor descended toward these screens in three tiers each housing rows of computers some of which were attended the far righthand screen showed all those atm locations under timetrap control after pestering from boldt perch reluctantly added another sixsecond wot this time between account authorization and delivery of cash netlinqs public information office had earlier distributed a press release announcing that due to system maintenance some inconveniences were to be expected the eleven oclock news had promised to run it for the sixth consecutive night an atm hit occurred shortly after pm its getting like clockwork perch said pointing out the flashing dot on the overhead screen clockwork was what boldt hoped forthe more predictable and repetitious the withdrawals were the increased chance of apprehending a suspect perch announced five seconds and counting boldt relayed news of the hit directly to spd dispatch location is nsixteen repeat enonesix ten seconds perch tracked he checked a computer screen this one is not under timetrap control he warned boldt could imagine one of his plainclothes detectives throwing a car in gear and speeding toward the location but with less than five seconds to close the gap he did not see much hope he needed more people he needed more of the machines timetrapped transaction complete perch announced dejected lieutenant boldt barked hopefully into the telephone receiver shoswitz said surveillance is four blocks and closing boldt felt tempted to cross his fingers he envisioned the unmarked car running traffic lights and braking loudly to a stop to perch boldt said we need better communication with the field tell me about it perch replied frustrated and upset shoswitz said through the phone nothing repeat no visual contact boldt relayed this to perch who cursed so loudly that he raised the attention of several of the netlinq employees an hour later there was a second hit though this time on a machine not under software control surveillance failed to close within twelve blocks we need more of the machines on the software boldt complained dont tell me my business sergeant we cant make any more headway until morning we have two lags in usage ninethirty to eleven am and two to five pm thats as soon as we can hope to put more machines online we need them tonight the system will crash and if it crashes while this person is online then it could look intentional is that what you want he asked heatedly reluctantly boldt sat back and watched a third and final hit take place and for a third and final time that night surveillance was nowhere close at a few minutes before midnight he was summoned to the hotel room where dr richard clements was staying boldt arrived depressed and exhausted shoswitz and daphne reached the alexis before boldt and all were awaiting him when he arrived the suite was spacious with paper japanese sliding doors separating the bedroom from a sitting room that included a large glass conference table two couches a coffee table several freestanding lamps a fireplace and a wet bar the decor was granite glass and steelultramodernwhich was not to boldts tastes and yet here he found it to his liking cnn was muted on the television in the cornermichael kinsley with his coat off interviewing an authorand clements kept the remote within reach clements was dressed casually in linen pants and an italiandesigned white egyptian cotton shirt with black loafers and no socks he was drinking what looked like brandy out of a snifter the size of a fishbowl and he carried a wad of chew neatly in his upper lip leaving a bulge there as though he were trying to stop a nosebleed he wore halfglasses tortoiseshell imitation that rode on the bridge of his nose precariously he sat at the glass conference table in a black leatherandstainless steel captains chair waving a twohundreddollar mechanical pencil in the air and punctuating his authoritative instructions you sit there and you there nothere please he advised shoswitz yes thank you the armagnac is excellent and seemingly endless and comes highly recommended whatever your pleasure he looked them over daphne and boldt declined shoswitz requested a miller lite an order that so disgusted clements he referred him to the wet bars refrigerator advising him to use whatevers there dr richard clements began with a selfpossessed arrogance that immediately offended all present before we get into twenty questions let me head off whatever possible by offering you my updated profile he rolled the liqueur around in his mouth and boldt had to wonder what a mixture of armagnac and chew tasted like when spilled across ones tongue its interesting behavior will always tell you more than a rap sheet i am referring of course to the incident in mr adlers woods and the telephone call that immediately preceded it its late so ill try not to bore you you are all aware of the stalking phase that a serial killer or rapist enters into prior to the attack any of a number of specific incidents may precede the stalking phase including arson the killing of house pets voyeurism and masturbation but the stalking phase is unique in that it directly precedes the offense we see it in the wilda cat even some packs will stalk prior to the kill even if the intended prey is wounded or incapacitated still the stalk what our mr caulfield is doing is getting up close and personal with his intended prey mr adler the fact that he has entered this phase is warning sign enough it is drawing to a close we are in the last act the stalking phase can go on for days weeks even months or years and we are still at odds to know exactly what precipitates the craving for completion of the act boredom rage sexuality so different in every case he swilled more of the snifters contents and inhaled apparently enormously satisfied with the results his audience was too stunned to interrupt and so we know that he has begun this final coda before the finale he waved the pencil in time to music within his head and boldt could see his lips close as he hummed silently along with it but unfortunately we do not know the length of the piece point number one he said strongly adleror someone in that house he conditioned is the target of his intentions he excused himself to the bathroom and apparently leaving an interior door open urinated loudly enough that all could hear shoswitz said in a forced whisper is the airconditioning on or is it just him daphne noticeably upset reminded in an equally soft reply like it or not hes one of the best there is boldt added and he knows it point number two clements began anew when he returned he is distracted by his own greed he is withdrawing two or three thousand a day he finds himself addicted to this easy money he has a good thing going so why not prolong it all of that sounds so logical does it not well its bullshit plain and simple what we have is a theoretical conflict that i must admit weighs heavily upon me on the one side he has clearly entered the stalking phase this includes a verbal threat to adler over the phone and a use of language a reference to certain personally historical issues that confirms a deeply profound sense of injustice on the other side he is running around milking atms if this were a game show the buzzer would have sounded wrong answer so which is the real mr harold caulfield and to what extent can we predict his schizophrenia so apparent in these conflicting personalities within him will the real harry caulfield please stand up revengemotivated killer or greeddriven extortionist he had lost the chew while in the bathroom for the lump below his nose was gone and he inflated his cheeks and lips using the cognac like mouthwash point number three theres method to this madness it appears increasingly obvious that a grievous wrong was done to person or persons with whom mr caulfield had strong emotional ties and upon whom he was otherwise financially and emotionally dependent he appears to have a personal agenda to which he is committed and i must say from past experience that we should prepare ourselves for the unexpected nothing that we can imagine for mr caulfield is out of the question kill a hundred why not a thousand same answer caulfield believes he is justified in this and that makes him especially dangerous drive a truck full of explosives into a barracks of marines why not blow up the world trade center same answer he reached for the phone and ordered another without asking the lieutenant he also ordered a miller lite though he pronounced it as if it were a disease he met eyes with each of them individually and said patronizingly okay time for twenty questions stunning them all shoswitz said twenty minutes ago when captain rankin heard of mackensies murder he ordered us to pull all adler products from the shelves by six am or the start of business tomorrow boldt felt the wind knocked out of him is this that bulldog i met the one with the cheap suit and buzz cut clements asked boldt said captain of homicide if you are asking for a prediction of the effects on our mr caulfield of such a decision i can tell you this he wont like it pulling the adler products will signal caulfield that he has lost control of thisand control after all is what is and has been getting him high the man closed his eyes and his eyelids fluttered oddly and he said softly imagine the power he must feel dictating demands to a man of position like owen adler poisoning people with the medical community seemingly powerless to stop him withdrawing cash like its christmas that carries an awesome sense of power and control he opened his eyes stood and answered the doorbefore even boldt with his keen sense of hearing heard any approachand greeted the room service boy perfunctorily a moment later he sat back down and began sloshing the liquor around his new fishbowl the loss of control or even the perception of such a loss will accelerate his timetable he was unpredictable before he is even less predictable now i will chatup your captain rankin boldt decided to reveal what he had mentioned to no one he glanced at daphne then met eyes with clements and said owen adler will pull all the product if given half an excuse he lobbied me to do just that and i dissuaded him daphne looked horrified that she had not heard of this if he gets wind of rankins request hell bypass any of our concerns and get out he wants out he is staying with the game plan only because he fears making the wrong decision himself and i convinced him that to go against the demands was the wrong decision by get out i presume this to mean pull the product not conform with the ultimate demand and commit suicide thats right boldt agreed the killings have weakened him he feels directly responsible which is exactly as our mr caulfield intends interesting what im hearing shoswitz said is that if rankin bypasses us and gets to adler were going to lose this anyway clements said i have little doubt that the intelligent thing to do is to keep as many adler products on the shelf as possible we would also like to keep the news media at bay for as long as possible though we may have lost that battle the point beingas i think sergeant boldt will concurwith these atm withdrawals we have our first real chance to trap our mr caulfield and we are making some progress there i think boldt interjected he told them about the limited success of the timetrap software so i suggest we advise your public information department to issue a series of nocomments and that we staple down the tongues of anyone associated with this investigation if there are no sources there is no story it is that simple this should include our friends at state health this infectious diseases lab he said to boldt and turning to shoswitz and anyone within your division who may be privy to this he sipped the drink i will work a little while longer here and by morning i will hopefully be armed with enough of a profile to convince our captain rankin of his ineptitude and the certainty of his own fall from grace should his orders be carried out seeing you work as a unit i believe in youin all of youand i must confess to you now that my secondary role in coming here was to act as a kind of spy if you will in assessing your abilities to handle this investigation i hope you will be pleased to know that my initial report and subsequent followups have been glowing and they will continue to be but i should warn you that there are those looking over your shoulders and they will pounce if given half a chance clements sipped more of the cognac what about special agents boldt asked spotting an opportunity he addressed shoswitz what if we requested the bureaus assistance with the atm surveillance fifty or even a hundred special agents to place in the field equal partners with us drawing on what is admittedly a formidable expertise in ransom situations this allows them in on perhaps the most critical aspect of the investigation as it now stands perhaps defusing any later attempts to take over the investigation completely and at the same time seems to satisfy a great need of our own namely a shortage of field personnel shoswitz considered this boldt said i dont mean to put you on the spot no its not that shoswitz allowed perhaps something to give some consideration to clements said genially no hurry sleep on it boldt sensed immediately that clements approved of the suggestion and that it might help his own position in walking a line between the two agencies i like it shoswitz admitted my only real concern he directed to clements is that if we let them in a little do we give it up completely somewhere down the road this is our town our citizens our investigation we have our own political concerns the bureau has two faces one is cooperation one is complete control surrendering control of this investigation would not go over well and is not what we want i understand it is one reason i like sergeant boldts suggestion working as equals on the surveillanceand im sure that can be arranged might indeed fend off any he searched for his wordshostile takeover he added i can explore such a relationship if you like shoswitz thought a long time checking with boldt repeatedly by firing off hot glances in his direction if we catch him at an atm we all win shoswitz said it was his way of giving his approval on their way down in the elevator together daphne and boldt agreed to meet on her houseboat for a recap it was not very far out of the way for boldt and he wondered if she wanted someone to escort her inside and make sure the place was empty and so he agreed at onethirty in the morning she made a pot of herbal tea and poured them each a mugful she began in a tone of voice that placed boldt on attention i completed my affidavit striker obtained a warrant and we made an inquiry with norwest national to obtain the checking records for new leaf foods norwest national was lizs bank renamed after a string of acquisitions and this was certainly not lost on daphne he thought i want to see what checks were being written on and around the date of the altering of that state health report because i firmly believe someone was paid off and maybe theres a paper trail i have no objection to that but my focus remains on caulfield its not that she interrupted him the bank told me that they had already cooperated with us had already turned over that information to us with no warrants involved they complained at having to do so again not me boldt admitted obviously not me she agreed danielson boldt said guessing how is it that caulfield manages to always be where our atm surveillance teams are not danielson is in bed with him do i believe it no can i rule it out also no providing hes not criminal what would motivate chris money boldt nodded an offer from the tabloids tv a book deal a movie dealthere are a lot of temptations out there for a cop these days different than when i was coming up chris sell out hes the departments number one overachiever boldt hesitated before dropping his bomb feeding daphnes earlier suspicions what if taplin was paying him for inside information what if taplin had promised him fowlers job if danielson could settle this affair without the publicity certain to surround a police arrest which one of us is the psychologist she asked nervously do you like it i can see it if thats what youre asking yes its possible it explains a hell of a lot of whats been going on and it fits with taplins defensive position taplins name is in and around all of the communication on the new leaf contamination you want to look for someone with a lot to lose if caulfield blew the whistle on state health howard taplin tops the list we need caulfield for more than these murders she suggested we need caulfield period boldt said twentynine i read about the two boys you killed and your friends with guns should not wander the woods you just wont listen will you i meant what i told youyou will pay sooner than later and more will die until you do many more two newspaper articles were included at the bottom of the faxone about the boys and one the mysterious murder in golden gardens park technical services informed boldt that the articles had been scanned into a computer and pasted into the fax which had been transmitted electronically from a pay phone on a side street near the kingdome this was all supposed to mean something to boldt but it did not his entire interest lay with the words at the top of this page and the implication that clements was right harry caulfield was running out of patience time was almost up like water seeking its own level boldt sought out the evidence calling bernie lofgrin and complaining to him about the delay in the fbi report on the longview farms evidence lofgrin suggested he lodge the complaint with clements boldt did so and clements promised to do what he could for his part clements believed he had convinced captain rankin to rescind the adler recall that he had threatened though the psychiatrist admitted to boldt that rankin was a difficult bastard to read there was a lot of talk and little action public information called repeatedly frustrated by a press corps that sensed a much bigger story than two boys dying in a tree house boldt issued a string of denials and nocomments but could see the inevitable coming the story was going to break and when it did there would be a recall according to clements if anything was certain to push caulfield into following through on his threat of mass murder it was this combination of events many more boldt could not get the words out of his head again he waited for his phone to ring with the news of more murders again his mood went sour and his squad steered clear of him again his appetite deserted him his bowels bled and the maalox did nothing more than make his breath smell like lemon creme he did a quick turnaround at the dinner hourrefusing food but swallowing down a zantacand prepared to join ted perch at netlinq where tonight for the first time lucille guillards monitoring of the pacwest atm network had been brought on board the timetrap software had been expanded to cover percent of the netlinq system liz was ironing a pleated skirt for the following morning i owe you a champagne dinner for that software he told her make it in rome and you have a deal rome it is she laughed in the corner by the dryer was piled a gigantic stack of clean laundry that was his responsibility to iron and he looked away from it because it made him feel guilty to see so much of it in his exhausted state it seemed to him a physical manifestation representing his total failure as a father and husband if you leave what do i tell poor michael striker what about striker his shirt tucked in he leaned for a kiss he called when you were in the bathroom said he was coming by he was checking to see that you were here and i told him you were she tugged at the skirt and said down to the ironing board my guess is that it has nothing whatsoever to do with work he feels a lot closer to you than you do to him she looked up at him thats true of a lot of your friends you know he knew her well enough to know when she was concealing something from him liz she said calmly i thought that he probably wanted to talk to you about whichever detective of yours is screwing elaine what boldt bumped the ironing board and the spray bottle fell to the floor miles who should have been in bed two hours earlier began pounding the floor with a spatula up until that moment his father had not realized the boy was on the other side of the inverted laundry basket although it helped to explain lizs constant distraction boldt realized this discovery that he had overlooked his sons presence for the last five minutes hit him hard boldt asked liz are you sure about this knowing that she had to be liz was not a gossip im sure hes coming over she added and its kind of an odd time to talk shop are you telling me you really hadnt heard anything do you know who it is no only that hes fifth floor and that hes on your squad they met when whoever it is came knocking on the front door one saturday afternoon looking for michaels approval for a warrantsomething like that only michael was on the back nine and elaine was feeling pretty mad at him for spending his weekend with a golf club and maybe she was feeling a little bit creamy as well and anyway she jumped your boys bones the way suzie tells it makes elaine sound like she knows how to pick them evidently your boy is a rocket in the sack and it didnt end with the back nine eitherjust in case he asks its a nearregular thing now lamoia she laughed thats exactly who i guessed she admitted great minds boldt had often accused liz of having the hots for lamoia though it had always been teasing suzie doesnt know who the mystery man is only that its incredibly hot sex and that elaine claims to be in one of those selfdiscovery phases liz had had her selfdiscovery a few years earlier though they never discussed it anymore jesus razor will kill the guy if he finds out talk about having a short fuse laws of nature love survival of the fittest and all that we have no place in this cant you talk to elaine me i hardly know elaine and besides suzie promised she wouldnt tell a soul so id just be getting her in trouble if michael says anything about it to you you had better look surprised buster i am surprised laws of nature i cant hang around for him boldt complained oh no you dont youre not sticking me with him she suggested why dont you put himself to bed hes up late as it is boldt spent the next twenty minutes with his son he changed the boys diapersknowing they neared the day when they could do withoutgave him a quick sponge bath with a warm hand towel and had another of those limitedvocabulary conversations with him that amounted to listing quite a few nouns and the occasional verb wa meant both water and wash bunky meant bunny and mama meant that it eventually required liz alongside to coax him to give sleep a try they returned to the laundry room where liz was still ironing the same skirt clearly sensing a comment coming she said im not very good with pleats and when boldt offered to give it a try she kissed him on the cheek and started folding what was just coming out of the dryer as he ironed watching her fold the clothes he wondered if she felt envious of an elaine striker with her young lover the fawning and attention and the hotblooded romance he felt tempted to ask but decided against it there were some things a husband should not know they hadnt talked about her pregnancy in days so he asked her about it but she immediately changed subjects mentioning something about a yoga class she wanted to attend and he was reminded of his wifes superstition about pregnancy in the first trimester striker pulled up out front just as boldt held the freshly ironed skirt at his waist and asked what do you think youd look better in something brown and below the knee liz fired back deadpan strikers steel claw clicked like a telegraph key and he circled the small front porch like a dog searching for a spot to lie down awfully late for you boldt observed trying to initiate some kind of dialogue watching a colleague bounce off the railing of his front porch was not great sport he glanced at his watch impatient to get downtown an air force of small black bugs convened around the porch light striker explained i didnt want you to think that i had let you down on this cellular phone thing all three companies searched their calling logs for a call placed to adlers home number and all came up blank since were pretty confident about how this went downcaulfield making the call while up in that treei pushed hard for some results and two of the companies actually tried the search for a second time but they still came up dry about an hour ago i talked to a supervisor in data control and she said their lack of record could be explained technically but i didnt ask he burned us boldt summarized it looks like that yes striker stared his eyes dead and distant his prosthesis chattering like cold teeth boldt asked so you heading downtown strikers face contorted into an unforgiving knot razor better than going home striker said problems boldt asked as innocently as possible shes never where she says she is lou and shes smelling a little too good these days when she leaves the house shes a little too happy you know and worse her friends are doing a shitty job of covering for her its like everyone knows the secret but me but eventually you figure it out striker met eyes with boldt who saw the anger and hurt in his friends expression and offered what he hoped was good advice forgive her razor in the long run its the only thing that works he said youve been there right right boldt confirmed i feel for you buddyi want you to know that but at the same time this stuff happens to all of us and sometimes what we think is happening isnt happening at all its pretty easy to allow your emotions to give false reports shes definitely screwing someone he said bluntly giving in to the anger chewing his upper lip eyes downcast he repeated shes screwing someoneand in our bedin my bed if you can believe that shit he turned away and i dont know what the hell to do about it have you confronted her striker looked over with tears in his eyes he was pale and his nostrils flared as he spoke ill knock her head off razor you want to think before you do anything on second thought maybe its better you dont confront her he said backtracking maybe its better if you do some counseling together work this thing out with a professional hell im no professional in my own fucking bed no pun intended maybe its not like that boldt tested he wondered if liz was right about the lover being one of boldts detectives he hoped not he also hoped that striker didnt know anything about who it was did not have a name because where striker might restrain himself from hitting his own wife he would go after her lover with a vengeance boldt had no doubt about that listen i need you on this investigation boldt said honestly selfishly you want to watch yourself you want to talk about watching striker asked following his own skewed logic i can picture her you know in the act with him enjoying it getting off she used to really get off you know not so much anymorepretty bored really i bet she gets off with him he grew paler his eyes fixed on a stationary object and his lower lip trembled boldt could hear the bugs striking the glass bulb around the light down the street someone had their television too loud he felt it weird to have this discussion with a laugh track running faintly in the background striker snapped his head toward boldt so hard that his neck cracked loudly what the hell did you do when you found out liz you know boldt closed his front door and led striker down the steps and they stood in the small front yard with insects swirling overhead and the sound of that laugh track even louder he did not know how but somehow people had found out about lizs affair with a coworker to boldt it was ancient history now he didnt even think of it as having to do with her it was something that had gone wrong with themlike a disease they had shared as far as he knew only liz was aware of his onenight adventure with daphne but lizs distraction had gone on for several months he said what i would do if i were you is start with myself with you because when a relationship goes south its both of you its neverevera oneway street cliches he said furious i show you my dirty laundry and you hand me a bunch of cliches id start with myself is all boldt repeated me i work too hard i know that so what i break the little promises okay im home late i work weekends or i hit the links im selfish with my time i know that im away from the house too muchi know that but not the big promises okay am i getting laid on the sly he asked hoarsely im not like that damn it shes not like that maybe it just happened mike maybe its one of those things that just happened i think you start by keeping your head and opening a dialogue i think you go into that dialogue well aware that you are half the problem and you use a counselor i am not seeing a shrink a counselor as a refereea gobetween a therapist a shortstop however you want to think about it i dont want to think about it i want to catch the guycatch them both in the act i want to prove this one way or the other but i dont have a clue how to go about it you on the other hand boldt saw the trap he was being led into you dont want to do that razor thats a bad idea whose side are you on you want to catch her in the act boldt repeated so the man could hear his own words so he could face the reality of it when just before in the middle when think about it shut up he was thinking about it and boldt thought that was good because a guy with strikers temper had to be discouraged from this at all costs is it for you or her that you want to catch her in the act strikers one good arm was incredibly powerful and when he shoved boldt with it the big man tripped on a lawn sprinkler and went down hard you see boldt asked sitting on the damp grass you want those kinds of images permanently living inside you worming around inside you do you because ill tell you something they eat their way right back out eventually those kinds of things will kill the relationship forever you cant erase that stuff its a big mistake if youre smart youll stay as far away from that as possible what you want to do is talk to listen you want to sit her down and talk and youve got to accept what she saysno matter what she says he added no matter what because she may be a little hateful right now feeling guilty and thats where therapy comes inbecause a therapist wont let you play games with each other shell call your number boldt came to his feet striker appeared lost you with me buddy striker did not answer for a long time what do you care you got things straightened out razor i do care i care a lot the attorney hurried to his car boldt ran after him mikey fuck you he climbed inside the car mike listen but the man drove away boldt chased the car on foot calling after him but pulled up short when he saw it was a lost cause his sons threewheeler was crashed into an azalea bush he fished it out and carried it around back and left it with the other stuff he could not believe the mountain of toys this kid had he saw liz through the kitchen window holding miles the boy had not stayed down she was watching him with a worried expression he shrugged she shrugged right back ive got to get going he reminded her when he reached the kitchen she opened her arm and the three of them hugged miles touched his fathers face and nearly poked him in the eye im sorry you have to go through this stuff she said there are always a couple of blowouts on a case like this always happens so long as it isnt you she said holding to him tightly were lucky she added she did not try to look into his eyes what do you think about him i wouldnt want to be on the receiving end of that this could make trouble for you couldnt it she asked its all right he answered but she knew him better than that dada miles reached out for his father gofowak he slurred boldt stood him on his right shoe and the boy clung to his thick leg as if it were a tree trunk go for a walk boldt announced his son stared up happily into his eyes with unrequited love and boldt began walking him slowly around the kitchen his son squealing with joy dont get him too worked up liz reminded well aware that with boldt leaving she would have to face the terror of miles on a roll boldt wanted this and only this to be in his kitchen on a summer night with these two people to hear squeals of joy coming from his son to be free of the tin man and michael striker and adlers ninethousandsquarefoot estate to play along with a scott hamilton cut when no one was listening a few minutes later he walked out to his car climbed inside and drove off as he passed the house down the street and the sound grew louder it seemed quite obvious that the laugh track was laughing at him thirty but did it help liz asked from across the breakfast table the timetrap software had failed to make a difference the night before boldt said positively we got closer than weve been only a couple blocks away by the time the transaction ended he did not like bringing his work home like this to where liz had an active interest in a case but he owed her whatever she wanted to hear im told theres a pretty good chance the bureau will partner up with us which would mean more people and better gear if that happens i think we stand a chance the phone rang liz did not move boldt recognized the smooth french accent as belonging to lucille guillard sergeant boldt i have something in my hands i believe you would very much like to see you will please come to my office boldt was in the car fifteen minutes later he hit horrible traffic costing him another thirty to reach downtown he had to sign in with a receptionist and wear a badge marked visitor which was new since the last time guillard wore a navyblue suit with gold buttons and a blouse with a french collar and white silk embroidery on the cuffs that looked like waves her hair was straightened and pulled back into a topknot elongating her face and enhancing her eyes she wore pale red lipstick that contrasted with her black skin and her white teeth she offered him coffee he asked for tea with three aspirin funny way to drink your tea she said she called in a male assistant and placed their orders with him and she went looking for aspirin a few minutes later when all had been delivered she shut her door and they were alone the blinds were open and the view from the pacwest bank tower included the westlake center with a thousand shoppers swarming in and out of it like bees on the hive the seattle sun poured over them like golden honey a street juggler tossing pins into the air caught boldts attention from this distance the pins looked like matchsticks she slipped something out of a folder leaned forward across her desk and declared here is your extortionist the eightbyten blackandwhite photograph that she handed boldt was a grainy slightly blurred image that at first glance looked like an astronaut wearing a black space suit he donned his reading glasses reducing some of the blurriness guillard explained this was recorded on stopframe videotape during last nights nine pm withdrawal i did not know of it then or i should have mentioned it the camera you see was installed just this last weekend the photograph was shot through a starshaped form of spread fingers in the foreground and behind it a reflective surfacea motorcycle helmet he realizedand the high padded shoulders of a bikers black leather jacket no face no identifying features his heart sank out of politeness he studied the photo for a long minute and then put his glasses away this person wore gloves she pointed out tried to cover the plastic in case there was a camera guillard explained but you can see this was done a fraction too late some of our cameras are triggered by card access others by motion detectors i am guessing that this was a motion detector out came the glasses again as he drew the photograph close to his face the gloved hand had triggered the autofocus of the lens which helped to explain why all else behind it was fuzzy very few people could get away with wearing gloves in summer without attracting attention or at the very least being remembered a biker was the one exception the helmet hid the face effectively it confirmed his chase in the u districtthey were quite possibly after a woman wearing a helmet are you certain you have the right photograph he asked she showed him the entire threephoto series by the time the second shot had been taken by the hidden camera there was nothing to be seen the gloved hand having effectively screened the shot entirely but at the bottom of the frame where it showed the date and time and listed the atms reference location id there was now also a card number identified and it did indeed match the card belonging to the dummy account the third photograph was nearly identical to the second except for the time stamp which had progressed by several seconds i know its not much she apologized more than you might think he said trying to make the best out of precious little so its good its very good she seemed hesitant as she asked timidly may i express something that concerns me by all means it is the camerastheir location as i said this camera just came online in the last few days because of this it has yet to appear on any list here at the bank you understand no lists none and before this this person has not once made a withdrawal from any atm that has a security camera in place not one you understand such coincidence is not possible i am sorrynot possible and that means this person has a copy of our most recent atm security list those with surveillance security are indicated on this list understanding this boldt felt the first sinking sensation in a string of many would harry caulfield have access to such information definitely not but chris danielson howard taplin kenny fowler all had access to the information who has copies of this list yes i wrote these down i thought of this also perhaps a dozen of us here at pacwest i have written down their names for you all top executives no one below executive vice president also i should think that the companies that performed the installations would of course have record pacwest employees working at the particular branches during installation would knowbut only about that specific branch ted perch at netlinq would have a much more comprehensive list i would think encompassing all the atms in the entire northwest region anyone boldt realized in or out of the bank it means something she said do you think this is significant i feel it means something boldt agreed once again suspicion fell onto those around him he called fowler and insisted they talk at lunchtime boldt met kenny fowler in the pikes place market amid the bustle of swarming tourists searching out save the whales tshirts asparagus and fresh salmon the two men walked slowly atop pavers engraved with names of contributors whose donations had helped restore the openair market the tourists wore micro athletic shorts neon rubber sandals showing lots of long leg and filling the air with the distinctive smell of optimism suntan lotion there were big bellies and bigger chests and kodaks and nylon web leashes on the children under six there was real money and plastic and unwieldy icecream cones and the smell of fish that looks pretty awful boldt said noticing the blister on the end of fowlers index finger that he kept pushing as if he might pop it thats what i get for smoking a roach with the lights off fowler teased amused by his own joke fowler walked farther on before he told him my people drew a blank on danielson no big cash purchases no real money problems pays his taxes pays his bills maybe a little short on social activities ive got some of the paperwork for you in the car what about surveillance he works out at the body shop every day rain or shinenot the soap store the gym boldt knew the place spd was given special discounts there he lost my guys a couple of timeswhich is not easy to do i might addbut both times they reported it as their fault not some maneuver by danielson to avoid them middle of the day both times any private life about the worst thing weve got on your boy is that hes a palm greaser calls the numbers and likes to hear it real dirty likes to hear them describe things in detail frankly i think hes oversexed background bright kid good middleclass family father is an aerospace engineer his mother is middle management at nordstrom brother died as an innocent bystander in a gasstation holdup which is supposed to explain his being a cop supposed to you know him better than i do the guy is driven kay hes not doing this for some dead bro hes doing this for chris danielson he wants a suit and a secretary and a gold badge not nickel money he wouldnt take a kick if thats what you mean do you think i dont too ambitious hes not going to risk that desk and secretary for a few lousy bucks hes dirty kenny i dont know how but hes dirty not from what ive found he isnt you were smart not to go to ia with thiswoulda made you look bad they stopped in front of a fruit stand where the produce was stacked perfectly flawless and in beautiful groups of rich colors fowler bought an apple with a fivedollar bill so they had to wait for change when they were walking again wedged in a claustrophobic stream of loudly talking tourists fowler reminded mr atm burned us again last night go figure fowler was as competitive as the next guy boldt elected not to share any of his meeting with guillard an uncomfortable silence resulted you missed macs service fowler criticized did i boldt had not realized this lisa wanted it over with shes lucky there werent no kids boldt waited several steps and asked was mac on patrol that night or was he following matthews fowler missed a step though he covered it well by pretending he had stepped in something a person goes asking a question like that youd think its you running into posts in the dark not matthews is that your answer the way i see my job in all of this my primary responsibilitykay is looking out for number one which in this case is adler we watch him pretty much round the clock lou he dont like it so we dont tell him mac had the woods that night bad draw he was in the woods on patrol boldt clarified you got it and danielsons clean boldt repeated skeptically i can hear it in your voice you dont believe me kay so whyd you ask me to do this for you if youre not going to believe me anyway youre pissing me off here lou what im not busy enough without your laundry trouble with you lou he asked rhetorically you want everything nice and clean square pegs in the square holes but it aint like that pal he was building a head of steam a vein rose in his forehead order out of chaos all that shit i remember you they dodged around a street musician boldt threw a quarter in the guitar case seeing this fowler put a dollar in and took out fifty cents in change you want danielson dirty because it fits some preconceived notion of yours you want taplin too judging from our last conversation for all the looks you give her maybe you want your face in matthewss pussy boldt stopped cold how the hell do i know but it aint that way lou the square peg never fits danielsons not dirty and its adler riding matthews not you theres no fucking order to it lou its randomit has always been random no fucking way to make things fit that is your problem youve got a foul mouth kenny and a dirty mind fowler added but danielson is still clean no hes not pal you just dont like being wrong and you knew your guys screwed this up somewhere boldt turned and walked away fowler had drilled too close to the nerve he counted to ten and then he counted to ten again he wanted a drink he wanted some food he wanted to go back and pop fowler in the face or maybe he wanted fowler to pop him he wanted some order where none existed he walked for three hours before returning to his car and he had blisters in the morning thirtyone friday morning dr richard clements left voice mail for boldt informing him that the seattle field office of the fbi had been in touch with the hoover building and that the bureau was sending boldt seventyfive special agents and providing a digital tracking and communications package a man named meisner wanted to speak via a conference call with boldt and shoswitz about logistics slater lowry had been dead three weeks boldt jotted down some notes to himself while riding the elevator to the second floor his feet hurt too much to take the stairs another piece of voice mail had been from bernie lofgrin he entered the lab and signaled its director from across the room lofgrin carefully removed a pair of goggles and caught up with the sergeant in his office the goggles left a dark red line in the shape of a kidney bean encircling his eyes and bridging his nose his thinning gray hair was a mess much of it sticking straight up he patted it down but it jumped right up again charged with static electricity he looked like a cockatoo the office had been tidied though it could not be considered neat boldt took a chair clements must have leaned on the bureau lofgrin said as he closed the door for privacy at seven oclock this morning our fax machine started humming when the feds issue reports they dont mess around with all this paperwork he said indicating an impressive stack of faxes on the desk its no wonder it takes them a month of sundays to get back to us lofgrin settled into his seat and switched on the tape of scott hamilton at radio city that boldt had copied for him the sergeant felt impatient knowing full well that all indications pointed to a bernie lofgrin lecture lofgrin cleaned his cokebottle eyeglasses carefully rubbing them with a special soft cloth and returned them to his face he leaned forward do you know what we call the volatilizing chamber on our gas chromatography the process of gas chromatography involved burningvolatilizinga sample and analyzing the gases emitted in order to determine the organic and chemical compounds that comprised it boldt shook his head lofgrins jokes were famous for falling flat the ashhole lofgrin loved it he bubbled with pleasure boldt felt obliged to twist a smile onto his lips but found it impossible to maintain it foremost on his mind was caulfields threatas yet that dreaded call had still not come in the ashhole uses helium injection and weighs in at nearly twice the temp of your standard arson lofgrin explained boldt had heard most of this before he did not care about method he wanted results thirtyfive hun and up we reburn elements in the ash that werent torched the first time around and the gases allow us to identify all but the inert compounds seeing boldts lack of interest lofgrin said okayim lecturing again sue me caulfield had several boxes under his workbench weve identified them as cardboard you and i discussed that we had some supportive evidence that three of these boxes may have contained paper productslabels leaflets who knows the cardboard in those boxes is apparently from the same manufacturera set if you will produced by everest forest products up to anacortes everest has clients all over the statebut i have a list he said digging into the pile and handing boldt a fax it was several pages long and listed over two hundred clients about seventy of those clients have their company logo printed on the boxes before final shipment seventeen of those seventy have zip codes here in the city he grinned and teased and i bet you thought you were the only one who loves detective work boldt asked anxiously and do we know if the boxes at longview farms were printed or not we do not know anything conclusively were talking about the examination of ash lou our tests suggest that these boxes were the unprinted generic variety and that means they could have been supplied to any one of the other one hundred and thirty everest clients boldts hopes waffled the fbi techs have turned up a mixed bag in all three boxes we show pulp fiber inconsistent with the production of the cardboard meaning there is a high probability that all three contained paper products reading another of the bureaus faxes lofgrin said in one of the boxes we find the presence of bleach and heavy metals consistent with some commercial inkscommercial printing techniques in the other two we show trace quantities of organics that suggest but do not confirm what we usually see in herbal inks adler uses herbal inks boldt reminded yes that had occurred to me lofgrin did not like being interrupted sorry boldt apologized when lofgrins enlarged eyes blinked boldt felt as if the man were waving at him lofgrin said knowing that adler uses herbal inks on his labels we asked for a comparison and youll be pleased to know that the ink found in these two boxes at longview is consistent with that used on adler labels we cannot differentiate between say a chicken soup label and a hash label but we can say with some degree of certainty that the labels in those two boxes could have been adler foods labels what is of interest to us he continued is that the contents of this other boxthe one with the heavy metal contenthave nothing whatsoever to do with the labels of adler foods products did i mention that because of a nice stratification the bureau lab was able to approximate paper size no well i told you how when we exposed the contents of these boxes to oxygen they basically disintegrated the bureau boys have a vacuum chamber large enough for something like this and they were able to pull accurate measurements for us and those measurements also support the assumption that two of the boxes were adler labels and one not so basically of the three boxes with paper products two conform to what we see in adler products and one does not a different company boldt suggested lofgrin nodded right and by the size and shape they could very well be labels from another companys product whether or not it is food we cant say its food boldt said one other element of interest to you he said spinning to face his computer and this was sent via the proverbial new information superhighwaywhich we just happen to have been using for the past eight years i might add and theres a hard copy to follow by express courier he clicked through some files explaining the bureau people got a beauty of a photograph of a sample in what im calling the heavy metal box while inside the vacuum chamber no less i wish to hell we had this kind of gear the screen went completely blank and lines slowly drew across the screen until what looked like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle appeared lofgrin stepped the computer through several moves and the piece enlarged he said this is a piece of what we believe to be one of the labels in the heavy metal box its tiny only a few centimeters squarea flake is allbut notice the colors with the next enlargement the colors became apparent red yellow and blue strong primary colors boldt leaning over lofgrins shoulder asked for the crime scene photographs from longview farms color or blackandwhite color it took lofgrin a few minutes to locate the photos when he returned to the office he rewound the scott hamilton tape to his favorite ballad while boldt leafed through the dozens of eightbytens he grabbed the phone and telephoned upstairs to lamoia find someone at adler foods who can tell us who does their label printing fowler was handling that for us but i dont want to involve him dont want to involve him or dont want him to know lamoia asked both boldt answered he told him he could be reached in lofgrins office and hung up while it was on his mind and while still leafing through the dozens of longview crime scene photographs boldt said to the lab man i need an opinion thats my middle name if i take a bobby pin and insert it into an electrical outlet and im wearing gloves would there be enough heat to burn through the glove and get my finger this is not something you want to experiment with lofgrin teased though serious if youre lucky all youll come away with is a burned finger if theyre thin gloves if the circuit is carrying a lot of amps maybe your heart stops too and then youre all dixies kenny fowlers fingertip had been burned he had made a joke about it to boldt but something he had said later in their conversation about daphnes head injury continued to trouble boldt here it is boldt passed the photograph to the lab man lofgrins head rose slowly his eyes suddenly the size of dinner plates little orphan lofgrin boldt thought in a hushed voice uncommon in the confident lofgrin the man said same colors he set the photograph down it showed the cement floor of the slaughterhousea blend of spray paints in a rigidly straight line left by the removal of a drop cloth intended to catch the paints boldt said yellow blue and red he held the color photograph up to the computer screen and the colors matched nearly perfectly the phone rang boldt snatched it up first and barked his name into the receiver lamoias voice said grambling printers here in the city boldts stubby finger with its dirty fingernail ran down the customer list for everest forest products and came to a quick stop at the end of the gs grambling printers its here he said to lamoia get a car ready he hung up the phone boldt kissed lofgrin on the forehead youre a genius lou lofgrin asked scrubbing his forehead vigorously boldts voice cracked as he said caulfields threatto kill hundreds its for real the strychnine another food companys labels spray painting a truckmaybe a delivery truckhes got everything in place so whats the good news lofgrin asked boldt hoisted the photograph weve got these colors lamoia drove a white pontiac with privacy glass the vehicle had been confiscated by spd in a porn video bust it had custom wirespoke aluminum wheels and a red velour interior the backseat of which folded down and converted into an impressive bed it was said to be featured in several of the videos though only special ops and some attorneys had ever viewed them this was the car that lamoia drove regularly and had since been dubbed the pimpmobile by his colleagues he called it sweetheart as in lets take sweetheart or i gave sweetheart a bubble bath and a wax today he treated it better than he did some of his friends from behind the wheel lamoia queried boldt fowler already ran the mug shot by all the adler printers right in theory meaning what a guy like fowler tells you he does what he does and what he gets from whatever he does are all different animals hes got a company to protect hes working for people kenny fowler hosed us kenny has some explaining to do hes been putting his nose where it doesnt belong my guess is that its just competitive bullshittrying to keep a step ahead but if im right its ugly stuff dirty the kind of stuff you cant forgive him whatever the motivation lamoia pulled the car to an abrupt stop forcing boldt to brace himself against the fringecovered dash nice driving boldt said need the brakes adjusted the office was all cheap furniture and bowling trophies boldt pushed the door shut it rubbed against the floor requiring an extra shove there was a skim of oil on the vinyl seats from fastfood bags he and lamoia remained standing does this man look familiar boldt asked passing caulfields mug shot to raymond fione never seen him before the man said bluntly fione made it clear that he did not like cops look again boldt encouraged my visions fine a minimumwage job maybe you just havent seen him around listen its true sergeant he searched for the name blot boldt corrected his name surei spend nearly every waking hour with my head buried in a damn computer screen who doesnt these days its like the lead in the roman pipes right machines this smart theyre going to make us all dumb but i sure as shit know whos on my payroll and this guy here is not one of them do you run your own deliveries with the insurance what it is hell no so maybe he trucks your product maybe he does fione agreed so what the fuck do i care you care lamoia said fione glared boldt asked who delivers the adler product for you theyre a good customer of ours adler is listen fowler and i already did this dance okay what im supposed to say you want i should lie to you tell me who delivers the adler product fione answered pacer handles all our shipping lamoia wrote it down taking a wild guess boldt handed the mug shot back to fione and said this man applied for a job with you he paused fiones face flushed and he would not look at either of them he had a prison record he was fresh out of prison and you turned him down the man spoke to the desk he was wired all hyped up you know i didnt like the guy he braved a look at boldt is that a crime but you didnt tell fowler that he didnt ask lamoia said you had to get rid of him so you gave him the name of another company no nothing like that i got rid of him thats all boldt said are pacers colors red yellow and blue no the man answered black and green i think boldt tried again one of your customers then a food product company uses red yellow and blue in their labels you remember first grade sergeant blot the primary colors are in every other color he instructed just those colors only the primary colors red yellow blue one of your food accounts uses just those colors food companies are our specialtyour niche all right you know how many there are in this state you know how many customers we have fione asked rhetorically answering maybe sixty or seventy you know how often those customers change their designs their colors their look you expect me to identify one of our customers by their colors do you know anything about this business heavy metals boldt stated my son listens to that shit fione said lamoia stepped closer not the music asshole ink the man looked ready to fight heavy metals those arent in your primary colorsthose are your silvers and golds your foils boldt said so okay how about a customer of yours that uses red blue yellow and a foil does that clarify matters for you fione warned if youre going to treat me like some ignorant asshole you can go suck wind far as im concerned sergeant the door is right behind you you got it he turned back to his computer and started typing lamoia checked with boldt who nodded then the detective stepped forward and spun the man around in his chair he leaned in close and said with intentional dramatics were with homicide asshole theres some guy killing people and your labels are part of it and that could drag you in deep we need some fucking answers here right now you got it the mans face went scarlet he met eyes with boldt and looked back at lamoia ill pull the artwork for you back in the garish car lamoia asked where to lets say youre caulfield youre out on parole and youre determined to make adler pay first place you apply for a job is adler foods but youre turned downlets say because of your record next boldt asked while at the same time seeing the fallacy of keeping caulfields name away from fowler and taplin and regretting that decision you go to the source grambling printers but they turn you down too no one wants you you find out who trucks the labels you try to go to work for them or maybe you steal a couple of boxes out of the back when the drivers in making another delivery exactly and you put the boxes under your workbench boldt said and you go to work pacer trucking lamoia asked ill call for the address lamoia and bobbie gaynes kept the south entrance of pacer trucking under surveillance while the back entrance was covered by freddie guccianno back from vacation and don chun on loan to shoswitz from major crimes boldt and daphne waited for jerry pacer in a booth at a dennys restaurant daphne ordered an english muffin with cream cheese boldt ordered a hot dog with everything fries and a side of cottage cheese pacer arrived and took coffee with cream and sugar and made them switch to a smoking table he had basset hound eyes and a double chin and his hair seemed to be two different colors indicating a rug he was the kind of man who would be bored in the middle of an earthquake he handed boldt an employment form for harold caulfield boldt recognized the residential address as a rooming house by the community college only a matter of blocks from the broadway foodland it was within the designated area where dr richard clements had stated the killer would be found pacer took one quick glance at the mug shot and pointed to it hes younger but thats him his voice sounded like a cement mixer slowed down are we done now i got trucks to move boldt felt both the surge of excitement and the wash of relief he felt a knot in his throat he felt like laughing daphne said you dont seem too surprised in this business lady what do you think i deal with college grads i probably know more cops than you do he added we done is he on the schedule today boldt asked hopefully wouldnt matter he is or he isnt not working for me this kid no calls no nothing just stood me up happens all the time but it still pisses me off you figure theyre in trouble when they dont even pick up the back pay his is sitting in on my desk so i wasnt exactly shocked and stunned to get your call thats what i mean i really cant help you is that all can i get back now please he added sarcastically stay boldt said firmly waving the hot dog at the seat some mustard dripped onto the table pacer sighed heavily and glared at him indignantly boldt realized the man had indeed spent a lot of time with police when he began answering questions without being asked this kid was okay all right so why do the cops care did he socialize with the other drivers she asked no a loner so what i aint much for beveraging either what kind of cat do you have boldt asked he liked throwing questions that broke a persons train of thought pacer had cat hairs all over the sleeves of his shirt the mans face twisted and only part of his hair moved definitely a rug boldt realized just a street cat is all whats it matter whats its name boldt asked between bites he was starving the man shrugged trix trixie what the hells my cat got to do with this he asked this of daphne who returned his shrug any inventory ever missing from caulfields trucks boldt asked stuff gets mixed up all the time but caulfield in particular hell i dont know is there a way to check that we got manifests we got paperwork up the ying yang if thats what youre asking so it could be checked boldt stated not by my people it couldnt jerry pacer said defensively not on my nickel but you would supply us the paperwork daphne suggested without a lot of attorneys no problem whatsoever do you file invoices by driver boldt added no way we file by customer our drivers mix up the routes because some damn insurance study showed that it reduced accidents i gotta tell you i think it works but as far as administration goes its a real pain in the ass he checked his watch you gotta understand the place goes to shit without me this time of day can we speed this up any boldt pretended not to hear him one of your clients is grambling printers whatever you say and is the grambling work invoiced by grambling customer by specific delivery or all grouped together grouped we contract out to a lot of outfits they handle their paperwork we handle ours we want that paperwork boldt reiterated indicating daphne pacer said already taken care of come on let me out of here daphne tried one of the companies you ship for uses a logo or a namei cant rememberof red yellow and blue the three colors by themselves maybe some silver or gold in there hell if i know think boldt said too impatiently the rebuke rattled pacer he played with the salt shaker sliding it between his hands like a hockey puck i dont know sounds more like fruit and vegetable crates to me del monte you know some of the truck farmers eyecatching shit flowers maybe we dont do no produce boldt and daphne met eyes and boldt started sliding out the booth reaching for his wallet as he went what pacer asked tentatively daphne offered him a business card and told him we need the grambling paperwork immediately right now right away i understand the word immediately its my drivers cant read not me well have it youll have it pacer stood uncertain and confused he swept a hand over his rug ensuring it was still in place he nodded and headed out of the restaurant at a fast pace boldt flagged the waitress while stuffing the hot dog down produce daphne declared truck farmers he could be out there anywhere selling spinach out of a pickup during the summer months truck farmers proliferated on washingtons back roads interstate rest areas and downtown parking lots buy it shoot it up with strychnine and sell it off the back of your truck he keeps moving he keeps killing or deliver it to grocery stores or restaurants his pager sounded reluctantly he reached down and shut it off not wanting to read its tiny lcd display and whatever information was contained there just the sound of the device turned boldts stomach it was actually worse than a telephone ringing boldt read the code on the display he felt the blood drain from his face and his hands go cold lou he stole daphnes purse rummaged through it and removed her cellular phone he called downtown and the moment the dispatcher answered he spoke his name clearly boldt though to him it sounded like somebody else talking who is it he waited to hear the answer then shut off the phone and handed it back to daphne his hand visibly shaking she grabbed his pager from him and read the display an officer down she said her voice wavering there was nothing so painful as this for any cop who striker just shot chris danielson in a hotel room over on fourth thirtytwo boldt had been to over a hundred such crime scenes but with his friends and coworkers involved this hotel room looked somehow different shoswitz had assigned sergeant david pasquini as primary in the officerinvolved shooting and boldt tried to stay out of the mans way according to a uniform by the door danielson had gone out on a stretcher alive but critical striker was in handcuffs ranting and raving about what a lousy shot he was there was a good amount of blood on the bed and two piles of clothes on chairs with danielsons weapon still snapped into its holster four shells had been discharged onto the carpet an id man was taking photographs of them the air still smelled of cordite boldt crossed the room and glanced out the window downstairs on the street a media circus was brewing wheres that coffee pasquini shouted after cracking open the bathroom door a few inches boldt back at the rooms entrance grabbed the green starbucks coffee from the patrolman and delivered it himself inching the door open with his foot and not allowing pasquini to get full hold of it okay pasquini said relenting and admitting boldt to the tiny bathroom elaine striker wearing a hotel towel wrapped around her middle sat on the closed toilet a woman officer was braced in the tub a notepad in hand boldt pushed the door shut pasquini removed the lid from the coffee and handed it to the woman who used both hands to steady the cup before taking a sip elaine had mascara on her cheeks bloodshot eyes and a mottled chest her skin was freckleda good deal of it showingand her tousled red hair framed her face in a ring of fire she looked up at boldt with hollow apologetic eyes it just happened she said pasquini wanted her talking to him not boldt he had a key he came in without us knowing we were busy he must have just stood there watching she broke down crying pasquini shook his head impatiently and took the cup from her as she spilled some coffee across her hands boldt offered her a towel she dried off her hands tucked herself into the towel that was wrapped around her and looked back up at both policemen chris sat up and mike started firing boldt could see the blood in her hair there was some on the left of her neck too and only then did he notice the small pile of bloodstained washcloths used to clean her up how many shots pasquini asked no idea one ten more than one several and then chris she broke down again boldt had heard enough he leaned in closely to her offered some reassurance and took her hand as she reached out to him it took a few seconds to win his hand free again and he left using an address listed on caulfields employment form with pacer trucking warrants were issued to search the rooming house and that afternoon seventeen uniformed and plainclothes officers descended on caulfields room like a swarm of bees a check of records confirmed that caulfield had moved out of the hotel the day following the murder of sheriff turner bramma date boldt could not get out of his mind since that time the room had been home to a grunge musician and his girlfriend destroying any chance the lab techs would recover anything of useand nothing admissible in a court of law boldt was reviewing the search with shoswitz and lofgrin when daphne entered the lieutenants office and said i can get us into striker the nurses in harborviews psych ward knew daphne by name and allowed them to bypass much of the red tape usually required even so before being allowed into the ward that housed michael strikers barren hospital room she and boldt were required to leave behind their weapons badges belts pens and pencils and boldts shoelaces this was their first indication of strikers condition daphne had stretched the truth to gain them access so quickly saying she was here for a session with the suspect and explaining boldts presence as some protection after the shooting michael striker had broken a patrolmans arm before jumping into traffic in an apparent act of suicide this she explained to boldt was the reason for his admission to the psych ward and his doctors refusal for police interrogation a male nurse unlocked and then relocked the door behind them striker had cut up his legs by running into traffic though nothing was broken he was under physical restraints and daphne informed boldt in a whisper that he was also mildly sedated hey boldt said trying to sound casual the rooms mood was grim in place of a real window there was an electronic contraption mounted to the wall that emitted light and offered an incredibly lifelike pastoral view of the canadian rockies so i cant jump out striker informed him from his bed they pay ten grand for those things supposed to help improve your state of mind he grinned thinly at this supposedly the thing even does sunrise and sunset he wore a blueandwhite hospital gown that used velcro instead of ties to eliminate the chance of hanging oneself striker had sad lifeless eyes he had hollow drawn cheeks and bulging eyes that indeed made him look a little crazy theyve got so much shit in me he said that im basically a walking pharmacy check that he corrected im not doing much walking he tugged at his strappeddown arms daphne spoke with him for the better part of twenty minutes through which she remained incredibly calm and striker slowly began to make some sense listen he said in what sounded to boldt like the mans familiar intolerant attorney voice i was out of my gourd to do what i did and that includes diving for the grille of that truck but its over now and i feel great valium is a wonderful thing can you tell us about it daphne asked whats to tell the guy was fucking my wife so i fucked him his cheek twitched and he asked boldt to scratch his neck for him boldt said you found him with elaine is that it mikey you warned me lou i know that i thought about that right after i did it too but you followed her anyway sort of right is there something you want to tell us daphne asked boldt felt the avoidance in the man too and it impressed him that daphne seized upon it so quickly jergenson was the house dick remember jergenson lou i offered him a fifty and he said how it was on the house because catching people fucking was part of his job and he remembered me people dont forget this he said indicating his prosthesis the one shrink ive seen make a big deal about my mitt talked a lot about manhood and what i tried to do to danielson no offense matthews but the guy is full of shit im not a shrink she said boldt was not sure if striker even heard that he did seem pretty stoned it had a lot less to do with my mitt than it did with my dick and my heart she tore my heart out is what she did especially at the end there she wasnt trying to hide it at all just wave it in my face and head out the door all dolled up came home smelling like love jesus so jergenson let you in right how did you know which room mikey he looked over at the canadian rockies and when he did daphne shot boldt a quick look of apprehension and he was and you should have seen her he had her on another planet he had her so far gone that im not sure she even recognized me know what i mean boldt could sense it and he thought daphne could as wellthat was what that look had been about though he felt at a loss as to how to get at it this was her territory he felt more like a spectator and yet striker seemed more comfortable talking to him he did not look at daphne at all did this man jergenson know your wife she asked nah he was a beat cop once upon a time spent his last years as a court guard thats how i knew him im surprised you dont remember him daphne inquired so it wasnt he who told you where to find your wife boldt asked did you follow her was that it its not whats important replied the attorney authoritatively they were in the act boy were they and i caught the bastard and i blew him away what little shooting ive done in my life was done righthanded if i hadnt had this he said indicating his prosthesis ida hit the target they remained silent not easy to shoot lefthanded is it lou you ever done it im still a little confused about something razor boldt said when we talked out in front of my house you said that you werent comfortable following her you asked me to do it for you so did you change your mind is that it youre missing the point striker repeated avoiding an answer attempting to use his attorney skills that were considerably dulled by the drugs coursing through him i had to have proof can you understand that id been through her dirty laundryand i dont mean that figuratively i had asked questions and had studied her carefully for her reactionsits my job to spot the guilty i knew i was getting lies and there were times she would come home and completely avoid touching me until shed had a bath or a shower and when you see enough of that you no longer wonder whats going on but i had to know thats just part of who i am ive got to know is there something you would like to share with us about how you identified the particular hotel she asked boldt felt warm and the room was not warm not unless that fake window was responsible he felt anxious because striker was incredibly nervous and the sergeant knew that if the claw had not been tied shut it would have been chirping away ive fucked things up for you striker apologized boldt said ive always wished i could throw you a curveball razor but ive seen people try it in court and ive seen you blow them away so id just as soon lay it right out there do it who did you hire to follow elaine striker shook his head like a person who had a bug caught in his hair boldt took inventory of daphne who gave him a slight shake of the head indicating for him to let striker be her eyes said dont push striker took a moment to recover this was the first time he met eyes with daphne and she sensed in him a hatred of all women and took this as normal she offered i can leave the room if you like no its not that he looked at boldt i didnt hire anyone lou it wasnt like that okay so you didnt hire anyone after you spoke with me did you ask someone else in the department to do this for you or maybe one of the investigators in your office someone like that no curveballs razor im putting it to you straight you have screwed things up for me i need answers i received a call boldt glanced over and met eyes with daphne as she sat forward in her chair a call boldt asked as calmly as he could force his voice to sound i received a telephone call telling me that if i was looking for elaine i could find her in room fourseventeen male or female elaine is female lou this was the medication talking and though striker chuckled for a little too long boldt waited him out male striker answered did you recognize the voice no i did not he seemed a little bored a little let down in himself for talking about this but you believed him you went there prepared to shoot a man i didnt think about it i was on autopilot he laughed more strongly this time you know ive put guys away for twenty years who tried that line on me talk about the tables turning he hesitated and said youre messing with my head here lou because i hear what youre saying to me youre saying someone fed me that phone call knowing damn well that id go and blow the guy away counting on me to do it and if you dont mind right now thats a little much for me okay because i know what people think about my temperi mean its no secret boldt asked when did you receive this phone call a little after ten at the office yeah the office and is that number published striker nodded i see what youre getting at lou but its no good i didnt recognize the voice im being straight with you on that you were set up razor boldt informed the man someone wanted you or danielson or both of you out of the way yeah striker said angrily well i couldnt care less about that if i got that phone call again i would go right back there and finish up what i started i swear i would my one and only one regret is that i missed i wasnt aiming to kill him a pa knows the difference between assault and murder one but i missed goddamn it four shots and i couldnt hit the damn thing four damn tries not that it was very big anyway so much for the mythim here to tell you at first the laughter seemed all right though daphne looked concerned and then boldt realized that the laughter would not quit and after a minute it frightened him because striker had lost all control he was crying and laughing and looking at them desperately as though he did not understand where it came from and that they should pull the plug and shut off the machine he was laughing ten minutes later when the male nurse kicked them out and delivered a shot of something that daphne said would take care of it but it did not when they reached the car boldt imagined he could still hear the mans laughter as if it had penetrated the electronic window reverberating down to the parking lot below even the car door closing did not shut it out for boldt and he told daphne this you know what those two words are together she asked placing the car in reverse mans laughter combined she asked what we witnessed up there is how most of them pay for it boldt combined the words in his head and spoke softly manslaughter she said michael striker has a long road ahead of him he placed his hand on hers and stopped her from backing up the car how good is your memory he asked taking his hand away you know damn well that i pride myself on it i forget who it was boldt said but someone told me that the bump on your forehead was from a box coming down off a shelf that was lofgrin or lamoia or bobbie they were the only ones who asked she said its after seven arent you supposed to be over at netlinq you want me to drop you boldt asked why why did you invent the box coming down because we agreed to keep my breakin at the houseboat between us and trying to explain running into a post in the dark was a little much it was a white lie lou so what again she asked you want me to drop you or not and what about fowler if you told the others one thing why tell fowler something different ive never told fowler anything about it ive hardly seen the man since then but hes seen you boldt said and her face froze i made him nervous with a question and in trying to get out of it he made reference to your hitting that post he hesitated so how did he know exactly what are you saying her lips quivered and she crossed her arms tightly she knew when they put in your security system they swept your house for bugs right she gasped fowlers people bear berenson had told him that some people could feel the cameras presence boldt said but that feeling never went away did it she threw her head back as if to keep her tears from running why she choked out longview farms boldt answered she looked over and met eyes with boldt and tried to speak but nothing came out ive got an idea boldt said the device looked like a small squash racquet or an electric charcoal starter though it worked more like one of those handheld metal detectors used at airports the people in technical services referred to it simply as clark for clark kent he of the xray vision there was said to be a flyswatter variety and another in the form of a feather duster that came with a fourfoot extension both of which could be used without telegraphing that the room was being swept for electronic bugs detective laura battles carried clark in her briefcase a wire ran to her ear and would emit a beep if a bug were encountered once activated a microprocessor inside the device continuously checked for magnetic fields caused by hidden microphones and was said to be percent effective in detecting them it was less dependable in the detection of fiberoptic cameras the latest generation of which were smaller than a shirt button and emitted no magnetic field whatsoever but clark through some advanced technology that no one had ever bothered to attempt to explain to boldt scored in the percentile in this department as well daphne accompanied by battles entered through the houseboats front doorand by agreement already in the midst of a real estate discussion daphne the seller laura battles the agent they toured the houseboat room to room battles took detailed notes on a clipboardthe studious type back in the parking lot where he had waited she told them both the place is a floating sound studio sorry daphne she apologized checking her notes she informed them audio in the galley sitting area head bedroom back deck top deck and telephone line she hesitated uncomfortable with this fiberoptic in the bathroom sitting room and bedroom daphne sank to the gravel boldt tried to catch her but she fought him off battles said most of them these days are infrared nightvision sensitive everything daphne stated she looked up at boldt with eyes he had never witnessed in her he said well want to keep them in place i think she sprang to her feet and began hitting boldt ferociously he tried to hold her off but she was hurting him and as laura battles climbed out of the car daphne threw her knee into the car door turned and threw her knee into boldts crotch and sent him down to the gravel he heard her say oh my god and then her feet took off at a run laura battles helped him up and seemed more bothered by the dent in her car door than boldts condition they drove around the neighborhood for the better part of an hour and checked the houseboat twice ill keep looking battles offered boldt was due for yet another night at netlinq and this time he had an army at his disposal another night spent at netlinq passed without success the main problems being logistical with so many people added to the surveillance team and virtually overnight tracking them and deploying them proved a technical nightmare it left boldt watching technicians switch wires and install sophisticated radio receivers while the extortionist walked away with another in cash depressed he left for home at two in the morning but on the way he made a detour after a sleepinterrupting call to laura battles confirmed that daphne matthews had not been found he stopped at the houseboat first she was not home he pounded on both the front and back doors and was beginning to worry when it occurred to him to check his voice mail no message there either he finally thought to call her cellular and she answered on the first ring where are you he asked room sixfourteen a hotel inn at the market interesting view she sounded terrible daffy you okay peachy are you with someone in a roundabout way no one in the room with me if thats what you mean did i wake you she sounded that way to himdazed not a chance can you stand some company if you can possibly forgive me for what i did to you make yourself decent im coming over there room was a suite with a water view it had to cost three hundred dollars a night it smelled of earl grey tea she did not allow him to turn on the light though he tried twice no she insisted angrily holding his arm the second time he caught sight of her in the dimly lighted room and her eyes looked cried out holding his arm she led him over to a sitting couch that fronted the huge plateglass window a moment later she delivered a tea to him and kept one for herself she sat down beside him two people in a dark room looking out a window nice view huh boldt looked out across the bay its surface in a constant shifting motion catching the moonlight broken only by container ships awaiting a morning dock she arrived about an hour and a half ago they talked awhileactually he talked at her he was angry i think then he took her from behind right there she leaned against that table see that table i dont think she liked it much she said but she put up with it which tells you something about the way he negotiates a deal i wonder how much she goes for it was fowlers apartment she was watching fowlers apartment not the water not the boats or the moon a set of gauze drapes was pulled but boldt could make out the shapes of two people clearly a manfowlerand a woman no telling her age or what she looked like this is what he does in his free time when hes not watching other people her angry tone of voice worried him buy a little piece of ass for a midnight snack a hostess twinkie in a betty boop voice she said what cant sleep tonight dial oneeight hundredidofuck im right here he offered staring out the window she asked have you ever watched other people screw not moviesi mean for real it was disgusting it was my first time its really a disgusting dirty little act in many waysespecially like that at the table like that all the bumping and grabbing a couple minutes is all like alley cats they never even kissed can you imagine he just took her like a piece of meat like he had ordered a pizza or something i dont think she liked it she repeated lets get out of here boldt suggested ill bet you anything he watched me and owen she snapped her head toward him then but looked away immediately she said he didnt learn anything judging by his own performance we could get some eggs boldt suggested wanting her out of here shes leaving now shes smart boldt saw that the woman was in fact leaving two hours on the nose well not exactly the nose no matter what he paid her it wasnt enough not with a man like that i wonder what two hours cost is it by the hour or what what does this accomplish daffy if im watching him then i know hes not watching me you want to fault that logic she added i want to bring charges lou daffy do whatever you have to do if youre going to say something just say it we were cutting him out daffy he knew it he even said as much you were nosing around some old skeletons and he wanted to know what you had no pun intended she sniped sarcastically im quite certain that by now he knows what i have you want to blame someone try taplin you think fowler dreamed this up he takes orders daffy hes taplins goandfetchit they probably had pizza parties and watched me take showers theyre in business theyre not running peep shows if you really want to hurt them then forget filing charges we wait and we use this against them somehow how i dont know you think i can go back there and pretend i dont know he waited her out youre saying theyve already seen all there is to see so why not she questioned im not really suggesting that no we make an excuse a friend needs you adler asks you to move in with him we had to stop that because of my badge well think of something id just rather not blow the whistle yet fowlers light went off it was over youre staying here tonight he asked she nodded are you going to be all right another nod im a big girl she smirked just ask him i can stay go home to your family she glanced over at him im sorry for the way i behaved i lost it thats all yeah you lost it boldt said and she grinned for the first time he kissed her she flinched and he left thirtythree where were you until four in the morning youre not supposed to ask that at sixthirty the question stands if i told you i was in an oceanview suite in a fancy hotel with a beautiful woman what would you think that youre full of youknowwhat good the answer stands youre hopeless she walked around the room and in and out of the bathroom naked getting herself ready boldt thought back to someone watching daphne and how she had reacted and he thought he understood her better now that he saw his own wife being so casual with herself and he too was angry and perhaps more determined to do something about this anger wake up he had drifted back to sleep you said i shouldnt let you sleep adding its not fair to ask of me such things she was dressed now but not for work what day is it suzie and i are going over to elaines michael is still locked up in that room with rubber walls boldt realized that losing the prosecuting attorney would set back the investigation but he pushed this thought aside you should be sainted taken to dinner would do i havent forgotten yes you had she told him i had he admitted but now i remember i owe you a champagne dinner and you owe your son about two weeks off so noted hes spending too much time at day care ill drop him she frowned but ill pick him up early so forget it in case you were thinking about it she looked at him you werent thinking about it i can hardly think at all sleep deprivation has that effect she hesitated in the doorway reluctant to leave what he asked she asked tentatively how beautiful and which hotel he smirked the phone rang and they both hesitated do we have to she asked boldt answered it shoswitzs voice named an address on lakewood boldt hung up honey she asked it has happened again boldt mumbled by the time boldt arrived at quarter to eight the crime scene had turned into a circus scores of the morbidly curious plus television and radio vans including the three nationals with satellite links every variety of police andnever explainedtwo fire trucks crowded the area so badly that boldt was forced to park on sierra and cut through someones backyard much to his chagrin the crime scene had been held for one man lou boldt and his arrival sparked a kind of instant celebrity that proved one of the most distasteful experiences of his career reporters shoved microphones at him but he shielded his face and avoided both cameras and questions when he finally made it inside the home he discovered a videocam crew from a tabloid television news show in the process of recording every aspect of the deceasedthree bodies total the crew had set up in the living room and were waiting for him complete with a portable light that was blindingly bright the crime scene was contaminated yes but the violation of this familys privacy was what triggered lou boldts explosive rage he had the entire crew arrested for trespassing and breaking and entering by the time the area was finally cleared both dixie and his crew and bernie lofgrin and his were on hand the three men closed the kitchen door shutting out the chaos outside and studied the dead the husband had made it to the phone though he had apparently never dialed dixie attributed these extra few seconds to his body weight and a great deal of courage the middleaged suburban woman appeared to have lunged for her eightyearold girl perhaps knocking over her chair in the process mother and daughter were curled tightly in each others arms now dead beneath the kitchen table the mothers face locked in an expression of pure horror the source of the poisondixie guessed the cause of death as such within minutes of his preliminary examinationappeared to be a watermelon lividity the settling of blood in the body indicated a time of death of between eight and sixteen hours earlier additional tests would further narrow this there were three slices of the melon on three plates the seeds carefully removed the slices cut up into cubes no one had ingested more than six cubes of melon dixie declared weve both attended a lot of deaths lou but ive never witnessed anything quite like this it was true the fathers final effort was frozen mocking his attempt he was lying on the floor arm outstretched the phones receiver still in his hand the dishes were neatly stacked alongside the sink they had eaten barbecued pork chops corn and a green salad lofgrin said the news crew has already destroyed any chance of clean evidence but well go through the motions the similarity to the treehouse killings had reporters asking about a serial killer fishing still but closer to the real story he needed to be alone he passed through the kitchen and into a small sitting room where a color television aimed at a couch and a bookshelf was crowded with hardcovers and paperbacks the name of the family was crowley and the neighborhood the house the furnishings the appointments put them firmly in the combined sixfigure income this was another house that liz would have wanted and he could not help but think of mother and daughter beneath the kitchen table huddled against the fears and pain of death and how glad he was that this was not liz and miles the stairs were maple and climbed quickly to a second story he heard the whining as he reached the top and he moved toward it cautiously not knowing what to expect it grew sharper and sadder as he approached and he understood it was a dog before he opened the door there lying at the foot of the parents bed pressed into the floor lonely eyes trained up at boldt in complete confusion a shepherdcollie cried plaintively this dog boldt realized was the only witness to what had happened this dog had lost her entire family in the course of one evenings meal he bent down and petted it and fought back a seething anger dr richard clements commandeered shoswitzs office daphne matthews was there as were boldt and the lieutenant clements said to boldt you are focusing on these truck farmers is that right yes that is not right weve pulled every watermel schmatermelon blah he no longer cares about claiming authorship it is ending he is leading you astray sergeant you mustnt be misled i saw your work in the situation room stick with thatthe paint the colors the evidence this watermelon is a ruse intended to mislead the hunt he is the fox let us not forget and you are the hound he said to boldt and we must remember that the only way the fox ever wins the chase is not to outrun his pursuers but to deceive them shoswitz huffed audibly losing patience with clements his agitation surfaced as small tics to the shoulders and the eyes so that he looked like a marionette whose strings were tangled boldt feared he might say something to offend the doctor and realizing the value of clements quirky or not boldt headed off any such confrontation between the two by speaking first he could kill hundreds by poisoning produce he doesnt desire to kill hundreds what did he say on the phone he asked daphne that owen had killed the ones he loved he wants to kill adler my diagnosis is that his schizophrenia has progressed to a point that whatever voice may once have vied for such a grand scheme has since been overpowered by the drive for vengeance a far greater motivation as caulfield perceives it owen adler owes him several long years of his life how many have read this he waved a group of papers in the air impossible to see he explained it is his defense of his innocence subsequent to the trial a thoughtful powerful convincing piece of writing i for one believe him he claims to have been the victim of a framethat the drugs were not his he supported this by an offer of proof that not one blood test administered to him had tested positive for cocaine use he points to the police lab tests that failed to find any trace evidence whatsoever of the drug in his home or automobile in his third year of medium detention he wrote this most extraordinary appeal but because of the states minimum sentencing failed to be granted parole or a retrial it is my judgment that a schism developed within him driven perhaps by a valid injustice as we now understand his situation his more logical half advised him to follow the system his disturbed half revolted rejecting any such alliance with the very forces that had led to his demise the latter half has gained control now i am suggesting but there is a cunning logical intelligent mind at work here and one that has been alerted to the substantial powers and abilities of his adversary its all over the news he knows the clock is running he knows what he is up against and he has little conscious desire to be a martyr and be caught regardless of the efforts of the subconscious so he tricks us daphne said following the reasoning exactly he poisons a single melon off go the hounds chasing the melons following the wrong scent while all the while the fox has doubled back and is raiding the chicken house shoswitz protested but we dont know it was only the one melon sure we do clements countered weve not had one other report correct not one other incident and if he intended to kill hundreds using melons this would hardly be the case he giggled dont you see how obvious hes being about this the lieutenant bristled with the giddy pleasure clements was taking in all of this any homicide cop felt the pain and suffering of the victims and their relativesno matter how callous to the crime scenes he or she became no matter how quick the oneliners and how easy it was to move on to another case the tragedy of the crowley family had deeply affected everyone on the fifth floor and in this way clements was clearly a visitor im saying its adler he wants do not be fooled by his cleverness he will deceive you at every opportunity i warned you of this before you cannot put yourself in this mans mind but i can gentlemen he acknowledged matthews and smiled i can thirtyfour boldt entered netlinqs war room on sunday night losing faith that the atms might ever be used to trap caulfield for too many nights now he had sat in a chair and stared at the electronic map projected onto the huge screen for too many nights he had gone home with nothing more than a headache special agent sheila locke was about twentysix years old with short brown hair a thin pale face and enormous eyes she wore a blue blazer that hid her figure and a wireless headset that covered her right ear and a foamcovered microphone that hid her generous mouth using the newly added fbi communications locke and another agent whom boldt knew only as billy were in constant touch with the nearly seventyfive men and women watching atms in king county although boldts tiny squad of eleven was keeping tabs on downtown atms the fbi special agents and king county undercover officers had been deployed in the outlying regions including kirklandbellevue and seatacrenton ted perch was chatting up lucille guillard who monitored a computer terminal allowing her personal control of all pacwest atms she would also get a realtime look at the extortionists account balance so that if a hit slipped through the screening software again they would at least see a balance change indicating a hit over seventeen hundred atms under netlinqs control were now subject to the timetrap software in the past fortyeight hours the system had not crashed once publicly the delay was still being attributed to maintenance the electronic wall map was peppered with differentcolored dots red represented cash machines not under direct surveillance of which there seemed to be hundreds green considerably fewer depicted the atms under covert surveillance no atm had been hit twice and the amber dots represented the machines previously hit it was indeed a remarkable display of technology he realized though it did little to buoy his mood netlinqs two other enormous screens part of the switching stations regular command center displayed atm traffic as blinking orangeandgreen lines these colorful lines shot across the maps like arrows reaching hubs that represented banks mainframes changed color and traveled on there were six people from netlinq tracking these screens though they were generally disregarded by the law enforcement visitors ready billy locke asked the male dispatcher after several minutes of relative silence billy rolled his chair forward to a computer terminal that was positioned central to the wall maps he adjusted his headset and tested it twice he typed into the keyboard checking his monitor and the maps and spoke in a soft even monotone check seventeen he listened typed again and said into the headset check fortysix again check sixty he did this for several minutes before giving a nod to locke dispatchers boldt thought were a different lifeform they needed nerves of steel and a steady monotone voice to go with them in the middle of the most complex chaotic lifethreatening emergency they were paid to keep calm and direct human beings and vehicles as if they were chess pieces twenty minutes of silence followed punctuated only by the clicking of computer keys boldt had nodded off when he was pulled awake by the sound of a human voice we have a hit three seconds and counting where once this announcement had brought excitement now it brought only frustration on the display a bright white light flashed in earlington indicating the hit a digital display ran in the upper righthand corner counting off the passing seconds of the active atm transaction billy dispatched two of the field agents directing one to the north of the hit and the other directly to the atm not surprisingly given the odds this atm was not under direct surveillance guillard called out its not ours perch shouted ten seconds elapsed he hawked instructions at an assistant who worked furiously at the keyboard twenty seconds to billy perch said where the hell are your people the dispatcher maintaining his calm did not reply boldt watched as perchs assistant shook his head and announced transaction complete boldt said we need more time and cued billy to rush the surveillance teams a volley of calm instructions followed billy informed boldt surveillance nine is closing also fourteen perch guillard and boldt all fixed their attention on the two dispatchers motionlessly silently cars racing down streets caulfield calmly walking away billy finally looked up surveillance reports no visual contact the atm is empty perch slammed the desk violently im increasing the window of time he added the system had better hold together the room settled into an uncomfortable but workmanlike atmosphere for the next thirty minutes boldt checked his watch frequently glancing between billy and the overhead screen for netlinq it was business as usual the rows of technicians monitored the endless transfer of money as hundreds of transactions representing thousands of dollars raced through the netlinq computers at five minutes to nine guillard announced excitedly we have a second hit im pushing the time delay to thirtyfive seconds objections she had independent control of the timetrap software for her banks atms perch sounded apoplectic as he questioned the wisdom of such a long wot thirtyfive seconds boldt glanced at him hotly perch said fuck it just do it he okayed boldt stood to his feet as the screen changed to an enlargement of the earlington area showing all its streets the small dots were now large circles with numbers inside them each surveillance agent carried a global positioning system transmitter relaying back his or her exact realtime location which the electronic map then displayed a blue triangle bearing the number moved steadily toward the yellow atm on southwest seventh another blue dot numbered moved north on highway and another under billys monotone instructions north on the authorization requested boldt could picture caulfield at the atm waiting for the cash would he notice the added time would he have heard the fabricated news stories that the entire northwest system was experiencing delays due to maintenance operations authorization approved perch called out reading over jimmys shoulders twenty seconds currency delivery in progress guillard announced the timetrap software included a routine to slow the actual delivery of the bills this was because perch had explained that a customer can hear the machine counting out the cash and he believed that once the suspect heard and recognized this sound psychologically it would be much more difficult to walk away from the machine thirty seconds billy said into his microphone i copy six to boldt he said calmly we have visual contact he handed boldt a headset at that moment there were no sweeter words for lou boldt given all their efforts this was the first time anyone had actually seen caulfield description boldt asked he did not recognize the voice of field agent number it belonged to one of the dozens of fbi agents who were now participating he did not recognize the description of the suspect either which was when his head felt faint and dizzy five foot seven or eight motorcycle helmet leather jacket repeat height boldt ordered harry caulfield stood an even six feet five foot eight sex female repeat definitely female im looking at her backside dont forget boldt recognized the description well enough lucille guillard had shown him a photograph disappointed it was not caulfield himself he settled for the accomplice orders boldt heard through the headphones he glanced around the room all eyes were on him billy asked calmly instructions sergeant he felt cheated he sorted through his choices as the accomplice stood waiting for her cash and the field agent stood waiting for instructions maintain visual boldt said though barely loud enough to be heard perch jumped forward and complained but the software worked youve got her back off boldt ordered the man maintain visual he repeated calmly to billy feeling himself again his eyes glued to the electronic map the dispatcher repeated the command with all the energy of ordering a tuna sandwich how long to throw a net around it billy boldt inquired the plan all along had been for one or two surveillance personnel to make the bust patrol cars readied as backup in case it went sour but now all that had changed billy and sheila locke consulted several screens locke said two minutes and we can have all the major routes in and out with a minimum of singleagent coverage i can put the bird up if you want she checked a mileage chart seven minutes and were there that would give us backup support although its a dark night out there tonight do it tighten it up and close it down he ignored perch who hovered alongside maintain visual surveillance only right transaction complete guillard announced from her corner what the hell are you doing perch implored i heard you the first time thank you boldt said he had other answers all cliches my job what they pay me to do but he held his tongue wondering if a civilian could be made to understand the balance of risk and assets billy deployed the agents to cover onramps and intersections bus stops bike routes and running paths not taking his eyes off his work he explained to boldt if she goes too far south of town too quickly i may lose her were not set up for that i understand boldt returned she wont go south he predicted clements and a pair of fbi experts had studied the atm hit patterns from the previous nights and had determined that the extortionist always moved toward the city and i as the hits progressed it was assumed that i possibly in combination with other major highways was seen by the extortionist as an escape route in truth law enforcement welcomed the use of limitedaccess highways lucille guillards telephone purred softly and she answered it a moment later she hung up and informed boldt we have a stopmotion video image of the hit to locke she said your techs have been informed locke said to boldt we may be able to pull a video feed for us here boldt had seen the satellite van outside in the parking lot and had wondered what it was for he had no chance to doubt his decision with the suspect clearly not caulfield and caulfield the only person of interest to him he felt he had no choice but to follow the suspect hoping she would lead them back to him the thought crossed his mind that caulfield had never been any part of the extortion but he could not allow himself to give any weight to this given his current commitment both mentally and logistically to the surveillance operation the chopper is picking up the video for us billy told boldt a finger pushed to his ear we should have it back here in a matter of minutes he returned to his keyboard locke indicated boldts headphones which the sergeant had slipped down around his neck he pulled them back on in time to hear the same field agent describe the suspect moving northwest on foot turning left at the corner the voice said boldt caught himself holding his breath the agent announced in a low voice im about thirty yards back maintaining visual contact pointing to the screen billy told boldt well have another agent in play at the next intersection possible vehicle spotted the field agent announced a motorcycle boldt asked him through the headset negative a brown datsun washington vehicle registration ninefourfiveoneone billy repeated the number into his headset and told boldt your people are running the plate through dmv ive got it locke announced freeing billy of this communication a minute later she leaned into her headset and having been instructed not to repeat such a thing aloud wrote out for boldt vehicle registration cornelia uli female caucasian address airport way seattle boldt folded the piece of paper and placed it in his pocket assigning this a top priority he instructed locke to place the residence under tight surveillance she went about redeploying the field surveillance personnel in order to accommodate this change shes getting into the vehicle the field agent announced im on foot im going to lose her likewise said the second agent to arrive in the area boldt terrified they were about to lose her checked with his dispatcher who went offmike grinned and said dont worry sergeant weve got this tighter than a gnats ass he pointed to the screen ive got five vehicles within a fourblock area unless she beams herself up weve got her the radio traffic in boldts headset heated up as billy orchestrated the vehicular handoffs no one car stayed with the target vehicle for more than six blocks or two miles of highway on the screen the blue triangles representing the agents location transmitters clustered in and around an area where billy kept manually moving a white flashing dot indicating the suspect the white dot left i billy announced suspect is coming to a stop boldt listened in on the continuous dialogue between dispatcher and field agents he closed his eyes and tried to picture a sidewalk atm on a nottoobusy street the approach of a petite woman wearing a motorcycle helmet in the faint glow of the streetlights and the swarm of police that now surrounded her and would continue to monitor her every moment she was as of that moment public property cornelia uli would be stripped down to her moles and birthmarks if necessaryall in due time for the moment under the duress of a nervous stomach he sat back consulting a printout listing the various field agents and assignments and listened to his team at work under the unusual calm of the fbi dispatcher dispatch twentysix give us a walkby visual twentysix twentysix confirm walkby visual dispatch affirmative walkby please t wentysix roger a few anxious seconds passed twentysix affirmative suspect is standing at the machine boldt consulted the deployment printout number james flynnwas dressed as a pizza delivery man tonight carrying his pizzas he was passing the atm glancing briefly at the mark never breaking stride no wide eyes of recognition no probing stare professional sure lucille guillard announced we have a hit a hit flashed on the wall map surrounded by a sea of blue triangles boldt instructed the dispatcher can we kill the datsun on the run billy held up a finger and talked rapidly into this mouthpiece dispatch tech services mobile request a car kill on the suspects vehicle copy tech services van car kill affirmative one minute please boldt and billy met eyes the dispatcher looked completely relaxed t ech services van suspects vehicle is parked oneandonehalf blocks northrepeat northof the atm location looks good for a kill billy guillard announced fifteen seconds have elapsed twenty seconds left boldt told guillard extend the time trap give us a few seconds longer boldt asked billy can they do it in thirty seconds or less extending to fortyfive seconds guillard confirmed we should not go beyond this sergeant t ech services van thirty seconds is an affirmative deploy billy glanced at boldt who hit the transmit button and said sharply go dispatch fortyfour keep us alert to any change in suspects position fortyfive roger dispatch will do tech services operative im going in boldt could picture the man hurrying down a quiet street to one of many parked cars in his pocket would be an oilfilter wrench tech services operative dispatch problem i have a couple out for a stroll im aborting this pass guillard counted off ten seconds to go dispatch times awasting tech services operative affirmative making another pass guillard announced five seconds dispatch five seconds until transaction is complete t ech services operative affirmative dispatch five seconds making a second pass all clear im going under the car sheila locke said tech has live video for us coming onscreen all eyes riveted to the screen now divided showing two blackandwhite images on the left was a wavy telephoto image of the helmeted woman standing at the atm on the right of a split screen the tech services man in eerie nightsight video slid under the parked datsun and disappeared boldt caught himself whiteknuckling the chair how the fbi personnel managed this live video was beyond him but he did not question it tech services in every department was famous for performing miracles transaction complete guillard announced the video followed this woman as she left the atm and rounded the corner heading toward her car once a good distance away she pulled off the helmet and shook out her hair dispatch tech operative suspect on her way do you copy there was no response from the operative whose feet could be seen on the screen sticking out from under the suspects car billy calmly reported to boldt hes not responding must be radio interference the suspect was now less than a halfblock away and closing quickly get him out of there boldt ordered dispatch tech services request an interrupt repeat physical interrupt requested on the car kill tech services roger dispatch on the screen a woman dressed casually in blue jeans and a tshirt hurried out of the van moving quickly down the street toward the car she made no effort to look in the direction of the suspect now but a few yards away and coming up the sidewalk as the tech services woman came alongside the suspects vehicle she flung her purse to the pavement intentionally spilling its contents boldt watched the overhead screen hearing only the hum of the computers billys soft mumble and the endless tapping of the computer keyboards the woman field agent threw her head under the vehicle and said something as the suspect rounded the final corner now only two cars away the tech services man scrambled out came to his knees and immediately began helping her to clean up the contents of her spilled purse cornelia uli approached the drivers door and encountered them both the field agent laughed and shook her head at uli as if embarrassed to have spilled her purse she said something as did the tech services man the last of the purse contents were collected as uli unlocked the datsuns trunk and set the helmet inside she acted as casually about possessing a motorcycle helmet while driving a car as the two field agents did about collecting the items from the spilled purse their job completed the field agents made no sudden moves no panic together they headed down the sidewalk in the opposite direction from the van and the camera that recorded them the datsun pulled away from the curb and drove off stay with her boldt ordered billy he was thinking these next few minutes are critical there were two ways that boldt could play this woman whom he considered caulfields accomplice and he had already made the choice the first and most conservative was to keep his distance and sit on her obtain the necessary warrants and tap her phone perhaps even install video surveillance in her residence record her every move her every spoken word and hope for the contact with caulfield the secondand the method he had elected to followwas the more aggressive to force a problem onto her and hope that in her moment of panic she turned to caulfield for help either identifying his location or luring him to her he felt powerless not being in the field with the others and he sensed that by staying behind and coordinating the effort he had crossed the imaginary line to desk jockeyand did not care for it one bit following the radio traffic in the headphones he pictured the cars swapping responsibility for surveillance of the datsun he rejoiced with the others as the stream of leaking oil was spotted behind the vehicle and he alerted locke to open a line to us west they were going to need a listing of all payphone locations three minutes later the datsun pulled over stopped dead in the middle of a strip of fastfood quick lube and car lots one surveillance car pulled past and into the parking lot of a burger joint two others stopped fifty yards short and divided to either side of the road billy whats the address boldt asked hurriedly the dispatcher checked with the field agents and reported back boldt signaled locke like a conductor and she repeated the address to the ma bell supervisor she had on the line within seconds her pen was moving rapidly she tore off the piece of paper and handed it to boldt who scanned it quickly and passed it to billy asking him to put them up on the screen a minute later six pink stars with a t in the middle appeared on the electronic map over the course of the next few minutes reports streamed in that the suspect was repeatedly attempting to start her car during this time sheila locke determined the physical locations of the pay phones according to their addresses two were behind the suspect in a mcdonalds and a burger king respectively one was across and up the street in a strip mall one each in a pair of competing gas stations nearly half a mile in front of her near the interstate and one in a booth adjacent to a bus stop not a hundred yards ahead boldt instructed the trailing tech services van to set up with a view of both the datsun and this busstop pay phone three minutes later netlinqs center screen showed a grainy blackandwhite telephoto image of the sadlooking datsun pulled awkwardly onto the shoulder of soft grass suspect is moving announced a male voice in the headset boldt and billy met eyes billys earlier doubt that had been present when boldt elected to follow rather than apprehend was now gone replaced instead by a confidence that bordered on admiration on the screen the woman climbed out of the car clearly disgusted she looked both ways trying to decide where to find a phone boldt silently urged her to head back toward the fastfood chains he did not want her seeing the bus stop but as if hearing him and going against his wishes she elected to walk in the direction her car was headed trying to consider every possibility boldt advised locke get in touch with the local bus service and find out their schedule any bus due at that stop in the next ten minutes we want detoured tell them well want an empty bus on standby ten blocks back and get the chopper back here i may want a lift she scribbled all of this down and lets see how many taxi companies cover that area well want our people in as the cabbies and no patrol cars he emphasized i dont want to see a patrol within ten blocks of that area for the next several minutes locke and billy occupied themselves with boldts requests field agents were deployed to two area cab companies and the bus company the regularly scheduled bus was diverted the driver telling her passengers that an accident blocked the road ahead and thereby required a detour the camera followed cornelia uli who was by no means a fast walker nervous or perhaps just worried about her car she continually checked over her shoulder islandhopping from one parking lot to the next in search of a pay phone overhead boldt heard the mechanical thunder of the helicopter its going to be the bus stop boldt predicted choppers down locke announced boldt said to her tell the phone company which phone we think its going to be and that we need a realtime report on whatever numbers she calls got it to billy he said i want seven passengers and a driver on our bus mix it up more of our people on the stops along the route with everyone keeping a strict eye out for caulfield were going to have to allow civilians onto the bus in case caulfield sends a gobetween so i want to make it real clear no cowboy theatrics we consider her armed but any civilians are our first priority if she calls for a stop near her place on airport way thats our cue to take her i dont want her getting inside her place before we do got it he added and give me someone at the bus stop now right away i want to hear whats said if at all possible billy had to work quickly though his motions conserved energy and his voice never indicated the slightest degree of excitement sheila locke turned and told the sergeant that the phone company was all set on the screen boldt saw the suspect cross one final parking lot and quicken her step as she spotted a pay phone in the distance of the same frame a young woman approached the bus stop boldt asked is she ours billy nodded boldt thought to himself these people are amazing he asked locke do we have an open line to the phone company she nodded confirmation the suspect stepped up to the phone and seconds later was dialing boldt sat half off his chair his attention split between the giant television projection on the wall and the back of sheila lockes head for these few seconds the room went absolutely silent save for the hum of the equipment everyone hanging on this phone call the agent on foot arrived at the bus stop late the suspect dialed waited and hung up there was no way to tell from the cameras angle and distance if she ever spoke what the hell boldt let slip both billys and boldts attention focused on sheila locke who thanked someone asked this person to stand by please and turned to tell boldt its a business number theyre searching boldt wished there were a way to effect a line interrupt and to listen in on whatever conversation took place well aware of the technological ease with which such an interrupt could be accomplished but he was equally aware that any such interrupt required warrants and legal red tape that where pay phones were concerned took a minimum of several hours to accomplish the same system established to protect a persons rights limited boldts ability to carry out his job locke touched her finger to her earphone listened and then told boldt its a paging service she would have keyed in a personal identification code but the phone companys software doesnt trap any numbers dialed following line connection boldt felt crushed by this news over his headphones a womans voice spoke incredibly softly the phones ringing whoever she paged is calling her back he could hear the ringing of the phone it was the field agent at the bus stop a few short yards from the suspect sergeant it was billy he directed boldts attention to the screen cornelia uli answered the phone boldt said to locke get in touch with the paging company locke interrupted already on it billy said turn up your headphones sergeant were going to try something here boldt adjusted the knob he heard a raspy steady breathing loudly in the headphones and then in the background he picked up a womans voice bitching about the stupid car in a pause billy explained quickly that background noise is the agents breathing we have a thirtydb boost on her condenser the suspect mentioned the bus stop she paused she said okay twice and left the phone dangling as she approached the bus stop there was a tremendously loud click in the phones prompting boldt to jettison his headset it tumbled into his lap grinning billy said that was the agent turning off her mike he added but we should thank her if she had spoken she might have made us deaf im going out there boldt announced can you communicate with the chopper billy said in that unnaturally calm voice of his sergeant tech services can do anything the chopper ride was brief and a little terrifying at night they stayed low and the buildings swept beneath them with ridiculous speed toylike in appearance boldt was left off in a school soccer field seven blocks from the waiting bus so that there would be no sound of a chopper anywhere near the suspect he was met there by a field agent by the name of nathan jones whom he recognized as king county police were all ready for you the agent announced showing boldt into the car and racing down the streets oblivious to any of the traffic signs as they approached the bus it looked ominous to boldt it was parked alongside the road its interior lights shining yellow as he stepped aboard there were seven people sitting in the various seats he introduced himself studied them briefly and asked two to exchange seats and two to sit together if she looked closely cornelia uli might notice a similarity in age and appearance among several of them only one of them looked over fifty another kcp detective boldt knew casually though he could not remember his name were going to give her a lot of room he announced if she signals early then youhe pointed to one of the three womenwill get off at the same stop dont follow too closely but keep us advised remember he said addressing all of them well have support all around us in every direction my information is that shell have to switch lines to head toward town i think we can safely afford for four of usme and you threeto make that switch with her we are going to make every attempt to have that be a dummy bus as well our people will be coming onto the bus at various stops you two will disembark at the third and fifth stop respectively if we go the distance if she holds off and stays on until the fivehundred block of airport way when she stands we take her we do it fast and without fanfare and she does not get off this bus any questions there were none roll he said grabbing for a handhold as the bus door closed and the vehicle started off down the road they rounded a corner two of the agents were reading papers another a paperback two stared blankly out the window boldt tried to settle himself he leaned against the window and relaxed feigning an exhausted man taking a napat any other time something that would have required very little acting he had abandoned his radio earpiece stuffing it down inside his collar the bus and all its occupants except for the driver were now isolated from billy the dispatcher sheila locke phil shoswitz back at the department and all the support vehicles in place and ready to assist them they passed the disabled datsun the heads of several of the passengers craning to see it and the bus slowed as it approached the stop the door hissed open boldt recognized the agent from the live surveillance video she boarded first and took several seconds to come up with the right amount of money then cornelia uli stepped up and called out excuse me to the woman agent boldts heart pounded heavily he wanted that door closed and uli trapped inside the bus the agent turned do you have change uli asked she waved a crisp twentydollar bill and boldt realized this had come from the cash machine the woman agent seemed paralyzed boldt silently urged the driver to shut the door the younger man sitting ahead of boldt jumped up and said i do fishing his wallet from his back pocket he gave her an assortment of bills accepting the twenty from her and uli fed one of the ones into the drivers pay machine uli asked the driver a kcp man about the route fortunately someone had thought ahead to have a local in the drivers seat and the man informed her about the line change that boldt had just mentioned at the outset everyone took separate seats the door hissed closed boldts sense of tension increased with every mile his stomach grumbled noisily he glanced up just once to look at her no staring she wore tightfitting jeans and that black leather jacket she had brown eyes no makeup and full pouty lips she scratched the back of her neck and when she did this boldts first reaction was that he had seen this woman before somewhere other than in the surveillance video and this continued to trouble him as the bus drove on the driver announced a stop and handled the bus poorly as they slowed boldt faced himself so that he looked out a window when in fact he was using the reflection to watch the suspects profile if she moved toward the rear exit door he intended to follow there was no one at this stop and without a call signal the front door never opened the bus gained speed and continued on at the third stop an agent disembarked another boarded a pretty woman fbi with a simple face and inquisitive eyes she sat directly across from uli who occupied one of the front wall benches this agent took a look around for any leftover papers then pulled out a nail file and went to work on her nails as a signal of their identity all agents had been instructed to touch their left ear prior to boarding which was why boldt occupied a seat on the right side of the busand he was grateful that uli had her back to this same side in this way boldt knew ahead of time the status of his passengers at the fourth stop a civilian boarded a portly toothless man he showed his pass and asked the driver so wheres danny tonight the driver answered youre stuck with me never seen you before the man said in the windows reflection boldt studied ulis response she seemed to take no notice the driver handled himself well though the bus poorly he lunged ahead too quickly sending the teetering newcomer charging down the aisle barely keeping his balance he smelled of cigarettes and booze as he passed nice job he hollered he took a seat immediately behind boldt which made the sergeant uncomfortable he leaned forward over boldts shoulder and said got a rookie behind the wheel friend i can drive blindfolded better than that hmm boldt made a point of not engaging in any conversation this man had the feel of a nonstop talker and that was the last thing he wanted at this point one of the agents sensing this rose and came to this mans seat you mind he asked and without awaiting a response took the aisle seat next to this man and started him talking taking him away from pestering boldt the bus motored along whining and hissing one red light to the next the following bus stop was again void of passengers at the next another agent disembarked the one after that two more boardedboth agents the bus driver announced the stop he turned to uli and said heres your connection boldt hesitated he did not want to commit to leaving the bus until he was sure uli was also as the bus slowed she rose boldt came out of his seat and headed for the front door three of the others joined him they all disembarked receiving transfers from the driver they joined two others at this stop boldt guessed them both as agents though there was no easy way for either to offer the signal so he could not be certain the bus drove away the night was calm the air warm above them in the darkness two white seagulls swooped over the street and one cried at the other then they disappeared two of the agents discussed a mariners game the woman with the paperback found some street light and opened her book boldt said to one of the strangers is this the line going into the city this man scratched his ear as he thought about it international district and downtown he said you want the u you gotta change downtown boldt thanked him cornelia uli asked the woman next to her for the time she looked restless and the way she guarded her purse boldt assumed it contained the ransom money by now a police car would have pulled alongside ulis datsun on the offchance caulfield was coming for the car while uli headed home this was handled in a straightforward manner the patrolman wrote up the citation and called in a tow truck the truck took ten minutes to arrive it would be towed via a combination of the highway and streetsintentionally avoiding the bus routeto the police garage where it would be given the full treatment by the greasemonkey division of bernie lofgrins id unit the bus pulled up to the stop the driver was cleaning wax out of his left ear with his index finger as boldt climbed aboard and showed his transfer the driver met eyes with him revealing absolutely nothing in his face but in the eyes themselves there was a keen energy bobbie gaynes was in the fifth seat back there were six others on the bus all spd seeing these familiar faces boldt felt an immediate sense of relief no matter how much he respected the other agencies assisting him nothing felt quite as good as seeing family again uli took the first seat it faced the front window the bus bounced over broken roads and sagged through dips and rounded corners clumsily cutting them a little too tight as it slowed to the third stop boldt looked out the window and felt a rush of heat up his spine there were two people waiting for this bus one of them was digger shupe a retired major crimes detective he would recognize at least half the faces on this bus the other man boldt did not recognize and there was no move toward the left ear he carried a pair of grocery bags in his arms the doors opened and digger shupe climbed aboard the driver shot boldt one quick intense look and then averted his own face so that shupe would not recognize him an electricity sparked inside the bus the two new passengers paid and as shupe looked up and saw boldt he said well ill be damned but the driver hit the gas the brake and the gas again and sent the two newcomers sailing danny levin feigned an attempt to help digger shupe to his feet and in the process bent and pressed his lips close to the mans ear and boldt saw him say something shupes head nodded and when he climbed to his feet and collected himself he walked to the rear of the bus ever the professional and took his seat the bus driver apologized profusely especially to the man who had spilled his groceries the groceries were gathered up and this man took a seat by bobbie gaynes the bus set off two stops later boldt saw lamoia waiting in the shelter and again felt a sense of relief to see one of his own people there was a push to the back as several of the agents selected this stop to disembark lamoia paid walked right up to the suspect and sat down next to her boldt two seats back felt his stomach roll only lamoia would hit on a suspect finally some nice weather lamoia said to her she offered him a weak smile of course summers are the best anyway he said no reply you do any windsurfing he asked her she shook her head but smiled a little at the attention he gave her terrific sport he told her better on the lakes because theyre not as cold spend any time on the lakes do you she looked ahead paying him no mind do you ride he asked the jacket is that a fashion statement or do you ride a sportster a harley i cant believe this you ride a harley boldt turned to the window and smiled to himself they passed another stop the driver swooping in but not stopping cornelia uli peered out the window reached up and signaled the driver with the obnoxious electronic call again boldt felt the tension inside the bus despite the passive faces and the casual expressions one hundred yards to go this your stop lamoia asked indicating by body language that he could get out of her way yeah thanks lamoia stood the drivers eyes caught boldt in the rearview mirror he gave a faint nod gripped the stainless steel bar tightly and reached in for his weapon the bus slowed toward the stop then pulled a power turn to the left and sent cornelia uli hard up against the window and wall lamoia reacting with the reflexes of a cat planted his shield practically on her nose spun her around violently and pinned her shouting seattle police you are under arrest do not move dont do it he added driving his knee into the small of her back to hold her steady the bus pulled off into a vacant lot cornelia uli screamed for help and glanced over her shoulder only to be faced with the sight of a halfdozen handguns trained onto her some of the agents were shielded by the seats some standing and fully exposed a set of handcuffs clicked onto her wrist you fuckhead she shouted at lamoia wiggling to break free the purse boldt shouted an agent dropped to her knees and scouted under the seat the purse boldt repeated worried now the evidence the money the cash card he saw lamoia still holding the suspect looking everywhere for the allimportant purse two others now searched the floor of the bus one came up slowly met eyes with boldt and hoisted it in the air the purse a cheer went up spontaneously boldt shouted out loudly drive this thing downtown lamoia added and watch the goddamn brakes thirtyfive deputy prosecuting attorney penny smyth was on her third cup of coffee she winced every time she sipped the police brew but took it as medicine against the hour of am on the other side of the oneway glass a handcuffed cornelia uli sat at the boxs cigarettemarred table between the no smoking sign and the ashtray the suspect looked restless and agitated looking at her daphne said shes going to talk this one you both know the rules smyth said i dont have to tell you the rules and im sure as hell not coming in there with you or you might have to observe them the one area in which police were allowed a significant amount of latitude was in the interrogation of suspects the interrogating officer could blatantly lie and make as many false promises as he or she wished so long as the suspect kept talking silence and time were a suspects only real defense in the opening twentyfour hours of confinement a suspect could demand a courtappointed attorney but the officer did not have to deliver that attorney for as long as the suspect continued to communicate this being an arresting officers only clear opportunity to quickly clear a case many detectives had perfected the interrogation promoting it to an art form as a team daphne matthews and lou boldt were among the best and they were known on the fifth floor as sweet and sour smyth explained she has a long pink sheet which at twentyone speaks volumes convictions on gang activity drugs check kiting arrests but no charges on a handful of others including seconddegree murder she has seen a lot of us id keep that in mind weve got her cold on this extortion and with the connection to the threats and the murders maybe on an accessory charge if she doesnt talk she may be going away forever thats your carrot and whip the box smelled of human fear they could wash it even repaint it but within a week it smelled the same like an old worndown railroad terminal it was the end of the line the last stop for many who entered these walls this was their last time in civilian clothes for years to come the more experiencedthe guiltyknew this no matter his anger at what crime a suspect had committed boldt rarely entered this place without pity lurking somewhere in his heart he had to wonder what events in peoples lives had combined to deposit them here in this cheerless vapid dreary space where a bulldog of an overworked public servant went to work on them like a butcher with a sharp knife she might have been pretty once he thought but the streets had aged her prematurely drying her skin and creasing her eyes and placing torment and fear inside so that it bubbled out in a twitchy nervousness that kept boldt on edge daphne pulled up a chair boldt remained standing sweet and sour got down to business daphne stared at the young woman boldt paced the tight room in long heavy strides hands clasped behind his back neither spoke they waited out their suspect who finally said i want an attorney an attorney he asked to daphne he said she wants an attorney ill make a note of that now you want your attorney now boldt asked i just said so are you sure thats what you want because i was about to give you a chance to skate this whole mess youre in and if you insist that i get you an attorney well then hey thats all she wrote an attorney is yours and ill see you in court on the other hand if you keep you wits about you ms cornelia uli i might turn out to be your knight in shining armor fat chance she called me fat you look all right to me daphne said what youre a comedy team i want an attorney and we will assign you one cornelia its taken care of to daphne boldt said you wrote it down right its right here she informed him pointing to her stenographers pad its right there boldt told the suspect its taken care of bullshit he slapped the table with an incredible force uli jumped back daphne did not flinch listen to me he bellowed i am your last chance effecting a noticeable calm he said you play or you pay its that simple you know what weve got you on do you know what we intend to charge you with to daphne he said go ahead tell her boldt checked his watch twothirty he could not remember ever feeling this tired any minute lamoia should have the preliminary results of the search of ulis loft apartment boldt had been present when a swat team had kicked the placehoping for caulfieldbut he had left the detail work for the id unit and lamoia daphne read an incredible list of charges including extortion and concluding with firstdegree murder when this final charge was read ulis eyes flashed darkly between them and she said thats bullshit she doesnt know boldt told daphne were supposed to believe that this woman is some innocent runner some accomplice when in fact we know it was her all along to uli he said the account number is listed in one of the threats young lady that is a direct connection to you and these threats to you and the poisoning deaths of ten individuals ten and believe me if youre thinking you will somehow get life instead of lethal injection you have not been paying attention to whats been going on out at walla walla this state is in the killing mood ms uli and crimes like this are exactly the cases that im talking about on the other hand daphne said before uli could issue the prerequisite string of denials if you have something to tell us your cooperation might keep you off death row it might let you walk out of here boldt said shes not that smart daphne told him girls like this always think they know better than us and to uli which is bizarre to me since we spend all of our time putting people like you away and people like you spend all of their time behind bars isnt that strange i want an attorney daphne said to boldt i told you shes not that smart she cant even remember that i already made a note of that boldt said seriously you can probably sell sex to the guards for cigarettes i hear that oral sex is worth a pack the real thing a carton at least for a couple of years you can you have a nice body youre young but others come along younger than you and then it gets tough in there because the guards are through with you we try to police that you know we dont like it but its the prisoners who keep it going they get a little desperate in there women liking other women are you into that stuff shes into it all daphne said fuck you she understands the topic boldt said definitely daphne replied boldt looked at his watch again im tired how bout you he asked daphne exhausted shes not going to cooperate i think youre right who says asked cornelia uli boldt told her youre not exactly being forthcoming here cornelia can i stand up the suspect asked please boldt said i think better on my feet she said by all means think better boldt encouraged she wandered the small room for a few minutes and after a short time boldt observed that daphne was tracking her with an increased intensity and interest confusion knitted the psychologists brow and she squinted saying suddenly to the suspect put your arms over your head again like you just had them uli stopped walking the floor clasp your hands over your head uli looked to boldt for support the sergeant said do as she asks uli obliged lifting her arms and lacing her fingers on the top of her head whats going on she had small high breasts that disappeared when she lifted her arms she was thinner than boldt had first judged her and her neck was long and elegant turn around daphne instructed she did so asking come on whats going on turn around daphne was out of her chair now who gave you that atm card facing the wall the suspect said it was sent to me in the mail daphne sounded angry no it wasnt you applied for it by mail you opened an account daphne produced the scanned copy of the account application provided by lucille guillard a handwriting expert will connect you to this application were confident of that but who put you up to it she began to lower her arms keep them that way turn back around to boldt she said do you see it he wanted to support her but she had lost him he looked at her inquisitively who told you to open that account daphne asked uli was looking down at the document on the table blankfaced her hands still held on her head i and dont hand me a crock of shit uli because im running out of patience with you sweet and sour they never really knew who would play which role sometimes they planned it out in advance who would befriend the suspect who would lean sometimes it evolved and they found their roles as the interrogation wore on i cant say uli said boldt felt a spike of heat rush up his spine by these words uli had just admitted her culpability in the crimes they interrogated her for another fortyfive minutes talking in circles sometime after three they elected to send her down to lockup they would try again the next morning in the elevator on their way to the garage boldt asked her what was the choreography about a worried look about her daphne answered carefully its not that i understand it lou but ive seen that woman before thirtysix monday morning boldt was physically awake at eight but mentally he could not find his bearings he drank a pot of tea and stuffed himself into his car he turned on komo news on his way downtown the plan was to meet daphne and continue with the uli interrogation but as the lead story for the morning news was read boldt nearly caused an accident he involuntarily jerked the wheel forcing another car to make a quick lane change that evolved into a skidding uturn and left boldts chevy sandwiched diagonally in a parallel parking spot the cars tail was protruding into the morning rush he had expected the strikerdanielson shooting to be near the top if not the lead itself but instead the local report began with a pleasant female voice that announced an unexpected development in which adler foods had been ordered by the fda in conjunction with the cdc to recall every retail product line from all grocery shelves by noon this day the story suggested that an investigation had begun into the companys role in the alleged e coli contamination and in recent poisonings that had claimed several lives it had yet to be confirmed the listener was told but sources close to the investigation also claimed that a major food producttampering and extortion scheme had held adler foods paralyzed for nearly three weeks and that local authorities as recently as yesterday had summoned the help and assistance of the fbi captain rankin and the bureaucrats had scored again knowingly or not they had just challenged harry caulfield to russian roulette the pulling of the products the mention of the fbiall forced caulfields hand he had come to know his adversary this reckless decision on the part of captain rankin drew detective and suspect closer they shared a disgust at this decision boldt knew without checking that there would be a fax awaiting him when he reached his office in a strange way he was glad he was right daphne awakened late having spent the night with owen adler feeling frustrated and dirty from the interrogation she had shed her clothes and taken a moonlit swim then joined owen in his bed where she fell into a deep sleep he had sneaked out of bed and showered and shaved and as he was changing she came awake we have the estate under surveillance otherwise i wouldnt have come i know he said im glad you did i havent slept that well in weeks ive missed you he said so has corky he finished buttoning his shirt she pushed the pillow back and sat up in bed the sheet down around her waist and felt wonderful that she could be partially naked here without the sensation of violation she felt none of what she had been experiencing in her houseboat she decided not to voice her suspicions of fowler not yet daddy it was corky coming down the hall adler did not want his daughter connecting daphne to his bed daphne knew this and she sprinted out of bed for the bathroom making it only to his walkin closet before being forced to hide she felt like a teenager hiding from a parent and she began to laugh at this notioncorky as owens parent not the oppositeand she gagged herself with the sleeve of a sport coat to keep from being heard your fax machine is going his daughter reported ill be right there owen hesitated before saying honey whys daffy in your closet kids daphnes mind raced she called out im wrapping your birthday present corky you are no peeking she looked through the racks of clothes for a robe to put on and resorted to one of his mantailored shirts are you coming sailing maybe afterward she said i cant promise youll miss monty the clown daffys extremely busy honey but shes going to try and make it to the party after what kind of present she called out no peeking daphne repeated pulling on a pair of his underwear just in case she started laughing again because the underwear would need a belt to stay on she kicked them off meet you in the kitchen adler said okay said the child disappointed adler rounded the corner of the walkin he said dont even try for the party i completely understand and so will peaches but corky would not understand and daphne knew this better than her own father ill catch up to you later save me some cake and ice cream she waited a moment and reminded the fax d day for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee for the better part of the last thirty minutes boldts attention had been divided between this fax and the situation room wall where eleven pieces of artwork printed by grambling printers were thumbtacked all the artwork contained the three primary colorsred yellow and blueand at least one foilcopper silver or gold the products were as diverse as enchiladas and frozen yogurt and just looking at them worried boldts fragile stomach it was nine oclock in the morning and lamoia and gaynes were home recovering from the atm surveillance following the advice of dr richard clements boldt had divided his team freddie guccianno remained in charge of tracking down any truck farmer whose vehicle bore these same three colors in the evening hours freddie worked with a wall map planning out the next days coverage strategy although dozens of truck farmers had been questioned harry caulfield remained at large shoswitz was on the phone he seemed always to be on the phone a uniform patrolman entered and crossed the room and handed guccianno an enormous ball of aluminum foil that contained a sticky roll the size of a tree stump you get my receipt guccianno asked the patrolman produced the receipt and guccianno placed it in his top pocket two women detectives on loan from sex crimes were sorting through the companies represented on the wall by product and affiliation looking for a link to adler foods daphne entered and walked up to the wall stared at all the products thumbtacked there and said to the sex crimes detectives lets talk this stuff up she stood there looking around the room no one seemed to have heard her lou i dont see what good talking is going to do which is why im the psychologist and youre the detective guccianno oohed seizing the opportunity to tease boldt feisty boldt told her frightened she answered honestly okay so lets talk he studied the board we got eleven companies nine of them have vehicle fleets bearing the company colors five of those companies utilize truck fleets so we stay with those five companies for the time being she agreed he pointed to the center row of artwork top to bottom noodles frozen seafood ice cream jams and berries smoked seafood daphne asked the two women to read off some of the products keep in mind she told boldt that caulfield claims to be able to kill a hundred or more people with whatever product or method hes chosen that has to limit the field youre suggesting he intends to do this all in a single day before we have a chance to issue a recall clements is suggesting so yes boldt knew that she only said this to attempt to give it more weight he then turned to one of the other detectives and said denise of those five who has the highest product velocity boldt and daphne met eyes while denise checked through the papers he acknowledged with a slight nod that daphnes discussion did in fact seem to be clearing some of the cobwebs and if she had not been so frightened she might have smiled as a way of showing her thanks denise said in dollar amounts its pretty much a tie between chalmers microwavable fish dinners and the montclair icecream line but in terms of sheer product volume the montclair icecream products far outnumber the dinners daphne wandered over to denise and borrowed her paperwork on montclair for a moment boldt knew her well enough to ask what is it thats a familiar name to me she looked over the paperwork denise checking more records advised boldt they also have the largest number of trucksby farof anyone were looking at boldt felt the bloodhound in him stir he stood and began removing the other pieces of artwork leaving montclair in the center by itself studying it he asked daphne familiar how its probably a stretch she said not answering him daphne flipped through the pages of fax paper detailing the montclair products she came across a large picture of a clown with the words monty the clown written beneath it her chest grew tight and her voice turned to gravel then again maybe not that comment drew boldts attention to him she seemed to be in a trance daffy monty the clown she repeated holding up the faxs blackandwhite artwork for him its an icecream bar with a gimmick the kids love it she quoted what owen had told her when he warned her to expect an invitation to corkys birthday party the birthday party was today icecream bar boldt said in a voice filled with concern he repeated it several times and began madly digging through the files stacked high on the table in front of him an icecream bar he repeated lou she called out her voice stronger her mind ruling out coincidence guccianno raised his head sensing the tension in both of them its here somewhere boldt mumbled he found it inside the file second from the bottom got it he hollered rattling gucciannos nerves boldt tore into the phone book and found the phone number for the broadway foodland lee hyundai was paged and boldt waited impatiently finally looking up for the first time and seeing several pair of eyes trained on him he held up the receipt and reminded those in the room four items purchased by a man in a greatcoat at express checkout lane a man identified by holly macnamara as harry caulfield three of the items on here were adler productscandy barsand we lost those boys in the tree house and after that i never went back to the receipt focusing on the candy bars instead he recalled the haunting words of dr richard clements he will try to deceive you the muzak stopped and the voice of lee hyundai came on the line reading the receipt boldt asked how much do you charge for a single montclair icecream bar his finger pointed to the receipt where it was written after a long pause during which boldt heard the clicking of a keyboard lee hyundai reported that would be one dollar sixtysix cents boldt hung up the phone and hollered weve got a match guccianno came out of his chair daphne turned to boldt and announced with difficulty no one may believe this but i know what hes planning to do and i know where to find him are there bells on these trucks dr richard clements was one of the eleven law enforcement personnel now assembled in the emergency meeting under way in the situation room department of motor vehicle records had been checked four times no vehicles were registered to a harry or a harold or an h caulfield of the four caulfields in the listings two were senior citizens and two others in their late fifties a be on lookout had been issued for all montymobiles with orders to approach with caution with urging from the prosecuting attorneys office the companys legal counsel had agreed to open their employment records to the police effective immediately although they could provide the general areas their trucks covered there was no direct communication with the trucks and the specific routes were left up to the drivers the bottom line was not good the icecream trucks would remain in circulation until late afternoon the be on lookout seemed the only way to catch him dr brian mann had stated emphatically over the phone that strychnine was the perfect poison of choice for a frozen food cholera wouldnt survive in that environment he had added clements repeated are there bells on these trucks there were three or four conversations going at once and only by raising his voice in this manner did he draw the attention of those gathered bells on montymobiles shoswitz said who knows yes answered one of the fbi men at least there are on good humor trucks back east well someone find out clements ordered he held up the fax for boldt to read again for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee it tolls for thee you see i am right about our friend he would like for us to stop him if we can with our limited combined intelligence and take him at his word the bell tolls for mr adler gentlemen how can he be certain mr adlers daughter is a fan of monty the clown he checked with daphne who nodded she had remained sullen and silent for much of this not understanding howwhen she was so certain of caulfields whereaboutsthat these oafs could call a meeting boldt could see the wait was destroying her and adlers daughter has a party scheduled with an appearance by monty the clown which means a disguise shoswitz said precisely agreed clements and we are assuming he has his own truck rather than is planning to commandeer onethis because of the paint samples found at longview agreed boldt said can we hurry this up daphne snapped impatiently clements glanced up at her easy does it matthews we understand your concern we just want to do this correctly methodically mr caulfield is a worthy adversarywe must not underestimate him she boiled crossing her arms defiantly but she held her tongue boldt reminded we have the registration tags for all the legitimate montymobiles one of which is expected at this sailing clubthe party clements reminded but we must be able to identify his truck that is imperative bobbie gaynes offered it would be easier to repaint an old truck than to make original art on one an auction list clements snapped his fingers at gaynes get on it they must get rid of their older trucks gaynes ran from the room for the next twenty minutes they discussed the logistics of attempting to prepare for caulfield at the sailing party gaynes burst into the room and placed a fax down in front of boldt it listed the sixteen montclair icecream trucks that had been placed on the auction block in the last five months his names not here boldt moaned his hopes shattered i suggest you try the name meriweather clements directed in that allknowing tone of his boldt ran a finger down the list and hit the name immediately got it he announced he whistled loudly the door to the room swung open and a uniform blurred to him at a run he circled the name and handed the man the sheet dmv title and registration go what boldt asked catching the expression of the psychiatrist whose eyes immediately began to track back and forth in their sockets he pointed to penny smyth explain the situation the prosecuting attorney said i dont know how to put this quickly boldt encouraged watching the door for the return of the patrolman none of us wants to see caulfield duck these charges what shoswitz challenged she explained if you stop him now you have a truck with poisoned icecream inside you have intent certainly as she continued talking clements waved his pen high in the air and conducted stabbing and punctuating her words he was smiling thinly but intent is all you havewe have some good circumstantial evidence certainly some good motivation that our expert psychiatrist can use to our advantage i dont deny any of this what is this shit shoswitz asked clements eyes closed answered for her this is the law he opened his eyes now sat forward and placed down the pen shes right of course its her job to be right about these things shoswitz looked back at smyth who said we need to witness the actual passing of a poisoned item to an individual if were to build any kind of case to carry a life sentence or greater im not saying that what we have isnt good but it is not enough im sorry to saynot if you want this man on death row you take him as is and well put him away for ten or twenty with a good jury maybe twice that but connecting him to these other deaths wont be nearly as easy as pinning down an attempted murderdelivery of a fatal substance there are some holes in the narco laws we may be able to squeeze him into and put him away for mandatory life which is what i think we all want she looked at boldt with sad eyes she did not like this any more than the rest of them boldt said so we sting him she nodded checking the clock daphne reminded urgently less than forty minutes the patrolman charged through the door waving a sheet of computer paper weve got the registration he announced a light breeze blew out of the west filling the nine white sails beautifully and causing each boat to heel slightly boldt was wearing a set of dirty dungaree coveralls leaning on a shovel where lamoia used a pickax to dig a hole leading nowhere they worked at the junction of an asphalt path and the parking lot that connected the dock with the parked cars boldt wore a fleshcolored earphone with an attached wire that led down between his collar and his neck a hidden lavalier microphone was clipped below the coveralls second button he listened to the running monologue from the task forces dispatcher by pretending to scratch his chest boldt could depress a button allowing him to transmit through the microphone the two men cleaning the pool were task force so were all of a team of fourtwo men and two women including daphne matthewswho were in the act of putting the finishing touches on the party the hired caterer and her people were being kept inside the clubhouse and out of sight straddling the clubhouse chimney a roll of tar paper at his side an fbi sharpshooter pretended to be making repairs hidden inside the roll of tar paper a semiautomatic with laser scope awaited him this man was capable of a hardtarget kill at three hundred yards and he had the blue ribbons to prove it at the moment he had sore ankles as well there was a party of three having cocktails in the cockpit of a twentyonefoot ketch pulled up to the fuel dock all were task force all expert shots the cocktails were ice tea in a bourbon bottle there was a guy having engine trouble and another helping himboth bent under the hood of a chevy where a pair of handguns remained within easy reach hidden inside the clubhouse were six special forces agents and in the bathhouse six more twentyfour cops and agents in all eight on radios the dispatcher nimbly maintained constant communications with all elements continually updating and informing and ready to relay the latest input in the distance boldt heard the approach of the radio station chopper as it reported on traffic on the floating bridge the birdman was riding with this pilot and reporting on a separate frequency to dispatch this was a man who could spot a fox in a thicket from a thousand feet up if caulfields refrigerated truck was in the area the birdman would find it his efforts were aided by fourteen unmarked cars casually patrolling the seventeen streets that fed the two roadways that fed the dirt road at the end of which was this clubhouse phone line work was being conducted on these two feeder roads by fbi agents manned with communications and firearms the doortodoor salesman lugging his naugahyde box from his backseat to the front door of every house on the approach street was in fact detective guccianno he wasnt selling anything he was informing all residents to get their kids into the house lock their doors and await an allclear he was also showing each a photo of caulfield in case the man had been staking out the neighborhood prior to today dont worry so much sarge lamoia said nonchalantly digging the hole a little deeper static spit in boldts ear the sailboats are about five minutes out and closing dispatch reported alpha is four minutes eta that was adler pone and ptwo make your move please parentsone parentstwo a series bmw and a mercedes sedan both repossessed in drug convictions turned onto the final approach road passing beneath the overhead phone line repair crew and pulling into the clubhouse parking lotmakebelieve parents about to join their children at the party for the last thirty minutes police communications had busily sought out parents of the mostly girls in the sailing party of the eighteen kids the parents of eleven had been contacted and undercover police were to take their places the whereabouts of the remaining seven were unknown the helicopter displaying the station call letters swooped low overhead and banked as if to return for another pass over the floating bridge boldt glanced up on the other side of the mirrored plastic bubble the birdman was scrutinizing the landscape through his binoculars the birdman who could count eyelashes on a flea several more cars arrivedsome police some not boldt felt a stream of sweat trickle down his side civilians in the mix he wished there had been a way to prevent that you okay he asked lamoia lamoia rested the pickax looked up at his sergeant and nodded gravely digging holes is shitty work youve got your line all memorized im ready sarge relax boldt heard the barking of the dogs but did not see them yet there were three scheduled all german shepherds diana who ran the k squad and trained the dogs was dressed in jeans and a bob dylan tshirt out for an afternoon stroll down to watch the boats come in down to wreak some havoc another actor in a play so hastily written in boldts right ear the dispatchers voice said plainly we have hard contact repeat hard contact hold on boldt whispered hotly to lamoia who stopped midswing and set down the tool boldt listened and reported birdmans spotted a gray roof of a decentsize truck parked in a stand of trees about a quartermile from here he got here early lamoia said just as clements said he would i bet clements was a boy scout he added i always hated boy scouts now girl scouts was another story he swung the pickax again a nervous lamoia was a joke machine boldt longed for a switch lamoia said on second thought i could get to like this work i kinda miss this physical stuff cut the chatter boldt said the chopper pulled up to a new elevation high over the bridge boldt assumed that from there the birdman could keep an eye on the truck responding to a question from shoswitz relayed through dispatch boldt spoke into the radio no drivebys nothing to rattle him copy he nodded and went back to leaning on his shovel boldt pressed his ear and reported to lamoia a second truck just entering the road hold it it has pulled off somethings wrong tires are out birdman has all four tires flat lamoia said he spiked the road boldt said he spiked the road and lamoia grinned for guessing right take out the competition lamoia said make sure the truck that was hired is a noshow the guy is smart sarge tell me about it you nervous lamoia asked his concentration fully on his work theres nothing quite like an operation you think but i never really recover its like putting too much postage on a letter you know you can never get it back he added your postman ever return any money to you he reminded boldt of lizs mother who tended to rattle on when she became nervous or anxious switching subjects randomly and somehow stringing them all together boldt checked the roof the sharpshooter had his hand inside the roll of tar paper one of the two pool cleaners was scrubbing the steps of the high dive making sure he had an elevated vantage point in case he had the only shot all cogs of the same wheel it rolled slowly toward harold caulfield boats are two minutes out dispatch reported into boldts ear then after a spit of static suspect vehicle is rolling calmly he stated all stations suspect is rolling good luck everyone spd dispatchers rarely added such editorials but boldt was glad to have it the dispatcher traced the route of caulfields montymobile as it passed under the first of the phone crews we have confirmation of vehicle registration were on boldt told lamoia show time said the detective dont forget to smile boldt heard the first sailboat thump against the float and then the shrieks of excited childish laughter one of the parents passed by on the way down the dock but rubbernecked the two cops and boldt realized she was looking at lamoias cowboy boots and probably wondering what a guy wearing a gorgeous pair of ostrich boots was doing digging a hole at her club but she didnt say anything she ran her hand along the rail though she walked more slowly apprehensively and looked back one more time her face still caught in curiosity too many civilians boldt thought tempted to abort tempted to let it be penny smyths problem arrest now figure out the charges later dont do it sarge lamoia said reading his thoughts weve got this bastard five minutes and its all over the inevitable question came into his ear it was the voice of phil shoswitz decision time hes thirty seconds out hesitation as he awaited boldts signal to arrest now or play it out lamoia stared at him the anxious mother far down the dock reached the arriving boats and grabbed hold of a line tossed to her other parents waited in the party area boldt caught daphnes eye where he saw both worry and concern yesbut determination as well boldt considered a sentence of twenty yearsout in six with good behavior lamoia serious now and sensing boldts struggle looked into the mans eyes and said slater lowry in the distance the jingle of cheap bells filled the air boldt depressed the radio button hidden at his chest go he said dispatch said into his ear all stations green light he repeated this and then added suspect vehicle has arrived onsite boldt glanced up to check the sharpshooter the man had changed positions and now hid behind the chimney where it would be easier to steady a rifle barrel it occurred to boldt that in the next few minutes they might kill a manmight get several more killed if they were not careful for what to appease the legal process the clanging bells grew louder followed by the sound of a rough motor adler shouted not to run on the docks as a group of seven children sprinted toward boldt and lamoia boldt recognized corky from daphnes description third back in the pack brighteyed and innocent after today regardless of the outcome her life would be changed in and of itself a crime against persons the icecream truck bells clanging noisily came to a stop not fifteen yards from boldt the sergeant swung his head casually the driver wore a clowns face a bulb nose and a yellow wig he was dressed in a baggy jumpsuit of red yellow and blue he reached to his mouth withdrew a toothpick from his lips and tossed at the ashtray for boldt this confirmed it it was harry caulfield boldt felt hotter than just moments earlier body chemicals he could not allow himself to stare and so he looked back at the black hole that lamoia had dug and the similarity to a childs grave was impossible to mistake he took his first and only stab with the shovel and spilled a mound of dirt back into the hole like a widow at a funeral he touched his breast pocket lamoia looking on nervously and said for the benefit of the microphone suspect confirmed he heard the dispatcher repeating this as he plucked the earpiece from his ear and stuffed it down inside his collar out of sightout of contact now isolated the plan called for he and lamoia to make the front of the lineto beat the kids to the truck and hence maintain their position closer to the parking lot than to the dock or the party area boldt took two steps toward the icecream truck and casually shouted over his shoulder loudly enough for the driver to hear what kind you want get me an orange and vanilla lamoia answered loudly delivering his one line just as he had been told boldt quickened his step sensing the approaching children coming up on him rapidly from behind everything felt sharp and crisp and suddenly the sunlight seemed overpoweringblindingly bright to his left the cop on the high dive adjusted his position to his right high on the ridge of the roof the sharpshooter could no longer be seen but boldt could imagine the black eye of the barrel looking down on him if boldt pressed the switch hidden on his chest and uttered the words take him then caulfield was a dead manhis sentence decided right here and now the power of that possibility did not escape him he was judge jury and executioner ironically arrest was all that could save the man now in this moment of consideration he moved too slowly two of the frantic children scampered past him and cut in line beating him to the icecream truck this was not the way they had planned it and though his fallback position had been to take caulfield before any sale of ice cream that too was now no simple matter given the two childrenhostageseasily within his reach the safety release was diana and her three shepherds boldt glanced over at her seeing she was in position just behind the icecream truck kneeling and talking to her dogs stalling boldt could not make a play for caulfield until these two kids were out of the way the first child in line ordered a big dipper with nuts and caulfield looking uncomfortable and acting slightly awkward moved to the side of the truck and checked two of the small doors before coming out with the order none with nuts he said handing the girl the ice cream im all out she took it anyway and immediately handed caulfield two dollar bills boldt recognized fear as it darkened the suspects eyes with all this preparation he had neglected to bring change he stuttered ahhi glanced into boldts eyes and hurried back into the truck he came out with change and handed the girl some coins he looked into boldts eyes againcalmlyand boldt thought that caulfield somehow knew the second child in line ordered a red barfrozen fruit juice on a stickand it occurred to boldt that as he stood here waiting in line every montclair frozen icecream product in a threestate region was being pulled from the shelvesevery truck emptied and the product destroyed if caulfield had laid bigger plans hopefully they had shut these down change the man was asking boldt any change caulfield repeated boldt had been caught up in thought any quarters the coveralls allowed a snapped slit to access the pants he wore underneath and boldt reached into his pocket and found five quarters and several dimes he extended his open palm to caulfield who thanked him and picked his way through a dollar in change exchanging it for a dollar bill he thanked me i just helped him boldt thought he stuffed caulfields dollar back into his pants but it required of him an amazing amount of concentration and effort for so simple a task the girl with the red bar slipped out of line and lou boldt stood facing harry caulfield help you the clown asked an orange one with vanilla and a big dipper please he was saying please to a murderer it seemed inconceivable to him caulfield checked two doors the white vapor of the dry ice escaped briefly concealing him inside a cloud an orangeup and a big dipper he confirmed thats right boldt heard the tearing of paper the two kids were not waiting they were ripping into their treats he glanced hotly at diana and she released the trained dogs who immediately bounded across the pavement and leapt at the girls knocking them down and stealing their icecream bars the panicked screams and piercing cries of the two girls cut boldt to his core diana plunged into the fray confirming that the ice creams were not in their possession and then called off her dogs making apologies she reprimanded both dogs severely all the while petting thema trainers game as if on cue daphne and another of the fake caterers rushed to help the girls his backup was in place boldt pretending to be absorbed in the drama kept one eye cautiously on caulfield who handled the disturbance quite well and then caulfields head snapped and boldt followed his line of sight inexplicably the third of the shepherds was gobbling down one of the ice creams it had sneaked in behind its trainer as she collared and controlled the other two dogs seeing this caulfield seemed to panic boldt tried to catch dianas eye but it was too late snap snapthe big dipper was gone twoninety caulfield said boldt had not thought this out had not figured on having to hold the two ice creams in one hand while searching for money in his pocket this left him with no hand free for his weapon as he rummaged back into his pocket and found several dollars corky adler jumped line in front of him and demanded a snofoam fudge bar at this same moment owen adler right behind his daughter looked first into boldts face then daphnes and actually staggered as he realized what he had walked into he straightened himself up and in a moment of quick thinking said corky lets wait for the cake at the sight of adler harry caulfield was unable to move the air charged with hatred corky oblivious to it said to the clown its my birthday i can do what i want right monty boldt handed caulfield the money which snapped the mans momentary lapse if he could just get corky out from in front of him it was over his hand free of the money was now touching the stock of the handgun move corky better listen to your father boldt said trying to nudge her stop it she said precociously holding her ground move he tried again quit it all out of snofoam caulfield apologized to the girl focusing on her briefly moving to the freezer door closest to him but how bout a big dipper he asked monty thought the birthday girl loved big dippers adler stammered daphne stepped forward alongside boldt a face of cold stone she took corkys left arm listen to your father corky you made it a delighted corky said oh please oh please daffy the other kids pressed in against boldt eager to be next in line it was too crowded it was all wrong they could not take caulfield with corky where she was and they could not allow this man to sell anything more caulfield was distracted and boldt followed to see one of the shepherds whining and circling erratically diana consoling him boldt understood then that all of the ice cream was poisoned not just selected pieces intended for adler or his daughter another check of dianas charge confirmed it the dog stumbled and went down onto its front legs in a praying position he collapsed twice and pulled clumsily back to his feet wanting to perform for his trainer but it was no usehe was dying boldt turned in time to see caulfield leaning toward corky with the big dipper the little girl accepted the icecream cone and tore at the wrapper no corky adler exclaimed but not in the voice of a father worried about spoiling an appetite caulfield reacted instantly by reaching out for corkywanting a hostage motherfucker caulfield muttered looking at adler boldt went for his gun but it hung up in the coveralls caulfield took hold of the child daphnes purse came at his face like a wrecking ball and as it connected she yanked corky away threw her down onto the pavement and covered her the children behind boldt screamed boldt charged the man caulfield went up hard against the side of the truck and boldt felt a knee implode into his gut the wind knocked out of him his head swirled as he heard more screams from behind himscreams of childrenand the unmistakable sound of weapons being drawn from holsters as the voice of john lamoia hollered hold your fire boldt was going down to the pavement in slow motion as lamoia appeared in his peripheral vision diving through the air he saw sheriff turner bramms shotgun then it had been sawed off the metal a fresh silver on the end of the barrels and must have come from inside one of the freezers down he heard shouted in the midst of the pandemonium drop it came a stern voice from behind lamoia dove at owen adler and carried him down hard to the pavement boldt still falling toward the pavement in an indescribable slow motion touched the chest of the coveralls and said take him he heard a dull poplike hands clapping togetherand the side of the truck sprayed with caulfields blood it was a shoulder shot and though caulfields eyes rocked in his sockets and seemed to acknowledge the hit the sawedoff never faltered for a moment mechanically he pumped the weapon boldt in midair kicked out hard and caught the toe of his shoe under caulfields kneecap caulfield twisted and screamed the sawedoff blew the mirror off the truck and sprayed the front windshield into powder two of boldts people swarmed on top of caulfield boldts head slammed into the pavement and the lights went out he heard the words paramedics hes hit get these kids out of here coming back boldt pulled himself up to sitting caulfield was buried under a pile of police a pair of handcuffs sparkled in the afternoon sun as they disappeared into that pile the miranda was being spoken a moment later the pile parted slightly revealing a clown without his nose and wigjust bright red cheeks and eyes filled with hatred his shoulder was bleeding badly daphne was hugging corky and stroking her hair boldt could not see lamoia or adler but he did see diana she was weeping her shepherd down and still she held to it as a mother to a child boldts heart tore in two too close too big a risk and yet the joy of triumph as well the tim man was in handcuffs his glassy eyes fixed rigidly on a point beyond boldt fixed on a man whose voice rose above all others as he called out joyously for his daughter thirtyseven while surgeons at harborview medical clinic stitched up caulfields left shoulder boldt and six others went through several hours of debriefing the scientific identification divisions secondfloor lab under the direction of bernie lofgrin began testing each and every one of the sixtyone icecream products recovered from the freezer van despite the fatigue of everyone involved there was an ebullient bounce in the step of all those who walked the fifth floor a press conference scheduled so that footage could be included in the eleven oclock news was held in a conference room at the westin with over eighty journalists and news crew personnel in attendance captain rankin the police chief and the mayor fielded questions assuring the public that this terrible man had been apprehended that a nightmare of carnage had been avoided and that seattles supermarkets were safe once again bobbie gaynes john lamoia freddie guccianno and dozens of others involved in the incident were given a sixhour break to go home and sleep some of them took it some did not the emergency surgery took fortyfive minutes finishing up a few minutes before six oclock the chief surgeon allowed boldt and one other detective to interrogate the suspect if the interrogation was kept to thirty minutes or less boldt pressed for and won a concession that the interrogation could involve three possibly four people a second more involved session was tentatively approved for the next morning although caulfield had already waived his right to an attorney by morning a public defender would be assigned and the case would fall into the hands of the attorneys with black holes everything was done to the letter at tenthirty that night armed with a cassette tape recorder and a large tea boldt stood outside caulfields hospital room alongside two spd patrolmen who stood guard they were accompanied by dr richard clements and deputy prosecuting attorney penny smyth boldt wanted nothing less than a full confession they had attempted murder they had enough circumstantial evidence to fill a courthouse but a confession would finish things nicely clements wanted a peek into that mind smyth wanted to make sure they conducted the interrogation properly before we go in clements said stopping them his world has ended and he knows it he continues to blame adlernot us you will findfor everything and that is extremely important because it offers us a way to the truth he will surrender the truth without meaning to the more he tries to hide it the more we can get from him i see your confusion you will understand as we proceed he pushed open the door and they entered the room caulfield was awake lying in bed his head rocked up on a pillow his eyes alert and sparking darkly with anger the room stripped down to the bare necessities smelled of alcohol and disinfectant the surgery had involved only local anesthesia which meant medication would not interfere with or negate the results of the interrogation boldt switched on the tape recorder and spoke clearly listing the location the time of day and those present caulfields pewtergray eyes ran over them the man looked so normal clements pulled up a chair beside the bed boldt and smyth remained standing ive got nothing to say caulfield informed them smyth said the difference to you should you cooperate may mean life imprisonment instead of the death penalty i want to hang caulfield said stunning both boldt and smyth clements smiled and said softly of course you do caulfield eyed him peculiarly clements said but not before clearing mark meriweathers good name hmm think about it you know about that we know about everything my boy we are very interested in mr meriweather caulfield looked at him curiously wondering how far he could trust the man bullshit he said meriweather was set up son dont call me that very well what would you like me to call you mr caulfield harold harry leave me alone if i leave you alone attorneys like our ms smyth here will get their hooks into you and that will be that youve been through this before harry you know what im talking about if you had wanted that you would not have waived your right to an attorney attorneys suck he said directly to smyth no attorneys lets talk about your hanging for a minute i want it over i understand but why so fast what about mark meriweather hes dead its over you loved him he was good to me they broke him they lied yes we know that caulfield sat forward slightly stopped by the pain of his wound but his neck remained craned forward clements said oh yes we know about it all they laced the birds they paid people off they placed the blame on mark meriweather he paused they made you kill the birds the pain on caulfields face cried out the last thing boldt wanted was to feel sorry for this monster that wasnt easy was it killing those birds caulfield shook his head slightly he seemed to have left the room you had never seen mr meriweather like that had you so much blood caulfield whispered he wasnt himself he changed yes killing the birds changed him didnt it he added changed you all caulfield nodded you loved those birds he nodded again we need your help harry if you help us we will help you sergeant boldt here knows all about what happened out at longview farms but we need to hear about this soup what you did to the soup the birds were not sick we know that and you blamed mr adler they lied about us what about the soup harry tell us about the soup they poisoned our birds i warned them they didnt listen he had a glazed look no longer directed at clements or boldt or smyth but somewhere on the ceiling or the back wall off on his own i thought the cholera would convince them you put the cholera in the soup he nodded boldt glanced over at the tape still running clements saw this and said i didnt hear you harry harry caulfield just stared at the wall we need your help harry i did it because they did it to us i did it to show them that they had better listen did what poisoned the soup boldt and clements met eyes there it wasand captured on tape caulfield attempted to sit up once again but was beaten by the pain he pleaded why didnt they believe me why did they let those people die excuse me smyth said she was pale and his lips were trembling she walked quietly to the door and left the room tell me about the money boldt said what are you talking about his eyes burned into boldt the extortion money the sergeant reminded but caulfields face went blank and boldt felt certain that this was no act youre out of your mind to clements he said all cops are out of their fucking minds are you out of your mind harry who is this guy he asked boldt to clements he said a shrink am i right how do you feel about these murders harry tell me about these murders ask owen adler no fault of mine tell me about the murders i didnt murder anyone yes you did harry you have murdered twelve people including two peace i didnt murder anyone and i dont know anything about any extortion money or whatever the hell it is you asked me he said to boldt clements scooted farther forward leaned in closely and whispered intimately tenderly were listening harry we want to hear whatever you want to tell us doesnt matter what caulfields eyes brimmed with tears the world has not treated you fairly have they son this time caulfield did not object to clementss using the term instead the patient shook his head and tears spilled down his cheeks clements said warmly but in a strangely eerie voice no one has listened have they i know what thats like son believe me i know they just never listen caulfield shook his head again you told them about what happened at longview and did they listen is that fair you told them about that drug chargeoh yes ive read the piece its a brilliant piece of writing son something to be proud of ive read it all caulfield groaned but no one ever listens do they they tell you to come back they tell you to go away they treat you like a child but they never listen do they he paused no one has ever listened like mark meriweather listened and they took mark away from you they ruined him didnt they the cry that came from the man might have been heard across several of the hospitals wings the patients mouth hung open and he wailed at the ceiling rocking his head on the pillow and dr richard clements threw his own head back closed his eyes and listened like an opera patron enjoying an inspired aria im listening clements shouted in the middle of one of these cries and it only encouraged the patient louder boldt glanced at the tape recorderno one was going to believe this he thought before the male nurses threw open the door clements had already raised his hand to stop them and wave them off boldt had not heard their approach were fine the doctor reported a little healthy release is all he said to the patient they heard you harry do you see were listening now we can hear you caulfield stopped and opened his tearstained eyes and boldt thought he was witnessing a souls final glimpse of sanity that harry caulfield had made a fateful journey but clements did not seem bothered in the least for the benefit of the troubled male nurses clements said to the patient were fine arent we son better now arent we to the nurses he said you see and he waved them off contemptuously a move he finished by sweeping off the lapels of his doublebreasted blazer now lets start at the beginning shall we son every action starts with a thought can you tell me please about the very first moment that you knew owen adler had to pay for his crimes the very first inspiration i have all the time in the world son all the time in the world clements looked over at boldt beaming a smile boldt was not certain who was crazier the money boldt repeated i dont know anything about any money caulfield repeated angrily for the second time boldt believed him he did not have all the time in the world he grabbed the tape recorder and headed straight to the office to have it transcribed boldt slept for fourteen hours awakening at two in the afternoon he ate a light meal called the office and fell back to sleep at eleven that night he found himself wide awake with a dozen thoughts colliding in his head he kissed his sleeping wife changed clothes and returned to the office deangelos squad was on rotation everyone congratulated him on the caulfield raid and on the confession treating him like a hero but boldt did not feel like a hero the extortionist was still at large he checked with lockup he checked with daphnebut could not find her cornelia uli had a public defender assigned to her she was in the system now with no evidential connection yet made between uli and harry caulfield no money found in caulfields possession no atm cards and caulfields denial of extortionwhile confessing to coldblooded murderboldt felt compelled to believe that caulfield had had no connection to the atm scam he pulled out ulis file and started through it once again reviewing her past arrests gangs drugs a prostitution charge that had been dropped he looked at her earlier arrest photos sixteen seventeen years old a real sultry beauty then now at twentyone the street had robbed her of her looks the gangs were hardest on the young women each time through he had been reviewing the contents of the files quickly passing over the form headings the departments the officers involved the overly familiar information that any cop encountered repeatedly and with little or no interest but the next time through a number jumped out at him one little number typed innocently years before into one little box so easy to miss one small piece of information left on a form over six years old now by a cop making an arrest filling out a blank arresting officer the atm pin number boldt picked up the phone his hand trembling dialed daphnes number again and again she did not answer he had to search his notebook to find adlers unlisted residence his fingers punched out the number he waited seven rings before adler answered and passed daphne the phone i need you he said chris danielson was asleep when boldt turned the light on in his room daphne and the male night nurse followed at a run boldt turned to this nurse pointed to the other bed in danielsons room and said hes out of herenow the nurse opened his mouth to complain but boldt had already been through hell with him at the nurses station and he had had his fill get that bed out of this room now the man mumbled something but obeyed apologizing to danielsons roommate the nurse took him for a ride into the hall and daphne closed the door i need straight answers chris he still appeared halfasleep sarge and matthews daphne announced herself theyre going to throw me out of here in a minutewere still not allowed to see youand this cant wait until morning are you with me go ahead he rolled his head blinked furiously and reached for a paper cup of ice water with a straw boldt handed it to him and danielson sucked in a mouthful you took caulfields file from the boneyard without signing it outa day before we identified him when we did you returned it i need to know why any minute that door would open the man had new lines in his face and a combination of pain and exhaustion in his eyes a tent frame held the covers off his abdomen and two large weights held his legs in traction his voice was dry i obtained a state tax record of longview employees caulfield had a record i pulled the file but why boldt challenged for money money he asked incredulously to clear the black hole why else the man was too tired too medicated for boldt to read his face well you were offered a job away from the force boldt speculated not true he met eyes with boldt i wanted your job a flashing light passed below the window as a silent ambulance arrived it pulsed light across all their faces i wanted this one worse than you did ive been going at this case night and day when i wasnt handling your paperwork for you nice little nigger sit behind the desk and let the white boys do the big tough jobs not this nigger sergeant bullshit it wasnt like that at all wasnt it they both raised their voices simultaneously and began shouting daphne cut them off with a sharp reprimand and said to both of them out of order unaccustomed to losing his temper boldt took a few seconds to pull himself together he checked his watchprecious seconds daphne said to the injured man elaine striker danielson looked over at her just one of those things that happened its nothing im proud of shes lonely and she doesnt remember what love is and then this black hole comes along daphne nudged like i said its nothing im proud of turns out michael striker is a talker thats all turns out his wife knows everything there is to know about this case and suddenly im a lot more interested in the romancethe pillow talkand she isnt complaining what a sweetheart you are daphne said i paid for it matthews you want to switch places he jerked his head toward the corner of the room where a collapsed wheelchair leaned against the wall daphne stuttered listen striker was all messed up about lonnieelaine he wasnt thinking clearly i came to him for a warrant to get the new leaf bank recordsthe canceled checksand it never occurred to him to clear it with you he said to boldt you found the payoffs she concluded no i didnt they were more careful than that it was a long shot was all hoping to find a paper trail to the bribe money i had already guessed who had been paid off but couldnt prove it so i changed tack were listening chris check the transcript of caulfields trial it was not a good case but public sentiment toward drugs was bad right thenyou so much as said the word cocaine and in a jury trial the suspect went down for the long count and what did the case hinge on some tip that the arresting officer received the whole thing turned on this snitchan anonymous tip one anonymous snitch and caulfield goes away for four and change granted thats how drugs busts go down narcs never reveal their snitches but if you read between the lines of that transcript the arresting officera cop named dunhamwas nervous as hell up on the stand why because he didnt have a legitimate snitch it was a setup caulfield was framed and and before i got to this dunham striker got to me must have followed lonnieelaineto the hotel but you suspected someone wouldnt be fair i never did prove it kenny fowler boldt said supplying the name he mumbled badge number eightonesixfive daphne stared at him dumbfounded danielsons eyes flashed he hesitated barely nodded and explained dunhams partner for five years on major crimes fowler goes private with a company called new leaf dunham goes over to drugs hes floundering cant get the hang of drugs then he does this major bust harry caulfield with a couple kilos of highquality soda four months later guess who hes working for double the salary double the vacation double the fun boldt sagged and leaned onto the frame of the bed jesus in a soft apologetic guiltridden voice he confessed i got you shot chris no one said a thing until boldt spoke again i suspected you of stealing that file i didnt want an ia investigation in the middle of this black hole i asked fowler to place you under surveillance for me keep it out of uniform he lied to me about what he found out about you obviously what he found out was that you were a little too close for comfort and that you were sleeping with elaine striker another long silence as the sound of the circulating air and the hum of machinery seemed deafening to boldt he wanted this mans forgiveness and he knew that was impossible her pd is on his way prosecuting attorney penny smyth informed them but do we wait boldt asked her no one is forcing her to speak to you smyth pointed out you can push but technically she doesnt have to talk understood smyth was cautious not to give them her outright approval you dont have much time she requested of daphne should anyone ever ask you loaned me your office where i remained while you two were in there with her okay near as i can remember boldt and daphne moved quickly down the hall i have an idea back me up in here she requested meeting eyes with him as he reached to open the door for her im there he promised we turn the volume way up and shes going to talk bet on it but it may get a little nasty that suits her i think he followed her into the box daphne never broke stride she burst through the door leaving it for him to close and she hollered at the suspect out of the chair now dressed in an orange jumpsuit cornelia uli wore a haggard expression from her two dismal nights in lockup uli sprang to her feet come over here daphne said indicating the end of the table right here uli stood at the end of the interrogation table looking concerned daphne said now lets get one thing straight if you do not cooperate with us your life just got ugly youre going where girls do other things to girls that are not pleasantthings youve never heard ofand where the guards just do worse things so no one ever says a thing to them you keep your mouth shut unless someone has use for it thats option number one option number two is you open that same mouth for me right now this is not some twoyear drug charge were talking about it is not some checkkiting scam this is not some free atm card that your pal set up for you this is murder one this is the end of your pitiful little life cornelia if you do anything but exactly as i say ive got nothing to say daphne glanced once hotly at boldt turned to face the suspect and said lean against the table i will not uli protested daphne slapped the table hard jarring the woman lean against the table go ahead boldt said reluctantly uli leaned onto her hands your forearms daphne said good now open your legs more move em good what do you think daphne asked stepping back to view the profile as she might a painting having no idea what he was agreeing to boldt said i think youre right daphne stepped up behind a nervous cornelia uli and reached around her careful not to make contact and leaned over her in a provocative position impossible to mistake she rocked her hips unmistakably in an intimate whisper she asked the suspect remind you of anyone get off me im not on you neither was he he was in you boldt felt like an idiot for taking so long to see it the woman in kenny fowlers apartment the night daphne had taken the hotel room and sat in the dark in that same intimate whisper daphne said i saw you two up there ulis head jerked i dont know what youre talking about it didnt look like you enjoyed it very much daphne said she added quietly whatever he has on you is gone we tear it up burn it whatever were not interested all i do is squeal right forget it the first crack boldt said were talking about extortion accessory to murder the rest of your natural life spent behind bars he added we know it was you the door swung open and an angry male voice demanded out of here now it was ulis public defender and he left the door for them to close as he rushed to his clients side on the other side of the boxs oneway glass uli her attorney and penny smyth were waiting impatiently for daphne and boldt who had been talking it through for the last several minutes wrapping it up boldt speculated being one of the few insiders fowler knew how to word the extortion threat so that we would attribute it to caulfield but he blew itthe extortion demand neglected to blame adler something that bothered both dr clements and me we expected extortion demands he simply gave us what we wanted looking at uli through the glass daphne explained proudly it was her body language that caught my eye when she started prancing around the room like that i knew i recognized her i sat in that hotel room watching them for hours it just took a second for it all to click boldt said cynically both of them in that apartmentright there across from us he was angry with her about something maybe she wasnt supposed to show up there he took a quickie at the dining room table for payment and sent her packing hes such a prince boldt said swinging open the door as they joined the others ulis public defender was a young jewish kid fresh from the law boards named carsman he looked like an unmade bed he had a high squeaky voice and he protested boldts every breath penny smyth looking the most dignified of any of them dragged carsman into the hallway for a conference and when they returned to the box carsman did not utter a single objection he took notes furiously and occasionally passed one to his sagging client boldt passed uli her arrest record badge number eightonesixfive that badge number belonged to detective kenneth fowler when he was a police officer he arrested you in a gang situation and you were charged with a seconddegree homicide the charges were later dropped for lack of evidence daphne stated we saw you in his apartment that night shit the suspect said and she hung her head and shook her hair in defeat boldt felt triumphant his face revealed nothing impassive exhausted daphne said what does he have on you cornelia she mumbled a videotape a surveillance tape i was seventeen sex daphne asked a homicide boldt stated knowingly dont answer carsman interrupted boldt said lester gammon age eighteen stabbed seven times cornelia uli obeyed her attorney though she locked eyes with boldt he asks me to do stuff now and then i do it like the other night daphne asked go stuff it uli said vehemently what do any of you know about the streets let me tell you somethingout there you do favors and people leave you alone its simple in the streets its basic survival you and your perfect hair and your strawberry douche she said spitefully to daphne you make me sick daphne blushed and held herself back in a formidable show of internal strength you did fowler favors boldt repeated like this atm thing yeah do not say anything more her attorney advised shut up uli told him i cant represent you if shut up to boldt she said i went where he told me to i did what he said to do to daphne she said and yeah he jumps my bones now and then and no i dont particularly like it but its not like its something new okay hes been doing it since back when he was a cop he had a lot of the girls doing it back then if kenny busted you you went down on him no charges it was that simple thats what im saying you get why im afraid of cops it started when i was fifteen and running with a gang kenny liked me too bad for me she seemed to be apologizing to daphne you get kinda used to the ones like kenny fowler but its better than the alternative and thats the way it works out there doing favors for people beats the hell out of living under bridges in cardboard boxes getting gangbanged getting bad needles you dont know until youve been there youre right daphne said overcoming her personal agenda and striving to establish rapport with the suspect daphnes friend sharon had been there daphne knew all about it but was not going to say so was not going to defend herself boldt admired her for that he gave you the atm card boldt began for her and the number and he told me which machines to hit big deal he gave me a hundred a night generous boldt said its a living uli replied dully sergeant it was penny smyth she asked for a conference in the hall daphne stayed with the suspect smyth said what im seeing here is that its going to come down to her word against fowlers is there any other evidence tying them together other than this because ive got to tell you a judge is not going to like her will fowler have the money on him no way its long gonethe minute you picked this girl up it was gone he was a cop right he knows the game hell have something planned he used her for a reason am i right or am i right ill run with this if you want i can take it up the ladder and see what they think but it stinks if you ask me shes youngshe has reasons serious reasons in her past to hate fowler and want to do him harm and thats going to come out in any testimony it stinks sergeant matthews cannot say for sure it was this girl in fowlers apartment that night boldt countered we have the pin number we have the former arrest the bank account was opened by her she uses fowlers badge number as a way of getting back at him just in case shes caught which she was im showing you the spin that can be put on this as a witness she stinks im telling you your call you tell me what you want me to do she met and held eyes with him i hate attorneys boldt told her me too she smiled all my friends are cops he smiled back so what do you suggest counselor i suggest she wears a wire for us we plea her down to six months in medium with good behavior carsman will do back flips to get that we send fowler to the big house until hes gray boldt asked incredulously do you actually think that kenny fowler will get within a sixstate region of this woman no way in hell maybe to kill her but not to he caught himself what is it she asked maybe we let fowler do our work for us i think he owes us that boldt had his car swept for listening devices before driving daphne out to alki point where he parked with a view of the water and a volleyball game being played out at sunset thankfully no devices had been found a body had washed ashore here once and had changed a case and their lives along with it he had not chosen this place to park at random i dont want to ask this of you daffy then dont she knew already but she had agreed to the drive so perhaps he stood a chance of convincing her she looked away from him out her window please dont she repeated you have to be living back there if this is going to work well have to script some things for you and adler to say we have to chum the water or hell spot the hook do you understand what youre asking i know what im askingi dont know what it would be like i dont know that i could do it and watson and moulderthey would see me too if all this works the way you have planned on the toilet in the shower my god lou we gave him the mug shot daffy we know he showed it around the processing plants the warehouses at some point someone must have recognized it caulfield delivered there on a regular basis fowler kept that information from us all so that he could continue the extortion hes as guilty as caulfield is if were to put him away for that we need a huge case against him we need to build it from the ground up and show that kenny fowler because of greed allowed these poisonings to continue but to do that we have to have him deadtorights on the extortion honestly he asked i dont care much about the extortion i care about these lives i care about being lied to and strung out because of fowlers greed he deserves more than a slap on the wrist and yes it means that you have to take your clothes off yes you have to do all the private things we all do every day of our lives and yes you have to do them as if there is no camera watching you no microphone listening and no i dont know how a person does that but i know you want him as badly as i dootherwise i couldnt have asked she sighed and she scratched the dashboard with a fingernail thank you for not saying that hes seen it all alreadythat he may have hours of me on tapeso what does it matter and thank you for not saying that im strong enough to pull this off that is a sentiment that would not be appreciated i can tell you that we wont know about any such strength until i tryif i try and so that would only be manipulative garbage she smirked and added more my territory than yours i could blow this lou and thanks also for downplaying the report on that witness from the loading dock we know fowler received confirmation of caulfields identity and did not act on it i read that report that makes him guilty of these crimes by omission boldt did not realize that she had read it whatever he said but his heart was pounding strongly for it sounded to him as if perhaps she had made up her mind they ask too much of us she said her lips tight as if fighting off her emotions we give too much and we get so little back the media tears us to pieces the sixth floor rains hell on us and all for what cold pizza and maalox boldt answered she sputtered a laugh yeah job benefits right the wind blew across the water like a shadow and sand swirled in the air and the people playing volleyball shielded their eyes from it as a teenager like all teenage girls i wanted to be a movie star i thought it looked so easy be careful what you wish for someday it may be yours or however that goes you have to do this willingly its not something that will work if you feel pressured into doing it you have to sell him on the idea that everything you say everything that goes on at that houseboat is for real business as usual she said spitefully he was not going to touch that comment im in she announced facing him with hard eyes she said but for my own reasons lou for my own damn reasons everyone called the man watson and he ran tech services as if it were his own department which it was not he had been called watson for so many years that boldt did not remember his real name he was a bald man with glasses and thick red lips and was commonly mistaken for bernie lofgrins younger brother if it ran on electricity then watson could build it modify it copy it or compromise it watson and his prize technician a man named moulder spent two consecutive days in a cabin cruiser anchored off of the lake union houseboats alternating between running the gear and fishing off the sternthis to keep up appearances they were the envy of the entire department that week the two most difficult performances were turned in by daphne matthews and owen adler who did everything short of making love for the cameras according to script they discussed the uli case on occasion with daphne implying that the suspect was getting closer and closer to cooperating with the authorities daphne showered shaved her legs and brushed her teeth as usual and watson followed procedure to the letter never connecting monitors to the cameras in the bedroom and bath the technology behind the ruse was explained to boldt in laymans terms fowlers surveillance system worked off of infrared and radiofrequency transmission as opposed to hard wiring which necessitated cables the signals from the microphones and fiber optic cameras were transmitted via the airwaves to a remote location that watson estimated was within a quartermile of the houseboat another houseboat or a nearby condominium seemed the most likely location for this remote but a vehicle or boat was a possibility it was suspected that the incoming signals were recorded and videotaped at the remote site although it was also possible that the signals were relayed over telephone lines from the remote to either the security room at adler foods or fowlers apartmentthey would not be able confirm this until they conducted a physical search of the various premises it was no different from the surveillance techniques the police themselves used except that fowler was more thorough in his coverage of the houseboat and he incorporated a stateoftheart digital technology that required watson to borrow some equipment from the fbi watson and his people spent twentysome hours identifying the various frequencies being used and stealing onto the signals now what fowler was listening to and watching was also being recorded on the anchored cabin cruiser that housed two of the worlds worst fishermen more important when directed to do so watson was prepared to jam fowlers outgoing signals from the houseboat and transmit his own from videotape leaving fowler with false images of an empty houseboat when in fact it would be bustling with activity this deception had been the key element for boldts plan to work and it took nearly seventytwo hours before watson believed he was ready no one could guarantee it would work on day four of the ruse the morning headlines and broadcasts led with the story that cornelia uli had agreed to turn states witness and to reveal to a grand jury the identity of the man who had run the atm extortion of adler foods deputy prosecuting attorney penelope smyth was quoted as saying that with ulis testimony the state believed it had an airtight case and that for security reasons the witness was being placed into hiding so that nothing could jeopardize her testimonyor the states case at onethirty in the morning the night beforewell before the story hit the pressan unmarked darkblue sedan pulled up in front of the dock that led to daphnes houseboat and two plainclothes policemen climbed out and walked the area for five minutes before returning to the car and giving the allclear the cars back door opened and a figure small in stature accompanied by a big bear of a man walked quickly toward daphnes home the front door swung open and admitted these two without a knock or introduction moments later the blue car sped away daphne closed the door and locked it everything go okay fine boldt answered cornelia uli pulled back the hood to the sweatshirt and shook her hair free i thought we were going to a hotel she complained so will everyone else boldt said the press will be searching every hotel motel and inn within an hours drive of the courthouse a houseboat on lake union five minutes from downtown youre safer here than in any hotel it has a brandnew security system and a policewoman to look after you and take care of you what about television theres a television in the bedroom and the bedroom is yours until this is over okay fine cornelia uli strolled the houseboat looking it over touching some of the furniture inspecting the view its killer she said lets hope not daphne answered and lets get one thing straight i am not your housemaid we share dish duty cooking and cleaning forget it this is nonnegotiable you can go back to county lockup and take your chances if youd prefer boldt began drawing the curtains and lowering shades and you cant go outside daphne stated emphatically this is a small closed neighborhood we decided against putting any of our people around the area because we thought it would cause too much suspicion and probably force us to move you we dont want to move you we were also worried about leaks only a handful of people know youre here all of whom can be trusted boldt continued with the shades you wont go outside you wont use the phone and you wont open any of the shades were taking no chances that you might be randomly spotted and remember this is for you not us bullshit the woman protested this is so ill squeal this is so kenny fowler goes to jail dont give me any of that shit cornelia uli had been told nothing of boldts ruse and boldt delighted in the fact that unwittingly she too played her role out to perfection for a day and a half the two women lived side by sidesometimes combative sometimes in harmony but with daphne either wearing her weapon at her side or leaving it within plain reach boldt and his team were equipped with some of the same digital communication technology used in the atm sting preventing any possibility of electronic eavesdropping officially the police were completely out of this in fact an elite team of individuals including gaynes and lamoia were following a carefully choreographed script in which cornelia uli was the only unwitting participant for the sake of possible surveillance it had long since been decided that the trap would be baited after dark on the second evening of ulis confinement daphne sat waiting for the woman to take a bathroom break as usual she wore a radio and earpiece uli was a television addict and remained virtually glued to the set in the bedroom during waking hours boldt used this against her in his plan the diuretic slipped into the evening meal guaranteed frequent bathroom calls at some point she would come down to the headessential to the success of the ruse more important she would immediately return upstairs to her shows where true to form she would remain she would not be hanging around downstairs checking coat closets crucial because on this night the closets would have more than coats inside of them but for daphne the time seemed to stretch on forever finally uli did come down from the bedroom the sound of the television behind her and crossed the room toward the head daphne as per instructions sprang into action she walked quickly to the front door and unlocked it at the same time she keyed in the security code deactivating the system she also flashed a signal of three pops of the transmission button to her radio then she hurried to the back door which she unlocked as well all of this required only seconds to accomplish thankfully uli always washed her hands after using the toilet the running water was to serve as daphnes warning signal outside the houseboat the three quick pops over the radio were the awaited signal boldt lamoia and gaynes all dressed in dark clothing hurried from the back of a panel truck and down the short dock toward the farthest houseboat while through an earpiece boldt monitored the monotonous drone of the dispatchers voice tracking kenny fowlers every move at present fowler was holed up in his waterview apartment across town on board the cabin cruiser daphnes radio signal instructed watson to jam several of fowlers transmission frequencies and to start the prerecorded videotapes playing it was for this reason that daphne remained standing close to the back doorthere were no hidden surveillance cameras watching this back area of the house one moment the hidden cameras were showing the realtime activity inside the houseboat the next only the camera and microphone showing cornelia uli urinating were live the rest briefly displayed the images and sounds of empty rooms it was during these few precious moments of illusion that boldt and his team slipped quietly inside the houseboatboldt and gaynes through the front door locking it behind them and seconds later lamoia through the back lamoia took up position in the back coat closet boldt stuffed himself into the front coat closet bobbie gaynes raced up the ladder and concealed herself on the small deck outside the bedroom daphne heard the bathroom water running she rekeyed the security code and the light flashed red she glanced into the living room boldts jacket was caught in the closet door cracking it open he did not seem to notice no time watson had warned her that for the video to play correctly once the jamming was removed she had to walk on screen from the same location where she had walked off she could not suddenly appear in the middle of a room when the cameras went live desperate to correct boldts coat she had no choice but to return to her screened position at the back door while at the same time clicking her radio three times successively click click click on the cabin cruiser sweat clinging to his brow watson stood alongside his assistant moulder each with fingers from both hands occupied awaiting the signal the radio sparked three times watson said ready moulder nodded one two three in a synchronized movement the men depressed the buttons simultaneously the video of the houseboat was once again live but now there were three police inside watson spoke calmly into the radio youre live uli came out of the bathroom at the same time daphne heard watsons confirmation and crossed back onto a video screen somewhere in the city the psychologists heart was pounding ferociously she had not realized how tense this would make her on cue the phone rang and daphne answered it in her same bored manner with which she always answered a phone fully aware of the electronic device listening to her every word hello its me said lieutenant phil shoswitz we need you downtown its urgentthe grand jury has advanced the schedule theyve decided to hear her testimony tomorrow morning smyth wants to talk to you but i twenty minutes is all i know youll be leaving her but its better than us sending a replacement and making a scene lock it up tight and key in the security youve done it before shell be fine but i really dont think if we dont handle this tonight weve got major problems in the morning get your butt down here he added no one can bust in there without us knowing im putting an unmarked car up on fairview theyll respond if needed but i dont want them any closer than that yes sir she hung up and told uli i have to go downtown bullshit i have to go youll be fine ill lock up and youll rekey the security behind me i wont be more than a half hour she added ive gone out for food before she turned around and there peering from the closet was boldts eye wide with urgency shocked she quickly collected herself boldt could not spin around in the tiny space and free his coat without making noise nor could he pull the closet door shut without risking being heard but not at night uli complained its orders i have to go a half hour thats all uli stated as a requirement i thought you didnt like cops daphne reminded her she edged toward the closet i like your gun i dont suppose you would leave me that youll be fine she reminded her of the code although uli had used the system before lock up behind me no the woman snapped sarcastically i think ill leave it open so fowler can just walk right in daphne stepped up to the closet door and said oh hell i dont need a coat and smacked the door firmly pushing it shut a small triangle of boldts sport coat stuck out by the hinge like a tiny flag boldt was not big on claustrophobic environments he was large enough that even the front seat of a car seemed tight to him the minutes ticked by interminably long he monitored the time by pushing the button that lit the display on his casio watch four minutes after daphnes departure boldt heard softly in his ear suspect is departing his domicile repeat suspect departing they had intentionally given fowler only a few minutes in which to react because they knew their operatives could not stand inside a coat closet remaining absolutely silent for more than thirty minutes and because they hoped to force an urgency upon him that would require a quick perhaps irrational decision to act this also accounted for shoswitzs announcing to daphne an advanced trial date suspect headed east on denny way boldt heard in his ear boards creaked overheaduli was in the bedroom watching television unaware of bobbie gaynes lurking in the shadows only several feet away the surveillance traffic crackled in boldts ear fowler drew progressively closer and when he eventually turned north toward the lake boldt knew he was headed here seven minutes suspect has arrived at destination came the dispatchers bland voice boldt could not stand the lack of air another minute he tugged on the closet door and cracked it open again delivering fresh air and leaving him a tiny slit through which he could see somewhere around three minutes later the back door came open kenny fowler using a master key for locks that his own people had installed he punched in an override code that circumvented a customers pinsupplied to alarm companies by the manufacturer in case a customer forgot his or her security pin then he shut the door and reset the alarm cornelia ulis ears were aided by the fact that she had muted a commercial and because fowler proceeded to step on the same noisy board that had gotten him into trouble with daphne uli came charging down the ladder calling out changed your mind boldt watched as fowler came into view he wore a darkgreen oilskin jacket bold could not see uli oh shit uli barked out seeing him relax im not here to kill you he sounded emotionally drained bullshit no shit he produced a fan of cashtwentydollar bills were getting you out of here what are you talking about out of here im giving you a choice he said calmly you can take a plane ticket and three thousand bucks right now or you can get on that stand tomorrow morning its not tomorrow morn shut up theres no time corny fowler evidently cared for the woman boldt had not anticipated this you get on the stand and you lose your memory no atms no kenny fowler no testimony it was all your idea i can tell you how to make it sound convincing you do that and ill give you thirty thousand when you get out ill never get out four years maybe six and thirty thousand at the other end ill deposit half in your name before you get on that stand i take the fall for you something like that jesus she said boldt realized she was actually considering it boldt reached down and depressed the radios call button twice click click overhead he heard gaynes move he saw fowler turn as he must have heard lamoia boldt swung open the door his weapon already drawn cornelia uli screamed fowler scrambled for his weapon completely caught offguard three of us kenny drop it boldt announced hands high lamoia warned from behind gaynes leapt down the ladder and tackled uli shielding her fowler shook his head he sat down slowly onto the floor only inches from the post where daphne had struck her head but how he said glancing toward the wall and one of his hidden cameras weve got all the latest shit boldt said quoting him fowler remained dazed lamoia said hey sarge get this tonight you and i came out of the closet thirtyeight at owen adlers recommendation they met at place pigalle because it was small and intimate and offered a stunning water view boldt noticed daphnes new ring immediately but he said nothing because he was not sure liz had seen it yet but of course she had liz did not miss much when it came to daphne matthews the ring was both handsome and elegant though not showy and boldt admired adler for that boldt had accepted the invitation reluctantly not wanting to leave his home for any reason not comfortable with the idea of socializing with the two of them but he had never been good at denying daphne much of anything she had gotten him into this investigation and now in her own way she was letting him out boldt asked how do you interpret fowlers statement in a plea bargain to lessen the charges kenny fowler had agreed to cooperate by giving a written statement one of daphnes jobs was to analyze the psychology behind it from the day he left spd he told all of us he was going to have his own agency working for owen he spent as much money as he madeactually more most of the time he lived beyond his means he felt inferiorhoward taplins goandfetchit he claims that the caulfield case brought all those feelings home that he suddenly saw a way to make enough money to strike out on his own he knew the look of the faxes the language and the tonehe could imitate the killer and extort money if people kept dying he could use this to apply more pressure but he withheld information boldt reminded he lied to all of us adler snapped if it was a matter of money but he cut himself off clearly too upset to discuss it daphne continued hesitantly the statement says nothing about the original new leaf coverup or framing caulfield on the drug charges i suspect that his intention all along was to find caulfield himself before we did and to take him out that way he could continue the extortion while the new leaf connection to the killings remained unproven probably hoping it would fade away she looked out at the view he exploited everything and everyone around him she clearly included herself in this liz poked her husband in the leg her actions hidden beneath the table boldt asked no more questions liz changed the subject asking questions about corky and adler brightened and told a series of amusing stories he ordered champagne and liz changed hers to a san pellegrino because of the child growing inside her this announcement won several toasts and more talk of corky and naturally led into adlers blushing tonguetied inability to speak and daphnes finally announcing their engagement she confessed it may be the only engagement in history to be consummated not by a kiss but a handshake boldt and daphne met eyes briefly and he saw in hers a terrified joy that he had longed to see there far out on the water the ferries came and went their lights blurred in reflection daphne drank nervously and started telling stories on boldt reminding him of things that he pretended to have forgotten adler drank to liz for the timetrap software and to boldt for everything he had done and to his fiancee for finding the truth no one mentioned harry caulfield by name howard taplin was cooperating with authorities but he received no toasts that night boldt said a silent toast for danielson and strikerone recovering the other facing a difficult trial and a messy divorce in all it was an awkward evening for boldt he fought adler for the check and lost and this seemed significant to him he drove home in silence with his wife napping in her seat and when they pulled up to the garage her eyes still closed liz said shell always be your friend it wont change that youll see he had no way to follow that he got the door for her and they held hands on the way to the kitchen after checking in on miles liz paid the babysitter while boldt tended to the days mail piled by the kitchen phone among the letters was a brown package and like a good cop boldt treated it suspiciously chastising himself once he read the return address i wondered what that was liz said as her husband opened it carefully but i didnt touch it she added boldt hated the precautions he resented so much of his public service the package was incredibly light and was marked fragile with a series of bright red stickers the note was on personalized stationery and read simply for your boy i forget his name did you tell me it i dont remember it seemed a shame to let it go to waste i know hes too young but perhaps someday he can finish thisbetty inside he found the partially completed model of the space shuttle thirtynine howard taplin took the stand for the third time in as many days he had turned states witness and the convictions were piling up in a case that drew both court tv and cnn updates the succession of trials was nearly as exhausting as the investigation for the lead detective it was in that horrible time of year for boldtbetween thanksgiving and christmas when the sky was gray the air cold and there was canned christmas music playing from fuzzy speakers on every street kenny fowler went down in flames receiving three thirtyyear sentences to be served consecutively amazingly to boldt cornelia uli was acquitted after the prosecution proved without a shadow of a doubt that she had served as fowlers accomplice had opened the phony bank account and had made over twelve thousand dollars in withdrawals television reporters called it a sympathy vote for uli had been arrested seven years earlier by fowler during a gang raid and had been forced to serve as his sexual partner ever since the jury apparently bought the defenses position that she had been brainwashed lamoia had summed it up as far as boldt was concerned thats the law for you go figure boldt still owed his wife that champagne dinner but he had not forgotten despite what she thought he was in fact saving up to make it dinner in rome though that required another few months of happy hour at the big joke miles was in the terrible twos and this boldt thought was the only redeeming value of the endless series of trials he sneaked out of the courtroom the minute he was handed the note by the guard and he knew what to expect despite its vagueness reporters eyes followed him these days where boldt went the press followed he was sick and tired of it he wanted his life back but they could not follow him down into county detention where he was headed the guards stopped them he walked and walked down into the bowels of a system that failed at every turn this was but one more example he felt his gun at the first station and he flinched when the bars shut behind him because he always flinched when he heard that sound his shoes squeaked on the clean cement floor though he avoided the center drain the guard was making excuses but boldt hardly heard them he had argued he had warned he had heard the words of dr richard clements as he had seen him off at the airport you keep your eye on him hes one determined fellow this was no place for caulfield he had been inside before and the five years he had served for a trumpedup drug charge had helped to buy him a life sentence rather than death row that was when boldt had pressed for a suicide watch and had lost the arguments had centered around transporting him back and forth for the trial overcrowding and expense they stopped in front of the cell he hoped the guard was finished making excuses but the man added i guess if youre crazy youre just crazy harry caulfield had vomited much as his victims had vomited he was lying in the bed his head cocked to one side eyes shut perhaps it had been a peaceful death you suppose he complained about the rats just so wed put out the poison i mean what kind of idiot would do such a thing what the hell are we going to say that he got what he wanted the morning paper open on the floor meant nothing to the guard but boldt saw it was open to the business pages he knew the article adler foods files chapter eleven besieged by lawsuits adler had folded his shop though according to daphne he vowed to return adler was not one to stay down long crazy bastard the guard said boldt turned and headed back for the entrance passing cell after cell of human beings behind bars they stood with their hands on the bars staring out at him envying his freedom to leave this place as he passed the front desk the guard held out boldts weapon he stopped stared at it the man wiggled it it grew heavy for him boldt accepted it snapped it into the holster he flinched as the cell door closed loudly behind him
