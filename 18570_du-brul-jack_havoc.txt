jack du brul havoc may alone in his cabin for the past three days the madman rocked gently on his narrow bunk his eyes fixed on the dull sheen of his personal safe while fever sent alternating currents of heat and cold through his body he was unaware of the great ships passage across the atlantic the rhythm of her four engines turning the large propellers the spectacular service offered by the crew or even the cycles of day and night it took all his mental ability just to keep his focus on the small safe since leaving europe hed ventured from his cabin only late at night to use one of the communal washrooms even on these furtive forays hed hurry back to his room if he heard other passengers stirring or crewmembers attending their duties on the first night of the trip and during the following day a steward would knock on his door inquiring about his needs asking if he wanted tea a cocktail or perhaps some soda crackers to settle his stomach if the ships motion was making him ill the passenger had refused everything struggling to maintain a patina of civility but when the waiter returned to ask if the passenger wanted dinner brought to him on the second night the man in cabin a flew into a rage cursing the hapless steward in a mix of english greek and an african dialect hed picked up in the preceding months as the third day slid toward an overcast evening what little control hed had over his mind slipped further he didnt care he was almost home hours now not days or weeks hed beat them all him alone his was an inside cabin and lacked a window a lamp was bolted above the tiny desk and lights in decorative sconces shone down on the bunk beds everything was made of polished aluminum with holes punched through the metal to give the space a futuristic appearance as if he were on a rocket ship out of verne or wells the safe had been manhandled into the cabins only empty corner by a steward whod waited a beat too long for a tip the passenger couldnt afford while the ship was at only half capacity on its seasonal maiden trip the tickets were some of the most expensive ever for a transatlantic voyage had he not felt the press of time or been certain that those chasing him were closing in he would have found a cheaper way back to the united states but then maybe taking this ship had been the most brilliant coup of all the people trying to catch him would never suspect he would use their own flagship on the last leg of his journey home he reached across to touch the safe feel its cool outline under his shaking fingers content in the knowledge that a lifes ambition was locked within he shivered from fever or exhilaration he neither knew nor cared bolted to the wall across the cabin was a small mirror he looked at himself avoiding his eyes for he was not ready to face what lurked behind them his hair was long and unkempt shot with gray that had not been there two months ago clumps of it had fallen out in the past few weeks and as he ran his hand across his scalp he could feel fine strands pull free and snag in the serrations at the end of his cracked fingernails the skin on his face hung in folds as though it had been fitted for a larger skull his beard had once been a thing of pride a distinctive trademark of wellmanicured whiskers now it resembled the down of a molting chick he bared his teeth at the mirror more grimace than smile his gums were raw and red he assumed they bled because he hadnt eaten a proper meal since leaving his new jersey home his body too had paid a heavy price while he had never been a robust man he had lost so much weight he could feel the sharp ends of his bones poke against his skin every time he moved his hands shook constantly and his head swayed as if it had become a burden to the atrophied muscles of his neck the excited voice of a young girl pierced the thin cabin door hurry walter we are approaching new york city i want a good place on the observation deck about time the man thought he checked his watch it was three in the afternoon they should have arrived nine hours ago against his better judgment he decided to venture from his cabin he needed to confirm with his own eyes that he was almost home then he would return to his tiny cabin and wait for the ship to dock he staggered to the door in the narrow hallway a girl of maybe twelve waited for her brother to finish lacing his shoes she gasped when she saw him an involuntary gesture that filled her lungs and drained the blood from her face without turning her startled eyes from him she reached for her brothers shoulder and yanked him away his protests died on his lips when he spotted the deranged passenger they ran around the corner in the direction of the promenade deck the girls skirt flaring above her coltish knees the innocent encounter made the passengers stomach give a wet lurch of protest acid scalded the back of his throat he thrust his nausea aside and closed his cabin door to make his way down the starboardside staircase a few idle crewmen and a lone passenger were pressed against the observation window on b deck behind them was the crews toilet and just as he reached the window a ships officer stepped from within followed by an unsettling stench it smelled no worse or perhaps even a bit better than the passenger himself he hadnt washed his clothes or his body since before fleeing cairo placing his hands on the sill he could feel the mild trembling of the engines through the metal he pressed his face close to the glass and watched as manhattans impressive skyline emerged from behind dark storm clouds the shipping line prided itself on their perfect safety record and as he watched the city come into focus he allowed a ghost of a smile to pull at the corners of his mouth as promised the voyage from germany had been uneventful and soon the flagship of the deutsche zeppelin reederei would float gently to her mooring mast in lakehurst new jersey a hole in the overcast opened allowing bright sunlight to form a corona around the giant airship hindenburg her shadow spread like a stain across the artificial canyons of midtown darkening all but the towering empire state building the colossal zeppelin larger than most ocean liners and four times as fast had made the crossing in a little over three days her four mercedes diesels pushing the foot behemoth through the sky at a surprisingly smooth eighty knots the passenger caught a glimpse of people atop the empire state buildings observation deck waving at the great airship and for a giddy moment he felt the urge to wave back an impulse that made him believe that perhaps he could once again connect with humanity after his ordeal instead he turned on his heel and rushed back to his cabin his breath coming in chopping gulps until he assured himself that the safe was still locked his body was bathed in an oily sheen of sour sweat he took his seat on the bunk and began to rock again he planned on remaining like that as the airship powered down long island sound as her captain max pruss sought a window in the stormy weather to bring his charge to the naval station at lakehurst yet just before five someone knocked on his door he didnt recognize the knock the stewards had been timid about interrupting him respectful if a little puzzled by his appearance and attitude this was the knock of authority a single hard rap that brought a fresh wave of sweat from his pores what do you want his voice was hoarse from lack of use herr bowie my name is gunther bauer i am a ships officer may i have a word chester bowies eyes darted around his tiny cabin he knew he was cornered but he could not help but search for a way out hed almost made it a few more hours and hed be safely on the ground and away from these nazis but somehow theyd learned his identity not that they wanted him he was no longer of consequence it was what was inside the safe that drove them he had come too far to see it end now only one course was open to him and he felt nothing but mild irritation at what he had to do of course chester said one moment the officers and crew are worried that you might have a negative impression of our company bauer said from the other side of the closed door his english passable but stiff his tone mild chester wasnt fooled i have some gifts the german continued pens and stationery for you as souvenirs of your flight just leave them bowie said as he made ready knowing the next words and the next few seconds were critical i would prefer to give them to you personal that was all he needed to hear they wanted into his cabin to steal the safe even as the last word hung unfinished in the air chester bowie used what little strength the fever had left him to wrench open the sliding door and grab the german by the lapels of his black uniform jacket he ignored the flurry of papers that spilled from bauers hands and the sheaf of pens that fell to the deck and yanked the officer into the cabin bauers only attempt at defense was a startled grunt bowie smashed him into the little ladder that allowed access to the upper bunk bed and as the officer began to fall bowie leapt on his back he jammed his knee into the hollow at the base of bauers head when they hit the deck their combined weight snapped the germans fourth and fifth cervical vertebra hard enough to sever the spinal cord bauer went limp and his body settled expelling his final breath bowie closed the door they would never let him off the zeppelin even though hed lost them when he fled africa he should have known theyd somehow pick up his trail again hed been so clever by traveling right into the heart of the beast and taking their own ship home no one could have foreseen him doing that but somehow they had they were unholy like allseeing gorgons who knew the routes of man the body took up nearly the entire floor chester had to step over it to grab a notebook hed left on the writing desk he picked up one of the pens bauer had dropped he had no idea how long it would be before the captain sent someone else to get the safe no chester realized next time there would be many of them too many of them he wrote quickly the pen racing across pages as if it knew what had to be written and only needed bowie to hold nib to paper he watched his hand flowing back and forth not fully conscious of the words it was writing in fifteen minutes hed filled eight pages with tight script he could barely read no one came so he filled another ten fleshing out his story as best he could remember it he was sure this would be his last will and testament all that remained of a lifes obsessionthese words and the sample in the safe but it was enough he had tread in the footsteps of emperors how many men could say theyd achieved that when he felt his hand had written enough he dialed the safes combination and stuffed the pages inside taking what he knew would be his last look at the sample hed brought back from africa it resembled a cannonball a perfectly round sphere hed crafted with the help of a blacksmith in khartoum he closed the safe and wrote a name along with a cryptic message on the stiff cover of his notebook he tore the remaining blank pages from the books spiral binding and using the lace from his left boot he threaded the spiral and note to the safes handle there was nothing else he could do but pray that whoever found the safe would deliver it to the addressee there was no need to write where the man lived everyone knew how to find him chester bowie rolled the corpse of gunther bauer under the bottom bunk trying hard not to notice how the head flexed unnaturally on the broken stalk of his neck then he began to shove the safe from its corner straining at first but seized with such desperation he quickly skidded it across the carpet he opened the cabin door peered up and down the hallway and then shoved the hundredpound safe toward the stairwell to b deck so far no one had spotted him but downstairs he knew passengers and crew would be watching the new jersey coastline scroll below the observation windows may i help you with that sir bowie froze the voice came from behind him and he recognized it from where his mind raced cairo khartoum somewhere in the jungle he whirled ready to fight standing before him was the earnest young steward hed yelled at on the second day of the crossing werner franz did everything in his power not to recoil when he saw the crazed look in bowies eyes the feral countenance of a cornered rat while only fourteen werner considered himself an experienced airshipman and no lunatic passenger would crack his veneer of professionalism may i help you with that yeah er yes thank you chester stammered surely this mere boy wasnt the second wave of nazis sent to steal the safe the captain would send mechanics and other officers big men whod beat him and hide the safe until tonights return flight to frankfurt i overheard the captain werner said earnestly as he began pulling at the safe the weathers cleared enough for us to make a run for lakehurst with luck well land a bit after seven i guess you want to be the first off the ship herr bowie er yes thats right i have people waiting for me may i ask what is in the safe the other stewards think you carry gemstones to a new york jeweler i ah no these are ah papers for ah an important scientist jesus why had he said that the boy could just look at the note tied to the handle to see who the safe was intended for he should have gone with the story the steward had given him i see clearly werner franz didnt believe him and for that chester was thankful hed traveled five thousand miles and almost given away his secret in the final minutes together they dragged the safe down the stairway its weight making the light aluminum steps vibrate with every tread they descended we will leave it out of the way werner said and dragged the safe into the observation room crewmen need to lower the retractable gangways when we land and we cant have them tripping over your safe this is fine chester said panting from the exertion his face had blanched under his tropical tan and his legs trembled i will help you with your safe when we land werner offered bowie said nothing and waved the boy away so he could sit back against the railing protecting the outwardly angled observation windows in a moment his heart had slowed the airship was flying due south and it seemed that every passenger and crewman not on duty crowded the port windows the starboard observation room was thankfully empty without wasting any more time chester braced his stillshaky legs and lifted the safe from the floor muscles in his back strained under the load and he heard more than felt some tear yet he did not drop his burden he lifted it higher pressing it against the wall for leverage until he had it balanced atop the railing below the zeppelin the ground was an endless sea of pine trees and sand broken only occasionally by lonely rutted roads they crossed over a stretch of cultivated land with a farmhouse situated along the perimeter the barn was dilapidated and the tractors and machinery looked like toys the windows in the opulent promenade on a deck could open but those on b deck were fixed in place chester leaned across the railing his hands tight around the teetering safe and waited for the right moment the hindenburg cruised at a thousand feet as she plowed through the overcast sky beyond the protective bulk of the airships hull rain fell in gusting curtains now that bowie was ready the airship continued over desolate stretches of pine from above the canopy of trees was an impenetrable mass his whole body shook with frustration at any moment a passenger or crewman would come by and his plan would be ruined from above on the a deck promenade he heard someone play a few notes on the lightweight bluthner baby grand piano there another farmhouse appeared at the edge of the forest even from this height bowie could see the place was rundown the shingle roof sagged in the middle like the swayback of an old horse while the porch seemed in danger of collapse yet there was light in the windows and a trail of smoke caught the breeze at the top of the chimney and smeared across the landscape the nearby barn appeared much newer the flight path would take the hindenburg right along the edge of a cleared field a quarter mile south of the farmyard with luck the farmer would find the safe before whatever crop he grew overwhelmed the pasture chester had to do nothing more than let go of the safe it fell through the angled window with a crash that was quickly swallowed by the roar of wind whipping into the airship bowie hadnt been prepared for the blast of rainsoaked air he staggered back from the rail then whirled away running back up to his cabin just as the door to the crews mess opened he was trailed by angry german voices but no one had seen what hed done unfortunately chester bowie also couldnt see the safe plummet to the ground a hundred feet before it plowed into the sandy soil the note he had so laboriously tied to the handle was stripped away it stayed aloft in the stormy air for nearly an hour and by then it was shredded to confetti and spread across two counties rain cut forking trails along the gum rubber poncho as drops pooled and poured across the fabric for nearly eighteen hours the lone figure had remained hidden under its folds unmoving and nearly unblinking from his perch atop a hangar he had an unobstructed view of the landing field a half mile away and the metal framework of the mooring mast from here it looked remarkably like a miniature eiffel tower his target was twelve hours late a bit of irony since his hurried orders had forced him to rush into position moving so as not to change the outline of the weatherproof poncho he brought his rifle up to his eye the scope was a trophy hed taken from a sniper during the great war hed adapted it to every rifle hed ever used he stared through the optics centering the crosshairs on the milling throng of the landing crew theyd just returned to the field after a brief downpour he estimated there were more than two hundred of them but such a number was needed to manhandle the giant airship in the face of even a gentle breeze he let the reticle linger on individuals for a moment before moving on he spotted the airfields commander charles rosendahl the man next to him had to be willy von meister the zeppelin companys american representative despite the occasional gusts the sniper could have dropped either man with a shot through whichever eye he chose a ways off were a radio journalist and a cameraman both of them checking equipment as everyone waited for the hindenburgs late arrival he was about to lower the heavy rifle when everyone on the ground turned at once raising an arm skyward in what almost resembled the nazi salute the sniper shifted a fraction out of the pewter sky came the hindenburg distance could not diminish the size of the airship it was absolutely enormous a defiant symbol of a resurgent germany she was sleek like a torpedo with stabilizers and rudders larger than the wings of a bomber at its widest the zeppelin was one hundred and thirtyfive feet in diameter and inside her rigid frame of duralumin struts were gas cells containing seven million cubic feet of explosive hydrogen twostorytall swastikas adorned her rudders and pale smoke trailed from her four diesel engines as the airship approached it grew in size blotting out a larger and larger slab of the sky her skin was doped a reflective silver that managed to glisten even in the stormy weather the hindenburg passed directly over the naval air station at about six hundred and fifty feet the sniper watched passengers inside the accommodation section of the ship leaning out the windows and trying to shout to family on the ground it took fifteen minutes for the leviathan to circle back around for her final approach from the west a quarter mile from the mooring mast the engines suddenly screamed at full reverse power to slow the airship and moments later three tumbling avalanches of ballast water spilled from beneath the hull to correct a slight weight imbalance someone in the hangar below had rigged a speaker so the sniper could hear what the radio announcer was saying as the airship made its final approach the voice was highpitched and excited well here it comes ladies and gentlemen were out now outside of the hangar and what a great sight it is a truly one its a marvelous sight its coming down out of the sky pointed towards us and towards the mooring mast the gunman pulled his riflea nitro express more befitting an african big game hunt than a sniperto his shoulder and waited the first of the heavy mooring lines was dropped from the bow he scoped the windows one more time then came the second mooring rope as ground workers began to haul the ship to the mast they looked like ants trying to drag a reluctant elephant its practically standing still now the announcer said growing more animated as he described the scene theyve dropped ropes out of the nose of the ship and its been taken ahold of down on the field by a number of men by moving the rifle barrel an inch the sniper found his target its starting to rain again the rain has slacked up a little bit the bullets in the rifle were of his own manufacture hed had only a day and a night to construct them and had only fired two as a test at a deserted gravel pit both had worked as hed designed but he still felt apprehension that they would fail to do the job hed been assigned herb morrisons voice on the speaker was reaching a fevered pitch as he described the landing the back motors of the ship are just holding it just enough to keep it from the rifle cracked the recoil was a brutal punch to the shoulder at two thousand feet per second the bullet took one point two seconds to reach its target in that sliver of time a coating around the special slug burned away revealing a whitehot cinder of burning magnesium unlike a tracer round which burned all along its trajectory the incendiary core of this round only showed in the last instant before it hit hydrogen needs air to burn a random spark could not have ignited it within the airships enormous gasbags only when hydrogen was released to mix in the atmosphere could something like this round cause an explosion but the bullet wasnt meant to ignite the gas at least not directly the sniper had fired along the spine of the hindenburg the intense heat of the bullet scored the zeppelins doped skin as it traveled down the length of the airship by the time it reached the tail fin it had lost enough velocity to hit the dirigible and lodge into the duralumin frame just as the magnesium burned itself out the waterproof paint a combination of nitrocellulose and aluminum powder began to smolder the doping agent on the cotton canvas skin was in fact a highly combustible mixture commonly used as fuel in solid rockets the smoldering turned into open flame that burned through the skin and sent flaming bits of cloth onto a gasbag the fire quickly holed the bag and allowed a gush of hydrogen to escape into the growing inferno herb morrisons voice turned into a horrified shriek it burst into flame it burst into flame and its falling its fire watch it watch it get out of the way the sky seemed to go black as if all the light at the airfield had been sucked into the explosion above the airship the stately approach of the hindenburg turned into frantic seconds as time telescoped its fire and its rising morrison cried its rising terrible oh my god what do i see its burning bursting into flame and its falling on the mooring mast and all the folks agree this is terrible this is one of the worst catastrophes in the world the flames are rising oh four or five hundred feet into the sky for seconds the ship hung in the air as the intense heat warped and melted her skeleton her outer skin rippled with the concussion then burned away the roar of burning gas and the intense heat was like standing at the open door of a blast furnace she fell stern first panicked ground workers racing from under her bulk one of them wasnt fast enough and was engulfed in wreckage as the zeppelin crashed to the earth inside his cabin on a deck chester bowie felt the ship lurch as her stern lost buoyancy he heard screams from the observation lounge and the sound of tumbling furniture as the airship dropped from the sky the ceiling above suddenly flashed redorange as the hydrogen exploded above him the ship dropped further the thunder of burning gas overriding the terrible screams of twisting metal as her frame collapsed he remained on his bed at first he thought hed just smile at the irony of it all but he found himself laughing instead he knew this was no accident the germans were willing to sacrifice their own dirigible to deny the united states gaining possession of what hed found theyd chased him halfway around the globe sabotaged the hindenburg to stop him and still he was one step ahead chester opened his mouth wider laughing even harder maniacal now it was just too funny the heat hit him then a solid wall preceding another gush of flame he died in an instant hearing his own laughter above the sound of the fire that consumed him the sniper watched for a second longer as the great airship plummeted its back broken when the bow slammed into the ground smoke and flame licked the heavens as the carcass melted its skeleton bowing under the thermal onslaught and then collapsing into a pile of melted girders and burning flesh its a terrific crash ladies and gentlemen the smoke and its flame now and the frame is crashing not quite to the mooring mast morrisons voice became a strident evocative sob that still echoes today oh the humanity central african republic present day cali woke to the mindless frenzy of gunfire with her hotel windows open the sound seemed amplified she tensed waiting for return fire from the jungle that would surely come instead she heard the steady beat of a heavy rain and then a burst of drunken laughter the local troops sent to oversee the evacuation of kivu had been drinking steadily since their arrival the lone officer sent to control them seemed to be the worst offender not even the six belgian peacekeepers the un had dispatched bothered to keep the soldiers from the booze or from smoking the potent marijuana called bhang cali remained on the floor where shed slept shed learned her first hour here that the piebald rug was home to far fewer insects than the bed mashed breasts were preferable to being eaten alive by fleas and god knew what else there had been no water in the hotel when shed arrived late yesterday so she smelled of sweat dirt and deet a rotten nights sleep had done nothing to relieve her aching body following the torturous drive from the capital bangui she rolled onto her back shed slept in shorts and a sports bra with her boots lightly laced her tongue was cemented to the top of her mouth and when she finally got it unstuck she found her teeth sticky dawn was slowly creeping over the town with the approaching sun the canopy of trees outside her room resolved themselves in shades of gray and silver mindful that light might attract a burst of gunfire from the drunken soldiers cali left her flashlight next to her bedding slid her arms into a bush shirt and cautiously went to the window the town clung on the muddy banks of the chinko river a tributary of the ubangi which eventually flowed into the mighty congo kivu had grown around colonial french plantations that had long since been reclaimed by the forest while mostly built of round mud huts thatched with reeds kivu boasted a cluster of concrete buildings arranged around a central square one was an abandoned government office that now housed the soldiers and another was her hotel optimistically named the ritz a twostory structure that was riddled with bullet holes after decades of civil war a quarter mile upriver lay a dirt airstrip that was still serviceable kivu was a tiny island surrounded by a forest sea an impenetrable expanse of trees and swamp that rivaled the amazon there was no electricity now that the owner of the general store had fled with his family and the towns only generator no sewer or running water and the only ready communications with the outside was the satellite phone in her rucksack kivu had changed little in a hundred years and it was unlikely to change much in the next century if it survived the week two weeks earlier reports had filtered in to the capital that a group of rebels had crossed the border from sudan and were making their way south in an effort to isolate the eastern third of the country it was now believed that the vanguard of caribe dayces army of popular revolution was a mere four days from kivu from here it was only thirty more miles to the ubangi river and the border with the congo the government of the central african republic planned to make their stand there outside the town of rafai however few believed the cars meager forces would prevent rafai from falling to dayce any people still in the region afterward would find themselves under the authority of a rebel who found inspiration in idi amin and osama bin laden cali muttered an oath under her breath the central african republic was one of the few nations that even the poorest of third world countries could look to and feel proud of their own success most midsized american companies had more revenue than the car the average person made less than a dollar a day there were few natural resources little infrastructure and absolutely no hope why someone would take the time to carve out a piece for himself defied logic caribe dayce would soon make himself the ruler of a few thousand square miles of nothing the rain slashed through a thin fog that oozed up from the river obscuring shapes and making the first stirrings of the townspeople look like ghosts meandering back to their graves a driver from a relief organization opened the door to his big volvo truck and fired the engine the first load of refugees for the day would be on their way out in a half hour or so with luck cali would make it the last miles up to where the scilla river emptied into the chinko this morning check her theory and be back on the road to bangui by noon she turned from the window first buttoning her shirt then using a rubber band she kept on her wrist to tame her red hair into a ponytail a baseball cap hid the rest of the snarls and tangles she brushed her teeth with bottled water and spit in the sink anchored to the wall outside the toilet cubicle she teetered over the seat rather than let her skin touch the filthy commode she didnt want to waste her precious water supply so she made do with a towelette from a foil packet to clean the sleep from her face using a hand mirror she applied spf lipstick although her hair was a deep shade of redthank you clairolshe still had the pale complexion of a carrottop with a generous dappling of freckles to match looking at her reflection in the kind light of the dawn cali admitted that even in these rough surroundings she managed to look years younger than thirtyseven in the past year her work had kept her away from home nearly eight months in places where she was hardpressed to find enough food to spend her per diem so she maintained her shape without becoming a slave to a health club shape she thought without looking down a nearly six foot bean pole with b cups no hips and a flat ass she didnt even have the green eyes the red heads in romance novels always seemed to possess hers were dark brown and while they were large and wideset they werent green her older sister had gotten those along with the boobs and the butt and all the other curves that had attracted men since shed hit puberty at least cali had gotten the lips as a child shed always been selfconscious about the size of her mouth like any adolescent she hated to stand out it was bad enough she had hair that shone like a beacon and that she was taller than all the boys in her class but shed also been given a mouth much too large for her face and lips that always looked swollen shed been teased about it from kindergarten then suddenly in her junior year of high school the teasing stopped that summer her face had matured and cheekbones had appeared graceful curves that transformed her mouth from something oversized into something sensual her lips gained a pouty ripeness that continued to spark carnal fantasies to this day cali packed her toiletries in her rucksack swept the dim room to make sure she hadnt forgotten anything and headed down to the hotels lobby the eightroom establishments reception area was an open space defined by arches along three walls at the back was the reception desk which doubled as a bar and a door leading to the kitchen a collection of mismatched chairs and tables dotted the flagstone floor beyond the arches the steamy rain came down in curtains the towns dirt square had turned into a quagmire a group of villagers huddled at the back of a truck for their turn to join the exodus their few meager possessions were carried in plaited grass bags or piled on their heads cali took a seat near the back of the lobby ah miss you are awake early as with many businesses in western and central africa the hotels owner was lebanese you can thank the assault rifle alarm clock cali said and accepted a cup of coffee she eyed the owner her expression asking the question yes yes yes the water was boiled i assure you he looked out beyond the falling rain the troops the government sent are no better than caribe dayces bandits i think if un had not sent observers the government wouldnt have even come for us i was in bangui yesterday cali told him its just as bad there people who can get out of the country are i know my cousins live there many believe that dayce will move on the capital after he takes rafai tomorrow i will join my family and we go to beirut at the end of the week will you come back of course he seemed surprised by her question dayce will eventually fail you sound sure miss this is africa eventually everything fails he went off to take the order of the truck driver whod just stepped out of the rain cali ate two of the plantains hed brought to her table and left ten dollars by kivus standards the lebanese was a wealthy man but she felt the need to give him something extra maybe just the knowledge that people on the outside still cared shed parked her rented land rover under a crude leanto in a dirt yard behind the hotel the rain drumming against its tin roof sounded like a waterfall she kept her head down as she slogged through the clinging mud so she didnt see the damage until shed slid under the leantos roof the four bullet holes in the rovers windshield werent the problem nor were the shattered headlights she could have even dealt with one of the tires being shot because there was a spare bolted to the vehicles rear cargo door it was the second front wheel lying deflated that did it hot rage boiled she whirled looking for a place to vent her anger the square was quickly filling with people desperate to leave the region some soldiers were trying to keep things orderly while others slouched negligently in doorways out of the rain none paid her any attention son of a bitch she muttered in frustration she could blame no one or everyone it didnt matter finding who shot up the fourwheel drive wouldnt fix it and without it she was as helpless as the refugees before she left the states one of the old hands in the office had told cali an expression that seemed strange at the time but now fit perfectly africa wins again the lebanese hotelier had said essentially the same thing everything fails here if it wasnt the weather it was the disease or the corruption or the sheer stupidity of drunken soldiers using her truck for target practice if it hadnt been so pathetic it would have been funny like a buster keaton farce where he keeps knocking himself down again and again as he bumbles through his day well this explains why the shots i heard were so loud she thought as she circled the land rover looking for other damage the lone spare mounted above the tailgate mocked her there wouldnt be a second spare in kivu so shed have to hitch a ride to rafai with the refugees not only was rafai bigger but the military was there in force and only a handful of businesses had closed if she got a second tire she could return in an empty truck coming back for the next group of evacuees and that would waste a day she was sure she didnt have she had landed in the car only two days ago thinking she would have at least a week to get her work done then shed heard about caribe dayces lightning thrust shed rushed to kivu as quickly as she could hoping she could get in and out before he overran the town could she lose a day and still do it were dayces men far enough out to give her the break she needed cali had no choice she would have to chance it with luck she would be back this afternoon shed reassess the situation then and make her decision about heading farther north shed phone in her report after first getting herself a place on one of the refugee trucks from her rucksack she withdrew a travel wallet and tucked two fifties into her shorts she dodged out of the leanto and ran back to the hotel her boots sucking at the clinging mud with each rushed pace the truck driver was hunched over his breakfast shoveling food into his mouth even before swallowing the previous bite two empty plates were stacked at his elbow a carton of marlboros rested on an adjacent chair the hotels owner wasnt leaving anything for dayce to loot so everything was going cheap she was about to approach when another heavy truck roared into town unlike the other vehicles this one had come in from the north in the open bed of the sixwheeled diesel were three dozen africans trying to keep a piece of plastic tarp over their heads when the truck braked in front of the hotel the mass of bodies shifted and gallons of water sluiced over the cab just as the driver jumped clear the full weight of the water poured over his head and ran down his open rain jacket he looked up through the beds stake sides and must have made a face because children suddenly started laughing cali watched as the white driver raked rain from his hair and flicked drops at the children eliciting more shrieks of delight she hadnt heard a child laugh since shed arrived in the country judging by the bundles of possessions being handed down from the truck these people had just fled their homes and somehow this man could make their children laugh she guessed he was an aid worker and they had known him for some time which meant he knew the situation up country she looked behind her the trucker would be at his meal for a while she stepped back into the rain and approached the stranger he paid her no attention as he helped people out of the truck handing infants to waiting mothers and steadying the arms of old men affording them dignity while making sure they didnt fall he was maybe an inch taller than cali and with his tshirt stuck to his chest she saw he had a powerful build not the grotesque muscles of a weight lifter but the lean physique of someone who worked hard for a living he must have finally felt her presence because he turned cali startled it was the eyes she realized instantly the man was handsome yes but his eyes a shade of gray like storm clouds were riveting shed never known such a color existed or could have imagined they would be so attractive hi he said an amused lift at the corner of his mouth hi cali replied before gathering herself you just came from the north thats right he said found these people wandering out of the jungle about twenty miles from here thought id give them a lift youre not an aid worker a lanky farmer passed a caged chicken down to the man he handed it to cali making her part of the human chain unloading the truck no im a geologist he held out a hand mercer my name is philip mercer his occupation took her by surprise as she absently took his hand for the second time in just a few moments cali startled even wet his palm was as rough as tree bark callused so that the skin picked against her own she felt strength in that fleeting touch but also something more assurance confidence kindness an utter lack of guileshe wasnt sure which or maybe all of them he held her gaze as he let her fingers drop and you are huh oh im cali stowe im with the cdc the centers for disease control in atlanta im a field researcher believe it or not disease is the last thing these people need to worry about right now he was american but had a trace of an accent that cali couldnt quite place so ive noticed she said mind me asking what youre doing here mercer slid a large iron cauldron from the truck and set it on the ground prospecting she laughed i always picture prospectors wearing union suits with picks over their shoulders and dragging a stubborn mule on a short rein only ass here is me im here doing a favor for a friend my friends ask me to go shopping or help talk through why their current boyfriend is a total creep you really have to learn to set boundaries it was mercers turn to laugh point taken what were you prospecting for coltan colombitetantalite mercer replied cali looked disinterested but he added its used in the capacitors for small electronics especially cell phones dont take this the wrong way but i hope you didnt find any there are already too many of those damned things in the world amen mercer agreed and no i didnt this was a unsponsored expedition some functionary from their economic development office in bangui heard about a hunter who claimed he found coltan on the chinko river more than likely hed smuggled it from uganda or the congo but the un guy saw it as an opportunity to create jobs in the area and get his ticket out of here punched no doubt probably ive spent the past six weeks shifting tons of worthless mud until i heard slaughter season was starting up again i waited as long as i dared then sent my workers out when i packed it in yesterday i found these people along the way listen i ah im planning on heading north tomorrow how bad is it mercer stopped unloading the truck to give her his full attention since this corner of the world isnt on many tourist maps i assume whatever youre doing here is important i wont try to talk you out of it but if you really need to head upriver do it today right now i cant cali admitted some hoppedup teenager used my truck for target practice this morning i have to go down to rafai to buy a spare tire then forget it he wasnt being dismissive or protective he was stating a fact as simply as he could cali appreciated that but she also had to ignore his advice i wish i could i have to go mercer pushed wet hair off his forehead cali thought he was calculating a price he wanted for his truck how far sorry how far do you need to go theres a village on the scilla river about a mile from where it empties into the chinko thats about a hundred miles north how important is this cali answered readily one of our researchers came across some medical records put together by a missionary in the late eighties no one had paid any attention to them it seems the people in this town suffer from the highest cancer rate on the planet the cdc believes there may be a genetic cause if we can isolate it well you can figure it out for yourself gene therapy to prevent cancer she nodded and possibly cure it i need to get blood and tissue samples and if you dont get there before dayce those people are either going to be dead or so scattered ill never find them cali finished for him thats why i rushed here as soon as i could youre talking about going further than id planned but ill take you you were going back up there cali couldnt believe it why do you think i unloaded the truck he said i passed a lot more people than i could carry on my way down here the governments not going to get them so someone has to his voice went grave just so were clear though were turning around at the first sign of trouble calis tone matched his this was her best and probably only shot you got it okay once i get this beast refueled were out of here thank you she said he grinned dont thank me until we come back why dont you wait in the cab out of the rain mercer watched cali slide around the battered ford but didnt know what to make of her he was sure that if he hadnt offered to drive her she would have followed her original plan it was in the stubborn set of her jaw but mostly it was the intensity of her eyes cali stowe believed in her mission and he couldnt imagine much that could deter her it was a trait he admired because there were few people left who had it one of the refugees hed driven down pressed two tomatoes into his hand as he fed diesel from the drum lashed behind the cab mercer was overwhelmed by the gesture this man had just lost everything he owned the home hed lived in probably since he was a child but still wanted to thank him with perhaps the only food hed have for as long as it took to get resettled mercer carefully inspected the tomatoes took the best for himself and handed the other back returning the better one would have been an insult the farmer touched mercers hand and nodded behind him his wife smiled her gratitude and hugged her children a little tighter mercers thoughts turned back to cali as a field researcher for the cdc he imagined shed been in some rough country before but he doubted shed seen anything like this yet shed shrugged off her car getting shot up as though it was a mere inconvenience that kind of confidence came from experience he doubted the cdc prepared people for this kind of thing so he guessed there was something else in her pastmilitary training perhaps that made him feel a little better about driving her north while he only had one weapon with him a beretta pistol he sensed she wouldnt freeze if he needed to use it and for all he knew she had her own gun the sudden image of her holding a drawn pistol spiked his pulse it was the capacity for violence juxtaposed with her delicate features and that sensual mouth uncharacteristically he acknowledged how attractive she was uncharacteristically because mercer hadnt thought of a woman in those terms in a long time not since a woman hed thought hed loved died eight months ago he then found himself circling the same argument hed faced since her death he hadnt told her he loved her until after she was gone until after there were no consequences to the declaration he still didnt know what that meant or if it had meaning at all hed talked about it with his best friend harrys advice was that he should mourn her for a while miss her probably forever but not let his guilt make her more than she was usually taking advice about women from harry was like asking a vegan to name a good steak joint however this time the old man had a point harry knew mercer better than anyone alive and knew how guilt drove him more than any other emotion the truth was it was a fear of guilt that drove mercer the fear that he could have done more but hadnt that is what pushed him so hard in his professional life he feared not being able to face the mirror knowing that somehow he had failed at something really at anything he attempted and rather than back down from challenges mercer continually set himself tougher and tougher goals he had no obligation to return north other than his own desire to help those who couldnt help themselves yet like so many men he avoided the challenges of his own emotional life rather than take time following tisa nguyens death hed buried himself in work soon after her funeral hed returned to the canadian arctic where he was under contract with debeers then it was off for two months on behalf of the brazilian government to head a task force investigating illegal gold mining in the amazon rain forest and then six weeks consulting in joburg followed by another couple of months working with geologists at nevadas yucca mountain nuclear repository as hed known the distractions hadnt healed the wounds but he felt the scars were less raw which was why he could see cali stowe as an attractive woman a gush of diesel erupted from the gas tank and mercer quickly shut the hoses valve his thoughts snapped back to the present he looked around chagrined people were struggling for their very lives while he was rediscovering the first flicker of his libido he coiled the hose around the bracket mounted behind the cab and hauled himself into the truck he slid out of his wet raincoat and stuffed it behind the seat cali had changed into a dry bush shirt and had used makeup to cover the dark circles under her eyes and freshen her lips she was probably in her midthirties but the freckles made her look like a teenager mercer smiled at her efforts yeah yeah i know typical woman cant go anywhere without makeup for your information ive been a field researcher for the cdc for five years in some places that make this look like paradise my makeup kit weighs exactly six ounces and i dont go anywhere without it with your fair complexion its a good idea cali stopped and looked at him her mouth creased upward in a surprised grin thank you you wouldnt believe the grief i get from some of the men ive worked with i spend seven or eight months a year away from home mercer told her i know how important the little things can be i worked with a guy in canada a while ago who carried the remote from his tv set he said holding it makes him feel hes back in his living room although it really pisses off his wife and kids cali laughed what about you anything you carry to make yourself feel better mercer turned serious not to sound dramatic but this helps he slid his beretta from behind his back and set it on the bench seat between them i thought you should know i have it she nodded lets just hope we dont need it the jungle began just five feet from the back of the towns last building an arcing canopy of greenery that met above the single dirt track so it was like driving through a living tunnel for the first half hour they passed miserable groups of refugees trudging south toward kivu mercer stopped at each to tell the refugees that if he had room hed give them a lift on the way back but to hurry nevertheless none of the locals had seen or heard dayces army but mercer and cali remained quiet and vigilant as they continued northward the rain started to slacken and even though the windshield wipers made a sound like nails on a chalkboard with each swipe mercer wouldnt turn them off too much water was dripping from the trees and if he had any hope of spotting an ambush he needed clear visibility two hours into their drive and an hour after seeing the last group of refugees they neared the swift scilla river the mud brown scilla was barely fifty feet wide where it swept into the chinko a ferry made of empty barrels lashed with wire and topped with corrugated metal was the only way to cross mercer was relieved to see that before hed fled the ferryman had punctured enough barrels so the flat craft was halfsunk on the near shore if caribe dayce had followed the chinko down from sudan which the rumors said he had he would have to track east for at least fifteen miles to where the river could be crossed on foot according to the report cali spoke for the first time in twenty minutes the village im looking for is about a mile to the left mercer peered into the jungle while the area where the two rivers met was relatively flat the scilla carved through a series of hills so its banks were steep dirt berms there was no road in just a narrow footpath meandering along the bluff that quickly grew to eighty feet in height he backed the truck next to the ferrymans abandoned hut and killed the engine it appeared silent for the moments it took for his hearing to return and then he caught the sound of the river the patter of water dripping from the trees an occasional bird cry ready he asked cali she eyed him are you taking your gun yes then im ready on the approach to the village mercer and cali passed what appeared to be an old openpit mine carved into the top of the bluff it was a maze of interconnected trenches that covered at least four acres one long wall acting as a dam to keep the filthy water trapped within from dumping down into the river mercer estimated the workings were at least ten feet deep but as flooded as they were they could have been deeper he paused at the lip of the main trench his back to the steep bank and the river he dropped to a knee taking a handful of damp soil in his hands and letting it sift from his fingers cali stood rapt at the edge of the trench for a moment before taking a small camera from her knapsack and snapping a dozen digital pictures judging by the erosion mercer guessed the site was at least fifty years old possibly older as he thought about the incongruity of such a mine he realized he might be able to pin down the exact year the mine was worked by whom and at the same time answer the mystery of the villages cancer rate he looked more closely at the surrounding topography noting that the far bank of the river was primarily dark granite while this side contained intrusive basalt i think you can forget your gene theory mercer stood wiping his hand on the seat of his pants cali gave him a wary look why do you say that im not positive we need to talk to the villagers someone old preferably come on can you give me a minute cali asked i need to powder my nose powder youroh sorry sure he stayed at the trench while cali meandered into the jungle he called to her dont go out of earshot peeing fetish she called back like to listen do you mercer could tell she was teasing watch usually dont worry im not going any farther than decorum requires after five minutes mercer called her name a minute she answered her voice strained jesus what do they call montezumas revenge in this part of the world mercer kept the instant concern from his voice in india ive heard it called hindu tush egypt its tuts curse or pharaohs fanny i dont think central africa has its own nom de poop cute her voice sounded a bit stronger a minute later she emerged from the jungle she looked none the worse for her troubles you okay yeah fortunately when i get the ah congo river runs it passes quickly no pun intended want me to carry your bag cali tightened the strap over on her shoulder no im fine the village sat atop the bluff with a commanding view of the river below ten or so acres of jungle had been cleared to raise crops manioc mostly several nearferal dogs roamed the round huts while a pair of staked goats watched mercer and calis approach with disinterest their bodies as scraggly as their beards it wasnt until they reached what passed as the village square that the first person came out to greet them a child of about six wearing an overly large manchester united tshirt that fell past her knees a woman in a print dress dashed from her rondavel and rushed the child back inside a moment later an old woman emerged from the same hut her face was perfectly round and so deeply wrinkled that the only way to see her eyes was by the light reflecting off them she leaned on a cane made of a tree root and wore a shapeless dress that completely covered her ample figure she said something in a dialect mercer didnt know an accusatory question by the tone her voice was a force of nature that startled birds into flight and sent one of the dogs slinking with its tail curled under its belly pardon madam mercer said in french parlezvous francais she stood as silent as a statue for a moment appraising the two white people then grunted something into the hut the childs mother emerged with the toddler clinging to her shoulder i speak english the young woman said haltingly better and better mercer gave her his best smile were american the matron said something else to the younger woman she lowered her child to the ground and went back into her hut when she reemerged she carried a low stool and set it on the ground behind whom mercer assumed was her mother or maybe grandmother with a groan the old woman lowered herself onto the stool mercer half expected the chair to collapse as the womans generous backside enveloped the seat mercer and cali approached a few paces and hunched down near the womans bare feet she smelled of wood smoke and animal dung in the doorways of other huts mercer could see eyes watching themmost of them female and all of them older where are all the young people cali asked gone into the jungle mercer said bitterly ive seen this happen before other places other wars with dayce on the move everyone who can takes off leaving those too old or infirm behind my god thats i know the young mother must have stayed behind to care for her elder though mercer couldnt understand why someone didnt take her baby when they fled he looked more carefully at the child and understood why she had a tumor on her neck the size of an orange an angry reddish mass that if left untreated would soon choke off her breathing cancer why would someone slow themselves down with a child who would die soon anyway you are very brave to stay mercer said slowly the woman said nothing but her wide eyes filled with tears i have a truck near the ferryboat that crosses the chinko river i can take you all with me to rafai as quickly as the tears welled they subsided and the womans stoic expression exploded with a smile tell the others to prepare he added we can leave in a few minutes you are from the government mercer didnt want to explain to her that her government had pretty much abandoned everyone north of kivu yes the woman shouted out to the villagers many of whom had stepped from their mud and thatch huts in seconds they ducked back into their homes to collect anything of value the younger people hadnt already taken when they ran away what do you know of the mine on the bluff overlooking the river she didnt respond so mercer said the holes dug into the hill do you know who did it she spoke to the old woman who in turn gave a lengthy reply punctuated by a wet cough a white man came when my grandmother was a child that put the time frame right in mercers mind he paid the men to dig many holes then he left with crates of dirt some time passed and then more men came they forced the men of our village to dig more holes and they took away even more dirt soon after did the people of your village get sick mercer touched his neck in the same spot where the little girl had her tumor the young mother clutched her daughters hand that is what my grandmother says many children die and many are born with she didnt have the words to describe the horrors of newborns deformed by the ravages of acute radiation poisoning many of whom probably never took a breath mercer turned to cali i think this is where the united states mined pitchblende during world war two i thought that came from the congo cali said quickly then stammered that is the stuff used in the atomic bomb right i saw a special on the history channel about the manhattan project a month ago i could have sworn they said we got our uranium ore from the congo im not sure mercer replied but someone mined something from here and judging by the womans age id guess around the second world war then a short time later the villagers begin suffering what sounds like radiation poisoning then its discovered this place has the highest cancer rate in the world the guy who did the initial medical survey probably thought the mine was irrigation canals or something and never put the pieces together usually pitchblende isnt dangerous it needs to be refined before radiation concentrations are high enough to cause illness but not here apparently the natural concentration of uranium was high enough to cause birth defects and cancer the old woman spoke to her granddaughter she went back into her hut and returned with something in her hands it slipped when she handed it to mercer he picked it up from the ground it was a metal canteen with a waterproofed canvas cover the olivedrab canvas was frayed and brittle but remarkably intact the metal was still bright it looked governmentissue to mercer he slid the canteen out of its cover and a scrap of paper fell to the ground written on it were the words property of chester bowie he showed it to cali thats an american name if there ever was one i think the history channel got it wrong the daughter translated what her grandmother was saying the first man he gave this to my grandfathers father the old woman pulled something from around her neck a leather thong she wore as a necklace hanging from it was a small copper object fastened to the leather by a tiny wire cage the second men the ones who came later gave her this the old woman handed the necklace to mercer the pendant was a misshapen bullet mercer looked at the woman confusion written on his face she hiked up her skirt to reveal one of her thighsized calves the black skin was puckered by a small scar on the outside and when she turned her leg he saw a much nastier exit scar the skin shiny and gray even after all these years they killed many of the workers when they were finished with the digging the daughter translated they used fast guns and just a few escaped into the jungle my grandfathers father and all his brothers died cali looked to mercer i dont understand the americans killed the miners to hide what theyd done i cant believe that mercer replied even with the evidence in his hand i know the whole project was shrouded in secrecy but i just cant see americans systematically killing innocent villagers if not us then mercer never let cali finish her question it was the brief instant of silence the absence of the omnipresent jungle sounds that launched him into action in one swift movement he shoved her into the dirt covering her body with his own as automatic fire erupted from behind them the barrage struck all three generations of women the old woman took two slugs in her chest the fat rippling with the impact before she fell back off her stool her granddaughter and greatgranddaughter were stitched across the stomach and head both dead before their bodies hit the earth banshee cries and more gunfire followed as elements of caribe dayces army attacked the isolated hamlet mercer caught a glimpse of a teenage rebel soldier with an ak nearly as long as he was tall his young body shuddered as though he was holding a live wire when he fired the weapon into a hut mercers first instinct was to save as many people as he could from the onslaught but with only a single pistol he knew he didnt have a prayer so he opted for his second choice and that was to save himself and cali the truck was a mile away and it would take the rebels at least ten minutes to satisfy their bloodlust they had a chance if no one saw them he rolled off cali grabbed her knapsack and started to slither toward the old womans hut he felt cali respond to the tug and follow him the huts mud walls hid them from the rebels but otherwise offered no practical protection once inside he got to his feet locked eyes with cali in the dim light to make sure she was okay then kicked out the back of the hut a thin strip of vegetation ran along the crest of the bluff before it dropped to the river he considered making a dash for the water but there was no cover on the sloping bank theyd be cut down long before they reached the water and even if they made it the river offered no cover they were trapped between the army of caribe dayce and the scilla he led cali into the hedge not knowing when hed drawn his pistol but not surprised it was in his hand a round chambered the safety off hed also given cali her pack to free both of his hands the attack had originated from farther upstream so mercer pressed cali ahead of him if they were caught from behind he would take the first rounds and hoped his sacrifice would see her clear they stayed low and mercer kept a hand on her back to steady her pace quick movement would catch the eye of even the least trained soldier a gush of smoke overwhelmed them as the rebels put a hut to the torch someone within screamed as the thatched roof ignited as though it was soaked in gasoline the scream was ended abruptly when the roof collapsed in an explosion of sparks there seemed to be no break in the gunfire as soon as one weapon went silent another rebel found a target and opened up mercer didnt dare look at the carnage behind him as he and cali threaded their way through the thin tangle of trees and ferns hed seen it before hed been orphaned by such an attack not five hundred miles from here his hand on calis back was as much to steady her as it was for himself fifty yards from the edge of the village the strip of jungle ran out mercer and cali paused keeping low in the shadows of a tree mercer finally looked back smoke billowed from several huts and indistinct figures moved through the haze some firing weapons others dropping no one seemed to be looking in their direction dayce had assumed his attack would overwhelm the village so quickly that there was no need to station sentries on the perimeter the mine was another hundred yards away the trenches would provide cover and beyond it the jungle grew thick and impenetrable mercer surveyed the ground picking his route through the barren land while another part of his brain dealt with the adrenaline overload that was flooding his system next to him cali seemed to be faring better her eyes were wide her body loose and ready well make it she whispered adjusting her pack so it rode high on her shoulders i know he forced confidence into his voice they struck out commando crawling across the damp ground and had made half the distance when mercer saw a pair of rebels cross the dike separating the mine from the edge of the bluff dayce had sent pickets the rebels were coming at a jog anxious to join in the slaughter they would spot the two prone americans in a matter of seconds mercer was an expert with the beretta but he had no chance at this range there was no cover nearby nothing to hide them he had no choice and brought the pistol to bear his mouth had gone stone dry he watched them come two boys with bandoliers crossing their thin chests sandals made of truck tires on their feet their aks battered but serviceable they were thirty yards off when one finally spotted mercer and cali lying on the ground his mouth opened in a surprised o his partner saw the duo an instant later and his face went savage he shifted his weapon to fire mercer had his sight picture and pulled the trigger the gun bucked the first rebel went down the next shot was hurried and mercer was positive the round went high but the second rebel dropped his ak clutching his shoulder and began to wail as he collapsed cali and mercer were up on their feet before the youth had fully fallen they ran stride for stride accelerating like sprinters out of the blocks eating distance with each pace the distinctive crack of the pistol had created an eerie lull in the gunfire behind them it lasted just long enough for mercer and cali to cover another thirty yards before rebels began firing in their direction they covered another ten yards before the gunmen calmed themselves enough to aim hornet swarms of millimeter rounds cut the air around the fleeing pair stitching fistsized craters in the dirt at their feet a round hit something solid in calis pack and the force of the impact saved her life she pitched to the ground as a half dozen rounds sped through the space where her head had been mercer barely broke stride as he dragged her back to her feet then bodily tossed her into the trench now three yards away she rolled with the impact and fell into the ditch as mercer leapt over her hitting the far wall of the eightfootwide trench and sliding into the fetid water are you okay he gasped spitting a mouthful of water cali stripped off her pack taking just a moment to examine the bullet hole she tossed it aside and nodded wordlessly her cheeks flushed and her breathing coming in irregular gulps come on mercer took her hand and began wading through the thighdeep water it would take less than a minute for the rebels to reach the openpit mine mercer and cali had to lose themselves in the labyrinth and then find a way back out they halfran halfswam their feet sliding on the slick mud of the trenchs floor mercer led her into the interior of the maze so that gunmen at the perimeter couldnt simply pick them off he had no idea how many of dayces men would come all of them probably but with four acres of trenches to cover he doubted the rebel leader had enough troops to fully encircle the mine the dirt walls were sheer and all the corners were still sharp their view of the leaden sky was reduced to angular ribbons like walking through a scaleddown version of manhattans canyons mercer hadnt taken a close enough look at the mine to know the way out of it but his acute sense of direction had been honed through years working in the threedimensional network of tunnels in coal gold and diamond mines and while the sun was hidden behind storm clouds he could judge its direction and thus maintain his own two minutes after tumbling into the trench mercer estimated they were a quarter of the way across he heard voices behind them far enough away that he knew the men had just reached the lip of the workings but close enough to make him quicken their pace a soldier fired off half of his aks banana magazine his cohorts cheered him on the rebels didnt have a clue where their quarry had gone do you know where youre going cali asked after another minute not exactly mercer admitted but we need to get away from the river where dayce is sure to station troops along the main trench i think our best hope is to get to the opposite side of the mine nearest the jungle and hope we can make a break for it lead on macduff some of the trenches were long straight galleries while others deadended or branched into innumerable side channels as he ran mercer scanned the edge of the trenches above them in case rebels had managed to reach the interior earthworks and were searching for them they rounded yet another corner damn what is it that tree branch leaning against the left wall we passed it a minute ago were circling ourselves mercer looked back the way theyd come then glanced at the sky he could no longer tell where the sun had hidden itself behind the scudding clouds it began to drizzle he turned around and led cali the way theyd come feeling a slight hesitation in her step he didnt blame her the young rebel had already killed three people today but wanted more his friend simi would be able to cut six new notches on his aks already serrated stock he had managed to jump the outside trench and had been running along the top of the maze in his search for the whites suddenly he saw where the normally calm water sloshed against the side of the channel they were near he kept running his rubber sandals mere inches from the lip of the trench he turned another corner and saw them they were below him running in his direction their legs hidden by the water their heads down he skidded to a stop and was about to fire when something slammed into his shoulder his feet slid out from under him as he fell he managed to twist himself and clutch the ground before sliding into the trench his assault rifle pinned uselessly under his chest his feet scraping against the trench trying to climb back out mercer stopped and raised his pistol yet hesitated to fire at the defenseless wounded boy who knew how many people this child warrior had killed how many women hed raped how much suffering hed caused at that moment it didnt matter mercer couldnt shoot him in cold blood instead he ran forward and grabbed the boys skinny ankle the rebel shouted out to his comrades as mercer yanked him off the wall the boy splashed into the water and before he could regain his equilibrium mercer fired a straight right fist into his face with a broken nose and several loose teeth the boy would be unconscious for hours mercer made sure the kid wouldnt drown tucked his beretta into the flat holster sewn into the back of his pants and took the ak who had shot the kid he wondered could there be government troops in the area is that who took out the second rebel when he and cali were pinned in the open because mercer was sure his second shot had gone high a shadow passed over his face he whirled firing from the hip the first two rounds blew dirt from the lip of the trench the other three punched blooming crimson holes in the chest of another rebel an instant later a third rebel ducked his head over the parapet keeping out of view he swung his weapon and sprayed the trench with a full magazine his shots went wild as the assault rifle bucked in his hand mercer and cali raced around the next corner a moment later came an anguished cry as the rebel peeked over the rim of the mine and saw the cloud of blood forming around the friend hed just finished off the rebel and three others jumped into the trench and started after the whites hand in hand mercer and cali ran on staying in the shorter stretches of trench trying to keep from being spotted but mercer knew their wake was as easy to follow as a trail of bread crumbs at the next corner he pushed cali ahead of him and flattened himself against the wall the pursuing rebels made no effort at silence coming on like charging crocodiles mercer waited another two beats then rounded the corner the ak was at his shoulder and he had complete surprise he killed the first before they were even aware they were being ambushed the second went down an instant later the third dove flat and mercer fired his last two rounds into the spot where hed sunk the body floated to the surface two neat holes in his back mercer threw the gun aside and took off after cali he caught up with her just as she rounded another corner twenty paces away a rebel stood in the center of the trench a rocket launcher tucked under his arm mercer and cali both dropped into the water as the rpg punched out of the launcher and ignited a blazing trail of fire and smoke corkscrewed down the trench and hit the far wall the projectile detonated an instant later blowing a twelvefoot hole in the dam separating the flooded trenches from the steep riverbank mercer erupted from the water pistol in hand the instant his vision cleared he put two rounds in the terrorists chest as he fell back he realized what had happened with the dam breached by the rpg the stagnant water began to rush through the opening worrying at it eroding the sides so the hole doubled in size in seconds caught in the inexorable pull he and cali were swept along with the current neither could dig their heels into the muck at the bottom of the trench or find purchase on the crumbly walls water swelled through the cleft a remorseless torrent that bore them like so much flotsam mercer cursed and cali clung to his arm as they were sucked through the opening they went airborne for what seemed like forever before crashing to the ground tumbling in the flood and sliding down the bank amid a batterthick sludge of water and mud they cartwheeled over each other and the beretta was stripped from mercers grip when they hit the river they were pushed far out into the stream but were so disoriented they couldnt seize the opportunity to escape together they struggled back to the bank choking and coughing up water with every painful breath mercer pushed cali ahead of him as they floundered back to land neither looked up until theyd dragged their upper bodies from the surprisingly cold river the man was huge six four at least with a broad chest and a head like a cannonball he wore fatigues new boots a leather vest made of some animal hide was all that covered his muscled upper body his features were cold and distant while his sunglasses mirrored the pitiable figures at his feet the holster belted around his waist was big enough to carry a railroad gun he took an unlit cigar from between his teeth and gave a short derisive laugh welcome to hell mr cia man the looming rebel removed his sunglasses revealing deepset fanatical eyes i am general soon to be emperor caribe dayce central african republic bound at the wrists mercer and cali were dragged back up the riverbank to the village and dumped into one of the few surviving huts the men took everything from their pockets and performed an exhaustive search of calis breasts and between her legs by their expressions there was little doubt what was in store for her when dayce was done with them two of the men remained outside the hut while the others went on to continue ransacking the small village to a chorus of screams and rifle fire i think were going to be okay mercer whispered shuffling across the dirt floor so he could lean next to cali their clothes were soaked and despite the tropical heat he could feel her shivering are you out of your mind she hissed her eyes wide in an hour or two youre going to be shot and im going to be raped to death no listen to me i dont think were alone the kid who fell into the mine hed been shot in the back and the second guerilla who went down just before we reached the trench i dont think i hit him i think theres another force out there who took them out a rival faction or maybe government troops id like to think so she said in return but doesnt it make a little more sense that they were shot by their own men please be quiet and let me think for a second cali didnt get her second caribe dayce wedged his considerable bulk into the thatched hut seemingly dropping its temperature by ten degrees just with his presence he didnt remove his sunglasses in the dim recess of the rondavel the clouds of smoke wafting from his cigar masked the stench of abject poverty blood dribbled from the bottom of his knife scabbard forming a black pool in the dirt as he hunkered down to stare at his seated captives the cia must not think too much of me to send just two of you and one is a woman dayce spoke slowly in english with a deep commanding voice we arent from the cia cali said before mercer could buy a little time by replying in french i am from the centers for disease control the cdc ah dayce said as if hed heard of the organization that is the arm of the cia that controls disease and spreads it among the people of africa by pretending to vaccinate our children no it is not part of the cia cali replied hotly im here to prevent the spread of disease i hope to save your children he casually backhanded her mercer stiffened and dayces enormous pistol was suddenly pressed between his eyes next lie i use my fist you are here to spread aids and to give me aids like how the cia tried to kill brother fidel by overwhelming cuba with pigs it took mercer a moment to realize dayces warped sense of history had led him to believe the bay of pigs invasion was quite literally an invasion by a bunch of pigs in another time and place he would have laughed you are assassins sent to kill me and end my revolution he switched his attention back to cali you carry the disease yes i am supposed to want you because you are white and when we are done you will tell me i have the slim yes cali scoffed in a display of bravado or idiocy were here to assassinate you with a disease that takes years to kill and you he turned back to mercer never once lessening the pressure of the gun between his eyes what disease do you carry at that moment mercer saw a white man pass by the rondavels open door he was dressed for combat and carried a machine pistol slung under his arm he moved with an easy professional grace almost like a shadow in the smoke of burning huts he had to be from the un one of the belgian soldiers on guard in kivu sent north to hasten the evacuation of the region and if there was one there had to be more mercer swiveled his eyes back to caribe dayce and kept all trace of emotion from his voice optimism the african guerilla leader rocked back on his heels and laughed that is something that you cant spread in africa i know dayce got to his feet remaining in a stooped position because the hut wasnt tall enough he holstered his sidearm i think we will not take chances with the two of you i decree that you are cia spies and sentence you to death execution is at sundown did you see him mercer asked as soon as dacye had walked out of earshot tension ran from cali so her body sagged against his yes jesus i did who is he i think hes a un peacekeeper and he wont be the only one they must be getting into position get ready to bolt as soon as they attack can you get your hands free i cant even feel my hands doesnt matter as soon as they attack well kick out the back of the hut and drop straight for the river the trucks only a mile downstream all we need is three minutes head start and were gone they crawled to the back of the hut and braced their feet against the wall one or two good kicks would likely knock the entire structure down the tall riverbank was only a couple of yards beyond the hut for the first minutes mercer felt adrenaline sing in his veins as he waited for the inevitable assault but after five his body relaxed as his mind began to wander the un soldiers had to have seen their capture they wouldnt wait until the last minute before attempting an attack granted they were outnumbered but mercer had taken out a half dozen rebels and he had nowhere near their combat training more experience maybe but not training even if they didnt attack dayces entire force they must know where he and cali were being held and could rescue them after another couple of minutes cali pushed back to a sitting position her lower lip quivering slightly were wrong you cant be sure she composed herself and gave him a wry smile while mimicking caribe dayces voice you cant spread optimism in africa she looked at him levelly if there really is a un force out there theyll wait until after sundown to attack thats what i would do in their position making it a bit late for us her easy grasp of military tactics was at odds with what shed told him about herself again mercer wondered if shed been in the military who are you i told you im with the cdc and before that how long were you in the army what makes you think no one who hasnt seen combat is as calm as you she looked away i was captured by sunni insurgents in baghdad in they couldnt pull a jessica lynch for me because no one knew i was missing what were you doing there medic in the national guard i got separated from my unit just before they ran into an ambush it took three days for our guys to recover our humvee and realize mine wasnt one of the four burned bodies another five days passed before special forces got me out mercer was about to ask why the media never picked up the story but he stopped himself he imagined that military censors quashed it the reasons would forever be locked in a file someplace and in her heart a tense silence filled the hut even the village had gone quiet i wasnt raped cali said softly after a minute im sorry i said i wasnt raped i just wanted you to know im scared shitless right now but the iraqis didnt touch me and im relieved that dayces men wont get to me either im grateful for that too was all mercer could think to say although it put his wrist in an awkward position he reached out as much as the binds would allow and took calis hand she returned the grip and together they waited for a rescue that seemed less likely with each passing second a half hour before the sun set on the overcast day the final flicker of hope vanished when the white soldier they had seen crossing the camp suddenly stepped into the hut in the glow of the lantern he carried they could see he was as large as caribe dayce and equally muscled his features were eastern european with thinning blond hair and thick slack lips one of his eyes was hidden by a black patch that couldnt cover all of a scar that ran from his temple to his nose his other eye was watery blue and small but held dark malevolence whatever had taken his eye had damaged the tear ducts because the patch was moist and he wiped at it with a finger absently as he regarded the two prisoners mercer knew the type hed even run across a few the man was special forces from the former warsaw pact now turned mercenary spurned by the countries whod trained them to be killers many elite soldiers had sold their skills on the open market while western governments concentrated on keeping russian nuclear scientists from trading their skills with terror organizations ranks of highly specialized soldiers had gone to the very same terror groups to train the next generation of fighters while the fear of a nuclear device falling into the wrong hands was very real a perhaps more immediate threat was thousands of fundamentalists with skills rivaling the best special force troops in the world caribe dayce entered the room and slapped the mercenary on the shoulder the man whirled dayce recoiled he had an army of soldiers at his command a reputation of brutal savagery and the confidence that came from his huge size and still he feared the mercenary what have they told you the mercenarys accent was thick slavic or russian and his voice was as deep as dayces there is nothing they can tell us the rebel leader said with a touch of deference we will find what we find as i said i do not like that they are here when we arrived i dont either poli dayce agreed my men saw them enter just before the attack whatever they learned will die with them here we do not know who sent them they are american it must be the cia the mercenary looked mercer up and down then gave cali the same scrutiny he didnt appear impressed by what he saw i do not think they are cia then torture us and find out you stupid son of a bitch calis outburst startled all three men mercer tightened his grip on her hand to steady her but she continued jam bamboo shoots under our nails cover us in hot coals do whatever you want in the end you will know that i work for the centers for disease control in atlanta and mercer is here on behalf of the un in case it escaped you your little revolution has caused a humanitarian crisis that has killed god knows no you know how many people and forced thousands to flee their homes poli regarded her for a moment as cali struggled to get her breathing under control he said nothing and backed from the rondavel dayce followed him out and a moment later four teenage guerillas stormed into the hut since dayces pronouncement earlier mercer and cali had known this was coming but now the moment of reckoning was here cali screamed and mercer struggled to his feet he kicked the gun from one rebels arms and threw himself bodily at a second knocking the skinny youth to the ground and landing on him with his full force the teens breath exploded in mercers face a rank combination of stale liquor and rancid meat mercer headbutted him to keep him down and was just getting his legs untangled from the youths when a third soldier rammed the stock of his ak into his kidney mercer recoiled from the strike searing agony radiating from the blow the guerilla tried to repeat the attack mercer managed to roll enough so the wooden butt slammed into the back of his thigh deadening his leg he continued to roll as the soldier rained blows swinging the assault rifle like a club mercer came up against the huts wall and frantically tried to kick his way through it was a test of endurance between the rondavels rickety walls and his ability to absorb punishment but as fate would have it the wall was the huts strongest and a particularly sharp blow to the back of his head knocked mercer momentarily unconscious the rebel clubbed mercer once more for good measure then he and his partner hauled him to his feet cali had been subdued in the first seconds of the melee with a rifle butt to her lower abdomen that nearly ruptured her bladder they were both dragged outside where several excited soldiers waited in the villages central clearing only two huts remained the rest were smoldering piles of ash a short line of men waited outside the second hut they joked with each other with nervous gibes and toothy grins as they waited their turn with whoever was alive inside two wooden poles had been rammed into the loamy soil behind an odd stone pillar mercer was dimly aware of the strange columns size about seven feet and how it was shaped like an obelisk before he was turned and thrust up against one of the poles cali fell as she was pushed against the second one a rebel hauled her to her feet while another tied her bound wrists to the pole mercer tried to fight off his two guards but was eventually secured as well dayce ambled over to them examining the glowing tip of his cigar in the fading light there was no sign of the mercenary any last requests sorry but i cant spare one of my cigars maybe one of my men will give you a cigarette instead general dayce mercer began he was about to beg for their lives and he stopped himself dayces bemused expression showed hed been in this position countless times and enjoyed the entreaties for mercy mercer wasnt going to give him the satisfaction if he was going to die he wanted it at least partially on his terms i want to give the order to fire dayces expression changed slightly he nodded and gave a deep barking laugh you are a man i see i respect that he shouted to the four men milling a short distance off the firing squad one of them gave mercer a thumbsup gesture im no man mercer said not like you think dayce patted mercers cheek in that case die well no man what the hell are you doing cali whispered as dayce moved off to form up his troops when the shooting starts drop to your butt what do it think we can dodge the bullets like in that matrix movie you never know the four troopers had formed their firing line caribe dayce stood to their right and slightly behind he had his big pistol in hand to administer the coup de grace poli the mercenary stood a dozen or so yards behind them idly wiping a tear from under his eye patch make your count the men held their weapons low at their waists their eyes bright with the prospect of killing two more people mercer glanced at calis profile her face was rigid while her chest heaved mercer she cried softly i dont want to die drop to the ground like i said mercer looked beyond the firing squad even beyond the mercenary where shadows played at the edge of the jungle make your count no man or i will do it for you as loudly and with as much authority as he could muster mercer shouted at the ready in unison four kalashnikovs snapped to port arms all around them the rebels watched the proceedings with fascination most of them had left their weapons outside the hut they used to rape any of the women theyd captured cali began to whimper mercer waited as long as he dared never taking his attention off dayce judging the mans impatience to the second just as the guerilla was about to speak mercer whispered to cali dont forget what i said then tensed for the inevitable he shouted take your aim guns came up to shoulders the men settling into their stances as their fingers sought triggers mercer flicked his eyes to the jungle perimeter then back to dayce he opened his mouth wide to fill his lungs fire erupted from all quarters of the jungle the four men making up the firing squad were scythed down like wheat caribe dayce was stitched from thigh to head from two different directions his body exploding under the onslaught the men whod preferred to keep their place in line at the hut rather than enjoy a ringside seat at the execution were taken at the same instant shot through the head with a pistol by a figure dressed in black who had materialized behind them the assassin slipped into the hut and two more shots rang out any of the rebels holding weapons were targeted next one managed to counterfire and was gunned down with half his neck vanishing in a gout of blood next came any soldier who made for his rifle some dropped to the ground to crawl to the cache while others ran doubled over it didnt matter the unseen gunmen found their marks and the guerillas died those that tried to flee into the jungle were shot in the back those that turned to beg for mercy were shot in the front at the instant of attack poli was far enough from the mass of rebel soldiers to escape immediate detection rather than run and draw attention to himself he eased to the ground and edged toward the river embankment crawling so slowly that in the fading light he looked like nothing more than a faint breeze blowing through the undergrowth when he reached the steep hill he slowly rolled over the precipice and slid down the unprotected face keeping his arms and legs spread to maintain a slow pace he allowed himself to roll into the water without making a splash filled his lungs with as much air as his powerful chest could hold then struck out underwater for the far shore he surfaced near a felled tree and drew himself from the water with the patience of a crocodile stalking a shore animal despite his exposure he crawled slowly and steadily knowing a sniper with a night scope could easily pick him off but he reached the top of the escarpment and faded into the jungle by the time the firing in the village stopped he was a half mile away and eating ground with every pace mercer hadnt told cali about seeing the shadowy figures encircling the village because he wasnt sure if hed really seen them himself they were like wraiths hints of movement rather than solid form he hadnt wanted to give her false hope again his whole charade about wanting to give the command to fire was his way of helping his rescuers if they really existed as soon as the first rounds raked the firing squad he dropped to his backside and leaned as far over as he could trying to present as small a target as possible he couldnt shout to cali over the din of automatic fire but he saw she had followed his lead shed even managed to flatten herself to the ground using some doublejointed maneuver the onesided firefight lasted less than five minutes dwindling to silence as the unknown force picked off the last of the rebels whod fled into the night in all one hundred and fortyeight wellarmed guerillas had been massacred the mysterious attackers had done what neither the central african republics army nor the un had been able to do when it was over mercer stood on shaky legs hed hoped for this but the aftermath left him drained cali didnt bother to stand she lay back against her pole her eyes shut you knew they were out there she finally asked i suspected you werent going to tell me i didnt think youd believe me youre right i would have thought it was a lame attempt at being gallant and i would have died thinking you were a misogynist jerk and now she finally looked over well youre not a misogynist and then she rewarded him with a tired smile a few seconds later mercer felt someone behind him he stiffened before feeling a knife slice through the ropes securing his wrists when he tried to turn to face his rescuer strong hands clamped the sides of his head do not turn around the voice was pitched low and expressionless as if masking an accent keys rattled next to mercers ear these were in dayces pocket the two men he sent to search for your vehicle have been dispatched take your woman and go never return here the man thrust the keys into mercers hand along with two other items you dropped these it was the canteen and the necklace made from the bullet that the old woman had worn who are you that is not your concern go but you leave in five seconds or die in six we give you this chance for our own reasons take your womans hand cali was moved next to mercer her fingers locking with his their palms tight walk straight forward until you reach your truck then drive to rafai tell them dayce is dead and then never come back to this area again as soon as the unseen man released mercers skull an accomplice racked the slide on a pistol to emphasize his point cali and mercer needed no further urging as if they were soldiers on parade they marched in lockstep from the ruins of the village bodies rigid eyes straight ahead only after theyd made their way along the dike separating the mine from the riverbank and climbed up from the cut left by the rpg did cali finally ask what the hell just happened back there who were those guys mercer noted they were still holding hands i dont know that wasnt another rebel faction they fought like commandos and the guy who spoke sounded white although not american could they have been un if they were why not let us go with them no this is something else that warning about not returning to the area they were here to protect something and i dont think its coincidence that they got here the same day as caribe dayce or us for that matter do you think they were here all along keeping watch over the village mercer thought it over it was possible with one glaring exception if they were here to protect the village why allow dayce to slaughter everyone and rape the few that survived its something else the old mine i cant think of anything else but why thats something i plan on finding out well this is kind of out of both our purviews not mine mercer answered she glanced over startled by the mettle in his voice how so there was never any easy way for mercer to explain his parttime position with the government without sounding like he was boasting he usually just told it straight two years ago i was hired as a consultant to the president of the united states my title is special science advisor because my work like yours takes me to some pretty hostile places i act as an intelligence gatherer for anything that could threaten the united states youre a spy no not like that mercer reconsidered well kind of if i come across anything out of the ordinary when im in the field i write it up and forward it along to a deputy national security advisor named ira lasko truth be told ive only passed on a couple of things in the two years since i agreed to take the job and nothings ever come of them and you are going to follow up on this cali we just saw a village butchered and then some other mystery group come out of nowhere and annihilate the vanguard of a rebel army how could i not follow up on it they had reached the truck it was almost dark the jungle canopy was a silvery gray and the waters of the chinko river ran black they spied curious puffy white shapes milling around the battered cargo truck mercer held out a hand to take calis wrist and lower her to the ground a pair of figures stepped from the far side of the vehicle mercer cursed himself for not retrieving his beretta it was hard to make out details but both people carried something long in their hands weapons one of the figures brushed aside one of the odd pale shapes and it protested with an angry bleat they were sheep as soon as mercer realized it the details came into focus it was a man and a woman they had just forded the river with the twentyfive or so sheep to flee dayces army the animals must represent the sum of their wealth as mercer and cali watched a pair of naked toddlers joined their parents the mother lifted the youngest to a hip and allowed him to slide her breast from her blouse and begin to feed what do you think cali asked mercer was pretty sure that all of the men with dayce were dead but he couldnt take the chance a few were still out in the jungle he couldnt leave these people here vulnerable he stood holding his arms wide in a friendly gesture as the familys father saw him and lowered his staff as if to joust it was all just too bizarre but that was africa mercer chuckled i think were making our escape from the car with a frightened family and a flock of wet sheep it took mercer and cali three days to get from rafai to the capital bangui and from there a flight to lagos and finally to new yorks kennedy airport to mercer it seemed the closer to home she got the more withdrawn cali stowe became he suspected it was a defense mechanism to distance herself from the horrors of the past days she had compartmentalized the episode and was slowly building a wall around the memory locking it deep in her soul so it would only return as nightmares and given time even those would fade mercer recognized the technique hed done it himself dozens of times hed seen savagery on a scale cali couldnt possibly conceive not the slow death by international apathy someone from the cdc would witness in refugee camps or in rural aids clinics but wholesale violence for violences sake hed seen wars on four continents regional dustups that barely made the evening news but left thousands dead hed rescued enslaved miners in eritrea and hed held a woman he loved in his arms as she died harry white had been in a particularly philosophical mood one night not long after tisa nguyens death and told mercer that god didnt place a burden on a person that he felt couldnt be handled look at job harry had said by way of example the guy had it all when god took it awayfamily money friends health the whole magilla but god also knew old job could take it you soldier on harry had continued you take the shit life tosses at you and keep on going theres really only one alternative yeah i could turn into a bitter drunk like you mercer had replied hanging out in a bar twelve hours a day waiting for some dupe to pick up your tab harry had grinned at that his lopsided grin that turned the eightyyearold rogue into an eightyearold scamp if only for an instant thats exactly the alternative im talking about but in a way harry had a point and his words had stuck mercer did soldier on maybe what hed seen and done in his life clouded his once crystalline beliefs forced him to search through the shades of gray but the core was still there the ability to find the good amid the rotten and hold on to it while the rest eroded with time he sensed that cali worked the same way in a week or a month shed look back and recall an episode from her trip maybe their profanityladen struggle to load twentyseven damp sheep into the truck and she would smile that would also bring back the panic shed felt in the village and the smile would fade but so too would the intensity of that fear in six months or a year shed still smile at the sheep and maintain just a vague unease about the rest in order to do all that she needed distance distance from africa and distance from mercer he understood and as she waited with him at the us airways counter they exchanged phone numbers and made indeterminate plans to stay in touch both knew they wouldnt however there was comfort in the ritual well good luck with your search cali said stiffly and im sorry about yours she shot him a puzzled look your cancer research it had sounded promising oh i think i got carried away when i first read about that village and ignored the number one rule in medical research there are no shortcuts where will you go next thats up to the cdc though i wont be putting in for any new assignments for a while i think ill stick to a desk until her voice trailed off mercer took both her hands made sure she was looking into his eyes then leaned in and kissed her gently on the corner of her mouth it was perhaps a bit more intimate than he intended but he had to feel the texture of her full lips if even just a sliver they were softer than hed imagined good luck cali stowe good luck oh my god i cant remember your first name ive just been calling you mercer dont worry he smiled everyone does their eyes remained locked steady he held on to her strong fingers a moment longer and she let him both knew this was the last theyd see of each other it was awkward but charmingly so had they met at another time in another place theyd have been making plans for a date not saying goodbye forever just before he released her cali impulsively returned his kiss her lips didnt linger and she turned her red hair flaring catching sunlight and reflecting back like spun copper goodbye she was swallowed immediately by the throng of commuters and tourists a few moments later an elderly woman in line behind mercer tapped his elbow her hair was a white bush her eyes blue and friendly its none of my business but i think you should go after her young man mercer looked to where cali had vanished i think youre probably right but such is life yes i suppose making mistakes is how we learn mercer smiled at her you think im making a mistake letting her go only you can answer that she pointed theres a spot open at the counter mercer grabbed the bag hed bought in lagos containing chester bowies canteen and the mashed bullet the old woman in the village had shown him he took one step toward the counter then turned suddenly thank you maam you go ahead he dashed out of line he moved quickly through the terminal hoping to spot the flash of calis hair above the crowd already he was composing what hed say to her this is stupid i think were attracted to each other and i dont think its right that circumstance should bring us together only to force us apart i know you want to put everything behind you i do too but i also think one date wouldnt kill us i can be in atlanta the day after tomorrow i just have to file a report with my contact at the un adam burke if she said no she said no it would only cost him an hours delay until the next flight to reagan national but if she said yes then maybe it would help heal a little of the loneliness that had dogged him for the past six months with atlanta being their hub he assumed shed made reservations for a delta flight hed stepped out of the airport and begun searching for a skycap to ask where their terminal was located when he saw her across the trafficchoked street he was about to call her name when she reached a black town car she didnt look back or even acknowledge the driver holding the door as she ducked into the backseat mercer waited until the lincoln was rolling before dashing out into traffic a cabbie leaned on his horn and a traffic cop shouted mercer ignored them angling so he could see the vehicles license plate the white background and black letters were distinctive and suddenly a great many things came clear while even more became confused the town car was registered to the united states government arlington virginia it seemed to mercer that the block of brownstones on his street was the last stretch of what had once been a charming suburb arlington had grown in the decade since hed bought the threestory row house it was now mostly anonymous highrise apartment towers and office parks with a few box stores thrown in to complete the sprawl trifecta mercers street was lined with identical buildings red stone structures with dressed block entrances narrow windows and shade trees along the curb traffic was generally light outside rush hour and it wasnt unusual to see mothers allowing their kids to play outdoors it was almost as if time had left the street alone for the past sixty years usually mercer felt a calming wave as he entered his house he owned the entire building and had remodeled the space so an atrium lofted to the third floor and a circular staircase spiraled down to the first on the second floor were a niche library two spare bedrooms and a room outfitted with a fivestool mahogany bar matching wainscoting with brass accents and clubby leather furniture it was a space designed to evoke a nineteenthcentury gentlemans club and other than the plasma tv and the sera locklever refrigerator behind the bar the effect was perfect the master suite took up the entire third floor bathed by a pair of skylights mercers bedroom was larger than most apartments in arlington and the marble bathroom was the only one he knew of that had a urinal tucked in beside the toilet he strode through the front door and made straight for his home office on the ground floor he felt no sense of homecoming nothing but the hot anger that had been with him since seeing cali get into a government car he wasnt going to allow himself to speculate until he was sure but now that he was within minutes of knowing all kinds of scenarios played out in his mind none of them were very good he snatched the phone from his desk and dialed information he heard a female voice and was about to ask for the number of the cdc in atlanta when he did the acoustical version of a double take he listened to the voice more carefully god harry you are so big i dont think chantelle and i can take you but were willing to try you just have to promise to be gentle what the were both still virgins you know harry youll be our first time who the hell is this mercer demanded before the woman could reply mercer heard the sound of snoring through the open line son of a bitch he muttered and killed the connection he left his travel bag on the desk and mounted the circular stairs to the second floor just as he thought harry white was sprawled on one of the couches the cordless phone lying on his chest rising and falling in time with his snoring the nearby coffee table was covered in so many water rings left by highball glasses it looked like it had been mauled by a squid the cut crystal ashtray atop was overflowing harry wore faded chinos an overlaundered white shirt made of some indestructible synthetic dark socks and sneakers his ubiquitous blue windbreaker was thrown over the back of one of the bar stools a dog leash uncoiling from a pocket on the opposite couch in an equally sprawled position was harrys dog the obese basset hound lay on his back so that his belly sagged in avalanches of fat while one ear dangled almost to the floor the other was spread across the leather like a mangy napkin the dog lifted one bloodshot eye spotted mercer and tried to wag his tail the effort seemed too great so he went back to sleep snoring just a shade softer than his master et tu drag mercer said to the mutt he snapped off the portable phone on harrys chest and tapped the old lecher on the shoulder harry gave a startled grunt and his eyes flew open phone sex harry at your age you get a hardon only during leap years and you waste it on phone sex the old man ran his tongue around his mouth and was obviously repulsed by what he found hi mercer harrys voice rang with the lilt of a train wreck i wasnt wasting it i just wanted to see what it was all about since you were asleep i can tell it worked wonders how long were you on for harry looked at his watch his wrinkled face pulling taut with concentration holy shit its four thirty hey i gotta go i told tiny id be back by now how long harry im not sure i think i fell asleep around three thirty two bucks a minute harry looked away not because he was embarrassed by what hed been doing but because hed been caught i think they said something about four dollars but i cant be sure some friendships develop over many years some are mere conveniences because of job or neighborhood some defy explanation harry white was fast approaching his eightyfirst birthday more than twice mercers age and yet they had been friends from the moment they met at the dive down the street called tinys a few who knew them assumed mercer saw a father figure in the octogenarian especially since hed lost his parents at a young age others thought mercer helped old harry as though he were a charity case neither explanation was even close mercer had analyzed their relationship a few times and the best he could figure was that the two of them were the same person just separated by a few decades harry white had fought for his nation during world war two never bothering to get veterans benefits afterward because hed done it out of a moral obligation and wanted nothing back for his service he gave everything and asked only for loyalty in return he knew firsthand that no matter how blurred the line between right and wrong there was still a threshold that couldnt be crossed he believed that actions and words were of equal importance and that a favor asked was a favor granted he personified what it meant to be part of the greatest generation without consciously knowing it mercer had held himself to the standard set in those days and lived by a similar code so in fact mercer and harry were from the same generation men who had known deprivation in their youth who had survived combat who still mourned friends and who still believed in the rightness of their deeds harry suddenly became indignant and anyway you werent supposed to be home until the end of the month mercer slid around the bar and poured himself a vodka gimlet using jamaica gold lime juice and ketel one he put together a jack and ginger for harry adding just enough ginger ale to make the whiskey tingle nice to know you care you bastard the central african republic is in the middle of a civil war or havent you been following the papers ive stolen your paper every day since you left harry found his customary place at the bar and took an appreciative gulp before lighting up a chesterfield his blue eyes vanishing into folds of skin to blink away the smoke but if it aint a headline or on the crossword page i dont pay attention a tiny trace of concern edged into his boozeand buttruined voice everything okay i mean nothing happened to you before mercer told his story he grabbed the cordless from the couch drag whimpered in his sleep in the months since harry had found the basset bawling at the dumpster behind tinys trying to get food he and mercer had come to the conclusion that the dog couldnt be dreaming of rabbits snails maybe or arthritic sloths were more his speed mercer dialed information and got the number for the cdc in atlanta after dealing with a byzantine automated answering system mercer managed to get an operator and request the personnel office human resources john speaking how may i help you hello john my name is harry white i just got back from africa and i think the airline gave me a piece of luggage belonging to one of your people the name it sounded to mercer as if john took his social cues from the automated system stowe cali stowe mercer spelled it we dont have anyoneoh wait there it was the pause mercer feared he would hear um yes let me transfer you to mr lawler that wont be necess john had already started to reroute the call a moment later a guarded voice came on the line this is bill lawler i understand youre asking about cali stowe no mr lawler i just want to make sure that if i send a piece of her luggage mistakenly dropped off at my house by the airline that she would get it she mentioned that she worked for the cdc when i met her on a flight today ah yes she is an employee you said she was on a flight today may i ask from where so she works there great ill put her bag in the mail first thing in the morning thank you mercer cut the connection before lawler could ask any more questions what the hell was that all about harry cocked one bushy eyebrow and more importantly if i find her bag does that mean i can go through her underwear there is no bag replied mercer his voice filling with frustration and exhaustion i met cali stowe in africa she told me she worked for the cdc but when she and i split at jfk i spotted her getting into a government car and and the guy i just talked to at the cdc seemed pretty interested in why i was asking about her i think she uses them as a cover for something else calis name shows up on their computer but it flags whenever someone tries to get information about her harry ground his cigarette into an ashtray and drained the last half of his drink he spoke while mercer rummaged through a drawer behind the bar any suspects on who signs her paycheck dozens of suspects but no clue mercer found a blue pushpin and pressed it into the car on the world map hanging behind the bar adding one more to the dense forest of pins studding the framed chart there were easily eighty other gaily colored tacks denoting the places mercer had traveled for work and pleasure there were almost a dozen clear ones showing places where he had been involved in covert actions his eyes lingered on the transparent pin stuck into the island of la palma part of the canary chain it was all he had of tisa harry noted the tension creeping into mercers neck and saw the shadow lingering in his storm gray eyes when he turned from the map you were attracted to her she was attractive mercer admitted quit dodging thats not what i asked no matter how much mercer wanted to avoid the issue he knew his friend wouldnt let him yes i was attracted to her shes the first since tisa and now you feel guilty about it yeah six months is an eternity and its a blink of the eye i cant tell you how to feel about this but i will tell you that being attracted to another woman is not a bad thing you do realize that since tisa died youve held yourself to a standard most married men cant touch guys find women attractive every damned day and you can bet that not one of them feels the least bit guilty but you you see it as an act of deepest betrayal this isnt mourning mercer its selfinflicted punishment what if i cant help it youve always found a way in the past what do you mean harry lit another cigarette gathering his thoughts you beat yourself up every time something in your life goes wrong you blame yourself whether its your fault or not most people dont take responsibility when they screw up but you do even if you dont this isnt a character flaw or maybe it is but not a bad one to have except each time it costs you a little more to find your center again and come to grips with whatever just happened its been six months since you lost tisa and youre no closer to putting her death behind you mercers anger flared i wont put her behind me not her you dope her death you havent put her death behind you theres a distinction and maybe thats where youre stuck what do you mean i bet you relive her death every day but dont relive her life mercer didnt deny it so harry continued youve turned her into the symbol of some perceived failure a memory where you can unload all the guilt you carry around you dont celebrate the short time you were with her and thats not very fair to her i mean mercer was rocked by what harry had said in a rush he realized it was all true tisas memory had become a wound he would reopen just so he could revel in the guilt he was certain he deserved this wasnt mourning it was selfflagellation and was actually a little sick hed made her death about him and in doing so reduced her life to something he could blame himself for so how do i put my life back together harry leaned back on his stool jetting smoke from his nose how the hell should i know its your life ask that cali woman out on a date or maybe spend a week at a resort watching honeys parade by mercer hadnt been to a beach in years and couldnt imagine himself sitting around leering at bikiniclad hardbodies nor did the prospect of dating cali hold much interest not at least until he found out who she was and whom she really worked for that thought reminded him that he needed to contact admiral lasko he dialed iras cell ignoring the red light indicating that the handsets batteries were low your being back early cant be good news lasko said in greeting having finally mastered caller id ira lasko was a former submariner who then transferred into naval intelligence john kleinschmidt the presidents national security advisor had tapped him shortly after his retirement from the navy to work for the white house lasko possessed a mind that could think on both strategic and tactical levels and intuitively understand the link between the two he was below average height and had a slight build but he more than compensated with a commanding voice boundless energy and a pugnacious attitude to go along with his shaved head no and no mercer replied no i didnt find any coltan ill call burke at the un tomorrow then fax him a formal report later this week and the second no is because i found something else that isnt good news you want to get together i think we should ive got a couple of items that need to be analyzed im stuck in the office until eight ill meet you at that thai place i like near the pentagon city mall eight thirty at loong chats got it after some of the swill mercer had been eating over the past weeks the idea of thai food sent a spasm through his guts hed grab a sandwich before the meeting im off harry announced drag get up the dog didnt even lift an eyelid drag up walk time the basset rolled onto his side his back to harry an annoyed growl rumbling from deep in his chest harry walked over favoring his prosthetic right leg which always bothered him when he napped with it on he shook the hound causing waves of fat to ripple under the dogs loose skin drag finally righted himself his stubby legs barely able to keep his belly from rubbing the couchs leather he managed to get a single wag from his tail before it sagged like a deflated balloon harry clipped the leash to his collar and as his name implied had to drag him from the couch and toward the library and the curving stairs beyond mercer smiled as he heard harry tug the recalcitrant dog across the tile foyer to the front door harry called up if you finish with ira before midnight ill be at tinys i dont think so okay then ill see you tomorrow ira was already at a table when mercer stepped into the trendy thai bistro a trio of women sipping cosmopolitans at the bar eyed mercer as he entered the room carrying a neverused gym bag he didnt see them but spotted ira at a table near the back ira already had a pair of drinks waiting lasko had removed his suit jacket and loosened his tie but couldnt shed his thirty years in the military he sat straight with his fingers laced while his eyes never rested you look beat the deputy national security advisor said by way of greeting they didnt bother to shake hands you have an eye for the obvious the past few weeks and especially the past five days are something i wouldnt mind forgetting i thought this was supposed to be a slam dunk you go in find some minerals to make the car rich the un gets to look good and a little rubs off on us problem is the minerals arent there which i suspected all along and whatever riches the car might eventually have are going to line the pockets of warlords i read a brief about someone coming down from sudan caribe dayce charming fellow all muscle favors a machete hes dead ira didnt show surprise you i wish a waiter came to take their orders mercer demurred the sandwich hed had earlier lay like a stone in his stomach ira ordered enough food for two mercer continued when the young asian had stepped away dayce actually had me and a woman named cali stowe staked out for a firing squad when this group ofmercer wasnt sure what to call his rescuerssoldiers came out of nowhere and gunned down all of his men locals peacekeepers neither i dont know who they were they just came out of nowhere did their thing and warned me to never come back who is cali stowe ira rarely made comments until he had all the facts thats one of the things id like you to find out for me she claimed to work for the cdc but when i called i got the impression she was using them as a cover also when we parted ways at kennedy i saw her get into a government car if shes on uncle sams payroll id like to know why she happened to be the same place i was i can make a few calls anything else mercer plucked chester bowies canteen from the gym bag and set it on the table he then withdrew the misshapen bullet from his pocket the copper glinted in the restaurants dim lighting id like these looked at by an expert especially the bullet mercer took nearly a half hour to tell him the story hed heard from the old woman and lay out everything that had happened from the moment cali had approached him in kivu ira jotted a few notes on a napkin white mercenary eye patch pauly or poli eastern european accent got it the admiral set his pen aside and pushed away the nearempty plates so whats your take at first i thought that village was where the us mined its uranium for the manhattan project but i cant believe wed kill off the witnesses agreed but where does that leave us its gotta be the germans mercer answered quickly they had a pretty sophisticated nuclear program during the war somehow they learned about a vein of incredibly concentrated uranium ore and sent out an expedition to get it and chester bowie its just a guess but maybe he was the prospector the germans used to find the uranium from what the woman told me it was just a few weeks or months after he left that a bunch of other white men arrived if he got word to the nazi high command it would take about that long to put together a team and get them on the ground so hes a traitor who helped the nazis during world war two possibly or maybe he was coerced or didnt know who backed his original exploration thats what i want to find out how i entered his name in a search engine and came up with over a hundred thousand hits bowie state university bowie maryland jim bowie bowie knives teen sluts with big bowies but i have a better plan to track him down okay ill leave you to that what about the town now is the old mine still dangerous i mean could someone go there and dig up their own concentrated uranium i doubt it from what i saw it looks played out whoever mined it took everything and as of three days ago the village no longer exists in my report to adam burke im going to recommend that a team from the international atomic energy agency go in once things calm down just to make sure with dayce dead shouldnt it be quiet now itll take a few weeks or months with dayce out of the way there will be a dozen or more petty warlords fighting to take over the remains of his army ira was quiet for a moment furrows on his forehead extending up to the crown of his shaved skull how did bowie find it in the first place mercer leaned back a smile on his lips hed known ira would get to the real mystery about the whole affair thats the question nagging me since cali and i got out of the car the village isnt even a blip on the map the geology in the area doesnt look conducive for uranium and yet sixtyodd years ago this guy walks into the jungle and starts to shovel overburden as though there was an x on the ground with a sign saying dig here you have any idea how he did it either he was the greatest prospecting geologist ive never heard of or the luckiest sob in history ira motioned to the waiter that he wanted the bill then stood ill call as soon as i learn anything what parts of this story do i keep out of my report to the united nations ira didnt have to think as much as you can i told them about you as a favor to the president it doesnt mean i want you sharing any secrets with them in fact ax your recommendation about sending in a group from the iaea having seen firsthand a number of un failures in africa and elsewhere mercer was inclined to agree ill contact connie van buren at doe constance van buren was the secretary of energy a longtime friend of mercers ill see if she can send some of her own inspectors id wait on even that ira said guardedly lets dig a little on our own before you contact her you said the place is too dangerous now anyway ira lasko had also picked up that there were elements to what had happened that didnt add up the admiral paused for a second looking down at mercer who was sliding a credit card from his wallet whats your sense of the group who took out dayce and his men dont ask me how or why but i think they knew about the mine and had gone there to make sure dayce didnt discover it if the mines played out like you said whats the point mercer had no answer but he would find it new york city the upper east side coop had a commanding view of central park and the apartment towers beyond it had four bedrooms a study and a small suite for a livein servant the dining table could seat a dozen the owner stood on the balcony the first brush of a spring breeze blowing through his dark hair he wore black linen slacks a black silk shirt and black shoes he scanned the park like a hawk eyeing an open meadow as if he too were searching for prey in one hand he held a slim cell phone in the other he cradled a snifter of seventyyearold cognac the man was in his midforties unmarried but handsome enough to rarely want for female companionship he hadnt earned the money to buy the coop that had been earned generations earlier his older brother ran the familys empire a farreaching conglomerate with interests on four continents a lesser man might have been jealous of the power his brother wielded not only over the company but over the family as well yet because of the career path hed chosen and what hed done with the contacts hed made he was close to reaching a pinnacle of power his brother couldnt even conceive the roots of the operation came from within his own family history from a story hed learned from his grandmother so in a sense hed been planning it since childhood although hed never told a soul this was to be something he alone would accomplish his brother needed an army of lawyers and accountants to keep the business running while he was about to change history with a select few the cell phone rang he answered it quickly hello its me darling i was wondering if youd reconsidered my proposal it took him a moment to recognize the voicemichaela taftsburys an international attorney from london currently working in new yorkand to recall her proposala weekend at a bed and breakfast in vermont michaela i told you i cant leave the city its a weekend not a fortnight lover i havent seen you in so long best to end it now he decided while she was a passable conversationalist and highly charged in the bedroom she was becoming bothersome and you wont see me for even longer he warned if you keep pestering me pestering pestering screw you i thought we were having a little fun if ive become a pest then to hell with you she hung up but the phone rang almost immediately damn it he shouldnt have dumped her before he got the call he was waiting for now hed waste precious time assuaging her feelings so he could get her off the phone hed only break up with her later he checked the phones caller id feature it was an international call with a country code he didnt recognize this was it poli he asked when he opened the connection no names the oneeyed bulgarian assassin hissed the man in new york ignored the rebuke he was about to hear the news hed waited for all his life was it there at one point maybe it was and maybe it wasnt what are you talking about was it there if it was there someone beat us to it a long time ago its gone i didnt stick around long enough to explore the entire region but it is safe to say that i believe it is all gone you didnt stick around i am paying you a great deal of money to more than merely stick around youve promised me a great deal of money the killer reminded sharply and i didnt stay because they showed up the disappointment was too much the whole thing could have been wrapped up in a couple of days now he was being told the ore was gone and then polis statement finally cut through the mans frustration wait they who are they but he knew all too well he knew but still he persisted my god man you had an army behind you caribe dayces men are more than ample protection dayces dead and so are a lot of his men so you can forget about paying him the other half you owed to get me to that village i barely got out myself this happened five days ago its taken me this long to reach khartoum a note of professional respect crept into polis voice when he added you warned me the opposition was good i had no idea a fire team could move like that theyve had centuries to refine their craft what of the american who was in the area which one there were two a man and a woman i know nothing of the woman the man in new york admitted in either case i dont know what happened to them i was running the first instant the opposition showed up last i saw of the pair they were staked out and about to be executed by dayce its possible they were killed in the cross fire i dont know i will make inquiries youd best come to new york i have a feeling youll be needed here my flights in two hours mercer knew exactly how hed find chester bowie and he began his search with the optimism of the fatally misguided he worked under the logical assumption that bowie wasnt the luckiest sob in history and that he was a trained geologist and a damned good one at that he also assumed that a guy older than fifty wouldnt trek into one of the remotest spots on the globe without a support team placing the excavation at the village sometime in the early s and working backward mercer guessed that bowie would have graduated from college no earlier than he gave himself a cushion of another five years and decided to begin his search in the next step was simple and that was to search the electronic database for academics whos who for the years between and the computer search took less than a second and came up with no chester bowies not yet concerned mercer pushed the search back to the oldest records on the database and still came up empty he leaned back at his desk and wondered if bowie hadnt been a good student in college or worse if hed been a selftaught geologist mercer was so sure of his investigative technique he hadnt considered either alternative he idly brought up bowies name on the search engine again and for a fruitless hour called up and scanned random entries he wouldnt let go of the idea that bowie had formal training no one could have found the uranium deposit without it he phoned the alumni offices of a dozen schools with preeminent geology departments no chester bowie he called all the major mining schools and still no bowie even going back to which would have made bowie at least sixty when he went to the car he ate lunch hunched over his computer and let his answering machine pick up the twenty incoming calls dinner was chinese delivery which he also ate at his desk and he finally called it a night past one he was at his desk at six the following morning the coffee at his elbow strong enough to take the enamel off his teeth he continued on with the search engine until nine when he called the company that ran the whos who web site he talked his way past two secretaries and finally got the chief archivist on the line she introduced herself as mrs moreland from the frailty of her voice he guessed that she might have graduated a couple of years before chester how can i help you dr mercer he thought it prudent to use his title and to embellish the story somewhat im a field geologist mrs moreland and ive just returned from central africa where i came upon a grave in a remote village the headstone said that the man who was buried there one chester bowie died in a village elder remembered the man was also a geologist who had come to the region by himself and that he was mauled to death by a lion how awful the elderly librarian said yes he went on to say that the village has experienced nothing but bad luck ever since cattle diseases drought and the like he believes that because bowies family doesnt know how or where their ancestor died that his spirit still haunts them it sounds a little strange to us but animism is the prevalent faith in this part of africa dr mercer im from new england i know all about ghost stories i promised the headman that i would try to contact the bowie family to tell them what happened to chester and you think i can help its a hunch but i believe he was a rather gifted geologist and its possible that you have records of his academic career your records online go back only to and i was wondering if you could dig back a couple more years no digging required we are about to load the years to onto the site give me a moment she typed so slowly that mercer spelled out the name in his head and here we are chester t bowie class of from keeler state in new jersey he knew it thank you mrs moreland i can contact the college hopefully they have records going back that far that give some family history im not sure if that will help her tone sent a stone plummeting to the base of mercers stomach how so it indicates here that this chester bowie graduated summa cum laude with a degree in ancient greek history excuse me i dont think this is your man he wasnt a geologist he was a historian mercer cursed and immediately sensed mrs morelands disapproval over the phone he apologized thanking her for her time he stared into space for a minute his hand still holding the portable phone what the hell he said and dialed information for the small new jersey college our records go back to the day the school was founded by benjamin keeler in a perky coed named jody in the alumni office assured mercer when he asked im looking for information about chester bowie he graduated in oh sure jody said as though she knew the man bowie the booby excuse me oh its a nickname he had he is sort of like a legend here how so he was a student here and then became a teacher i guess he was a real whack job he vanished in the s or something the timing could fit had mercer been wrong about the african womans age why do you say he was a whack job im not sure students here use his name if someone does something stupid like you know pulling a chester its just like a thing we say mercer had thought using the word like so often had died out a decade ago is there anyone in the office who could give me a bit more information um not really im here by myself and i dont know when my boss is coming back shes on maternity leave jody went quiet before perking up once again her voice jumped several octaves but hey there was like this book written a couple years ago this woman wrote it and she had a section about bowie the booby she gave a couple of signed copies to the school theres one here someplace she fumbled through a bunch of drawers slamming them so the metal rang in mercers ears yes i found it science beyond the fringe alchemy to perpetual motion and those who sought the free lunch by serena ballard mercer was more than a little intrigued that a historian of ancient greece was in a book about junk science he thanked jody and hung up typing the title on an internet booksellers site and there it was science beyond the fringe by serena ballard the book had been published three years earlier and by the looks of it hadnt done well there were no readers reviews and the site indicated the book was already out of print next he typed the authors name onto a search engine and came up with an uninspired web site dedicated to the book as the title implied the book chronicled pseudoscientists in their bizarre quest to invent the impossible on the singlepage site were short paragraphs about some of the stranger folksa dry cleaner from new york who tried to patent his interstellar telephone a mechanic from pennsylvania who spent his life trying to draw usable power from static electicity and another from california who was convinced hed deciphered the language of humpback whales mercer got the sense that the book was written with tongue firmly planted in cheek and thought it might make an amusing read at the bottom of the page was a link where he could email the author so he dashed a quick note to serena ballard explaining his interest in chester bowie and giving his telephone number to his astonishment his phone rang in less than a minute hello dr mercer yes is this serena ballard it is i cant tell you how surprised i was to get your email about half as much as i appreciate you getting back to me mercer said she had a beautiful throaty voice according to the web counter on that old site you just doubled the number of hits since it went online i have the feeling the book didnt do as well as youd hoped she chuckled the publisher lost my princely advance of one thousand dollars in truth science beyond the fringe was a labor of love i sent it to publishers on a lark still writing a book is a hell of an accomplishment i did it for my grandfather if you saw the web site you might have noticed the bit about the guy in pennsylvania who tried to harness static electricity your grandfather he was inspired by a machine he read about in ayn rands atlas shrugged and knew he could make it work he spent every night and weekend in his garage tinkering away he burned it down once and spent a week in the hospital after nearly electrocuting himself he got a chance to read my book before he died but never knew that i managed to get it published you indicated you wanted some information about chester bowie what can you tell me about him and what did he do to merit a mention in your book bowie taught ancient history at a place called keeler college here in new jersey youre in new jersey yes im the marketing director for the new deco palace hotel and casino in atlantic city its great have you ever been here no but i have a friend who considers atlantic city his third home third home wow not that impressive because he uses my place as his second anyway back to bowie chester bowie taught ancient history at keeler from what i recall from my research he was a real flake he muttered to himself all the time and always wore a cape around campus and what did he do to merit a mention in your book asked mercer well he wasnt a scientist but he was a crackpot thats why hes in there he was convinced that the creatures from greek mythology actually existed you mean griffins medusa and giant threeheaded dogs yup i guess that would certify him as a crackpot its not as bad as that serena admitted what bowie believed is that ancient greek farmers plowing their fields discovered bones from animals that went extinct in the last ice age not knowing how the skeletons fit together he believed they created all kinds of fantastic monsters from the bones mixing and matching as they went along and then inventing stories about their creations mercer absorbed what shed just said and couldnt find any quick flaws in bowies theory it was a simple elegant answer to a question hed never considered but it got him no closer to explaining how chester bowie came to be at a highgrade uranium deposit in central africa where he presumably vanished in the mids he had no other interests geology for example not that im aware of serena paused i hate to say this but i dont remember much about him i wrote the book a few years before i got it published and bowie was only a couple of paragraphs i still have boxes at home with some of my old research material there might be something in one of them i could look through it and mail you anything i find mercer considered her offer he doubted he was on the right track even though the dates somewhat corresponded with what he knew this could very well be the wrong chester bowie however he had nowhere else to turn pressed by a vague sense of urgency he asked would it be possible for me to come up and get them he sensed hesitancy i assure you im not a stalker or anything i can even meet you at the hotel mercer knew hed have to bring harry the old bastard would pout for weeks if he knew mercer had gone to a casino without him well i suppose so i can go home at lunch and grab the stuff im pretty sure i know which box its in are you in new york no dc mercer checked his watch how about five oclock in the lobby she gave a small laugh this hotel is huge wed never find each other how about the bar americain its right next to the casinos main entrance bar americain it is five oclock and serena thank you im glad i can help ill even see what i can do about getting you a room comped then she added as an afterthought i never asked whats this all about anyway ill tell you when we meet suffice it to say that chester bowie found something and it sure wasnt minotaur bones mercer checked the time again and decided it was still too early for harry to be at tinys so he called whites apartment when he got no answer he tried tinys but even the owner paul gordon wasnt there he climbed the back stairs up to the rec room to refresh the inch of tarthick coffee fused to the bottom of his mug harry was slouched at the bar pen poised over the washington post crossword a bloody mary within easy reach morning he growled mercer shook his head slowly help yourself to my paper and booze already done my boy already done feel like going for a ride no harry didnt look up from the puzzle tinys getting some guys together for a poker game tonight im gonna crash on your couch this afternoon to rest up for it im going to atlantic city still harry remained slouched but he didnt miss a beat drag get your leash youre spending the day with uncle tiny the dog raised himself over the back of the couch to regard his master through bloodshot eyes his head was bowed so that his ears dangled past his long gray muzzle he gave one soulful bawl sorry pooch im exchanging your crap for a game of craps today were getting a room for the night go home and pack ill pick you up in an hour ill be ready in fifteen minutes atlantic city new jersey the tires of mercers jaguar convertible gave a slight chirp as he pulled into a spot near the top floor in the parking structure adjacent to the deco palace hotel and casino he killed the engine but could do nothing to stifle the excited monologue harry had kept up since getting off the garden state then there was this time i was here oh must have been eightyeight or eightynine with jim read you remember jimmy for some reason he and i drifted apart when he got sober you drifted apart for the same reason feminists dont hang out with pornographers mercer said sarcastically harry ignored his remark anyway we came up here and i have never seen someone as hot with the dice not jimmy i swear to god the dice would land on their edges for him no it was this little old biddy well she was probably five years younger than i am now but could she roll she must have gone on the way youre going on now mercer interrupted give me a break will you i havent been to a casino since you were in canada thats what seven months harry five tiny and i came up when you went back to finish your contract with debeers mercer unlimbered himself from the sports car and you took my jag no doubt harry held a zippo to his chesterfield and arched his brows at mercer no doubt from the elevator a moving walkway glided them through a long tunnel lined with advertisements for shows restaurants and of course the gaming tables keeping with the hotels art deco theme big band played over hidden speakers the other guests riding with them were mostly older new yorkers uniformly dressed in nylon sweat clothes in neon colors with gold chains resting on fleshy breasts for the women and mats of graying hair for the men none of the couples spoke to each other they seemed intent on getting to the games with as little distraction as possible the conveyor ended at the lobby the expansive space was themed after the old ironandglass railway stations seen in hundreds of movies from the thirties and forties but with art deco accents on the walls and numerous columns the reception desk ran along one wall with a commanding view of the boardwalk and the ocean beyond opposite was a real locomotive puffing ersatz steam connected to a pair of beautifully restored pullman cars there were forests of potted palms and all the staff were dressed in period uniforms there it is harry said pointing across the vast lobby to the bar americain leave it to you to find the bar mercer checked his watch they were a half hour early but he could use a drink they ducked into the bar which was remarkably intimate despite its size the room looked like it had been the set for ricks cafe americain from casablanca there was even a black piano player at an old upright and while he was probably named jamal or antoine his staff badge identified him as sam harry muttered i feel i should be wearing a tux and drinking champagne cocktails they sat at the alabastertopped bar harry ordered a jack and ginger while mercer asked for a gimlet of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world mercer recognized the voice at once but couldnt believe it he swiveled on his bar stool cali stowe wore a black suit with flared slacks and a cream silk shell her ruby hair danced and tangled to her shoulders her lips were such a bright red that he had trouble dragging his eyes to hers there was humor in them that sparkled into a smile shed looked beautiful in africa unwashed and dressed in wrinkled safari clothes here she was absolutely stunning and it took mercer a moment to get over his shock heres looking at you kid he finally stammered and saluted her with his glass buy a lady a drink she didnt wait for an answer and addressed the bartender dewars rocks with a water back dont get me wrong mercer said but you are about the last person in the world i expected to see here to what do i owe the pleasure she took a sip from her drink im a compulsive gambler cant stay away mortgaged the house sold the car the works i live in a dumpster out back im in love harry said then stood to introduce himself harry white at your servicing she chuckled at his quip and they shook hands hi harry im cali stowe harry shot mercer a glance before saying she was the one in africa she too gave mercer an appraising look and now im here what are the odds pretty even if youre meeting serena ballard head of the class for the guy in the armani sports coat she took the stool next to mercer forcing harry to lean over the bar so he could ogle at her she and i spoke this afternoon and imagine my surprise when she told me she already had a meeting to discuss chester bowie today still not over his shock and delight at seeing cali mercer asked so are you going to tell me who you really are because i know you dont work for the cdc their human resources guy nearly choked when i asked about you ever heard of nest part of the department of energy isnt it it stands for nuclear emergency search team im a member our main function is to act as a rapid response force in the event of a nuclear bomb strike or an attack at a nuclear plant back in our charter was changed slightly after president bush went before the country in his state of the union address and made a serious booboo by saying saddam had gone uranium shopping in africa because of that gaffe nest has also been tasked with finding and securing previously unknown sources of uranium there are ten of us on a team searching the world for old uranium mines and places where uranium might be found so you werent lying about how you found that village a shadow passed behind her luminous dark eyes and she took a quick sip of her scotch some of her freckles blurred into an angry flush sort of but not exactly someone at the cdc contacted me about that village having the highest cancer rate on the planet when i took that info to my bosses they played around with it for a while talked it over in a dozen meetings and committees and finally shelved it saying and i quote there are more pressing matters let me guess harry chimed in you went out on your own cali nodded her good humor returning if you noticed im sitting kind of funny its because most of my ass was chewed off when i got back to our field office in new york unbidden mercers mind conjured up the image of her backside he was in little hurry to force it away but he remarked i saw you getting into a town car the head of nest cliff roberts came to get me personally thats when the butt chewing began part of my left cheek is still in that lincoln cali tossed hair from her forehead in a simple gesture that held harry entranced they bluffed about firing me then about suspending me in the end i was ordered to take a weeks worth of personal days and come back she deepened her voice to an approximation of her superior with the proper attitude of a team player i envy you mercer for not having to deal with government bs one of my first jobs was working for the usgs it wasnt bad as bureaucracies go but i knew id never make it there for long he thought back to their time at the village making certain connections now that he knew her true purpose in being there some discrepancies came to light when you stepped into the bush for a little privacy i was checking a geiger counter if you were anyone other than a geologist i could have done it in the clear and made up a story you would have seen through the ploy in a second forcing me into the jungle with tales of diarrhea sorry to cause you the embarrassment now that i think of it you werent all that pale coming back and you made a miraculous recovery she grinned im not a method actor and i wasnt kidding about having an iron stomach so what did the geiger tell you there wasnt much radiation above normal ambient however large the lode was it was all cleared out back in the thirties or forties and erosion would have carried away any contaminated soil long ago im leaning toward the s mercer told her not long after chester bowie made his discovery and then the germans came to mine what bowie left behind thats my guess from what little ms ballard told me about bowie i doubt he was a traitor so i think someone caught wind of his find later on and came back to clear out the vein mercer ordered another round samjamalantoine the piano player must have thought there were enough patrons in the bar to start in on a pretty good rendition of as time goes by he must have played that song a dozen times a day so how did you find bowie mercer asked i traced him through his schooling irs database cali sucked on an ice cube and both harry and mercer paused to watch her sensual mouth in action she noticed the scrutiny and quickly crunched down on the cube it was an absentminded habit that drew more attention than she intended in matters of national security nest can access some pretty powerful databases since im out sick i had one of my teammates do the search he led me to keeler so i called the schools president and he passed on the information about serena ballards book i called her et voila here i am what i dont get she continued is what that mine has to do with a loopy classics professor serena filled me in a little about bowies theories and it doesnt jibe at all with what we found if he went out playing amateur archaeologist to prove his theory about ice age bones he would have gone to greece how did he end up in africa with luck serenas notes might shed a little light on the subject that reminds me cali said quickly the president of keeler is ticked at her she was supposed to have returned her research material to the school years ago so make sure i tell her that it all has to go back a lone woman in her forties entered the dim bar unlike the tourists ebbing and flowing into the room she wore a business suit and carried a briefcase she had long blond hair and a chubby round face mercer put her height at about five three and her weight somewhere around his own he guessed that there was pennsylvania dutch not too far down her family tree she spotted the trio at the bar and made her way across the room it had to be serena ballard dr mercer ms stowe you found us cali answered hi im serena ballard please call me cali even seated on the stool cali was almost a head taller than the casino executive and people generally call me mercer he shook her hand noting that her eyes were cornflower blue this is my friend harry white harry didnt repeat his servicing joke again his instincts had been spoton that cali would see the humor he didnt think serena ballard would pleased to meet you serena looked first at mercer and then to cali three years after my book comes out and not one but two people suddenly show an interest mercer and i are working on the same problem from different perspectives and came to the same conclusionyou can we get you a drink just a diet coke why dont we grab a booth away from the piano she hoisted her bag i brought everything i could find actually there is a lot more than i remembered and it reminded me that i was supposed to return it all to keeler college cali grabbed up her and serenas drinks the schools president asked me to ask you about that she then quipped he made it sound as though there was a long line of scholars clamoring for the chester bowie files once they were settled at a corner booth serena emptied the contents of the collapsible briefcase onto the table there were about ten musty notebooks several old manila folders and clutches of loose papers mercer harry and cali started leafing through the notebooks it was clear from the eager look on her face that serena wanted to help but had little to add there isnt much i can tell you i looked through some of this in my office but im afraid it didnt jog my memory as i told you over the phone i wrote the book a long time ago and chester bowie wasnt a very big part of it how did you first hear about him cali asked over the top of a brittle notebook my fatherinlaw went to keeler he was the one who told me about him when i was working on the book even though he vanished sometime in the s students still talked about bowie the booby when my fatherinlaw was a student i just contacted the school and told them i was writing about bowie they sent me everything they had in their archives cali continued to press you hadnt come across his name in any other source no sorry serena sipped at her soft drink what is this all about mercer set aside the notebook he was thumbing through we found a canteen in a small village in central africa that once belonged to chester bowie an old woman there remembered him from her childhood she also told us that shortly after bowie left other white men came and killed a number of people my god thats awful why would they do such a thing mercer just shrugged since she didnt need to know about the uranium mine we dont know we hoped that this material might provide a clue serena bit her lower lip are you two looking into this for yourself or is this some kind of government thing i work for the government cali replied im sorry i cant tell you in what capacity mercers a civilian consultant mercer tried to suppress a smile cali had put just the right hint of intrigue in her voice for serena ballard to make her own inference and also to make the offer without being asked i was going to let you keep this stuff overnight so i can return it to keeler but if this is something official you should keep it until youre done with it just get it back to me so i can forward it mercer gave her his best smile ill do you one better ill send it to keeler myself with the promise that well keep you informed as best as were able serena beamed at being included i cant ask for anything more she stood oh and good to my word i got you some rooms compliments of the deco palace hotel you should be in the system already just give your names to one of the receptionists and dont you worry harry said shaking her hand the hotel will more than make up the cost by the time im through tonight after serena had gone they received their room cards at the reception desk harry dumped his overnight bag on mercer with the vague promise to be back before they left atlantic city in the morning he gave his cane a jaunty wrist flick with each pace as he headed for the craps tables their rooms were on different floors so mercer gave cali half of the documents serena had provided and kept the other half for himself they made arrangements to meet for dinner at eight mercer decided against a quick shower and instead sat himself in a club chair in his room and began scanning chester bowies notebooks after leafing through just a dozen pages he was convinced that jody the alumni receptionist at keeler college was correct bowie was a whack job his writing style rambled from subject to subject with no discernible pattern in one paragraph he railed against sir arthur evanss work on minoan culture at knossos and in the next he gave scientific reasons why the sun couldnt have melted icaruss waxandfeather wings he wrote that the boy must have blacked out from hypoxia and crashed into the sea as if the mythological story was fact once hed established in his mind that the bones of ice age creatures were the basis for demons and monsters chester bowie treated all the ancient myths as if they were real and sought to explain them logically or at least as logically as he could he believed that the famous gordian knot was simply a hedge maze at the entrance to phrygia and alexander the great merely chopped it down with his sword mercer was well into the third notebook when the phone rang hello i forgot what room you are in cali said breathlessly ill be right up i found it a minute later he opened the door to calis insistent knock she blew into the room her eyes alight shed removed her blazer and he could see the shape of her small breasts and how they moved under the silk of her shell chester bowie was certifiable but he was also a genius mercer found himself immediately caught up in her enthusiasm what did you find adamantine huh she threw him a teasing smile not the geologist you thought you were always suspected i wasnt mercer replied whats adamantine in greek stories of creation after the gods had fashioned the earth she glanced at a note card epimetheus and his brother were given the job of fashioning all the animals some were given wings others claws some got speed some got strength unfortunately epimetheus gave out all the best attributes so when it came to man he had nothing left in his bag of tricks and he asked his brother for advice the brother told him what would make an appropriate gift to man so epimetheus went up to the heavens and lit a torch from the sun and bestowed fire to man making him superior to all creatures as you might imagine this wasnt what zeus chief god of all the gods had in mind in anger mercer finished the story in anger zeus had epimetheuss brother prometheus chained to a mountain where birds ate his spleen exactly cali checked her card again it was mount caucasus and it was his liver actually the chains were reportedly made of unbreakable metal called adamantine that jupiter himself had mined only hercules strength was enough to break the links and free prometheus so what does this have to do with bowie dont you see through his research he thought he had found jupiters secret adamantine mine he went to central africa to prove that adamantine really existed just one more step in proving that everything about ancient mythology was real but instead of some legendary metal he discovered a vein of naturally enriched uranium mercer shook his head hold it he trekked into the most remote part of the world because he thought hed found the mother lode of an imaginary metal cali grinned at his skepticism ill do you one better he got a grant from princeton in the fall of to go looking for his adamantine mine princeton princeton backed this lunatic to the tune of two thousand dollars not large by todays standards but in the s thats not chump change she handed him a memo on princeton letterhead the letter from a professor swartz at the institute for advanced study at princeton stated that indeed bowie had been given two thousand dollars to pursue his work on procuring the elemental metal you outlined in your grant request mercer read the short note a second time as if not believing his first reading he looked up cali had a smug look on her face why the hell would someone fund this guy he was off his rocker apparently this professor swartz didnt think so since i found our link youre buying dinner mercer didnt acknowledge her there was something about the date that struck a chord princeton in the s what was happening at princeton in the s did you hear me cali noted the faraway look in mercers eyes and then mercer remembered not what was happening at princeton in the s the question was who without thinking he reached across and drew cali to him kissing her hard you are a genius flustered but not disturbed by the sudden kiss she asked what what did i do do you know who happened to be at princeton in the institute for advanced study in the s hell he was there until he died in the fifties mercer didnt wait for an answer albert einstein thats who and while he didnt send that letter to president roosevelt until just before the war detailing how his theories could create an atomic bomb he must have suspected that bowie was on to something and had this guy swartz fund the expedition einstein knew bowie hadnt found adamantine but believed that he might stumble on highly concentrated uranium maybe a source with naturally occurring isotopes of u which is usually refined from the more common u in centrifuges thats what they needed to sustain a chain reaction einstein sent bowie to find the uranium thats the only theory that fits the facts mercer spoke faster and faster somehow god knows where bowie found something in his studies that mentions the location of zeuss adamantine mine maybe he made the connection to uranium or maybe it was someone else but his idea eventually gets einsteins attention einstein knew that fermi and a couple of others were working on creating a nuclear chain reaction at the university of chicago he believed that bowies adamantine might just be the uranium isotopes the team needed for their experiment so he gets princeton to fund the expedition so what happened the first sustained chain reaction didnt occur until mercer was surprised she knew the date but had to remind himself that cali wasnt a medical researcher as shed once claimed instead she was a trained nuclear specialist and would surely know the history of her chosen field the girl at keeler told me he vanished chester bowie never made it back from africa with his samples leaving fermis group to enrich their own uranium lets not get ahead of ourselves we cant be sure that he found a vein of u come on cali it was strong enough to kill dozens of people over the years from acute radiation sickness ive never heard of a case of natural uranium doing that especially since their village is a good half mile from the mine you need proximity to radiation to feel its effects she conceded the point with a nod so what happened to bowie no clue he could have been eaten by crocodiles on his way out eaten by a rival tribe for all i know if he died out there then hes carrying a sample of whatever the germans came back to take later on theres no way were ever going to find his body after all these years it was mercers turn to admit his enthusiasm was getting the best of him but he wasnt going to admit defeat i wont let the trail just die here there must be something maybe there are archives at princeton letters between bowie and einstein i think i read someplace that he kept pretty complete records of his correspondence should be easy enough to get cali said princetons not that far if we leave early enough we can get there when they open tomorrow youre on ill book this room again for harry he and i can head back to dc the day after we should finish reading bowies notebooks first there may be other clues agreed but not before you buy me dinner its near enough eight now cali suddenly became aware that her nipples were pressed against the silk of her sleeveless shell shed long ago admitted she didnt have much in the way of breasts she also knew men would look no matter the size she gave mercer high marks for not leering im just going to run down to my room for a minute ill meet you at the elevators in the lobby cali finally came down from her room fifteen minutes later and while the effects were subtle shed taken the time to apply some makeup and fix her hair mercer felt like a slob for not showering earlier they dined at a restaurant in the hotel called margeaux and despite the urgency theyd felt up in mercers room they took their time over crocks of onion soup dover sole and beef wellington and thick wedges of black forest cake mercer had left the wine selection to cali since his only knowledge of the vintners art was to avoid anything that comes in a box when they finished their meal the bottle was empty and the restaurant was nearly deserted it wasnt until their conversation drifted into a companionable silence and lingering glances that the guilt slammed into mercer like a sledgehammer blow he hadnt known the exact moment their working dinner had become a date his first since tisa but thats how he felt about it now and the delicious meal turned sour in his stomach he thought hed given no outward sign but somehow cali picked up on his distress are you okay lying is what he should have done blamed eating too much and moved on it would have been easy and he could have kept tisas memory locked away barely reined but still under control but before he could open his mouth the idea of lying faded tisas memory wasnt under control it was controlling him it wasnt reined it rode free across his mind and until he exorcised it it would always be there i lost someone very dear to me six months ago cali had to lean across the candlelit table to hear him tonight was the first time since then ive had dinner with a woman this dinner wasnt a date but sitting here with you it was easy to imagine it was i was overwhelmed by guilt thank you for sharing that i know it couldnt have been easy i have a tendency to keep stuff locked away what man doesnt mercer gave a low chuckle true i guess its just easier than admitting theres something wrong you pretend you can handle the pain and usually you can but sometimes sometimes you need to talk talk or just admit to yourself its okay to have feelings women often complain about men shutting them out cali said ive had my share of that but i also came to realize that mens silences can be just as cathartic as when women vent the dangerous guys the ones you have to look out for are the ones that dont even allow themselves the silence ive never lost anyone close to me so i cant imagine how it feels i will say that you seem to be handling it pretty well i think we had a good time tonight i know i did had you not been dealing with her death you wouldnt have allowed yourself even this cali let that sink in before setting her napkin on the table they stood and made their way back to the elevator why dont we meet here at seven okay sorry to end the night on a down note her smile was the most charming hed ever seen on her you ended it perfectly when her elevator reached her floor she gave his cheek a gentle kiss see you in the morning mercer held the elevator open until she was in her room he thought hed come off sounding like a morose dolt pining for an unrequited love and she thought the night had ended perfectly he repeated to himself something harry was fond of saying the only thing youll ever truly understand about a woman is what shell let you understand atlantic city new jersey two minutes on the internet would have saved mercer and cali about six hours but would have cost them a bucolic ride and a selfguided tour of princetons campus the institute for advanced study wasnt affiliated with the ivy league school it had been started in with money from newark department store magnate louis bamberger as a place for theoretical mathematicians and physicists the small institute did not archive any of their most famous thinkers papers in fact einsteins home was merely another piece of property for faculty housing a harried staff member who had answered the same question for countless people told them that all of einsteins papers had been bequeathed to the hebrew university of jerusalem in conjunction with caltech they were making much of the material available online back in mercers room at the deco palace he handed her a beer from the minibar and opened one for himself the sun was setting and the hotel cast a long shadow over the boardwalk cali checked that she had a connection with the hotels wifi and quickly located the archive they found that there was a document of some sort in the collection from a ch bowie however that particular piece of writing couldnt be accessed through the internet what time is it in israel cali asked reaching for the phone never mind it doesnt matter she dialed a long number from memory and when it was answered she asked for ari gradstein who is ari gradstein mercer asked the deputy director for israels demona nuclear research facility weve worked together a few times on responses to nuclear terrorism cali replied then picked up the conversation with the israeli when he came on the line ari its cali stowe from nest she paused listening good how are youexcellent and shoshanagreat listen ari i need an official favor id like you to cut through the bureaucracy for me at the hebrew university in jerusalem i cant tell you what its about yet other than to say i highly doubt the state of israel is at risk im researching an american who wrote to einstein and all his papers are archived at the university yeah i know it surprised me too i wasted a couple of hours at princeton thinking they were there could you call over there for me and clear the way im going under the assumption that as soon as i identified myself as someone from the doe all sorts of red flags would go up and it would be weeks before i got an answer cali rattled off her email address and then the universitys reference number for the document authored by ch bowie thanks ari i owe you one bye mercer was impressed even if i had a contact in israel i never would have thought of that you were brilliant cali smiled at the compliment and sometimes knowing your way around a bureaucracy isnt a bad thing harry returned to the room while they waited for an email from israel he was blearyeyed and his cheeks were prickled with silver stubble it was the first mercer had seen of him in nearly twenty hours well well well look what the cat dragged in have you been gambling this whole time harry lowered himself to the bed with an exaggerated groan god no i stopped for breakfast this morning and howd you do mercer asked knowing the answer by harrys dejected look harry propped himself against the pillows his eyes closed never ask a gambler that until hes done that bad eh the old man suddenly leaned forward and pulled thick bundles of cash from both pockets of his windbreaker he spoke mildly as though it were no big deal actually i think i did all right for myself holy shit mercer and cali exclaimed at the same time how much mercer asked harry roared in triumph thirty grand my boy i crushed em i was unstoppable i even told them i was staying at trumps so theyd comp me a suite last night to keep me here you wily son of a bitch mercer muttered in astonishment congratulations cali added what are you going to do with all that money harry eyed her as though she were an idiot gamble it away tonight of course cali looked like she was going to try to dissuade harry from blowing his winnings mercer knew better her laptop pinged and all thoughts of harrys windfall vanished it was an email from the hebrew university the archivist who sent it wasnt happy about answering a request past midnight but said theyd found what cali had asked for this is it cali said and opened the attachment it was a telegram sent to einstein in april of from athens greece mercer read over her shoulder may i inquire as to your health sir it has been seven weeks since i left i have spent my vacation near lake como my hotel reminds me a little of that monstrosity hearst built at least there is plenty of sunshine and fresh air ive found some trinkets youd enjoy and plan to ship soonest i could not find the gibson print of drakes golden hind you so wanted i did locate that recording by stephan enburg you asked for in my opinion that is a small success but i cant imagine why you liked it too much oboe not enough flute ch bowie ps fail fall ball bill fill pill poll pall pail pain gain cali was the first to voice her assessment what the hell is this its meaningless lake como he was in africa and that bit about seven weeks bowied been gone for months how did he end up in athens and whats with the postscript its got to be code mercer said maybe he and einstein had some prearranged signal concerning the expedition he says he had a small success the name stephan enburg could mean something specific like that bowie found the mine had he not found it maybe it would have been a different name maybe maybe maybe damn it she blew a frustrated breath let me see that harry called mercer swiveled the laptop so harry could read the telegram gibsons print of drakes golden hind cali questioned aloud what is that drake is sir francis drake mercer replied an english admiral and privateer around the time of queen elizabeth the first the golden hind was his flagship my knowledge of art ends with dogs playing poker so im guessing that gibson was an artist who created a famous portrait of him when harrys done we can search it on the internet along with a composer named stephan enburg it might give us a clue what bowie meant dont bother harry said looking up from the computer his blue eyes were alight with a devilish spark the real question you need to answer is if chester bowie made it aboard the hindenburg like he planned what are you talking about give me a pen and a piece of paper and ill show you cali handed him some hotel stationery and her montblanc the clues in the postscript that line bowie wrote is called a doublet a word game invented by lewis carroll the guy who wrote alice in wonderland the object of the game is to transform one word into another usually with the opposite meaning by changing one letter at a time and using as few words as possible bowie turned fail into gain using eleven words including the original oh i see cali exclaimed change an i into an l and fail becomes fall then change the f to a b and you get ball and so on except bowie messed it up and it was deliberate how so asked mercer its obvious that he knew the rules of a doublet since he wrote one out but he used eleven words when you can change fail into gain with only four and he wrote fail pail pain gain mercer nodded at what harry had done this is all well and good and im sure provides hours of entertainment to the gaming set but how does this get us to bowie being on the hindenburg eleven words when four would do i guessed eleven is the key to the telegram and when you count out every eleventh word you get harry wrote out the secret message may seven lake hearst air ship hind enburg success oboe bowie was telling einstein that he was returning to the united states aboard the airship hindenburg and to have him met on may in lakehurst success is obvious but i dont know what that bit about oboes means i do mercer and cali said at the same time and exchanged a grin he indicated for her to explain obo is a large town in the central african republic its pretty close to where we found bowies canteen he was telling einstein the approximate location to the uranium deposit mercer summed up didnt everyone die when the hindenburg blew up cali asked the men but she was looking at harry harry edged his chin toward mercer ask him hes the expert mercer demurred im no expert i was fascinated by airships when i was young so ive read a few books about the disaster a couple of years ago i managed to buy a piece of a girder from the wreck i hate to say its been in a closet ever since and to answer your question sixtytwo of the ninetyseven on board got out of the zeppelin alive if bowie was on her that fateful day theres a oneinthree chance he survived the man we need to talk to is carl dion hes the real expert and the guy who sold me the girder mercers nearphotographic memory failed him he knew dion lived in breckenridge colorado but couldnt remember the number he got it from information and dialed the retired aerospace engineer hello a timid woman answered after the seventh ring mrs dion yes mrs dion my name is philip mercer im an acquaintance of your husband is he there one moment please three full minutes went by before carl dion came on the phone hello who is this carl its philip mercer oh hello dr mercer my wife doesnt hear so well and she told me it was my friend phyllis matador a friend i neednt point out i dont have what can i do for you i need a little information about a passenger on the last flight of the hindenburg his name was bowie chester bowie the aviation experts reply was as instantaneous as it was damning no such passenger im afraid tension flooded mercers shoulders even as he felt his body deflate he collapsed into a chair are you sure i have a telegram from him saying he was going to be on the flight sorry but there was no bowie listed on the passenger manifest he wouldnt have had a difficult time booking passage the flight from germany wasnt even halffull the zepps trip back to europe was however fully booked by people going to a coronation think carl this is important is there any way he could have gotten on stowed away perhaps or under an assumed identity now that you mention it there was an anomaly mercers fist tightened around the phone as if physical strength would draw out what he wanted to hear a german couple professor and mrs heinz aldermann were to have been aboard but never showed up in frankfurt for the flight however their luggage did make the crossing if i recall there was a substantial amount of it enough so it could cover the weight of a stowaway oh yes four or five hundred pounds then someone could have been in their cabin dion became a little more excited now this is pure rumor mind you but witnesses claim there was a foot found in the debris after the crash that didnt correspond with any of the bodies this has been widely discredited as oh what do you call them an urban legend a tidbit to make the disaster just that much more horrifying mercer wasnt sure if this was good news or bad it brought bowie that much closer to home but if hed died as a result of the crash then the trail went cold again but if the rumor was true then it could belong to chester bowie like i said its a rumor what happened to the luggage oh gosh what little wasnt burned beyond recognition was returned to its rightful owners or their heirs mind you not much made it out of the blaze though i dont know specifics about the aldermanns luggage and the stuff that wasnt claimed shipped back to germany actually there were a few bits and pieces carted off by the curious like that small piece of duraluminum you bought from me but the hindenburgs skeleton and everything else went back and was recycled into fighter planes for the luftwaffe goring was never a fan of airships and detested dr eckner the head of the zeppelin company dead end mercer sighed harry had turned on the television and mercer waved at him to lower the volume whats this all about dion asked oh nothing carl this guy bowie might have been carrying some important geologic samples im trying to track them down i see well i have another rumor for you and take it for what its worth which i believe is nothing about fifteen years ago right after the publication of my book on the disaster i received a letter through my publisher from a gentleman in new jersey who claimed to have a safe thrown from the hindenburg on the afternoon she crashed a safe yes he even included a photo smallish affair totally unremarkable he claimed his father found it a few days after the wreck when he was plowing a field because there were no tire prints around the safe he said it must have been thrown from the airship and wanted to know if i wished to buy it how much this was when zepp memorabilia was at its peak he wanted fifteen thousand dollars and would provide no provenance other than what his deceased father had told him i spoke to him once very disagreeable fellow i didnt even make an offer i believed then and i still do that the man is a shyster and the safe is something he or his father had bought in a pawnshop do you have his name the chances the safe was real or that it had belonged to bowie were so remote they were off the chart and into the realm where early cartographers wrote beyond here there be dragons but mercer was desperate i knew youd ask im searching for it now i remember what youre like when you want something you were after me for years to buy that piece of the hindenburg i certainly hope you have it prominently displayed er yes mercer lied its on a credenza next to my desk ah here we go he still lives on his family farm in waretown believe it or not his name is erasmus fess mercer harry shouted from where he was reclined against the beds headboard mercer didnt turn just held up a finger for harry to wait erasmus fess thats right mercer wrote out the address dion rattled off goddamn it mercer hold on carl he covered the phone what harry was pointing to the television mercer looked on the screen cops and a medical team were swarming around a small suburban house mercer tuned into the reporters voice this morning by a neighbor who describes the scene inside as a slaughterhouse while the body has yet to be found sources have been unable to locate miss ballard and the amount of blood in her house indicates foul play mercer went numb and the color drained from his face he cut the connection without saying goodbye to carl dion serena yes another few seconds ticked by as the trio watched the news change to another story cali was the first to pull herself together we have to get out of here if they tortured her they know were staying at the hotel probably the room number too mercer do you have a car yes he said his mind spinning faster and faster its in the garage mine too thats where we should head cali had already closed her laptop bad idea if theyre already here theyll have it staked out harry do you still have that suite sorry the room they gave me is reserved tonight theyre giving me another but it wont be ready until seven mercer just nodded at the news okay then well just slip from the hotel amble down to the next casino on the boardwalk and hail a cab if we can get that far without being spotted were clear cali any chance you have a gun she shook her head in my desk drawer at the office ive got a glock but that doesnt help us here my spare berettas in my bedside table mercer admitted handing cali her computer case and casting an eye around the room for anything important ready harry and cali nodded mercer opened the door and peered quickly down the long hallway it was deserted but that didnt mean someone wasnt lurking in the elevator vestibule with harry in tow the stairs werent an option he motioned for them to hold still and he took off down the hall moving so his shoes made the barest whisper against the carpeta sound easily masked by the hotels humming ventilation system there was no one hiding by the elevators so he pressed the button and motioned for harry and cali to join him on the odd chance the people who murdered serena ballard arrived on the next car the three of them had better odds using surprise to overpower them than had mercer waited alone his stomach was calming after the first jolt of adrenaline at seeing the news piece and he began to wonder what they had stumbled into it was no coincidence that caribe dayce was operating near kivu at the same time cali was searching for a potential uranium deposit the key had to be the oneeyed mercenary poli mercers thinking about what had happened in africa was backward dayce hadnt hired poli to work with his troops poli was paying the african rebel to secure the lode of highly radioactive ore answering that question to his satisfaction left mercer with another how the hell did they know about the uranium in the first place he glanced at cali was it possible she wasnt who she claimed to be mercer discounted that idea even as it formed too many bullets were flying in her direction for her to be working with poli and dayce the answer lay someplace else the light above one of the deco elevator doors popped on with a discreet chime the instant before the doors opened mercer heard the distinct sound of an automatic pistol being cocked inside the elevator car they had less than a second before the gunman saw them not nearly enough time to run more than a few feet and if they had their weapons drawn mercer could forget about overpowering the assassins their only chance was to hide in plain sight the gunmen were looking for two men and a woman but not a couple and another man harry stood closer to cali than mercer so he pushed his friend into her arms and hissed kiss her mercer was sure cali understood what he had in mind but felt confident that harry would just give in to his natural lechery as the elevator doors slid open the two wrapped their arms around each other oh thank you john cali squealed in a little girl voice and pressed her lips to harrys mercer had turned away just enough so it was evident he wasnt with the maydecember couple the three men who stepped from the elevator held their pistols under their coats each gave harry and cali a passing glance and as their eyes swiveled to mercer he bent as if to tie his shoe mercer didnt recognize two of the men but the third was indelibly imprinted on his brain poli wore a black turtleneck and suit and rather than give him a piratical air his eye patch made him all the more menacing cali made sure she kept harry between herself and the gunmen as she and harry strode into the elevator room one of the assassins said studying a plaque screwed to the wall he motioned to their left this way mercer felt polis eyes burning into the back of his skull but remained calm as he stood erect and casually moved into the elevator behind cali and harry harry pressed the button for the lobby hows your luck holding out chum he asked mercer playing the part of strangers the elevator doors began to whisper closed just fine mercer replied and began to turn to face the front of the car poli stood rooted in the vestibule ignoring his men as they moved down the corridor toward mercers room his single eye went wide as he recognized mercer and his mouth split into a rictus of anger he lunged for the elevator doors trying to prevent them from closing but he was a second too slow holy shit cali gasped as the car began to plummet for the lobby how did he escape the counterattack in africa mercer didnt have an answer and knew now wasnt the time to worry about it we have just a few seconds once we reach the lobby he said then added grimly or no time at all if poli has more men and a radio whats your play harry asked can you get around okay without your cane harry smiled understanding what mercer really wanted i think ill be all right he handed over the polished wood cane that mercer had given him for his eightieth birthday mercer had commissioned the cane from one of the finest knife makers in north america he took the walking stick from harry and pressed a hidden button to release a twoandahalffootlong rapier the blade was as sharp as a scalpel and while mercer had no formal fencing training the barest touch would split cloth and skin he gave the black walnut scabbard to cali clubs and swords against pistols desperate times he replied with a smirk mercers hands were slick on the silver handle and he rubbed the sweat against his pants leaving a damp smear he kept the blade tucked behind his leg while cali held the baton across her chest and under her suit jacket they remained silent as they watched the indicator lights fall inexorably toward the lobby before the doors opened they could hear the chimes and bells from the slot machines and the noise grew as the doors hissed apart mercer ducked his head around the door and spotted nothing out of the ordinary no one was rushing for the elevators and it didnt appear that anyone was listening to a radio or cell phone come on he led them out of the car the elevators were offlimits to nonguests and a security guard checked to see that people approaching the banks of lifts had room keys mercer noticed that the paunchy guard had an automatic pistol belted around his ample waist just beyond the velvet rope was the casino floor a dazzling display of lights and sounds unlike anything else in the world hundreds of people were clustered around the green baize tables or seated behind ranks of gleaming slot machines their expressions rarely changing no matter how well or poorly they were doing waitresses in skimpy black outfits danced between the patrons their trays laden with complimentary drinks while dealers and pit bosses watched the action with inscrutable eyes the atmosphere was designed to pump up the players and keep them gambling long after they should quit for mercer it was just a distraction he scanned the crowds watching for anyone not enthralled by the experience see anything he asked cali shook her head not unless polis guys are disguised as a bunch of widows bent on blowing their late husbands life insurance mercer glanced back at the elevators just as they reached the guards desk one set of doors were opening shit poli raced from the car followed by his two henchmen all of them carried their pistols in plain view they shoved aside a couple waiting for the elevator and the man shouted angrily drawing attention a woman saw the guns and screamed the security guard tried to twist in his seat to see the commotion but years of inactivity had tightened his muscles mercer reached for the guards gun snapped the thumb lock off the holster and pulled the weapon free the guard hadnt even realized hed been disarmed mercer racked the slide noting that cali had pushed harry behind an ornate column poli got the first shot off and mercer counterfired neither had aimed polis round blew the strobe light from a slot machine while mercers embedded itself in an elevator door before either could fire again someone began shooting at poli and his men from across the casino they dove for cover mercer took the secondslong distraction to grab harry and cali and begin running for the exit he assumed the gunfire had come from casino guards but as they raced toward the big steam locomotive near the bar americain he saw a pair of armed men dressed in dark suits not uniforms their attention was focused solely on poli and they barely gave mercer a passing glance the crowds had quickly turned into a panicked mob shouts and screams had replaced the bells and the clanging of coins falling in hoppers it was all mercer could do to keep his grip on harry and cali he bulled his way through the throng until they could flatten themselves against one of the locomotives massive drive wheels dry ice provided the faux steam that leaked from around the pistons and rocker arms how are we doing he asked his throat suddenly tight and dry cali nodded sharply harry fine the octogenarian wheezed just get us the hell out of here working on it mercer replied keeping their backs to the train and their eyes out for more assassins they maneuvered their way down the length of the locomotive to the first car a dining car that had been restored to its full glory normally a hostess stood at the bottom of the stairs to take reservations for what the deco palace hotel touted as one of its most unique dining experiences mercer had read in the hotel brochure that the rail car was equipped with flat panel displays that were lowered over the windows and hydraulics made the train feel like it was in motion each night a computer controlled what scenic trip the diners experienced as they ate one night they traveled through the rocky mountains and on another they crossed the california desert and on yet another the passengers were made to feel they were crossing the florida keys on henry flaglers famous overseas railway get aboard mercer said pushing harry and then cali up the steep steps he was just about to follow her when a gunman broke out of the crowd he cradled a silenced machine pistol and as soon as he spotted mercer he sprayed a deadly stream of rounds mercer dove up the stairs feeling the searing heat of a bullet passing through the loose folds of his pants go harry slid open a beveled glass door and cali and he began hobbling down the length of the dining car mercer fired two rounds to keep the gunman from charging and went off after his friends the dining cars leather booths were set with elegant crystal and special deco palace railways china the silverware was sterling outside the train the gunman saw the figures through the windows and hosed the car with the remainder of his magazine cali had glimpsed the assassin a moment before he fired and shed shouted a warning they hunched down but didnt slow as glass exploded all around them and the air came alive with ricochets and copperjacket rounds the handcarved paneling was splintered and the sophisticated electronics that controlled the liquid crystal screens began to spark the car filled with the smell of burned plastic ozone and smoke as soon as the firing stopped mercer shoved aside one of the tables sending the dinner service to the floor in an expensive cascade the gunman had a fresh magazine in his weapon and was in the process of ratcheting the bolt when mercer double tapped him in the chest out on the casino floor a pitched battle was under way with at least a dozen men firing at one another while one group seemed intent on minimizing civilian casualties polis men fired indiscriminately with just a quick scan mercer saw a half dozen hotel guests either wounded or dead harry and cali waited for him at the end of the railcar and together they raced through the next it was the restaurants gleaming kitchen disguised in a decoera pullman car a few waiters and cooks cowered behind the stainless steel appliances one door at the end of the car opened out onto the lobby but there was a second door in the side of the train for bulky food deliveries mercer led cali and harry through this second door and across a commercial loading dock unfortunately there were no trucks unloading goods for the hotel one of the dock doors was open and the smell of the nearby atlantic mingled with diesel fumes and the stench of old garbage why not hide around here cali suggested swiping blood from her cheek where shed been hit by flying glass because it will take them about thirty seconds to realize where weve gone hate to admit harry panted but im about done in one of the straps on my peg leg has shifted so my stumps killing me though mercer had known harry had lost his leg decades earlier he rarely walked with a limp and usually used his cane for ornamentation so mercer had forgotten the pain his old friend was going through mercer slowly turned in place tapping into the mental map hed created of the casino in the twentyfour hours hed been there it was an unconscious skill honed over his years working in the labyrinthine world of hard rock mines he could discern the layout of almost any building after a brief tour and knew intuitively where he was at any time dont worry he said once he had his plan the main entrance is outside the loading dock and around the corner its no more than seventyfive feet at this time of the evening theres got to be a lot of people checking in cali picked up on his idea which means a lot of cars waiting for the valets to park them precisely mercer handed cali his gun and caught harrys eye firemens or piggyback aw shit mercer i can make it mercer didnt ask him again he bent low and flipped harry over his shoulder he was already running even as he settled the weight cali at his side if you fart harry im going to drop you id worry more about my occasional incontinence harry cackled outside the loading dock was a dark parking lot but once they rounded the corner they saw the neon glow of the deco palaces porte cochere liveried valets bustled between the ranks of cars most of the automobiles were ordinary sedans and suvs but there were a number of stretch limos and a ferrari parked so that people driving to the casino would be sure to see it it didnt appear that the pandemonium on the casino floor had spilled outside but it was only a matter of time they hustled up the access road because the entrance was so congested they needed to reach the head of the line of automobiles if they were to make their escape few paid them any attention as they danced through the throng mercer harry shouted behind us cali reacted faster than mercer whirling around but keeping her weapon out of sight mercer saw them too poli and two of his men had just emerged from the loading dock they paused studying the parking lot trying to spot movement mercer ducked as much as his knees allowed and still keep harrys weight centered he danced between cars and people ignoring the few grumbles from guests he shouldered aside theyre on to us cali announced as they reached the head of the line the first car wasnt what mercer expected or hoped for but it was their only option the car was a work of art a rollsroyce silver wraith with hooper coachwork it was painted in dove gray with dark blue fenders that swept gracefully over the wheels with a wheelbase over ten feet long the car was the epitome of stateliness and class although powered by a fourliter inline sixcylinder engine the vehicle was hopelessly underpowered because of its weight mercer could only hope they could vanish before poli and his men reached their own car because there was no way the british automobile would win any races cali you drive mercer said as they approached a distinguished man with the look of a television news anchor had just stepped from the passenger door mercer bulled past him so he could unceremoniously dump harry inside and give me the gun she tossed it over the roof as she ducked into the drivers seat the passengers protest at what was happening died on his lips when mercer caught the automatic pistol onehanded and pegged him with a flat stare just then a crush of people burst through the hotels multiple doors many of them were screaming and all wore masks of fear like a tidal wave they crashed into the lines of cars surging around the vehicles and shoving anyone who got in their way mercer jumped into the back of the rolls the rear bench seat was covered in soft connolly leather and the burled woodwork gleamed in the light cast by the deco palaces marquee cut crystal highball glasses were laid out on a folding tray and the decanter next to it held a rich amber liqueur he knelt against the seat and peered out the rear window one of polis men was limping but they were coming on fast mercer not now harry he snapped without turning cali go i cant she cried the cars righthand drive mercer twisted around and saw that harry sat behind the wheel rather than an export model modified for the american market the classic rolls had been built for the roads of england so the driver sat on the right poli and his men were seconds away they kept their guns from view but as soon as they were in range mercer had no doubt theyd open fire atlantic city new jersey no time to switch seats mercer shouted punch it harry harry mashed the clutch and forced the car into first gear laying on the horn which sounded a majestic almost apologetic tone the rolls didnt exactly shoot from its mark but in seconds they were outpacing poli and his men mercer watched as the gunmen reached the head of the queue of waiting cars poli snatched a young woman out of the seat of her geo metro the next car in line to pull away from the hotel the gunman with a limp lowered himself into the passenger seat waving his pistol at the second tattooed young woman who had been about to settle in for their drive home poli mouthed an order to his third man and gunned the little car the threecylinder engine screamed and the front wheels squealed as poli took off after the silver wraith hes following us mercer said and smashed out the rear window with the butt of the automatic he checked the magazine and was startled to find only two rounds harry glanced into the rearview mirror his eyes widened slightly when he realized the tiny blue car was what poli had stolen hes driving that thing braver than i thought just for the record ive got two shots left so if i dont get lucky youre going to have to outdrive him no problem harry said breezily as he turned onto atlantic avenue you forget tiny and i come up here whenever youre out of town and take my car mercer added while mercer hadnt been impressed by atlantic citys boardwalk with its tshirt shops psychic readers and saltwater taffy stands it was infinitely better than the rest of the city just a block from the glitzy multimilliondollar hotelcasinos the neighborhoods were some of the poorest in the nation abandoned houses were covered in graffiti yards were choked with weeds and teens loitered in hunting packs like wild animals smashed bottles littered the gutters and few of the streetlights still worked the pall of apathy and despair was overwhelming cali honey harry said as they flashed through an intersection i need you to focus on the road about a hundred yards ahead my night vision isnt what it used to be she nodded grimly and tightened her seat belt they had enough of a head start that harry could keep one turn ahead but the rolls was so slow on acceleration that he couldnt shake the little metro he broke out onto a long street and revved the engine winding out the old sixcylinder until it shrieked and managed to gain a few precious yards mercer watched the metro wheel around the corner sideswiping an abandoned sedan the range was too much for him to waste one of his precious bullets but polis man had no such shortage he steadied his pistol out the passenger window and cycled through the magazine most of the rounds went wild thanks to the potholed macadam but two hit the rolls one blew off calis side mirror and the other slammed into the trunk burying itself in a pair of matching louis vuitton suitcases that the valet hadnt had the time to remove there was a convenience store on the next corner many of the lights in the metal canopy above the gas pumps were out but the place was still open neon signs hung in the stores windows and a trickedout honda del sol was pulled up to the curb though mercer had never smoked he had developed the habit of always carrying a couple of disposable lighters in his pocket it was the old boy scout training and having them with him had saved his life more than once harry get ready to cut through that gas station mercer pulled the stopper from the decanter of liquor and stuffed one of the linen napkins that the highball glasses were sitting on into the mouth hey i smell booze harry said save me some sorry old boy mercer upended the bottle soaking the napkin in what smelled like a very good singlemalt scotch when we drive through the gas station i want you to take out one of the pumps are you crazy cali shouted like a fox harry said with delight he had supreme confidence in mercer so he was actually enjoying himself harry slowed slightly to lure the metro and then jerked the wheel to the right the big car bottomed out as it shot over the crosswalk kicking up a shower of sparks cali screamed as he nearly ran over a homeless man sitting on the curb drinking from a large bottle of malt liquor like a juggernaut the rolls raced across the lot harry aiming unerringly at the second pump in line mercer lit his improvised molotov cocktail the alcoholsoaked linen caught fire instantly in a maneuver that taxed both his strength and dexterity harry tweaked the wheel to miss one of the steel columns holding up the canopy drove the car up onto the island curb and sent the front fender crashing through one of the old pumps the deceleration was brutal cali snapped forward her head missing the dash by inches the pump was sheared off at its base tumbling end over end while the gasoline still in the lines splashed to the ground in a dark stain mercer pulled himself from the floor where hed sprawled the molotov cocktail held high as if he were an outfielder clutching a ball hed dived for the metro was twenty yards back and coming on hard he could see polis one eye shining with hatred his partner had reloaded and was just reaching out to open fire again harry regained control of the car and brought it off the curb aiming for the next cross street mercer shoved himself half out the side window took aim and heaved the fiery bottle back toward the pump it hit just in front of the hole in the concrete island where gas was fed to the pump from a huge underground tank the cut crystal shattered and for a sickening moment he thought the scotch hadnt caught fire but it had burning with a clear flame that quickly reached the flash point of the pulsing waves of gasoline fumes spewing from the tank like a rocket motor the gas ignited sending a coiling jet of fire fifteen feet into the air it licked then blackened the underside of the canopy poli had closed the gap to twenty feet from the back bumper of the rolls when the gasoline detonated it exploded almost directly next to the geo forcing him to crank the wheel hard over his car smashed into the rear of the lime green del sol kicking the sports car across the pavement and tearing off its rear fairing the hondas alarm shrieked over the combustive roar of the flames harry accelerated away from the conflagration shifting smoothly through the gears built in an age long before airbags and automatic seat belts the rolls thick metal skin had protected the engines vital areas and other than a wrinkled fender the luxury car was none the worse that ought to buy us some time mercer said with satisfaction i see a sign for the atlantic city expressway cali said where harry asked peering through the windshield straight ahead what that green blur above the road cali smiled yeah its actually the righthand green blur in moments the big car made its grand entrance onto the expressway the main artery out of atlantic city and back to the mainland the garden state parkway was only a couple of miles ahead traffic on the inbound lanes was heavy but fortunately there were very few people leaving the city harry edged the rolls up to seventy mercer continued to glance behind them in case poli somehow managed to get the geo running again he was about to dismiss a fastapproaching vehicle until he noted the distinctive paint job the honda del sol had to be doing a hundred and twenty as it barreled down the expressway cutting through traffic with the effortless grace of a slalom racer will this guy ever quit what is it cali asked she looked over her shoulder and saw the fastapproaching sports car jesus what do you want me to do harry asked they were outgunned and were no match for either the hondas speed or its agility before mercer could come up with another plan polis teammate began firing again unlike before the smooth asphalt gave him a steady shooting platform and rounds found their mark cali do you speak french harry growled huh she wasnt sure if shed heard right or if mercers friend had lost his mind harry kept one eye on the rearview mirror as he drove his jaw was set firm and there was the barest trace of a smile on his lips he kept watching the del sol edge up to within ten feet of the back bumper i want to know if you speak french because im gonna ask you to pardon me using it he paused for another second judging angles and speed then shouted fuck you buddy standing on the brake pedal didnt have the dramatic results harry had expected as if ignoring the drivers wishes the heavy car merely rocked forward on its suspension in what could be described as a stately deceleration the maneuver forced poli to apply the del sols brakes tricked out discs that could have stopped the nimble sports car on a dime sensing an opening he raced alongside the rolls to give his partner a clear shot into the silver wraith this is what harry had been waiting for he spun the wheel in an attempt to crush the light honda between the rolls and the guardrail he could see poli almost smile at the vain attempt as he applied more brake to tuck in behind the rollsroyce once again but harry had another trick up his sleeve he reached for the hand brake and gunned the engine to build up enough rpms to slam the transmission down into third gear the big car shuddered at the insult to its machinery but it complied this time the deceleration was almost instantaneous as the big inline sixcylinder engine quickly lost power poli was also quick but not quick enough the rolls pinned his honda against the guardrail and held it there effortlessly a shower of sparks torn metal and fiberglass spewed from the del sol as it was remorselessly smeared against the metal barricade its right front tire blew and its steel belt ripped through the fender like a grenade going off and still harry kept up the pressure all the while laughing demonically harry cali screamed gun polis partner had recovered enough to try to fire into the rolls while poli fought to keep the disintegrating car from climbing the railing harry shoved the hand brake back into its recessed slot and swerved away from the del sol he slid the transmission back into fourth and watched in his rearview mirror as the little honda slid to a stop in a cloud of smoke there was a lick of flame from the blown tire and steam erupting from the crushed radiator harry caught mercers eye in the mirror and repeated what mercer had said moments earlier now that ought to buy us some time mercer squeezed harrys bony shoulder you drive my jag like this and i will kill you harry chuckled i have a confession to make the tone made mercer nervous even cali picked up on it yeah and whats that mercer asked with trepidation tiny and i have been pulling your leg about me driving when we come up here i havent been behind the wheel of a car in years he craned his head around to look at mercer but hey its like falling off a bike do it once and you never forget eyes on the road please i dont think we should use the garden state cali said even though the police are going to be busy at the deco palace theres sure to be a description out of a stolen rollsroyce good thinking mercer said so where are we heading get onto north were going to have a chat with a guy named erasmus fess about a safe his father claimed fell from the hindenburg not long before it exploded it took fortyfive minutes to reach waretown and locate the home of erasmus fess the sweep of the rollss only working headlight revealed that the property had once been a farm there was a onestory farmhouse with a shed roof overhanging a sagging porch at some point the original support columns had been removed and now the whole affair was supported by unpainted twobyfours the sofa on the porch was the bench seat of an old car mounted on a metal stand the forlorn house was covered with a fur of peeling and cracked paint flickering blue light spilled from the front window the fesses were home watching television behind and to the right of the house was a metalroofed barn that looked even more neglected than the yard there were half a dozen cars parked randomly around the house most were rusted heaps sitting on flattened tires with smashed windshields and rumpled fenders a flatbed tow truck stood watch over the vehicles fess towing and salvage written on its door above a phone number behind the barn was a corrugated metal fence that stretched out into the darkness the gates were open and inside was a sea of abandoned cars lined up in meandering rows a large forklift sat just inside its steel tines thrust through the side of a volkswagen like the lance of a knight through the armor of an enemy jesus harry breathed as he shut off the engine if we see a kid playing the banjo or someone comments on how pretty my mouth is were outta here amen brother amen mercer stepped from the car and tucked the automatic pistol behind his back a cat raced off the porch and vanished under one of the dilapidated cars with harry and cali behind him mercer mounted the sloping porch a screen door hung awkwardly from its broken hinges the torn screen was loose and showed signs of being clawed by the cat mercer shouldered it farther aside and rapped on the main door when there was no response he hit it again a little louder get the goddamned door a male voice shouted from inside almost loud enough to rattle the windows im busy a woman shouted back from the sound of it both were seated in the front room no more than a few feet from each other harry hummed the theme from deliverance jesus woman im watching wheel go see who it is fine a moment later the front porch light actually a naked bulb hanging from its wiring snapped on in seconds it had attracted every insect within a fiveacre area the woman who opened the door had a cigarette dangling from her slack mouth and a bovine expression she wore a housecoat that showed off her thick blueveined calves her feet were shod in slippers and mercer could see that her toenails were cracked and yellow more like horn or the rough body of a beetle her eyes were watery behind the cigarette smoke an indeterminate color and small she was as thick as she was wide and probably tipped the scales in the twohundredandfiftypound range the shadow of a mustache on her upper lip was inky black behind her was a short hallway and the kitchen the old metal sink was piled with dishes and the fly strips above it were blackened with their victims mrs erasmus fess mercer said hiding his revulsion he put her age anywhere between fifty and a hundred thats what it says on the marriage license her highpitched voice and brusque manner made her sound like she was screeching rather than talking what do you want i would like to speak with your husband who is it lizzie erasmus fess shouted from the living room just off the entrance she turned to face her husband how the hell should i know he wants to talk to you tell em were closed come back in the morning if he wants a car or a tow he then cajoled the contestants on his television come on big money big money you heard him come back tomorrow she began to swing the door closed but mercer shot out his foot to stop her she continued to press on the door for a moment not understanding why it had stuck mrs fess this isnt about a car or a tow job my name is philip mercer and this is cali stowe and harry white im here because of the safe your husband once offered to carl dion at that a furtive look flashed behind her closeset eyes youre here about the hindleburg safe mercer didnt bother correcting her pronunciation thats right we came up from washington dc does your husband still have it have it hell he dont get rid of nothing hes still got the bite marks from his first case of crabs she turned to yell at her husband again ras theyre here about the hindleburg safe aint for sale erasmus fess shouted back yes it is lizzie said hotly i told you back when to just give that damned thing to the feller from colorado she turned to address mercer and the others again ever since rass father found it weve had nothing but bad luck after he dragged it home aint been no kids born in the family i got seven brothers and sisters and ras had eight dont make sense we never had children could be the crabs harry muttered cali silenced him with a look how about cancer she asked lizzie fess does your family have a history of cancer sure do rass daddy and younger brother both died of the cancer and me and one of his sisters had our titties cut off cause of it given the amount of fat she carried and the shapeless coat she wore it was understandable that no one had noticed shed undergone a double mastectomy had they lived in the house after the safe was found cali asked sure did thats why i said the safe brought bad luck rass oldest brother didnt get along with his father none and moved away before they found the safe and hes fit as a fiddle and has twelve kids and a whole mess of grandkids cali whispered to mercer sounds like were on the right trail elevated cancer rates sterility remind you of anywhere mercers mind had already cast back to the isolated village along the scilla river in central africa chester bowie must have brought a sample of the uranium ore with him on his return to the united states but just before the hindenburg met its fateful end he had tossed it from the airship in a safe what astounded mercer even more than the samples bizarre odyssey was how it had remained radioactive enough to cause cancer at the farm and sterilize at least one if not both of the fesses the wheel of fortune theme music reached its crescendo and then the television was shut off a moment later erasmus fess approached the door unlike his wife he was railthin and rawboned he wore a pair of oilstained coveralls with his name stitched over his chest his hair was sparse and gray and he had dandruff the size of corn flakes he wore thick glasses that magnified his bloodshot eyes and he sported five days worth of silver stubble he belched a cloud of beer breath and held out a ropey arm to mercer erasmus fess philip mercer they shook hands why are you interested in the safe fess asked what difference does it make lizzie hollered at her husband he wants to buy it mercer hadnt come out and said that he wanted to buy the safe but he nodded anyway a speculative almost feral look came over erasmus fess twenty thousand cash fess wanted five thousand more than hed offered carl dion but that wasnt an issue for mercer he would have bought the safe and its contents for anything fess asked for the problem was he just didnt have that kind of money on him he could write a check for that amount easily but he knew fess would never accept it and there was no way the scrap man would want the paper trail from a credit card transaction mercer hated that theyd have to wait until morning for a bank to open but he saw no alternative then he remembered harrys winnings he shot his friend a look easy come easy go old boy huh empty your pockets what harry finally got what mercer wanted and his face turned red forget it i won that money fair and square relax mercer said soothingly ill pay you back when we get home he would then turn around and present a bill to deputy national security advisor lasko lizzie and erasmus fesss eyes bulged when harry withdrew two thick bundles of hundreddollar bills from his windbreaker he handed the stacks to mercer i should ask for a receipt mercer presented them to fess but didnt hand them over i want to see the safe first and i want you to throw in a working car we sort of borrowed that rolls outside fess peered out into his driveway at the elegant car he cast a practiced eye over the luxury car paying particular attention to the ruined fender and dented doors ill give you a car so long as you forget where you parked that one mercer had hoped to return the silver wraith to its rightful owner and thought he could call the police as soon as they were safely back in washington but he knew the rolls would be a bundle of parts by the time they hit the maryland border tomorrow would just have to be a bad day for some insurance company deal you should give him the papers too lizzie said to her husband papers cali asked what papers rass father had the safe opened back in the fifties dont know what else was in it but there were a bunch of papers a note or something he made a copy of it and locked the originals back inside ras where did they get to god you talk too much woman fess groused he ran his fingers through his hair and unleashed a blizzard of dandruff theyre in the office file bottom drawer behind the paperwork for them airplane engines i bought five years ago mercer wasnt surprised that fess knew where the papers were he suspected that the salvage yard owner could put his hand on any piece of scrap in his sprawling yard lets go fess growled harry said hed wait on the porch and hed talked lizzie into giving him a drink by the time her husband grabbed a flashlight from the tow trucks cab you aint no collector like that writer fella from colorado fess said as he unlocked the chain link gate guarding his scrap yard what do you want with the safe theres a chance it belonged to my grandfather cali said before mercer could come up with a lie he was returning from europe on the hindenburg he always carried a safe with him he was a jeweler at that fess stopped short and shone the light in her eyes aint no jewels in the safe i can guarandamntee you do you recall what was in it mercer asked i was fightin in korea when my pappy had it opened he said there wasnt nothing in there but the notes and a shot put a what cali and mercer said in unison a shot put like athletes use said it was nothing but a round ball o metal he led them deep into the salvage yard past ranks of demolished automobiles and trucks mercer spotted a burnedout fire engine several boats and the boom of a large crane there were countless tarry patches of oil dotting the sandy ground and a tire pile that had to be twenty feet tall night animals scattered at their approach and shiny eyes watched them from the darkness near the back of the yard was a metal shed fess used another key from his jangling ring to open the door he stepped inside and pulled the chain to a single bulb dangling from the ceiling why the junk on the shelves that lined the shed needed protection from the elements was something mercer couldnt understand most everything looked like valueless hunks of rusted metal i keep the good stuff in here fess said mercer wasnt going to ask what exactly qualified this to be good stuff fess shoved a transmission from out of a corner and bundled up a filthy piece of canvas to reveal the little safe it was about a foot and a half square and made of dark metal with rust on the prominent hinges on the single door were an offset dial and a small handle be right back fess said and scuttled from the shed the shot put has to be an ore sample cali said as soon as fess was out of earshot no other way to explain it mercer agreed remember the old woman said chester bowie sent crates of dirt away by river but he must have kept some ore with him he refined it and must have put it in the safe to block the radiation but enough has leaked to affect erasmus and lizzie cali thought for a moment im going to have to report this site to my bosses at the department of energy we need to get a nest team down here right away we need containment she looked around the shelves god knows how hot all this junk is might have a turf battle with the epa mercer quipped considering all the oil thats leached into the ground a moment later fess returned to the shed with a gardeners cart the tires were flat but it would be easier using the rusted handcart than to try and carry the safe mercer manhandled the safe into the cart pausing as he heard the distant beat of a helicopter his senses were hyperacute from the adrenaline overdose and he became suspicious any flight paths around here he asked fess that choppers nothing hear em all the time its big shots from new york going down to atlantic city the explanation seemed reasonable but mercer remained on edge the quicker they were on their way to washington the happier hed be he settled the safe toward the back of the cart and swung around to take the handles it took considerable effort to get the flattened tires rolling but once he had a little momentum it became easier fess didnt seem to be in any great hurry so mercer ignored him and made his own way out of the salvage yard relying on the map hed unconsciously drawn of the facility sure you know where youre going cali asked as she paced him with her long legs god you talk too much woman mercer said with a deadon impression of fesss redneck accent cali pantomimed smoking a cigarette and blowing the smoke in his face they reached the gates and mercer set down the carts handles he didnt know which vehicle fess would give him so he waited for the irritable scrap man why dont you go check on harry he asked cali ill load the safe once our pal erasmus ambles along she stepped onto the sagging porch and knocked on the door a second later she was inside fess finally emerged from the salvage yard he locked the gates and motioned mercer over to a latemodel ford sedan the tires looked bald and the right front fender was dented but otherwise the car would be fine fess opened the rear door and grabbed the keys from under the back bench seat thieves always look in the sun visor or under the drivers seat never in the back he used the key to pop the trunk and stood far enough back to let mercer know he wasnt going to help him lift the safe into the car mercer braced his legs and lifted what had to be a hundred pounds of dead weight he balanced the safe on the rear bumper then rolled it inside he clearly heard a heavy metal ball rattle inside the safe as it crashed into the trunk there fess said holding out his calloused hands you got your safe and car i want my money mercer handed him the two bundles of hundreddollar bills twenty grand but fess didnt hand over the keys he turned and started back for his house mumbling i gotta count it without realizing it mercer balled his hands into fists as he felt his blood pressure spike it was a struggle to keep the anger from his voice mr fess were in a bit of a hurry the old man whirled listen sonny buck i dont know who you are or what youre really after but i dont trust you as far as i can throw you so youre just gonna have to cool your heels until lizzie and i count the money if mercer wasnt sure hed give the codger a heart attack he would have pulled the pistol still tucked behind his coat fine he said and seethed he was about to follow fess into his house when he became aware of the helicopter again it sounded much closer too close someone flying from new york to atlantic city would surely stick to the coast or run along the barrier islands they wouldnt be five miles inland then mercer willed himself to relax hed left poli stranded on the ac expressway and the rest of his team was still back at the deco palace there was no way they could have tracked the three of them to fesss house or known about the call to carl dion that led them here mercer looked into the darkened sky but could see nothing but a few stars the sound of the helicopter continued to rise it was coming fast despite what logic was telling him a sense of urgency swept through him he started sprinting after fess when the dark chopper cleared a copse of pine trees fifty yards from the farmhouse mercer caught a glimpse of the open side door an instant before autofire rained down from above the gunman first concentrated on the rollsroyce the right side tires were shredded and a steady stream of rounds shot through the grille until radiator fluid poured from the car like its lifeblood mercer reached fess just as he was about to mount the steps onto his porch he tackled the old man and together they tumbled through the front door an instant before the porch caught the second volley from the chopper the money had come loose from its paper strapping and littered the floor sweet jesus christ fess roared over the deafening fusillade mercer ignored him and peered around a grimy window not recalling that hed drawn his weapon but it was in his hand nevertheless how he thought how in hell did poli find them it was impossible poli hadnt had time to put a tap on the phone back in mercers room at the deco palace and mercer was certain no one had followed them from atlantic city the chopper came lower its blades mere feet from the trees four figures jumped from the open door and the pilot pulled up a fifth person remained in the helo with an assault rifle in his hands mercer pulled his cell phone from his jacket and flicked it to cali dial he ordered tell them the men who shot up the deco palace are here he then grabbed fess by the collar of his overalls lizzie was holding her hands over her ears and screaming in the living room do you have any weapons mercer had to give fess credit he quickly gathered his wits his eyes losing their manic glint goddamn right i do im an american aint i and there i was thinking you were barely sentient harry remarked and took a swig of whatever liquor hed coaxed out of lizzie the entire house rattled as the chopper hovered overhead the precarious pile of dishes mounded in the kitchen sink crashed to the floor and pictures danced and blurred on the walls erasmus fess went to the back of the house and returned a moment later with a semiautomatic rifle two shotguns and an enormous revolver tucked between the buttons of his overalls he handed mercer one of the pumpaction shotguns cali took the other theyre both loaded he placed the box of shells hed tucked under his arm on the coffee table and checked the extended magazine of his ruger mini a civilian version of the weapon the army had used during the early years of the vietnam war lizzie he shouted cut your wailing and get the ammo from the dining room mercer was back at the window he recognized poli leading his team as they slowly advanced on the house they moved like seasoned professionals never exposing themselves for more than a few seconds as they crossed the yard when poli reached cover behind the big flatbed tow truck he motioned for his men to take flanking positions he spoke into a walkietalkie and the chopper banked away can you hear me the mercenary then shouted mercer said nothing watching as two of polis men took positions to the left and right of the house he could take out one of them but the other had gone far enough around the building that mercer could no longer see him i know you can hear me mercer poli yelled tell me why you came out here and i might let you live hes here for a safe that fell off the hindenburg its in the trunk of that ford taurus out there fess shouted back before mercer could stop him you just take it and leave us be shut your mouth mercer hissed at the junk man fess remained defiant one of polis men broke cover and ran to the brown sedan he peered into the open trunk without slowing then found cover behind another wrecked car its in there he yelled across to his team leader a shadow flitted across the window where mercer stood one of polis men was on the porch the front door wouldnt last a second under the onslaught of their automatic weapons mercer craned his head to see the gunman but he must have flattened himself against the wall mercer looked out toward the flatbed knowing poli would give the signal at any second mercer wasnt going to wait he had only one chance to catch the man on the porch by surprise he aimed carefully and fired the twelvegauge bucked in his hand and he had another round chambered before he knew if hed hit the target the fully choked barrel prevented the steel shot from spreading more than a couple of inches at close range so the full load ripped through the twobyfour propping up one end of the porch roof the piece of lumber disintegrated and its partner on the other end of the porch quivered then snapped with a sound heard over the nearby chopper as if hinged the entire porch roof pivoted downward the gunman wasnt quick enough hed tried to lunge off the deck but the roof smashed into him tossing him back against the house until the section of plywood and shingles crushed his body against the stout wall poli and his men opened fire spraying the front and sides of the house with a continuous barrage windows vaporized and lizzies cheap curtains were torn to shreds mercer tried to return fire the shotgun roaring over the staccato cracks of the assault rifles but the fire was pouring in too heavily the highpowered bullets bored through the farmhouses aluminum siding through the rotted insulation and the lath and plaster with barely a check in their speed plaster dust and bullets filled the air in the living room everyone dropped flat as the air seemed to come alive many of the lights were blown out plunging the living room into near darkness the couch took a long fusillade stuffing and fabric spilling like cotton waste a bullet found an electrical outlet in the kitchen and started a fire that quickly grew the sound was hellish unworldly a continuous din that pounded at eardrums and threatened sanity and there was no letup as soon as one of the gunmen drained his magazine he inserted a fresh one seemingly without pause chunks of plaster were falling off the walls and the fire in the kitchen grew so mercer could feel its heat through his clothes a round found the television and it blew with a searing pop smoke was growing thick pressed flat to the floor by her husband lizzie fess began to cough mercer caught calis eye her face was ashen with fear her beautiful lips parted as she tried to draw precious oxygen from the reeking air he peered over his shoulder toward the kitchen the entire room was engulfed in flame he didnt know if the fesses cooked with natural gas but if they did it was only a matter of time before the heat or a bullet ruptured the gas line and blew the house off its foundation and just as quickly as the barrage had started the firing ceased mercers ears rang so loudly and the fire roared so powerfully that he only knew poli had stopped firing because there were no new holes appearing in the walls as his senses returned he heard polis chopper once again the heavy beat of the rotors told him that the jet ranger was taking off poli had used the cover fire so he could grab the safe and radio the helicopter for a quick evacuation what mercer couldnt understand was why poli and his men were leaving before making sure everyone in the house was dead it was the first mistake he could see that poli had made fearing a trap that poli had left behind a sniper but pushed by the urgency to get out of the burning building mercer crawled across the broken glass and debris littering the floor and approached one of the ruined windows he tossed erasmus fesss singed copy of tv guide outside and when there was no gunfire he chanced a momentary peek he saw nothing out of the ordinary and gave the yard a longer look peering as deeply into the shadows as he could light caught his eye and he understood why poli had retreated he glimpsed the flashing red and blue lights of a string of police cars through the pine trees they were racing for the salvage yard and the lead vehicle was only seconds away unable to use the front door because of the ruined porch roof and with the back engulfed in flame mercer led everyone out the window making sure that erasmus and lizzie went first harry demurred to going next so cali could throw a long leg over the sash and duck outside she helped harry onto the ground and mercer slithered through after him he herded them to the far side of fesss tow truck and there he and cali fell into fits of coughing as they gulped at the fresh air for some reason harry and the fesses werent as affected harry took out his pack of cigarettes lit three and handed one to erasmus and one to lizzie through a wreath of tobacco smoke harry said years of building up my immunity finally paid off the new jersey state police cruiser slid to a stop kicking gravel across the yard the officer threw open the door and emerged with his pistol drawn making sure he was protected by the bulk of his car hands up where i can see them assholes he shouted hopped up on adrenaline and the thought of a promotion in his near future anyone move and youre dead the five of them did as ordered while more cars careened into the driveway before the next officer could cover them the back of the house collapsed in a shower of sparks and the flames danced ever higher lizzie turned to her husband and said matteroffactly ras were movin to florida arlington virginia mercer swirled the last of his vodka gimlet and downed the remainder in one gulp he was on his third contemplating his fourth harry slouched next to him on his favorite stool at mercers home bar both of them were raweyed and exhausted but neither was ready to call it a night it had taken more than eight hours and the direct intervention of ira lasko as well as a shadowy figure from homeland security who vouched for cali stowe before the new jersey police and fbi realized they hadnt captured public enemies numbers one through three lizzie and erasmus had spent no more than an hour making their statement before being released ira assured mercer that the junk man would be fully compensated for his losses cali had left before mercer and harry whisked away by the homeland security agent in a government car while mercer was allowed to return to the deco palace to retrieve his jaguar it was a long drive home harry had shown up at his place a couple hours after mercer had dropped him at his own apartment drag in reluctant tow theyd ordered chinese food but neither was in the mood to eat each was preoccupied with his separate thoughts well at least one mysterys been cleared up harry said after a healthy slug of his jack daniels what the car the police whod searched the rollsroyce theyd stolen from the deco palace found that the car had been fitted with a lojack tracking device the man mercer had seen poli leave behind at the entrance of the hotel had grabbed the driver and made him reveal his personal identity number the tracking service led poli and his men straight to the fesses salvage yard fortunately the cars owner hadnt been killed but three people inside the hotel were dead and another eight wounded while mercer knew their murders werent his fault they still lay heavy on his conscience he especially felt serena ballards death there was no way around the fact that had he not contacted her shed still be alive all of those people would i do have something to cheer you up harry said after a long silence he shuffled over to his windbreaker and tossed some papers onto the bar whats this the copy of the notes from the safe lizzie fess gave me mercer looked at him incredulously why didnt you tell me earlier you bastard youve let me sit here thinking were at a dead end while youve had this the whole time hey sorry harry replied i wanted to translate all of it first but seeing your face hanging lower than drags made me reconsider mercer read the first couple of paragraphs deer and the antelope play that damned infernal song will not leave me were there ever any antelopes in america i ask you albert what games did they play what merriment the rams and ewes all enjoy i remember once being sane and i think i should go back there but then again how does anyone really know what is madness and are there many who really care i no longer do burned out i fear this trip has changed me in sick and disturbing ways i no longer recognize the reflection in the mirror and within this safe is the key for more madness to follow nick of time i thought when i boarded this massive airship i escaped all those who pursued methe carmines and their minions but i have paid a price my eyes appear kohl darkened like a pharaohs my hair what little i started with has fallen out in stiff tufts and my body aches in unholy ways other passengers turned away when we boarded i indeed am a wreck to recall what ive endured in the past weeks and months makes me think that even before i left i was more than a little mad but i had to find out i was obsessed i suppose unable to forgo my egos needs to always be correct i barely had the strength to rise each morning on the zeppelin and now i sit here tryingforcing myself to write this story second tea into cup in six but i did it i had to show the world that at least one of my theories was worth pursuing and i have learned that they all were by ships automobiles trains and donkeys ive allowed my obsession to drive me deeper into hell ive been so wracked with fever i chipped a tooth shivering at one point my fight with malaria was so bad my urine turned the color of wine i think what my brother nick endured in the great war and i know i have surpassed his suffering my journey had all the elements of a great quest odysseuss odyssey only mine will not end in the dewcovered fields of my ithaca in the arms of my beloved penelope i could not vanquish the suitors and while i didnt want to believe they exist i know even now they are plotting against me i have become paranoid but i fear i am not in fact paranoid enough i lack the heros cunning and i lack his strength guile is not in my nature this has got to be in code like the note cali and i got from einsteins archives mercer said when he finished the cryptic paragraphs it makes sense on one level but there has to be more do you remember the code how many words to skip every eleventh word harry said at once mercer grabbed a notebook and a pen from a drawer behind the bar and began counting out words after a few moments he set the pen down and read aloud what hed deciphered leave you and i really care has recognize the thought of but like fallen ways he looked to harry what the hell does that mean harry chuckled it means youre an idiot the octogenarian said mildly you didnt count the first word mercer turned the pages over to his friend in frustration youre the one who loves puzzles and cracked the first message you do it i already did the first ten words are deer me albert ewes should know i changed the key when you clean it up a little you get dear me albert you should know i changed the key shit anger crept back into mercers voice so how do we find the new key is there a clue yeah harry pointed to the second paragraph a oneline non sequitur that mercer had glossed over when he read the text this line here second tea into cup in six im pretty sure its another doublet change tea into cup in six words and the second word is a clue i scanned the rest of the letter and found five more doublet clues can you figure them out mercer asked anxiously might take me a while but sure mercer slid harrys drink out of his reach then get to work after making a pot of coffee strong enough to melt a spoon mercer sat next to harry as he began writing out words there were literally hundreds of combinations and they wouldnt know if they were right until all five had been figured out damn harry muttered after a minute im beginning to hate chester bowie why you only need four words to change tea into cup it goes tea tap cap cup the other two are just filler and i dont even know where to put them i could make it tea pea pet put pup cup or it could be tea sea sep sap cap cup wait whats sep abbreviation for separate general rule for doublets is if its in the dictionary you can use it well im not as good at these things as you but why dont you give me the second hint and ill see what i can do harry leafed through bowies note to einstein and read out the next doublet fourth games into balls in nine changing only one letter at a time turn the word games into the word balls in nine words the fourth words our clue after that we have fourth gout into full in ten second east into west in four and finally there is third dire into fine in four mercer wrote out the first and last word of the second clue on a piece of paper realized how much harder it would be with fiveletter words versus three and silently switched papers with harry to give him the more difficult puzzle just for that i want my drink back harry said without looking up mercer slid the highball glass back to his friend and together they set to work at eleven oclock they compared notes mercer had filled line after line on his paper but had made no progress while harry was pretty sure he had three of them albeit they were the easiest hed deciphered the last two coming up with west lest last east and dire dive five fine seeing that one of the clue words five was a number hed cracked the first doublet and came up with tea ten tan tap cap cup so we have ten something something lest five mercer said emptying harrys overflowing ashtray into a metal bucket he kept for that sole purpose it must be a math problem ten plus something lest five or ten minus something less five ten times mercer suggested genius harry shouted and bent to his paper again games into balls he spoke aloud as he wrote out games dames dimes times ah tiles tills fills falls balls perfect way to go harry mercer applauded figure out the last one and were in business again you know the fourth word has to be a number give me a minute a few minutes passed harry finally looked up you realize that bowie wrote this just before he tossed the safe yeah so just think what kind of mind he had to create the doublets and then write out the letter to einstein making sure he kept his word count straight he could do this stuff in his head without really thinking about it and from the sound of it hed been through hell and back from what ive gathered he was an eccentric thats for sure mercer said and from the tone of this letter it sounds like he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown oh id say hed crossed the verge and was deep into lala land mercer asked harry for drags leash so he could take the mangy basset for his last walk of the night from long years of experience he knew harry wouldnt leave until hed solved the code and even then hed sleep on the leather couch rather than return to his dingy onebedroom apartment up the block mercer dragged the old basset to the circular stairs and once he got him going the dog made good progress the fat of his belly rippling as it scraped over the stair treads he even waddled across the polished marble foyer usually harry had to drag him to the door but for mercer he was a little less stubborn mercer had just reached the front door when the doorbell chimed he automatically checked the tag heuer strapped around his wrist it was quarter past eleven no one visited at this hour unless the news was bad he thought for a moment about running upstairs for the beretta ninemillimeter he kept in his bedside table but he caught a glimpse of his visitor through the doors side lights he smiled and opened the door cali stowe wore jeans and a black tank top with a mans white oxford shirt thrown over it mercer got the impression shed dashed over in a rush she wore no makeup and her red hair was a little disheveled but still she looked beautiful in that vulnerable way men love but women never understand then three things struck mercer at once cali hadnt returned his smile hed never given her his home address and there were two men standing behind her sorry she said sadly they didnt give me much choice one of the men showed mercer the pistol he held to calis back anger came in hot black waves who are you mercer demanded why dont we step inside dr mercer the gunman said both men had dark hair and dark complexions with thick mustaches but they appeared more mediterranean than middle eastern the one with the gun was mercers height and had a slender build and an angelic face that belied the weapon in his hand the other was older his mustache and hair shot with silver and shorter five seven or so while both wore conservative dark suits mercer had the impression that the shorter man was the leader are you okay mercer asked cali as he stepped back from the door im fine she said he couldnt see any bruises on her and she wasnt limping but mercer knew that in front of these two cali wouldnt tell him if she was hurt she was too brave for that what do you want mercer demanded of the one he thought was the leader i am here to deliver a warning dr mercer nothing more the man had an accent mercer couldnt place and spoke gently almost like a priest warn me about what you must stop your search for the alembic of skenderbeg the more you look the more you help others who are also searching for it if one of them didnt have a gun in his right hand mercer would have laughed at them friend i dont have the foggiest idea what youre talking about i dont know what an alembic is or who skenderbeg is so why dont you leave and well pretend this never happened it is much too late for that jesus mercer recognized the voice and his reaction suddenly tripped calis memory too she blanched that was you in the village mercer said you saved cali and me had i known you would continue your quest the man agreed i would have delayed my attack and let caribe dayce kill you were not on any quest mercer said somehow feeling more in control had these two wanted them dead they wouldnt be talking and the gunman had lowered his weapon which mercer realized was the first gun hed seen in a long time that wasnt firing at him were trying to find out what happened to the uranium that was mined near that village almost seventy years ago this has nothing to do with your allergy of skinbag or whatever it is the alembic of skenderbeg he said it almost reverently you dont even know what youre searching for doctor but i must tell you to stop we have saved your life twice that was you last night at the casino cali asked he nodded yes a mercenary has been hired to retrieve the alembic and we have managed to follow his movements we tracked him first to africa and then to atlantic city last night but at the casino we underestimated the size of his forces and didnt know he had rented a helicopter he turned his gaze to mercer his eyes appeared haunted like he knew too many secrets you led them to a clue they would have never found what was it by the way a safe mercer said guilt edging into his voice as he again thought about serena ballard and all the others a classics professor brought back ore samples from africa he had gone there believing hed found the source of the metal zeus used to forge prometheuss chains what he found was a vein of unusually powerful uranium not the mythical adamantine the two men exchanged a look when mercer said the word adamantine as if they knew of it was there anything else the safes owners said there was nothing else in it but the ore samples mercer lied praying that harry wouldnt come out to the library overlooking the foyer the mercenary poli feines the man with the pistol offered he stole the safe before i had a chance to verify but i have no reason to doubt what the owners said they knew nothing beyond the fact that the safe had been tossed from the hindenburg again the two men glanced at each other interesting the leader said at last but it changes nothing i came here to warn you you are caught up in an ancient battle you cant possibly understand i beg you to end your investigation now you have been lucky so far that i have been in a position to save your life the next time you might not fare so well the two men backed toward the door the one holstering his pistol cali and mercer remained where they stood and know this dr mercer if i could find you and ms stowe so easily poli feines will be able to do so as well who are you mercer asked before they disappeared into the night the leader paused considering the question he searched mercers eyes and found whatever it was he was looking for janissaries he said at last and closed the door it was as though the room had been dark and suddenly there was light mercer took a deep breath and stepped close to cali he rested his hands on her thin shoulders and looked her in the eye what he saw was anger rather than fear are you okay im pissed she answered and stepped back just a bit her freckles stood out in relief against her smooth pale skin and her small ears were reddened she didnt need comforting she needed to vent they came in through a supposedly alarmed window right into my bathroom i was a soldier for gods sake and i didnt even hear them they turned on the light and i just kept on sleeping they had to shake me awake which i will admit was one of the scariest moments of my life you can imagine what i was thinking but jesus then they never said a goddamn thing that was the worst part they held out clothes for me and motioned me to get dressed weird thing was they shielded their eyes so they could only see my feet when i got out of bed so i figured they werent going to rape me then they led me to their car and just started to drive i had no idea what was going on until you opened the door what is it with you anyway first it was africa and then atlantic city and now tonight do you go anywhere where there arent armed goons gunning for you her raised voice alerted drag he ambled over and flopped onto his back in front of cali instantly defusing her anger she bent to rub his ample belly looking up at mercer she said for some reason i never pictured you with a dog drags not mine hes harrys harrys here upstairs working on chester bowies damned word games this ones a little more complex than the first one we got from the archive why dont you head up ive got to walk drag ill be back in a second do you think those men theyre gone i believed him when he said he just wants to warn us off and did he mercers eyes tightened for an instant then he smiled not by a long shot cali straightened and kissed mercer softly on the cheek sorry about blowing up like that i was just dont worry about it mercer returned to the brownstone after drag had sniffed at every car tire lamppost and fire hydrant in a twoblock radius before finding one worthy of peeing on when he opened the door he heard calis ringing laughter from the bar and he silently thanked harry for dispelling the last of her misgivings harry had poured her a stiff scotch and was showing her the codes when mercer came into the room harry cast him a wicked look cali told me what happened i told her she has it all wrong you hired those guys just so youd finally have a woman in your house desperate times mercer shot back he moved behind the bar to pour himself another cup of coffee only this one he laced with a generous dram of brandy has he shown you the codes he asked cali or has he just been besmirching my character he cracked the last one i think harry said gout into full gout pout pour four which is our clue by the way then foul fowl bowl boll bull full so the key is harry checked his notes ten times four less five forty minus five mercer said thirtyfive have you started looking for the words a shadow crept across harrys blue eyes yeah and i may be all wrong it doesnt make a whole lot of sense to me what do you have counting every thirtyfifth word gives us this he showed the paper to mercer deer albert nick cola was right trains urine nick elements dew exist in nature see what i mean harry said waving away a cloud of cigarette smoke that was drifting toward calis face bunch of gobbledygook if you ask me mercer read the sentence again and again speeding up slowing down and inserting random pauses two words kept thrusting themselves to the forefront of his mind nick cola nickcola nickcola nickola nikola holy shit what cali and harry cried in unison tesla mercer said and suddenly the rest of the sentence became clear he blanched were in trouble damn it what does it mean dear albert mercer said still grappling with what chester bowie had discovered nikola was right transuranic elements do exist in nature oh my god cali gasped mercer wasnt surprised she understood right away she was a nuclear scientist after all harry still didnt get it so what transuranic elements are elements above uranium on the periodic table mercer replied they can only be produced in a lab by a nuclear reactor most of them decay in a few seconds but theres one that lasts yearshell millennia chester bowies adamantine isnt naturally enriched uranium its fucking plutonium and raw plutonium doesnt need expensive refining with centrifuges and a staff of scientists to be made into a weapon its stuff is ready to go instant dirty bomb a terrorists wet dream come true arlington virginia i have to call my boss at nest cali said at once we have a national emergency on our hands in due time mercer cautioned i want us to get everything together first figure out what we know and determine what we need to find out once were ready you can present it to your nuclear response team while ill go to ira lasko at the white house cali looked uncertain besides he went on its almost midnight we should be able to put a report together by morning if we work through the night she relented okay harry what the hell the old man said ill get plenty of rest when the big sleep comes thanks i owe you a favor actually you owe me twenty thousand favors but whos counting he set to work on chester bowies thirtypage letter to albert einstein mercer made a less sadistic pot of coffee for cali while she slipped into the guest bedroom to clean herself up a bit when she came back her eyes were clear and bright and her hair was tucked into a ponytail shed applied lip gloss which accentuated her generous mouth mind my asking why you have womens toiletries in your guest bathroom she said teasingly theyre harrys mercer deadpanned old letch is a crossdresser somethings bothering me cali said taking a seat at the bar actually everythings bothering me but what i dont understand is how can there be naturally occurring plutonium thats physically impossible not at all traces of it are found all over the planet whats more difficult to explain is a large concentration of it and i think i know the answer ever heard of oklo gabon in west africa cali shook her head in the early seventies a french team discovered unusual ratios of isotopes in a bunch of uranium deposits the discrepancy was tiny but important something had happened to the uranium at first they thought the sample had been contaminated in the lab or at the site but they ruled it out the only logical conclusion was that at some timeand they later figured out it was about two and a half billion years agothe natural uranium deposit had gone critical and started a chain reaction cali finished i have read about it a natural nuclear reactor that operated just like one in a power plant it had all the elements fuel in the form of concentrated uranium there was plenty of water to act as a moderator so the chain reaction didnt turn into a runaway explosion and there werent any neutron absorbers in the rock to prevent the mass going critical in the first place thats exactly right the water that seeped down to the uranium deposits was high in calcium which acted just like the control rods of a nuclear power plant the water also kept the reactor cool enough to allow for a sustained chain reaction how long did it burn do you know estimates range between five hundred thousand and a million years wow and just thinkno one around to protest it mercer joked do you think the ore chester bowie discovered came from another natural reactor like oklo with one critical difference bowies didnt go critical until much more recently otherwise the plutonium would have decayed it has a halflife around twentyfour thousand years so the size of the reactor and the ratio of remaining plutonium would determine its age but if i were to hazard a guess id say it couldnt be more than a couple million years old which in geological terms is yesterday cali was impressed i hadnt thought about that is it possible there are other natural reactors young ones i mean mercer shook his head i doubt it and even if there were chances are theyre buried deep in the crust cali became thoughtful its weird to think my original hunch about elevated cancer rates in africa led us to a natural source of plutonium and something else tipped off someone else cali cocked her head what do you mean poli when we saw him in africa i assumed he was a mercenary hired by caribe dayce to help in his revolution now its more likely that dayce was the muscle hired to protect poli and help him find the deposit thats right damn i hadnt seen the connection polis been on the trail of the plutonium all along which leaves us with tonights visitors what did they call themselves janissaries mercer answered you just knew this would end up involving middle eastern terrorists who or what are janissaries during the ottoman empire they were elite soldiers bound personally to the sultan they were some of the fiercest fighters in history totally ruthless if i remember correctly they grew so powerful that some sultan in the s organized another army and massacred the janissaries to a man and now theyre back i doubt these guys have any legitimate claim theyre just using the name you know though they didnt act like any terrorist ive dealt with over the course of my career they arent wildeyed jihadists ready to blow themselves up at the drop of the koran think about it they saved our lives in africa and again in atlantic city and tonight other than scaring me to death they didnt hurt me they were actually kind of respectful i sleep in the nude and when i got out of bed they averted their eyes cali devout muslims wouldnt want to look at your naked body mercer couldnt stop such an image of her flooding his mind he was sure she knew exactly what he was picturing and turned away he added hastily besides they had guns first of all a year in iraq taught me that men are men all over the world theyll cop a feel or sneak a peek any chance they get muslim jew christianits all the same but these guys didnt and why try to warn us off why not just kill us and be done with it if i was a terrorist thats what i would do mercer considered her point and admitted it had merit poli feines and company obviously didnt care about human life from what hed seen they looked like they enjoyed taking it but the two janissaries hadnt hurt cali tonight and hadnt even threatened them the leader just warned them that if they kept investigating they might get caught in the cross fire what was it they thought he and cali were looking for the alembic of skenderbeg mercer still didnt know what that meant any idea what they thought we were after he asked her the alembic of skenderbeg no clue cali admitted do you have a dictionary from down the bar harry said an alembic is a device once used in distilleries to purify booze figures youd know that mercer remarked sarcastically what about skenderbeg harry returned to his notes couldnt tell you cali followed mercer down to his home office he brushed his hand against a bluish rock on a credenza near the office door it was a personal talisman a piece of kimberlite the lodestone of every diamond mine in the world this particular piece had an exquisite diamond embedded on its underside and had been the gift of a grateful mine owner from south africa i havent had the chance to tell you cali said as mercer fired up his computer your home is beautiful thank you mercer replied i travel so much that i needed to make my home more of a retreat he accessed the internet found a search engine and typed in skenderbeg he read silently for a few moments then said looks like skenderbeg was an albanian general who revolted against the ottoman empire cali interrupted ottoman connection again shed retreated to the leather sofa against the wall throwing the steamer robe that was folded on the arm over her lower body uhuh he died in seems he held off a turkish army five times the size of his and managed to keep albania independent for twentyfive years hes considered one of their national heroes sort of a medieval george washington what about an alembic her eyes were closed and mercer could tell she was moments from falling asleep mercers fingers blurred across the keyboard as he tried several variations on his search but came up empty nada when cali didnt respond he looked up her breathing was shallow and even her lips slightly parted she was out he came around from behind his desk to stand over her despite her considerable height shed managed to turn herself into a tight ball with one hand under her cheek he couldnt help but think of tisa again although there was no similarity between her and cali tisa had dark sloe eyes and delicate asian features and the small body of a gymnast cali was allamerican with her red hair and freckles which mercer could see covered her upper chest and he suspected the rest of her as well she was tall and lanky more angles than curves but she moved with an athletic grace that softened her hard edges and mercer admitted she was the first woman he had been attracted to since tisas death in truth they had spent very little time together but under the intensity of the circumstances he had come to understand herthe way she thought the way she reacted and most importantly what she thought of herself she was confident and selfassured characteristics that mercer found appealing above everything else but now wasnt the time for any of these thoughts he had to resist the urge to brush a wisp of hair from across her forehead he straightened the blanket instead pulling it up so it was just under her chin and removed her shoes her feet were long and narrow with delicate bones and skin so pale he could see where veins came close to the surface she made a little sound then sighed as she drifted deeper to sleep he gave her one last look smiled then left the office turning down the lights to a faint glow so if she woke during the night shed be able to see a bit mercer made sure all the doors were locked before heading up to the master suite on the third floor the beretta in his nightstand was probably the fifth or sixth one hed owned some hed lost in fights while others were in evidence lockers it was a reliable weapon and he knew its capabilities as well as he knew his own he knew the ninemillimeter was loaded but checked it anyway there was a round in the chamber and the safety was off he safed the pistol and stuck it behind his back he doubted poli would come tonight but he wasnt going to take any chances hed make sure that starting tomorrow harry stayed at his own place while he would ensure that ira lasko got him and cali into a safe house back in the bar harry was snoring on the couch a deep rumbling that sounded like the dying gasps of a bear drag was curled around harrys prosthetic leg his nose near where the leg was strapped to the stump so he could spend the night smelling his beloved master mercer didnt adjust harrys blanket he took a seat at the bar and saw that harry hadnt finished his work yet so he set aside harrys notes and instead read the lengthy letter to einstein to keep himself awake through the long night at noon the next day ira laskos secretary led cali and mercer through to laskos office in the old executive office building adjacent to the white house ira came around his big desk to shake calis hand as mercer made the introduction so youre the lady mercer met in africa a la stanley and livingstone the top of his bald head barely reached her chin when he called me from new jersey night before last he mentioned youre with doe im a field investigator with nest nuclear response team your boss is cliff roberts then thats right hes an ass cali grinned warming to laskos directness immediately that he is hes exnavy like me i spent a year with him at the pentagon he has the imagination of a kumquat and half the brains he only got his gig at nest when homeland security was created after he indicated they should take the chairs in front of his desk while he slid around to his seat the office was large and comfortable with wainscoting and a plush green carpet there were only a few framed pictures and papers on the walls as well as an american flag ira also wore a flag lapel pin there was a model of a submarine on a credenza an old sturgeon class that lasko had served on as executive officer before moving over to naval intelligence he turned to mercer so whats so hellfire important that i have to give up a golf game with the chairman of the joint chiefs a couple hundred pounds of plutonium thats been missing for seventy plus years mercer explained about the naturally occurring nuclear reactor at oklo and his theory of how what they thought was an unusually concentrated uranium deposit was in fact the remnants of a much younger reactor that hadnt fully decayed what are the chances there are other such reactors ira asked when mercer finished cali asked the same thing last night remote i think this is probably the only one like it in the world so how did that guy find it you told me at dinner the other night that he was either the best geologist in the world or the luckiest chester bowie was his name mercer said and he wasnt a geologist at all he taught classics at a small college in new jersey he wasnt looking for uranium or plutonium he was searching for a mine out of greek mythology lost me according to mythology zeus chained prometheus for defying him and giving fire to humanity the chains were made from an unbreakable metal called adamantine bowie thought he knew where the adamantine had come from he ran into a little problem of funding his expedition and talked it over with a colleague from princeton hoping the ivy league school might see merit in his research not likely ira growled on the contrary someone at princeton was very interested none other than albert einstein himself from what i gather nikola tesla the croatianborn genius who invented the alternating current electrical system we use today had contacted einstein in the mids with the theory that there were elements higher than uranium on the periodic table remember this was six or seven years before enrico fermi created the first sustained chain reaction at the university of chicago and four or five before einstein wrote his famous letter to roosevelt indicating the theoretical possibility of an atomic bomb bowie didnt know how einstein became aware of his grant request but he did and agreed to have princeton fund his trip einstein warned bowie that what he might find wasnt adamantine from his mythology but a new and potentially dangerous element bowie was certain einstein and tesla had it wrong and was eager to prove himself to two of the greatest minds of his generation was bowie well regarded in his field ira asked mercer chuckled the guy was a total flake a real zealot when it came to his theories he refused to believe anyone but himself he sounds deranged he was obsessivecompulsive arrogant you name it mercer picked up the story again so he went to africa and using his research into greek mythology he found the mine he mentions in his journal that there was an ancient stele there to mark the site wait whats a stele a carved stone obelisk used by the egyptians usually to mark a military victory or some important event so this goes back to the egyptians mercer held up a hand thats getting ahead of the story but cali and i both remember seeing it in the village square it was about seven feet tall and very weathered anyway bowie hired some locals to help him dig out samples of the ore and as you know ever since then the natives have been suffering from longterm radiation exposure he crated up about a thousand pounds worth of dirt and made his way to the port city of brazzaville thats where he realized that he wasnt the only person looking for the ore in fact it seemed there were a couple of groups interested in what he was doing in the interior he was pretty sure his guide had betrayed him to some german agents im sure youre aware that the nazis had a thing for the occult and had sent out teams of agents to find certain ancient relics hitler needed them to legitimize his claim about pure aryan stock and all that crap thats how they came into possession of the spear of longinus the weapon purportedly used to pierce christs side ive seen the movie ira said lost ark and all that besides that fits with what you told me about others showing up at that village a few years after bowie to mine the rest of the ore and gunning down most of the villagers mercer added anyway bowie managed to get the crates of ore samples onto a tramp steamer called the wetherby with orders that it go to chicago where einstein believed fermi should study it to see if they really were transuranic elements why didnt bowie stay with the ship paranoia plus he had just spent several weeks around plutonium without any kind of protection he realized he was suffering from radiation poisoning and was also wracked with malaria and a few other fun tropical bugs theres a line in his diary that goes something like for three days my bowels ran like the river styx lovely the day after the ship sailed he was almost killed by a pair of men he believed were germans they tried to muscle him into a car but two other men dressed in dark suits came out of nowhere shot the germans and vanished who were they did he know he didnt but we do mercers statement invited an explanation cali said last night two men in dark suits showed up at my condo and forced me to go with them they took me to mercers where they warned us to stop searching for something called the alembic of skenderbeg they were the same guys who wiped out caribe dayce and his army in africa and took on poli feines at the deco palace mercer added they called themselves janissaries and said we were caught up in an ancient conflict we couldnt possibly understand ira held up a hand hold on are you saying that the men who saved bowie in brazzaville are the same two who took out dayce no but i think they belong to the same organization a secret group thats been around for at least seventy years and may have roots going back to the s skenderbeg whose real name was gjergi kastrioti was an albanianborn general in the ottoman army a janissary who eventually revolted against sultan murad ii he captured a key town in albania and with a force never exceeding twenty thousand managed to keep the ottomans quarter million men at bay for twentyfive years he had close diplomatic ties and financial support from the vatican because he was defending christendom from islamic invaders whats interesting and why i mention all this is that the name skenderbeg is a local translation of the ottoman iskender bey or iskender the great we know him as alexander the great this morning i got in touch with an ottoman history teacher at george washington university to get some more background on skenderbeg its accepted conjecture that skenderbeg was given this title because his military skill matched that of alexanders but theres another story one that cant be verified it was rumored that he possessed a talisman of some sort that alexander carried into battle against his greatest foe darius at the battle of arbela in b c and it was this talisman that allowed both men to defeat armies ten times the size of their own what sort of talisman the professor didnt know but i assume its this alembic the janissaries mentioned the professor said the real expert on skenderbeg is a turkish historian named ibriham ahmad i tried calling him in istanbul but just left a message we have a theory cali said before his final battle against darius alexander invaded egypt and overthrew the persian governor according to history the people welcomed him openly and paved the way for the construction of the city of alexandria home to the famous library during his stay in egypt he went to the temple of zeusammon someplace in the libyan desert it was there that the oracle revealed to him that he was the son of ammon egypts chief deity and was thus a god himself a year later he defeated darius with you so far ira said what if alexander received something else when he visited the oracle like how to procure a great weapon fit for a god trade along the north african coast was well established by this time its possible the priests had learned about magic rocks that could incapacitate an army and told alexander where to find them what we think mercer said is he sent a column to central africa to the site near the scilla river there they mined some of the plutonium ore and erected a stele to commemorate their visit we think alexander went into battle against darius using an improvised radiological bomb cali concluded we checked and the battle of arbela was carefully staged both alexander and darius knew when and where they were going to meet its possible that in the days leading up to the battle alexander had radiological dust spread around dariuss encampment his people would need little more protection than rags tied around their mouths so they didnt inhale the plutonium which is the only way plutonium is fatal by the way while dariuss men would suffer radiation poisoning nothing lethal but enough to incapacitate them and allow alexanders smaller army to wipe them out now jump forward seventeen hundred years to albania mercer added and you have a general who holds off a huge army for decades using a talisman that once belonged to alexander the great we think skenderbeg used his alembic to dose the ottoman army with enough radiation to make them too sick to fight what happened to skenderbeg he died in of natural causes mercer said his men held out for another decade but eventually they were overrun and his alembic ira had a dubious look on his pug face mercer shrugged im hoping professor ahmad in istanbul can answer that admiral lasko cali said i know this all sounds like a bit of a stretch but theres a line in chester bowies journal that ties it together somewhat he left brazzaville right after the abduction attempt and made his way across africa to alexandria in his journal he wrote that given a couple of days he could have found alexanders hidden tomb he knew there was a connection between alexander the great and his work from there mercer went on he caught a steamer to europe where he did the one thing the nazis would never suspect he knew he was dying and wanted to reach america as fast as possible to tell einstein what hed discovered he sent einstein a telegram from athens and einstein wrote him back telling him to contact otto hahn a nuclear physicist who would eventually win the nobel prize for being the first person to split a uranium atom cali interrupted hahn wasnt a nazi and he refused to work on germanys nuclear bomb program so when einstein contacted him about chester bowie he made arrangements for bowies return to the united states the fastest way possiblethe airship hindenburg are you telling me he was on the hindenburg when it exploded mercer nodded which makes me think that maybe the conspiracy theorists are right and the zeppelin was sabotaged only it wasnt about discrediting the nazis but about preventing bowie from giving the sample of plutonium to einstein jesus ira exclaimed who how my moneys on the germans themselves and heres why in the last few pages of his diary bowie said an officer came to his cabin he killed the officer believing that the germans had found out who he was and werent going to let him off the airship thats when he wrote down his story and tucked it in the safe he tied einsteins name to a tag on the outside and heaved it out the window but what makes me think it was the germans and bowie wasnt being paranoid is that the airship was delayed coming into lakehurst because of a storm but what if the captain was ordered to wait because the nazi higherups were trying to think of a way to destroy it i dont know if youre aware but after the hindenburg blew up the germans refused to let anyone help clean up the debris they sent over teams themselves to haul the zeppelins skeleton back to germany that could have been cover to find bowies safe in the wreckage only he was a step ahead of them and heaved it over the side above waretown new jersey i think it was the janissaries cali offered i think they realized theyd made a mistake letting bowie go in brazzaville somehow learned he was going to be on the hindenburg and had someone in the united states in place to take it out ira scratched his bald head i might have a third candidate one that might squirrel all your theories he reached into the middle drawer of his desk and placed an item on the blotter mercer recognized it at once thats the bullet the old woman gave me in africa i sent it to the fbi lab at quantico ira said this my friend isnt a german round but a by shell casing from either a pistol or a pp sh submachine gun which if you arent aware was the standard automatic weapon for the soviet army during world war two the soviets mercer and cali said as one and then fell silent mercer hadnt expected this at all he was certain that it was the germans who were after bowie as far as he knew the soviet union didnt even have a nuclear program until spies infiltrated the manhattan project in the s so why would they want plutonium five years earlier he was about to mention this when cali spoke up it makes perfect sense she said we know the soviet union had spies at los alamos which is how they got the plans for the bomb stalin knew more about it than truman when they met at potsdam and the president mentioned we had a weapon that would end the war what has never made sense to me and a lot of people who studied the history was how the soviets were able to create their own bomb so soon after the japanese surrender rather than the decades we expected to have nuclear dominance we lost it in just four years the entire western third of russia had been devastated by the war cali went on whole cities were destroyed and millions of people were left homeless the soviets didnt receive any of the aid we gave to europe to rebuild in fact they had to spend money to shore up their holdings in eastern europe i know stalin was a ruthless tyrant but the economics dont pan out they didnt have the resources to keep their people from starving while trying to rebuild their own country occupy eastern europe all the way to germany and spend a hundred billion dollars building their own bomb even with the plans provided by stalins spies it takes a tremendous amount of sophistication and resources to refine fissionable materials she caught mercers eye but what if he already had those materials if the russians had some of the ore it would dramatically reduce the amount of time and the cost it would take to build an atomic bomb they could easily do it in four years and still do everything else i mentioned makes sense ira said thoughtfully ive got a lot of contacts in russia and since the collapse theyve been pretty forthcoming with information from the bad old days ill ask around to see if what you surmise is true he looked at mercer what about you where do you want to take this cali spoke with her supervisor at nest weve got them tracing the disappearance of the wetherby how do you know she disappeared simple nowhere in the history books does it say enrico fermi experimented with plutonium ore in the s so he must have never received the samples ergo the wetherby vanished also i think someone should take a look at that stele cali and i saw in africa there could be clues on it about how much ore alexanders people mined is that important ira asked i mean come on were talking ancient history if were only right about alexander possessing a radiological bomb or dispersal device then id agree but the janissaries who nabbed cali last night act as though the alembic is lying around for someone to find you told me over dinner that you think that part of the central african republic is still pretty hot i dont want to send a team in there unless youre sure its important mercer silently cursed ira though he didnt believe his old friend was deliberately putting the responsibility for a potentially dangerous operation on his shoulders he was just being cautious but mercer knew the ultimate responsibility would fall on him if something went wrong like serenas death and the others at the casino like tisas and dozens morehe felt the weight of it all pressing down on him it would be so easy to just tell ira to forget it that he didnt need to send a special forces team into the middle of a war zone he could crawl out from under a little of his guilt but mercer also knew it would be wrong it didnt matter if the stele turned out to be nothing more than a marker saying the equivalent of kilroy was here he had to know no matter the cost yeah mercer finally said its important consider it done ira replied with finality buffalo new york mercer opened the door of the cessna citation executive jet as soon as the wheels stopped rolling mist that was almost rain swept buffalo niagara international airport making the runway lights blur into the distance dawn was just a ruddy promise hunkered low against the eastern horizon he grabbed his leather hand grip but didnt bother pulling up the hood of his north face rain jacket as soon as he stepped from the aircraft water glittered like jewels in his thick hair dr mercer a mans voice called from the rear of the airports general aviation gate im mercer he replied and strode across the tarmac paying scant attention to the multimilliondollar jets parked all around a throaty roar swallowed the mans next sentence as a boeing hauled itself into the dark sky what was that mercer asked as he reached the protection of a glass enclosure that led into the building i said you have a car waiting to take you to the docks thank you mercer said and followed the executive jet service employee through the lounge they walked across the quiet airport and eventually reached an exit a black town car idled at the curb its driver waiting expectantly in the front seat mercer didnt wait for the chauffeur to open the door he did it himself then tossed his bag into the back and swung himself into the front seat morning he said in greeting to the startled driver im not important enough for the full chauffeur treatment so ill ride up front with you guy gets off a private jet and says hes not important dont know his place in the world but it makes me no never mind the driver eased the big lincoln into gear and headed out of the airport complex soon they were on route headed west toward an area of industrial warehouses along the niagara river as the car eased between two metal buildings and onto the dock mercer saw a tight cluster of people huddled around the gangway of a large flatbottomed barge above them a street lamp cast their faces in heavy relief sitting atop the barge was a crane with a modified smooth silhouette it reminded him of the lowslung turret of a modern battle tank rather than a lifting derrick it was tied to a small tug with sidemounted exhaust so the vessel was no more than ten feet high from the waterline to the top of its radar dish mercer recognized cali stowe standing with the people she stood several inches taller than all of them when he got out of the car she looked over and waved she wore a dark windbreaker and her hair was covered in a baseball cap her jeans were just tight enough to outline the lean shape of her legs mercer grabbed his bag thanked the driver and approached the group the drizzle had stopped and dawn was fast approaching the air remained crisp with the smell of lake erie welcome to buffalo cali greeted it was the first time theyd seen each other since the meeting with ira lasko four days earlier and he had to resist the urge to kiss her cheek had they been alone he would have done it let me introduce you around she said philip mercer this is my boss cliff roberts because cali and ira had a low opinion of the director of the nuclear emergency search team mercer knew he wouldnt like him either roberts had mouse brown hair and indistinct features except for a pursed mouth that looked as if hed just swallowed something sour his stance made certain that his trench coat was open enough for everyone to see it was a burberry he didnt meet mercers eyes when they shook hands and his grip was limp pleasure to have you with us roberts said with little warmth it was obvious he resented mercers presence in what was to be nests highest profile operation when or if word got out about what they were doing im glad to be here mercer replied neutrally when admiral lasko wanted an observer i happened to be available roberts said nothing so cali piped in and these two characters are jesse williams and stanley slaughbaugh theyre part of my regular nest team stans a phd from stanford and jesse joined our outfit after babysitting nukes for the air force mercer shook their hands he eyed jesse williams didnt you play for the air force academy good memory man williams grinned that was fifteen years ago missed the heisman by five votes i have a friend who well hes a bookie mercer was talking about tiny he said the most money he ever won on a game was when you upset michigan state in the cotton bowl williamss smile faded just a tick same game i blew my acl and any chance of a pro career and finally this is lieutenant commander ruth bishop from the coast guard cali said not wanting to hear another insufferable football conversation ruths here to ensure we follow the coastys regulations concerning the salvage and shell act as liaison with her canadian counterpart since the wetherby is pretty close to the border she was a short woman in a coast guard utility uniform her hair was streaked with silver and there were lines around her mouth and bright blue eyes mercer had the impression they were laughter rather than frown lines she glanced at cali before saying hello which made mercer think the two women had talked about him prior to his arrival just think of me as your den mother she said with a toothy smile that made her glow with warmth when youre not sure about something ask me for permission before you do it so when i have to peepee her smile deepened ask me and ill give you a hall pass just dont make on the canadians theyre touchy about that mercer laughed yes maam ruth is also a bit of the local expert on the wetherby cali added shes made four dives down to her over the years not for a few years now lieutenant commander bishop admitted whats her condition mercer asked before ruth could answer he asked another question first of all why dont you tell me what happened to her and what kind of ship she was okay first the wetherby was a tramp steamer whats called a stick ship she was only two hundred twenty feet long and thirty feet at the beam she was coal fired had a single stack and from what ive been able to learn hadnt seen a moments maintenance after she put to sea bishop corrected herself thats not entirely true she served admirably during world war one on convoy duty but after that she was a derelict waiting to happen so what happened when she reached buffalo the wetherby put in here on the night of august where she was picking up some machine parts headed for cleveland she was then supposed to go on to detroit milwaukee and finally chicago where cali said the cargo you are interested in was destined thats right early morning august she unloaded some fuel oil barrels shed picked up in montreal that were supposed to have come down the st lawrence on another ship during the transfer a fire started in the hold since no one physically inspected the wreck because she sank investigators had to go along with eyewitnesses who claimed she was struck by lightning theres a problem with their story it was a statement more than a question it was raining that day but no one other than the crew in the hold recall any lightning in the area its possible a static charge built up and its discharge ignited one of the fuel barrels but im putting my money on either a longshoreman or a member of the crew smoking in the hold a dropped match in some spilled bunker fuel and voila she made the motion of an explosion with her hands how many men were killed six in the hold including the wetherbys second officer kerry frey another man was killed on the dock a local vagrant well known at the time another body was recovered from the river about a mile downstream but he was never identified no idea who he was none everyone was accounted for a lot of people said he had nothing to do with the wetherby because his body wasnt burned but i think its too much of a coincidence mercer glanced at cali she was already looking at him janissary he mouthed but she just shrugged he turned back to ruth bishop go on as the fire raged out of control a crane operator on the dock panicked when he jumped from the cab of his crane he hit a lever that sent a pallet of fuel drums plummeting back into the blaze when they exploded a second later it blew out the side of the wetherby as if shed been torpedoed mercer didnt say it aloud but he was sure she had told this story many times her sense of dramatic timing was too good not to be practiced the wetherby rolled right there against the dock parting her mooring hawsers as she turned onto her side another stevedore was injured by one of the heavy ropes when it snapped back toward the dock he lost his hand but went on to make a full recovery in fact his niece is a lieutenant commander in the coast guard it took mercer a second to process that bit of information ah so thats how you became interested in the disaster uncle ralph told me this story so many times i had it memorized by the time i was ten ruth admitted so the wetherbys on fire and capsized thats right the current took hold of her before she could settle and she started drifting down the niagara river toward the falls because she was on her side she slipped under the railroad bridge that spanned the river between fort erie and buffalo and also under the nearby peace bridge eyewitness on the peace bridge said that it looked like the river was on fire as she passed underneath and people at the falls saw the burning oil slick going over and thought it was part of a show by the time the wetherby reached grand island where the niagara splits into the chippawa and american channels shed grounded herself a couple of times once for nearly two hours before enough water had piled against her upstream side to push her farther toward the falls she finally came to rest just above the northern tip of grand island in the chippawa channel and as luck would have it she settled into the deepest trough on the river a sixtyfoot sinkhole left over when the glaciers retreated and created both the river and the falls that reminded mercer that niagara falls had only been in existence since the last ice age some twelve thousand years ago that wasnt even a blink of an eye in geologic terms what was she like when you dove on her shes lying on her side and like i said in sixty feet of water the part of her hull facing the surface is in good shape freshwater isnt as corrosive as salt but shes taken a beating from logs and other flotsam coming down from erie on the way to the falls last time i went down and that was a good ten years ago she had an oak tree embedded in her forecastle what are diving conditions like hell a voice called out mr crenna cali greeted the stranger then turned to the little group this is brian crenna from erie salvage and dredging hell be in charge of the salvage barge and support ship cali made the introductions crenna was a plug of a man standing about five foot six with a hard round gut and a snarled black beard he wore company coveralls and steeltoed boots a hardhat tucked under one of his muscular arms when mercer shook his hand he realized crenna was missing his pinkie he also realized that crenna wasnt particularly happy about being here why do you say the conditions are hell mercer asked crenna spat because about a hundred and seventyfive thousand cubic feet of water come down the niagara river every second thats twelve thousand tons some places the current runs two knots some it runs eight some days the winds come from lake erie which increases the flow ten or twenty percent others its off ontario which slows things a bit and some days it changes every couple of hours so you never know what youre going to get then theres the fact that last winter saw some heavy snows so the rivers still in flood and that sinkhole where the wetherby got herself lodged is loaded with back currents and whirlpools if you know anything about diving then youll know what im describing is hell he waited for anyone to speak when no one did he added and dont forget if you get into trouble the damned falls are only a couple miles downstream yes well thank you cliff roberts said in his best bureaucratic voice i named a crazy price to agree to this job crenna said addressing roberts and you said youd pay it but dont for a second think i agree this is a good idea we should wait until the spring runoff ebbs and we know well have a few good days of weather roberts pulled himself to his full five foot seven while he managed an inch on the tow boat operator he fell far short of intimidating him youve been hired by the united states government for a very important mission we are paying you for your expert advice concerning the salvage operation anything else you have to say is merely your opinion and quite frankly i dont care about it do your job mercer expected crenna to turn around and walk off again placed in a similar circumstance mercer would have after a few choice words crenna stood his ground his dark eyes never leaving robertss and it was almost as if mercer could see his mind at work but in the end he must have decided the money was more important to him than his own feelings about working for a martinet like roberts you coming with us he finally asked no the director of nest said as if the question was absurd im needed back in washington crenna spat again good nuf why dont you tell mercer the plan cali said to dispel the tension and cleanse the air of testosterone mercer just arrived and hasnt been filled in yet crenna shot mercer a dark look you another one from washington dont hold it against me but thats where i live im a prospecting geologist noticed the hands when we shook crenna remarked and glanced at roberts figured youve done some work in your life mercer knew the type it was inevitable in his line of work when on a consulting job he usually spent equal amounts of time with mine managers and the miners themselves while most understood the other guys had a job to do there were always a few on both sides who carried a chip on their shoulder about their own importance there was nothing wrong with being proud of what you did mercer applauded it what he didnt like and what he saw in roberts as well as crenna was disdain for the other side of the managementlabor symbiosis so what is your plan mr crenna captain captain it is as soon as my crew arrives crenna began well tow the crane under the bridges and downstream to the site as you can see shes built low because there isnt much clearance under them bridges once over the wetherby ill deploy the hydraulic anchors to keep us in position then ill send for you all i dont want you on the barge until its secure cali made to protest but crenna cut her off ive got liability issues as it is so no argument once youre aboard ill send down a couple of divers to assess the wreckage and determine the best way in youre not going to try to lift her cant risk it if the current picks up crenna said the hulk would produce enough drag to pull the anchors off the river bottom mercer nodded crenna seemed to know his business most likely youll have to cut through the hull to find the crates which shouldnt be too difficult crenna agreed with a little luck well get her open by tomorrow and have your crates on the surface the next day or so provided theyre still aboard its possible they were thrown from her when she was being dragged downriver which case theyre in the sinkhole at the base of the falls which is deeper than the falls are high mercer had considered that when cali first told him shed found that the wetherby had sunk on the niagara river but even with the possibility that the crates of plutonium ore lay scattered at the base of the largest waterfall in north america he still considered her discovery the first break theyd had in the investigation professor ahmad in istanbul hadnt returned mercers repeated calls and ira was making slow progress with the russian authorities concerning their operation into the car it was also taking time to assemble a team to investigate the stele ira had explained everything to his boss national security advisor john kleinschmidt but so far neither had had any luck persuading the pentagon to dispatch a special forces unit into africa and now state department officials were getting involved citing all kinds of sovereignty issues ira had told mercer that they would probably have to tell the president and have him issue an executive order but they got lucky when it came to the wetherby cali had done the research and quickly discovered that the ship had sunk in the niagara river just north of grand island the wreck was well known in the buffalo area and when shed asked the local historical society she was given ruth bishops name as an expert on the wreck a call to the coast guard confirmed that ruth was the person she needed to speak with ruth told her of her diving experiences on the wreck and helped locate a salvage master willing to take on the job cliff roberts had used his influence to clear the bureaucratic hurdles that cropped up and just days after learning the wetherbys location cali had everything in place to salvage chester bowies ore samples mercer marveled at how effortlessly she seemed to pull everything together usually an expedition as complex as this especially so close to a foreign border would have taken months if not years he shot her another glance now that the sky was growing brighter he could see the red swelling under her eyes and a little furrow between them she noted his scrutiny and shot him a tired smile then a saucy wink mercer made a phone call as crennas crew of four arrived and fifteen minutes later they cast off the tugboat amid a roar of blue exhaust the international railway bridge was a short distance down the river and from mercers vantage it looked like the tug wouldnt fit but he had to trust the captain to know what he was doing well im off cliff roberts said as if someone was going to miss him cali i expect reports every hour once the crane is in position he nodded to mercer and ruth bishop and shook hands with williams and slaughbaugh good luck to you all he headed for one of a pair of identical rental cars parked next to a black suburban with tinted windows that mercer suspected belonged to calis nest team its large cargo area was doubtlessly filled with their equipment the fourth car was a minivan that had to belong to ruth bishop what a wanker stan slaughbaugh said as soon as his boss was out of earshot you said it my man jesse williams agreed think what you want cali said but we wouldnt be here if he hadnt pulled a lot of strings so what do we do now boss stan asked wiping absently at his hornrimmed glasses i had expected wed be going out with the barge and staying on site cali replied i guess we find a hotel any recommendations ruth whos picking up the tab she asked uncle sam hyatts about the best in the city then the hyatt it is she turned to mercer sorry about having you fly here so quickly i really thought wed be going out with the crane thats okay i wasnt making much progress back home and harrys been driving me nuts wondering when he can come back and start drinking my booze again they drifted to their vehicles ruth said her goodbyes and said to call her tomorrow if they needed anything while mercer set his heavy hand grip into the rear of the rental stan and jesse had driven the nest suburban from washington cali got behind the wheel and told jesse to follow her she found the hyatt on the cars trip computer and started out i dont think it was the janissaries who attacked the wetherby you said in iras office that you believed they took out the hindenburg if they had the ability to blow an airship out of the sky to stop bowie from delivering a small sample to einstein its not too much of a stretch for them to destroy the freighter hauling the bulk of the plutonium ore hed mined i thought of a problem with my idea that the janissaries destroyed the hindenburg cali said with a trace of concern in her voice if bowie took the fastest mode of transportation available at the time to return to the united states how did a janissary beat him here so hed be in place to cause the explosion carl dion told me when i called him that tickets werent hard to get on that particular flight its possible that a janissary was on the voyage then why blow it up all he needed to do was kill bowie and heave the safe out a window when they were over the atlantic it doesnt make sense that hed allow bowie to keep the safe during the flight and then destroy the hindenburg when she was getting ready to land okay so there wasnt a janissary on the flight mercer said back to my point how did the janissaries get someone to america faster than the fastest way possible maybe they had agents here i considered that but i dont buy it okay tell me why as far as we know this outfit is strictly interested with protecting the alembic of skenderbeg and all our research so far points to them being confined to africa and europe it wasnt until bowie came along that they had a threat from the united states there is absolutely no reason for them to stage assets here not unless the organization is huge like the masons or something and its not or we would have heard about it by now i can see a small secret society lasting a couple of centuries undetected not some largescale organization with recruiters in north america she shook her head decisively doesnt wash so if there wasnt a janissary on the hindenburg and they didnt have someone here then was it the russians or the germans i dont know we know the russians were involved somehow so it could have been them they had all kinds of spies in the united states during the thirties same with the germans either one of them could have radioed someone to shoot the hindenburg down you couldnt destroy the hindenburg with anything smaller than a shoulderfired rocket mercer told her are you nuts it was loaded with millions of cubic feet of hydrogen a small spark and instant firecracker au contraire mercer said sure of his subject hydrogen needs oxygen in order to burn and the ratio is very narrow too much or too little o and it wont catch fire there would have to have been a sustained leak in one of the gas cells in order for hydrogen to be the culprit and that would have been noticed by the officers in the control car also you cant see a hydrogen fire its like pure alcohol it burns clear and if youve ever seen footage of the explosion you can clearly see the flames from the very beginning the latest theories concerning the destruction of the hindenburg focus on the waterproofing dope used to cover the skin it was basically a paste made of the same chemicals found in rocket fuel some experts believe that a spark from one of the engines landed on the envelope causing a small fire that quickly grew to encompass the entire airship it was only then that the hydrogen detonated cali was silent for a moment digesting mercers words ah ha she said with a wicked grin incendiary bullets did they have them back then absolutely it was mercers turn to think through the scenario he could find no flaw in her reasoning about the russians or germans or about a sniper using incendiary bullets to ignite the airships explosive skin you know he said at last theyre going to have to rewrite a lot of history books by the time were done niagara river new york mercer cali and her nest team met brian crennas support boat at a pier on grand island a chilled mist clung to the fastflowing river and obscured the forest on the canadian side in the middle of the channel sat crennas barge the cranes telescoping boom rising into the fog like a spindly finger the tires hanging from the side of the barge looked like oversized portholes and they could clearly see men on her deck the support vessel was an old cabin cruiser that had seen better days the once white fiberglass hull had yellowed with age and the red strip along her waterline had faded to the color of old brick crenna brought the boat in fast cutting a tight circle at the last moment to lay the cruiser against the dock barely squeezing the rubber fenders the three fishermen readying their big bertram sportfisher farther down the jetty looked up when the wake made their vessel bob but they didnt say anything about the breach of maritime etiquette howd it go cali called after a deckhand had tied the craft to the wooden dock and crenna had idled the engine no problem weve got the crane anchored just upstream of the wetherby he pointed to the stack of black trunks on the dock whats with all the gear just some scientific instruments cali said plus a pair of dry suits the waters freezing by her evasive tone mercer realized that captain crenna hadnt been informed exactly what was in the crates they hoped to recover he supposed it didnt mater as hed told ira plutonium isnt particularly dangerous unless ingested or inhaled as long as the crates maintained their integrity crenna and his crew werent in any danger oh cali said as if shed just remembered and a bunch of gas masks crennas scowl deepened gas masks what the hell for asbestos from the wetherby given her age shes going to be loaded with it when we bring up the trunks you and your crew are going to have to wear them sorry its an epa regulation crenna shook his head damned government regulations all right load up and lets go nicely done mercer whispered to cali as they started helping jesse and stan transfer the matteblack trunks onto the cruiser he made sure no one touched the big leather hand grip that hadnt left his side since washington as the cruiser pulled from the dock mercer tossed a casual wave at the three fishermen who were still puttering around their boat two waved back and the third a large black man wearing a greek fishermans cap gave him an ironic salute the barge wasnt as new as the crane sitting at its stern rust showed in streaks through worn paint and scaled the railings equipment bins overflowed with coils of rope lengths of chain and various tools there was a compressor for refilling the scuba tanks that looked like crenna had either just bought it or had rented it for the job the crane used to be mounted on a truck crenna explained i put it on this barge a couple of years ago when i was hired to salvage a fishing boat that sank on the other side of grand island it cost the owner twice what the boat was worth but i wasnt complaining so whos diving mercer and i cali replied jesse williams looked up from one of the trunks i thought i was going you will when we set the burn charges mercer wanted to check out the wetherby for himself the former college football star looked at mercer you know what youre doing after years of procrastination mercer had finally gotten his dive certification a few months earlier although hed dived countless times before while hed only ever gone down wearing a wet suit or just swim trunks when hed asked cali for the chance to see the wetherby shed told him the dry suits were just more cumbersome ill be fine hed said they were ready to go an hour later because she had more experience cali would carry the dive computer strapped to her wrist as well as a waterproofed gamma ray detector mercers os systems nautilus dry suit was a little snug around the crotch because he was taller than jesse williams but otherwise it felt comfortable jesse helped him into his tanks buoyancy compensator and weight belt while stan checked over calis gear jesse went over procedures for filling and venting the suit during the dive and made sure mercers knife and the steel pry bar were secure youre sure about this williams asked before fitting the helmet piece of cake mercer popped his jaw to equalize the pressure when the helmet was sealed how do you read me cali asked over the integrated communications net loud and clear together they waddled over to the rear of the service boat where a gate had been opened cali jumped first mercer waited until her head bobbed up before following her into the water even with the protection of the dry suit and thermal underwear he could feel the close presence of the cold waters but it was the current he noticed most it ran about three knots powerful enough to sweep him downriver if he wasnt careful visibility was no more than twenty feet and would diminish when they reached the wreck captain crenna had lowered an anchor down to the wetherby its line vanishing into the murky gloom cali put one hand on the rope and dumped air from her suit allowing herself to glide into the depths mercer followed adjusting his suit as the water pressure caused a fold of the tightly woven nylon to dig under his arm the morning fog had dissipated but there was a lot of sediment in the water dramatically cutting visibility mercer snapped on his dive light when he saw that cali had slowed her descent just like ruth bishop had said the wetherby had settled into a trough in the river bottom where she was sheltered from the worst of the current she lay on her port side with her classic champagneglass stern pointing upstream her hull was continuously scoured clean by the river although there were still thousands of cut fishing lines streaming from her rails and superstructure the ship was doubtless home to a lot of salmon and walleye and local anglers paid the price for fishing on her with snagged lines her superstructure had been battered over the years first when she drifted and sank and later by flotsam flowing down toward niagara falls at some point the tree ruth mentioned had been ripped free leaving a gaping hole cali and mercer attached safety lines to her stern bollards and finned the length of the vessel her funnel was long gone and silt had built up around her bow where powerful back eddies had formed one of her forward hatches was still secured while the other was open a yawning square that revealed her darkened hold because she rested on her port side there was no evidence of the explosion that had sent her to the bottom what do you think cali asked as they held tight to their lines just outside the open hold the current pushing at them like a stiff breeze mercer flashed his light into the hold but its beam could barely cut the gloom lets belay the line and take a look inside they tied off their ropes to give them some slack making sure that the tough nylon wouldnt scrape over any sharp surfaces they were both well aware that a mistake here could mean certain death plummeting over the falls just downstream the floor of the hold which was actually the wetherbys port side was littered with barrels and crates lying in a disorganized heap mercer again had to adjust his suit as the pressure squeezed it against his body he checked his depth and saw they were at fiftyseven feet the water was markedly colder even through the protective clothing here they could see evidence of the deadly explosion hull plates had been blown out by the blast and hammered flat by the ships tumble down the river ruths uncle had been right it did look as though the wetherby had been torpedoed cali examined a couple of the crates do you think any of these are the ones were looking for no mercer answered confidently bowies crates were loaded months before the wetherby reached buffalo the captain would have tucked them out of the way because he wouldnt need to reach them until they got to chicago this hold looks like it was used for cargo theyd need to access quickly he swam aft and found a hatchway that led to the next hold the door had been warped by the explosion but when he tried to open it farther he found it frozen by time he loosened the pry bar from its velcro holster and rammed it into a seam he placed his feet against the wall and heaved back on the hardened steel slowly building pressure until his spine felt like it was going to tear through the muscles of his back the door refused to budge mercer repositioned the bar closer to the most damaged hinge and again drew back the metal rod a kaleidoscope of colors exploded behind his tightly closed eyes as he strained against the unyielding door he was about to give up when he felt metal shear under the pressure the hinge pin broke with a sudden pop and the pry bar slipped free mercer tumbled across the deck caught immediately by the current that swept the hold cali screamed when she saw him rush by and for a panicked second he was sure hed be swept out of the ship he came up tight against the safety line just at the main hatch coaming are you okay cali asked as mercer swam back down into the hold bruised my ego a bit the door hung from one hinge and by pressing his back against the bulkhead and his feet against the door he managed to swing it open the shrieking protest of grating metal muted by the water the hold beyond was even darker a stygian void that seemed to swallow the beam of his dive light stay here and make sure my line doesnt foul he told cali and swam into the darkness this hold was the same size as the first and a huge amount of cargo had come loose from its pallets and lay against the portside hull he saw rotted sacks of what he thought was cotton smashed crates that held the remains of dishes and glasses and cases of wine bottles although all the labels had been washed away he also noted that there were hundreds of lengths of wood and when he touched one his heart quickened despite seventy years of immersion the board was still as hard as iron with no trace of rot he wasnt sure of the species but it had to be some kind of african hardwood and if cargo in this hold had been loaded in africa it stood to reason that bowies crates were in here as well i think we caught a break cali waited by the hatch her light like a muted beacon did you find them not yet but theres a bunch of wood from africa in here im sure bowies crates are here as well tie off our safety lines again and give me a hand before replying cali checked her dive computer and air gauges and asked mercer the pressure in his twin luxfer tanks weve got another twenty minutes less if we exert ourselves she said when she joined him inside the hold okay working in the narrow confines of their dive lights it was a daunting task looking for four specific crates amid the jumbled mass of debris but as they began moving junk out of the way they realized that the timber made up the bulk of the load and there were only about forty crates they had to check cali took out the gamma ray detector and slowly pirouetted in the still water her gaze never leaving the device im getting readings above ambient background but its hard to tell which crates are emitting the gamma rays the waters absorbing the particles cali began sweeping individual crates with the detector as soon as she was certain a crate wasnt one they wanted mercer would shove it aside to reveal other crates in the pile making sure he didnt dislodge anything from the precarious stack it was like the childs game of pick up sticks only a mistake here could trap them under tons of debris mercer heard the detector spike before cali called out theyd found one the crate was made of the same dense wood that the wetherby had been transporting most likely bowie had bought a few planks on the spot and had a carpenter in brazzaville fashion the chests the box was three feet square and nailed together and the joints had been further protected with a layer of pitch that had hardened so the crate looked like it was striped in obsidian how are the readings mercer asked were fine i suspect bowie shielded the inside with metal knowing what they were looking for made finding the other three a snap together they wrestled the heavy boxes closer to the hatch leading to the next hold weve brought protective bags in case the crates had rotted cali panted but were not going to need them until we get these to the surface when i come back down with jesse well hook the boxes directly to the crane and just drag them out lets head back up they swam into the exposed hold untied their lines where theyd belayed them and made their way out into the river the current hit like a hurricane gale having doubled in the twenty minutes they were inside the wreck they had to climb their way against its force first scaling the length of the wetherby to where the ropes were secured to the bollard and then hand over hand ascending to the dive boat it took them longer than theyd expected and mercers tanks were deep into the reserve by the time his head broke water jesse and stan were there to help him onto the dive platform and remove the eighty pounds of gear well stan slaughbaugh asked when mercer got his helmet off found them on the first try he held his hand out to cali and plucked her from the river hot damn i cant wait to get the samples to a lab im going to have a career just analyzing it well done boss jesse williams said to cali howd it go brian crenna called from the deck of the crane barge we found all four crates cali said raising her voice over the wind after ive warmed up and weve refilled the tanks jesse and i can go down with a cable from your crane well need to drag them out of the hold first so ill need to set up a blockandtackle system so you can have a clean lift which hold are they in the second one we have access from the first though i can extend the cranes boom almost a hundred and fifty feet that should put it on the far side of the hold and i can drag them back without using tackle that sounds like itll work call me when youre ready crenna turned away to continue some maintenance work with his men cali ate an mre and rested in the cabin while jesse and mercer filled the tanks with the compressor on the barge mercer noticed that the fishing boat hed seen earlier was still tied to the dock two men stood at the transom holding fishing rods while the black man in the cap lolled in the cockpit a few steps up from the rear deck it was eleven thirty by mercers watch when they were ready for the second dive theyd cleared a spot on the barges deck where theyd laid out large rubberized bags to contain the crates stan had told mercer the bags carbon fiber underlayment had been designed by nasa and was nearly indestructible it could absorb the shock of a bullet at pointblank range and would deflect a knife thrust cali gave crenna a walkietalkie dialed in to the dry suits radio frequency so they could coordinate the lift the wind had calmed again and the sun was trying to break through the overcast once more a bass boat with a huge outboard roared past the barge the four men aboard studying the craft as they raced to the next fishing hole dinners on me tonight mercer said as he helped cali back into her gear he spoke low enough so only she heard she grinned up at him i take it that offer doesnt include stan and jesse ill buy them some buffalo wings before we go its a date mercer had actually asked her out for a date he was thankful shed put on her helmet just then so she couldnt hear him exhale a nervous breath once more into the breach he muttered not sure if he knew what he was doing but glad hed done it jesse and cali dropped into the water as crenna powered up the crane he extended the telescopic boom until it reached far down the length of the sunken ship the barge listed heavily so that the chop lapped against the base of the forward rail he shouted to his deckhands to reset the hydraulic anchors to compensate for the shift in the vessels center of gravity mercer saw cali and jesses bubbles for only a few moments before they were borne away by the current with crenna refusing to let him on the barge until the crates had been swung aboard and only the one radio to eavesdrop on the dive there was nothing for him and slaughbaugh to do but wait stan held a phd in nuclear physics so the two of them talked about mercers theory concerning plutoniums origin after ten minutes crenna began to lower the hook into the water cali and jesse must have reached the hold a minute later the crane rotated a few degrees and another twenty or so feet of steel cable disappeared into the river they must be hooking onto the crates mercer said wont be long now as if to punctuate the statement one of the deckhands came over to the barges rail and looked down onto the cabin cruiser theyre about ready to lift your boss said we should put on the gas masks now oh right stan rummaged through one of his trunks and came away with an armful of nbc nuclear biologicalchemical hooded gas masks he tossed them up to the deckhand and took out two more for himself and mercer what happens when we get them to the surface mercer asked well bag them and get them back to the dock we have a hazmat truck standing by not planning on warning the people of this fair city that youre hauling a thousand pounds of plutonium through their streets mercer teased please on any given day there are a couple of tons of radioactive material on the roads only reason why there hasnt been an accident is because we dont advertise it and invite out all the wackos the cranes big diesel bellowed and mercer saw the drum at its rear begin to turn ever so slowly theyve got them he could imagine cali and jesse in the dark hold making sure the crates didnt snag or smash against anything as the crane dragged them out for another five minutes the crane spooled back cable in a delicate balance of horsepower wind and current then everything came to a standstill mercer couldnt understand it he looked across and could see crenna in the cranes cab he leaned far back in his chair and had his arms crossed they must have the crates out of the hold mercer said finally understanding he wants cali and jesse topside before he brings them up in case theres a problem moments later cali and jesse williams bobbed to the surface at the rear of the cabin cruiser stan and mercer quickly helped them aboard when crenna saw that the divers were safely out of the water he started drawing back cable and retracting the telescopic boom to reduce tension on the cranes hydraulic systems in moments the crates emerged dripping from the river and hung suspended over the barges deck the roar of the cranes diesel masked another deeper sound until it was almost at the work site the powerful outboard on the bass boat that had gone by earlier sent an arcing fountain of water into the air as it approached the barge at nearly forty miles per hour mercer had been busy helping cali off with her equipment and only sensed the fastmoving craft when it entered his peripheral vision he saw that the four men in the sleek boat were focused on the barge and three of them brandished automatic weapons down he shouted shoving cali to the deck as he whirled he saw the bertram fishing boat that had been tied to the pier suddenly come alive a boil of froth at her transom as the captain slammed the throttles to their gates mercer had kept his hand grip close at hand the entire day he ripped open the zipper fumbling for a frantic second and pulled out an mp schmeisser the weapon was the standard german submachine gun during world war two mercer had bought it from tiny whod taken it in trade on a gambling debt he jammed a thirtyround magazine into the receiver and racked the slide he stuffed six more magazines into his jeans pockets while not the most accurate weapon the guns high rate of fire made it devastating at close range the fastmoving bass boat was still twenty yards from the barge when the three gunmen opened up with their kalashnikovs crennas crew fell flat to the deck and crenna himself leapt from the crane he dove behind the big air compressor as rounds pinged and ricocheted off the barges metalworks he tore off the gas mask and sat there panting ducking behind the cabin cruisers gunwales mercer shoved the grip to cali theres a beretta in there how did you know i didnt i just wanted to be ready he addressed stan slaughbaugh and jesse williams both were huddled at the transom and neither looked like hed ever been on the receiving end of an ambush go forward into the cabin fire up the engines then stay down the two nest scientists complied wordlessly the bass boat continued to roar up the river the sustained automatic fire popping over the throb of the big outboard it looked to mercer as if they were going to jump onto the far side of the barge he chanced looking over his shoulder the bertram fishing boat had crossed half the river and was coming on strong her blunt bows buried behind a creaming froth of water the captain was in the high bridge while the other two were stationed on either side of the stern deck they both carried weaponsheckler and koch hks the german arms manufacturers latest assault carbine the compact weapons fired nato millimeter ammunition and were fast becoming the popular choice among the worlds elite military units cali saw where mercer was looking and gasped they were trapped even if they untied from the barge the bertram would easily outrun them she drew a bead on one of the sport fishermen with her pistol when the vessel was fifty yards out mercer had turned back to see the bass boat decelerate as it came abreast of the barge the men were still firing although mercer couldnt see crenna or any of his deckhands a snap burst from one of the gunmen hit the hydraulic controls that anchored the barge to the river bottom hydraulic fluid pumped from the reservoirs like lifeblood mercer looked back and was about to tell cali to stay put when he saw her about to fire on the bertram no he shouted and pushed her hand into the air the bertram was thirty yards away close enough for mercer to see the look of concentration on booker sykess face as he drove the boat across the river mercer didnt know the two special forces operators with him they hadnt been part of sykess delta force team when they escorted mercer into a tibetan monastery once run by tisa nguyens father calling sykes to provide security had dredged up fresh memories of the events leading to her death but mercer wouldnt let his pain hamper the ongoing investigation theyre with me he said they are delta force commandos the commanders name is sykes cover me mercer eased over the gunwale and onto the deck of the barge he could feel that the hydraulic system had failed and the barge was responding to the wind and waves but so far he couldnt tell if it was caught in the niagara rivers relentless current the bass boat was so low to the water that he couldnt see it on the far side of the barge he found cover behind a chain locker and waited for the gunmen to expose themselves again sykes arced the bertram well behind the barge and was about to engage from the canadian side of the river when another bass boat appeared around the north tip of grand island mercer counted four men in it as well bringing the total number of attackers to eight when he looked back to the first bass boat he caught a fleeting glimpse of one of the men lunging onto the barge his initial plan if they were attacked was to wait until he and sykes could take out all the gunmen in a surprise counter ambush but the sheer numbers made that option untenable another gunman raised himself over the low flank of the bass boat his classic middle eastern features told mercer two things one was that the gunmen had probably received training in some terrorist camp in iraq syria or saudi arabia the second thing he knew was that they were here to fight to the death the arab was exposed for only a fraction of a second but it was enough time for mercer to bring the schmeisser to bear the old submachine gun bucked in his hand like a living thing as he fired off a fiveround burst four of the rounds went wide but the fifth blew the gunman off the barge in a spray of blood the counterfire from the other three terrorists was swift and sustained the sound of bullets striking the chain locker was horrific it felt like the noise would shake mercers teeth loose from his jaw but even over this racket he heard sykes and his team engage the second bass boat their assault carbines adding to the gun battle raging across the width of the river mercer waited until the firing stopped to blindly fire a few rounds over the chain locker and scamper to better cover near the crane he nearly tripped over the prone form of brian crenna he was huddled partially under the crane with one of his deckhands what the hell is going on crenna shouted over the roar of automatic weapons mercer ignored the pointless question where are your other two men billy jumped over the side he pointed out over the water mercer could see a man swimming toward grand island hes a good swimmer hell make it i dont know about tom the second bass boat raced around to their side of the barge sykess big bertram trying to keep up with the faster and more nimble craft while one of the gunmen fired at the bertram two more raked the cabin cruiser several shots went wide and slammed into the cranes turret forcing the three men to cower further as if trying to burrow into the steel decking listen mercer said when the outboard faded im going to cover you get to the cabin cruiser and get out of here he changed out the halfdepleted magazine for a fresh one waited a moment for crenna and the deckhand to get ready then ducked under the extended boom and cut loose with the schmeisser he raked the far side of the barge in a continuous sweep from stem to stern the gunmen were out of sight so he nodded to crenna the two men took off in a loping run covering the thirty feet to the side of the barge in seconds both vaulted over the rail and onto the cabin cruisers deck even as he concentrated on finding a target mercer noticed that the far bank of the river was moving ever so slightly when the last round had cycled through the gun mercer ducked back under the crane and as he changed out the magazine he looked at the near bank intellect overcame the adrenaline surging though his veins and he realized the land wasnt moving at all the hydraulic anchors had failed completely and the barge was at the mercy of the niagara river and in the few seconds it took to reload the schmeisser he realized the barge was accelerating the wind had picked up again and he estimated they were going six knots mercer was certain the cabin cruiser didnt have the power to tow the barge against the current he needed to get to the tug moored to the far side of the craft if he was going to prevent them all from plummeting down the falls failing that he had to get the crates of plutonium ore into the special bags so they wouldnt smash open when the barge went over cali he shouted were adrift cast off and get out of here what about you she shouted back without revealing herself sykes can pick me up for the moment though mercer didnt know where his friend was the bertram and the second bass boat had gone upriver he would just have to trust that booker sykes would take out the second group of terrorists and return before it was too late cali and crenna spoke for a second and she covered him as he inched his way to the controls of the cabin cruiser cali wanted crenna to use the cruiser to push the barge to shore so he opened the throttles and put the rudder hard over the ropes securing the cruiser to the barge strained as the tired motor roared to mercers surprise and delight it seemed like her plan was working the ninehundredton barge slowly rotated and seemed to be heading for the canadian side of the river the gunmen on the bass boat hadnt expected such fierce resistance so it was taking them a few seconds to regroup but when they heard the cruiser they opened fire again the windshield and side windows exploded covering crenna in a shower of glass while chunks were ripped from the cruisers upperworks it was a fluke shot that hit the cleat securing the cruisers bow to the barge the boat slewed away from the metal side of the barge before crenna could bring the wheel over or throttle down the engine the tension on the rear cleat was too much and it gave way tearing a large section of the transom in the process the gunmen continued to fire as the two craft separated the rear deck was chewed up by the barrage forcing cali to dive into the cabin greasy smoke began to boil from the engine cowling and the motor started to sputter as soon as crenna drove them out of range cali mounted the four steps to the cockpit we have to go back forget it lady you aint paying me enough for this im going to pick up billy and call the coast guard mercer will be dead by the time they get here thats his problem cali cursed herself for emptying the beretta she wouldnt have shot crenna but she certainly would have threatened him okay ill drop you off at the dock but im going back not on my boat youre not bad enough i might lose my tug and the crane if she dont ground cali exploded in rage those crates we raised are filled with plutonium she shouted if they fall into the hands of a bunch of terrorists ill make sure youre charged with treason and shot he looked at her calis eyes blazed with fury and her breath came in heaving gasps just as he was about to agree a wave of heat washed over them they turned in unison the rear of the boat was a wall of flame a bullet had severed the fuel line and the raw gasoline had ignited jesus crenna yelled everyone off the boat now stan jesse and crennas third mate scrambled from the cabin more familiar with watercraft the mate knew instantly that the boat was going to burn to the water line so he threw himself over the side stan and jesse saw that cali and the captain were crawling out through the shattered windshield and they jumped into the swiftflowing river cali grabbed a pair of flotation rings that hung just below the windscreen and jumped into the water with crenna right behind her the shore of grand island was only a hundred yards away and once everyone was together and holding on to one of the rings they struck out the boat drifted past the fire had already spread to the cabin and flames shot from the cockpit tears of frustration stung calis eyes by the time she reached shore and found another boat it would be too late mercer needed to cross twenty feet of open deck to reach the little towboat the gunmen were well covered and fired at him from the protection of their boat their only exposed flank was from the water and since sykes and his team were still upriver fighting the other boat they could afford to be patient mercer was effectively pinned he had yet to figure out their plan or spot the last member of crennas crew and time was quickly running out the barge had drifted at least a mile from where it had anchored over the wetherby and was fast approaching a series of rapids he couldnt wait for sykes any longer he had to end the standoff and get to the tug he checked his ammo the magazine in the schmeisser was fresh and he had two more in his pockets he fired a quick burst to keep the terrorists heads down and sprinted for the fortyfoot tugboat as he ran he watched for movement and as soon as one of the gunmen looked over the side of the barge he triggered another threeround burst the bullets went wide but the terrorist ducked from sight mercer had just another couple of paces to go when the barge struck a rock as the river began to shoal he was thrown flat and the barge spun on its axis grinding across the hidden boulder until water pressure shoved it free the crates of ore still suspended over the deck on the end of the crane pendulumed dangerously but didnt fall mercer scrambled up just as the three terrorists recovered and let loose with their kalashnikovs he fell from the barge and onto the deck of the small tug bullets exploding all around him he lay flat for a moment and glanced back toward the gunmen when the firing stopped one of them stood upright a long tube resting on his shoulder it was an rpg a venerable russianmade tank killer the rocket popped from the launcher a second later its motor engaged and it streaked across the barge mercer threw his hands over his head just as the rocketpropelled grenade slammed into the tugs wheelhouse the explosion shattered the big windscreen allowing most of the blast to vent away from mercer but the overpressure wave was a crushing weight that seemed to suck the air from his lungs and left his ears ringing he could no longer hear the roar of niagara falls only a mile or two downstream mercer slowly sat upright he hadnt been hit by any debris but the pilothouse was ruined there was no way now to stop the barge from going over the falls and he had just minutes to get the crates into their protective bags he looked down the river there was a structure of some sort jutting into the water from the canadian side it was the water intakes for a massive hydroelectric power plant the barge had drifted too close to the american side for it to be drawn toward the intakes instead it was steering for the rapids that preceded the most powerful waterfall in north america a movement caught mercers eye he couldnt believe what he was seeing a man in a black jumpsuit had just landed on the center of the barge his parachute billowing before he cut it away a second man landed a moment later above them a dark helicopter began to descend toward the barge the gunmen must have thought mercer had died when the tugboat was hit because they cheered and ran up to embrace one of their comrades the second parachutist who was caucasian rather than arab made straight for the crates mercer steadied his submachine gun on the edge of the tug took careful aim and fired his rounds stitched through the group one of the parachutists was hit across the hips and collapsed screaming in agony as bright blood pumped from his femoral artery two of the gunmen were raked across the chest because no matter how mercer fought his schmeisser he couldnt stop the barrel from climbing the last gunman and the second parachutist dove for the bass boat mercer didnt give them time to recover he charged across the deck shouting incoherently he was halfway there when the barge slammed into another rock and stopped dead he staggered but didnt fall he reached the edge of the barge and was about to fire into the bass boat when he realized there was no point it had been caught between the barge and the rocks and had been crushed flat only the big outboard had survived the impact and to mercers eye even it looked a little narrower than normal the river kept the barge pressed tightly to the rock and as mercer stood over the ruined bass boat panting it seemed like it was jammed solid a few hundred yards away he saw a billowing cloud of mist as the river dropped nearly two hundred feet to the gorge below he checked the gunmen all were dead with the exception of the man with the shattered hip but he had already slipped into a shockinduced coma as he bled out mercer wasted no more time with them the helicopter the two men had parachuted from came within two hundred feet of the barge and mercer opened fire he missed at that range but the big chopper pirouetted in the air and thundered over the canadian border and out of view having logged hundreds of hours running everything from a twelvethousandton walking dragline to a compact skip loader mercer had little trouble deciphering the controls to crennas crane he retracted the boom and lowered the crates until they were a few inches from the deck he jumped from the cab and carefully arranged the bags so he could close them around the wooden chests he was about to lower the crates that last little bit when he felt the barge move again the current had found a tiny angle to exploit and started swinging the craft around the rock the deck began to move and the grind of metal against stone reached a fierce crescendo as the barge came free and was again drawn toward the falls mercer hurriedly lowered the crates and ran back out to the deck he scanned for the helicopter as he wrestled the first crate into place and began closing the bag there were four different seals first there was a wide adhesive strip then velcro and then a heavyduty zipper those took seconds it was having to lace the bag closed with wire that took several minutes the barge continued to hit against rocks it would hold steady for a minute or two then continue downstream while the flat bottom constantly scraped against the shallow bottom three shots in rapid succession made him drop flat and pick up his schmeisser he looked around there was no one then he looked upstream and saw booker sykes standing at the stern of the bertram his assault carbine resting on a cocked hip the bertram was a wreck part of the bow was smashed in and the hull was riddled with bullet holes mercer could just imagine what was left of the second bass boat sykes had fired three shots into the air to get mercers attention mercer waved over at him then shrugged his shoulders as if to say there was nothing the delta operator could do to help then he went back to work he had the second bag secured when he started to feel the spray from the falls sprinkling like a light rain but it quickly grew to a torrential downpour as the barge edged closer and closer the sound of the hull scraping bottom set mercers teeth on edge and water began to surge over the deck as it succumbed to gravity with the third bag sealed mercer glanced over booker was still on station watching the scene through binoculars behind mercer the niagara gorge began to yawn open he could see the city of niagara and the arching span of the rainbow bridge beyond the thundering mist he had two minutes or less and still hadnt thought of a way out of his predicament there were no large boulders he could jump to between the barge and the edge of the falls and if he tried to swim to one hed be sucked over the precipice the crash of so much falling water echoed in his head and made concentrating difficult he had the first three seals in place and had just started to lace the bag when booker fired again mercer looked up just as he was hit from behind in a blind tackle that sent him tumbling hed recognized the black jumpsuit as belonging to one of the parachutists when he was kicked under the chin the parachutist had somehow survived when the bass boat was crushed possibly by being close to the engine and had taken this long to extricate himself mercers head snapped back and slammed the deck he fought the dizzying wave of darkness that washed through his mind and rolled clear just as the man tried to smash his heel into mercers nose the empty hull of the barge echoed with the impact mercer grabbed the mans ankle with both hands and twisted savagely the man went down and mercer used his fall to lever himself into a sitting position he smashed his elbow into the mans groin as hard as he could and staggered to his feet the barge had stopped right on the edge of the falls where the water was remarkably only about three feet deep niagara gorge was a void that seemed to stretch forever he whirled again as the assassin got to his feet mercer recognized him it wasnt poli but one of the men with him when they attacked the deco palace hotel mercers schmeisser was on top of the crates and too far so he simply charged the two crashed together and fell into the water sluicing across the deck the water was only a foot deep but the current was relentless mercer lost traction on the slick hull plates and shot twenty feet toward the bow before he could dig in his heels and stand the leading edge of the barge was suspended over open air and the hull continued to grind against the bottom thats when he saw his only chance of salvation the parachutist had also gotten to his feet but the wind had been knocked out of him mercer splashed to the crates and grabbed up his weapon the white mercenary reached for a pistol hanging in his shoulder holster but he wasnt quick enough mercer fired onehanded the heavy weapon bucking in his hand and a pair of ninemillimeter slugs slammed into the mans chest he fell and was instantly grabbed by the current mercer dropped the schmeisser and lunged for the body grabbing at the mans hair just before he went over the bow he dragged the corpse against the current and in the lee of the crates managed to unhook the mans reserve parachute he hadnt done enough skydiving to know if hed put it on properly but there was nothing he could do about it the stern of the barge began to rise with the current as it edged toward its tipping point mercers biggest threat now wasnt that he was so high above the gorge the problem was he wasnt high enough while a hundred and eighty feet was a great height it was nowhere near high enough for a parachute to deploy it would be no different than jumping without one mercer ran to the crane again spun it on its turntable until it was facing aft to shift the barges center of gravity in his favor hit the levers that raised the boom to its maximum height and started the hydraulics that would extend it to its fullest length by doing this he bought himself another hundred feet there were ladder rungs welded to the top of the first section of the steel boom and even as it continued to rise mercer started to climb the next three sections didnt have any handholds so he had to rely on the strength of his hands to shimmy up the slick boom like a monkey he reached the top just as the world began to tip the barge was going over the crates slid across the deck and vanished over the falls mercer popped the drogue chute and held it in his right hand as the barge slipped farther he paused for a heartbeat waiting for the boom to reach vertical the niagara gorge was a narrow gash through the forests and farmlands while in the distance lake ontario looked like polished glass with a last rending squeal the barge tipped and just before it shot out from under mercer he threw himself from the crane tossing the drogue chute over his head he and the barge and the water all fell at nearly the same speed but the pressure against his stomach told mercer he was accelerating there was nothing to do but pray as he plummeted down the face of niagara falls his body sodden by the constant spray he couldnt see the surface of the river or the rocks below because of the mist and perhaps it was for the best but fate wasnt going to be that kind to him as he fell the mist cleared a bit he could see the boiling surface of the river the tons of rocks that had eroded off the falls and even the plucky sightseeing boat called the maid of the mist mercer could feel the chute start to pull from the pack drawn out by air resistance against the drogue there wasnt enough room mercer closed his eyes and jerked them open when the main chute deployed yanking the straps so far into his groin he was certain his testicles had ruptured the wind off the falls caught the chute and pushed him just past the mounds of jagged boulders as the barge augered in the crane snapped from its mounts and nearly hit him as he drifted a few more yards before plunging into the river he went deep and felt the current snatch the chute dragging him farther downstream mercer fought and clawed his way to the surface his lungs near bursting as he got there and gulped great drafts of air he managed to find the chute release and once it was gone he could tread water the maid of the mist cut across the narrows passengers in blue ponchos cheering when they saw mercer had survived a few minutes later a pair of deckhands helped him onto the lower deck have you got a death wish or something one of them asked having no pithy retort on hand mercer rolled onto his side and promptly threw up arlington virginia mercer sprawled on the leather sofa in the rec room wearing the loosest pair of sweatpants he owned a bag of frozen peas pressed to his groin and a vodka gimlet within easy reach from the floor drag regarded him through droopy bloodshot eyes indignant that hed been evicted from his favorite spot cali and ira lasko sat on the other couch facing mercer while harry and booker sykes were at the bar burgers and fries from a fastfood restaurant littered the coffee table and bar top when the maid of the mist returned to its dock and it was determined that mercer didnt need a hospital he was given a ride to the niagara police department and booked on numerous charges like after the shootout in new jersey ira had to step in with local authorities to get him released sykes had picked up cali and her team from grand island and abandoned his boat so no one knew of their involvement ruth bishop from the coast guard was to lead the investigation into the gun battle coordinating with her canadian counterparts to find the helicopter that had dropped the paratroopers and was most likely going to haul away the crates so far word of their contents had not spread thanks in large part to the money brian crenna was being paid to keep his mouth shut hed have a new tugboat and floating crane by the end of the week his missing crewman had been found on the canadian side of the border so with no civilian fatalities this was being heralded as a thwarted terrorist attack on niagara falls power plants mercer nest and sykess team werent part of the cover story and were sworn to secrecy because none of the terrorists bodies had been recovered mercer cali and sykess delta team had spent the day with the fbis counterterrorism unit going over hundreds of pictures of known terrorists in hopes of identifying the men whod attacked the barge one of the bass boats had survived the ordeal and was found packed with enough explosives to sink a cruise ship as mercer had noted during the battle the terrorists were middle eastern he recognized four of the men from the photo lineup two were iraqi and two were from saudi arabia the arab paratrooper a former captain in the iraqi republican guard was well known to the pentagon but none of the others were particularly high up in the al qaida chain of command there was nothing in any database on the caucasian parachutist ira made sure that homeland security would keep him in the loop as they tracked how the men entered north america and where they had gotten their weapons they would also provide twentyfourhour guards for mercers house that was his price for cooperation he didnt want to take up iras suggestion of moving to a safe house with his genitals sufficiently numb mercer set the peas on a dishrag next to him and wiped a smear of ketchup from his lips hed just finished telling harry the story of the fight and his dive off the falls i think that makes you the twelfth person whos gone over the falls and lived harry remarked however technically you didnt go over them you parachuted so it really doesnt count technically my ass mercer spat back and hobbled to the bar for another drink i may not be able to talk about it but in my mind i went over the falls and ive got the swollen stones to prove it he turned to ira ive forgotten to ask hows it going with the recovery of the crates coast guards on it now with calis teammates ah slaughbaugh and williams they managed to recover two of them pretty easily from the maid of the mist pool below the rapids but the other two are directly under the falls where the water is deeper than the falls are tall the good news is theres no trace of radiation in the water so we know they didnt break open and security airtight this time ira said solemnly what made you invite booker along polis been a step ahead since africa he has the original manuscript from chester bowies safe which gave him the name of the freighter bowie used to ship the crates to america and as cali proved finding what happened to the wetherby wasnt too tough what i hadnt anticipated was the number of men hed employ and the sophistication of the assault given the short amount of time he had to plan it booker sykes spoke up an operation like he coordinated would have taken weeks maybe months for training and he pulled it off in just a couple of days that tells us mercer continued that hes got a lot of assets in the states and youre sure he wasnt with the assault team ira asked positive mercer said bitterly more than anything he wished the mercenary had been there when the barge went over the falls i did recognize the white paratrooper from new jersey he was taking the potshots at us while poli was driving i suspect the qaida fighters on the bass boats were just cannon fodder in case the barge was protected thats why all the explosives booker added suicide run if you had a coast guard escort i figure the iraqi who chuted in was the terror cells leader but they were working for poli who ultimately works for someone else cali said someone we dont have a bead on yet mercer returned to the couch and settled the frozen peas over his groin again but its got to be al qaida how else could he get their men for poli its all about the money guys willing to die in a suicide attack do it for politics or faith ira finished his burger and crushed his napkin you think this is al qaidas attempt to get the radioactive material they need for a dirty bomb what else could it be cali answered we all know theyve wanted to get their hands on nuclear material for years and despite what the media thinks nest and other groups are doing a damn fine job closing conduits from the old soviet republics and any other source imaginable she glanced at mercer almost as if what she was about to say was his fault what no one anticipated was finding a cache of natural plutonium that seems to have been lost for a couple thousand years using what chester bowie rediscovered is al qaidas only chance if they want a dirty bomb i dont get something harry said if you guys could recover the crates without any problems whats the big deal with a dirty bomb anyway cali met his frank gaze its a terror weapon more people would be killed in the initial explosion than would suffer radiological effects but that doesnt matter the mere mention of radioactive contamination would be enough to cause nationwide panic remember the anthrax attacks and how many people were hoarding cipro unfortunately ira interrupted competition in the media has forced them into using scare tactics in order to sell ad space a story like a dirty bomb attack would turn the media into a feeding frenzy of doom and gloom that would actually help the terrorists in spreading fear you have to know that our press is no longer free and its not some vast right wing or even left wing conspiracy thats destroyed its objectivity its our own consumerism that has allowed the media to be coopted by madison avenue in order to sell lingerie and cheaper computers you just know there are editors and news directors out there who are anxiously awaiting a terrorist attack or a plane crash or a celebrity murder so they can pump their circulation and raise their ad rates so long as advertisers subsidize the media the press will always find the negative its human nature whats the alternative harry asked in countries where the state supplies the news you get nothing but propaganda i dont know ira admitted but it pisses me off that when theres no real news to report they go out and find some horror to exploit thousands of teenagers die every year but its only during a lull in the news cycle that one death gets turned into a national tragedy and this happens not because we value that teen over any other but because the constant exposure to the details creates a feedback loop of interest pretty cynical harry remarked and i cant deny it sad huh ira said tiredly mercer leaned forward were getting off topic sorry ira scratched at his bald head i spent the morning with our media consultants building the cover story around the attack leaves a bad taste in your mouth weve secured the bulk of the plutonium chester bowie mined mercer stated im not even going to worry about the little bit that was in the safe that still leaves the alembic of skenderbeg which were still trying to hunt down and what the russians mined after bowie left africa have you gotten anywhere with them actually i have ira opened the briefcase at his feet and withdrew a folder thats how i spent my afternoon i got this from grigori popov a guy whose career mirrors mine he was a sub driver in the pacific fleet who moved to naval intelligence hes now a deputy in the ministry of defense ive known him for years and while i dont trust him as far as i can throw him weve been dealing with each other long enough to know when its time to put all our cards on the table ira glanced at his notes we were pretty much right when we spoke in my office a few days ago the russians had stolen the designs for our atomic bomb but knew they wouldnt have the resources to enrich uranium for at least a decade and plutonium production would take even longer as world war two came to a close the kgb created something called scientific operations headed by a shrewd cookie named boris ulinev mercer sat bolt upright color draining from his face jesus department youve heard of it dont you remember me telling you about my involvement when hawaii almost seceded and the whole plot to blow up the alaska pipeline lasko nodded both of those were old department operations thats right ira exclaimed i knew it sounded familiar when greg was telling me about it you know their last director is still on the loose out there mercer said with illdisguised anger ivan kerikovs his name i wonder if hes mixed up in all of this i doubt it ira told him ah guys cali interjected little help for those of us who dont know what youre talking about mercer explained department was created during world war two as the russians were advancing into germanoccupied eastern europe and then into germany herself their sole mission was to assimilate captured technology the nazis had some pretty advanced stuff on their drawing boards at wars end and the soviets stole as much as they could get their hands on plans for jet aircraft powerful radar systems nextgeneration missiles even the worlds first infrared scopes it was department s job to take this technology back to the soviet union and integrate it into their military thats how they were able to produce jet fighters so quickly after the war the mig was basically a copy of a german aircraft he looked back to ira it makes sense theyd be involved with this if bowie was right and it was german agents after him he was and they were ira said when heinrich himmler the head of the ss learned about the alembic of skenderbeg he personally dispatched a team to search for its power source two of them were killed we know now by janissaries while a third returned to germany with a sketchy report about chester bowie and his crates the germans didnt send another team back to africa believing they could enrich uranium themselves and the whole affair was shoved into an archive and in waltzes department booker said from the bar a plug of tobacco shoved against his right cheek exactly while the nazis shipped a lot of their nuclear program to japan at the close of the war there was enough left in germany for department to figure out there might be a natural source of nuclear fuel unlike the germans the soviets scoured parts of africa until they found the cache in the central african republic in which was a french colony at the time oh and greg popov denies any massacre took place naturally mercer smirked ira gave him a wry smile he did say that they mined several tons of ore the entire lode in fact so what happened to it cali asked she pursed her lips around her straw to sip some of her coke it was a sensual gesture that caught every mans attention and delayed iras answer for a beat ah greg told me they used up half of it before they began to enrich their own uranium in so their early bombs were fueled by the plutonium harry said appears that way mercer asked what about the half they didnt use thought youd bring that up ira reached into his briefcase again and tossed two airline tickets onto the coffee table you and cali are going to go see it for yourselves the russians have it stored in an old mine in the ural mountains with a bunch of other artifacts left over from department ive already cleared it with your boss cali cali couldnt believe it the russians just left it sitting there you know better than most how poorly they secured their nuclear material during the cold war and when you think about it until the last decade or so it didnt matter there wasnt anyone interested in getting their hands on the stuff of course today is a different story which has forced them to play catchup our government has funneled billions to russia and ukraine to consolidate and better guard their stockpiles but it takes time i know cali shook her head its just frustrating ive spent my career trying to prevent a nuclear attack and no matter how good i am or the rest of nest it only takes one mistake by us and a citys wiped off the face of the earth meanwhile youve got the russians leaving nuclear material lying around in mines and warehouses or in the craters of old nuclear bomb tests they never bothered to clean up or even refill and what happens if we do get hit sure well condemn the terrorists and lob a few smart bombs but then well spend years investigating our own intelligence failures and never once address the real culprits the assholes who made the material available in the first place i agreed with taking out the taliban after but then we should have rolled right across saudi arabia its their government that allowed bin laden and his followers to fester only the saudis were smart enough in the beginning to ship them all to pakistan and afghanistan course now theyre coming home to roost ira added and its only when bombs started going off in riyadh that they took an interest in fighting terrorism and even now their attitude is still pretty permissive on the one hand they track down and execute a few extremists while on the other they continue to pump money into the wahabi schools where future terrorists are trained because if they stop the whole movement will turn against them we know invading saudi arabia isnt an option mercer said so how do we get out of this mess again cali shook her head the saudis are actively exporting terror because they can afford to it wont stop until theyre broke take away their oil wealth and theyre just another backwater third world country that cant feed its population we stop them by finding other sources of oil and eventually finding an alternative to it altogether in other words harry rasped we keep taking it on the chin for as long as it takes to pump the bastards dry and thats just whats going to continue to happen cali agreed theyll keep funding fanatics who will still try to fly airplanes into buildings or detonate a dirty bomb or simply strap on suicide vests and blow themselves up in malls and movie theaters this has turned grim booker said helping himself to a beer from mercers retro fifties era locklever bar fridge unfortunately thats the state of the world ira replied i see more shit crossing my desk at the white house than you can imagine but i do agree with cali that fundamentalism is the single greatest danger today and there are no easy fixes either were like the russians playing catchup with their nuclear materials it will take us years to find a way to neutralize the saudis influence by making oil obsolete in the meantime we have more pressing concerns mercer said to get the conversation back on track whats the plan once cali and i get to russia grigori will meet you in samara an industrial city on the volga river from there youll take a military chopper to the mine hell have a hazmat team on hand to make sure the plutonium ore is handled properly theyre taking it to a weapons depot about a thousand miles from anywhere in the middle of siberia just so you know that facility is the newest and best in the country courtesy of the us taxpayers once you verify that the plutonium is safely in the depot your mission is done not even close mercer said sourly we still have poli and the janissaries running around as well as the alembic of skenderbeg to deal with he turned to booker sykes are you up for a little trip depends the delta commando drawled ira i take it youre still not having any luck getting the pentagon to send a team to check out the stele lasko nodded then book howd you like an allexpensepaid trip to the worst hellhole ive ever seen to do what exactly theres an obelisk in the village where cali and i found the mine it was placed there by order of alexander the great cali and i both remember there was writing on it i need to know what it says im hoping that it will give us some clue as to where the alembic was stashed you just want pictures or the whole damned thing a couple of polaroids and youre out of there two days on the ground tops i recommend a digital camera ira suggested figure of speech mercer replied dont forget im a luddite i got my first cell phone last year sykes said the two guys with me on the boat paul rivers and bernie cieplicki both have to rotate back to fort bragg tomorrow he grinned ill see they come down with a case of the creeping cruds and spring them for the trip samara russia by the time the lufthansa airbus from frankfurt touched down at samaras airport cali and mercer had spent fifteen hours in the air and thanks to mercers upgrading of the tickets from the coach ira had provided to first class they had enjoyed their time together cali had teased as they ate petit filets and asparagus with sauce bearnaise over the atlantic that this didnt count as their date and mercer still owed her a meal and when she grabbed his hand when a crosswind slewed the aircraft just before touchdown at samara mercer felt his heart trip for him it was almost like the beginning of a high school romance where the tiniest gestures came loaded with significance but were also fraught with pitfalls was it too soon after losing tisa was he even capable of giving himself again each step forward came at a price of selfdoubt he wanted to believe that his burgeoning feelings werent merely a physical reaction to a beautiful woman yet when he looked into himself to find the truth he saw nothing but a hollow an empty void where once there was confidence he felt paralyzed by a guilt he was trying to convince himself he didnt deserve cali gave his hand a squeeze as the plane began to taxi to the long onestory terminal building then she let go mercers palms retained her nervous warmth they were met at customs by a pair of men one was short and handsome with blond cropped hair and the insignia of an army captain on his uniform collar the other was older stooped with haunted blue eyes and a large skull covered in wisps of gray hair his suit was wrinkled and his shirt had an ink stain at the bottom of the breast pocket he had the look of a muddled academic captain aleksandr federov the soldier said by way of introduction he spoke with just a trace of an accent and smiled brightly please call me sasha this is professor pavel sapozhnik of the ministry of defense i will be leading your military escort professor sapozhnik and his team are the disposal experts mercer and this is cali stowe of the department of energy they shook hands all around while the customs inspector frowned federov said a few angry words to the inspector then asked cali and mercer for their passports they were quickly stamped and returned sorry about that federov said as he led them to a closedoff section of the airport samara was a closed city until the collapse customs still likes to give visitors a hard time its not unusual for tourists to be denied entry for no reason which makes it especially tough since samaras newest export is mail order brides a lot of lonely german and american men have come here to meet the love of their life only to return more frustrated than before mercer chuckled warming to the officer immediately of course ms stowe you put all our brides to shame she smiled at the compliment i thought grigori popov would be here mercer said federov threw his hands up in a universal sign of annoyance bureaucrats he said he was detained in moscow and will be here tomorrow or the next day most likely he will not come samara is not how you say a favorite destination it is like your pittsburgh without a good sports team he paused outside a restroom door we have another twohour flight you might want to avail yourselves while cali used the facilities mercer learned that federov had studied languages during his military service and spoke french german and ukrainian he had been assigned to nuclear materials protection because so much of that work was carried out by foreign specialists professor sapozhnik ignored them while they chatted preferring to stare off into space rather than join in do you know anything about the mine department used as storage we did not know the facility existed until your superiors call to popov sasha federov answered candidly it is a sad state that we can misplace nuclear materials so easily but that is the fact we must deal with the old system was so secretive that the right and left hands didnt even know the other existed it is like a story about an incident in the s when one of our attack submarines almost fired a torpedo at a ballistic missile submarine returning to its port at vladivostok you see the two branches of the navy were in a bitter rivalry for additional funding and refused to divulge their patrol schedules catastrophe was avoided when the sonarman on the attack sub realized the computer was giving him a false reading on the boomers identity hed served on her a few years earlier and recognized her tonals professor sapozhnik snapped at federov in russian the younger man answered back just as hotly and an argument flared for a moment sapozhnik finally nodded and turned to mercer forgive me he said in a deep mournful voice old habits die hard we have nothing to hide from our western benefactors any longer no apology necessary mercer said and smiled he recognized sapozhnik as from the old guard who believed the nation was better off under a communist dictatorship no one likes to have their dirty laundry aired in public anyway sasha said smoothly it is an abandoned gypsum mine there is a single road that leads to it as well as a railroad line it was abandoned in because of flooding in the lowest levels we now know that department commandeered it soon afterward to consolidate their warehouses of leftover war materiel are the road and rail line still usable after all this time yes in fact were going to use a train to haul the ah ore to siberia even with no one around he was reluctant to use the word plutonium its much safer than the roads the train has already left the main freight yard here in samara but wont reach the mine until tomorrow cali returned from the bathroom mercer dashed in quickly urinated and washed his hands and face rather than risk drinking the water he dry swallowed a couple of painkillers the swelling in his groin had gone down significantly and the pain was little more than the discomfort of sitting so long they reached an exterior door that federov opened theatrically for cali on the tarmac loomed a military helicopter a massive mi transport chopper perhaps the most successful rotary wing aircraft in history at eightytwo feet long and eighteen high it dwarfed the men lounging next to the open door they snapped to easy attention when they saw federov approaching the russian captain gestured for mercer and cali to take seats along the starboard wall and showed them how to fix their helmets sorry they do not have radios but they will protect your hearing seated along the flanks of the helicopters cargo deck were six soldiers kitted out for combat with aks and a pair of rpg rocket launchers there were also five others aboard and while they wore olive green jumpsuits mercer believed they were the civilian scientists under sapozhnik in the back of the utilitarian hold were crates for tents food water and biohazard equipment federov took his seat and jacked his helmet into the helos intercom a moment later the onboard apu wound up and ignited one of the klimov turboshafts the second engine roared to life and the helicopter began to buck under the strain of her own power plants the pilot engaged the transmission and the five sagging rotor blades began to beat the polluted air they vanished into a blur and the shaking increased so that mercer had to clamp his jaw he felt calis hand find his it nestled into his palm like a little creature seeking safety in its den the shaking suddenly eased as the pilot gently lifted the eleventon chopper from the crumbling apron mercer peered out the yellowed perspex window as the helicopter gained height the city lay under an industrial pall from dozens of huge factory complexes as it clung to the shores where the samara river dumped into the volga the largest river in europe although the volga was many times the size of the ohio or allegheny mercer had to admit the city of three million did look a bit like pittsburgh the flight to the samarsskaya gypsum mine was monotonous the steppe slowly gave way to ugly hills of fractured granite worn smooth by time so they looked bald denuded the valleys werent particularly deep and what timber had once grown in the region had long since been harvested so the trees remaining were stunted and gnarled the land was muted shades of gray and dun and the sky was particularly cheerless as federov had predicted it took two hours to reach the mine for the last twenty minutes of the flight they flew directly over the rail spur that serviced the installation the rails were shiny streaks in the otherwise murky landscape the mines machinery and headgear the crane that raised and lowered mine cars into the depths of the earth were perched near the top of a long valley the mine shaft itself was a black square in the gray stone that descended into the mountain at a shallow angle about a quarter mile from the headgear was a clutch of small buildings administrative offices and housing for the miners when the mine was in operation now they were abandoned and crumbling the facility had been a bleak forlorn place even before the ravages of decades of neglect near the valley floor was the rail depot with oreloading hoppers straddling the tracks a halfmilelong metal chute connected the two parts of the complex a broad dirt road switchbacked down to the valley floor occasionally passing below the ore chute the train federov had said wouldnt be there until the following day was backed into the depot there was a bright orange tem dieselelectric locomotive from the bryansk works and a string of eight boxcars pale blue smoke vented from the engines exhaust and a few men milled around the locomotive several more worked near the open door of one of the boxcars mercer glanced at sasha federov and didnt like the puzzled look on his face he looked back at the train at federov again and quickly unbuckled his seat belt even though the chopper was making its landing approach in a large open area adjacent to the mines towering headgear thats not your train mercer shouted at the russian its a trap federov nodded grimly and yelled into his microphone at the pilot the missile came from behind a perfect blind ambush while a notoriously inaccurate weapon beyond two hundred yards the rpg lifted from its tube less than seventy yards behind the hovering mi just as it reached its most vulnerable position covering the distance in less than a second the fivepound warhead should have impacted squarely under the helos tail boom but mercers instincts and the pilots quick reaction heeled the chopper over just enough so the projectile slammed into the fixed landing gear the explosion came a microsecond later most of the detonative force blew away from the chopper but enough blasted into the mi to tear a sizable hole into her rear cargo compartment hot gas and molten aluminum from the helicopters skin ripped through the men and women inside the compartment killing the two soldiers at the end of the bench seat outright and severely injuring three more something sheared the drive shaft to the aft rotor because suddenly its contrarotating force was gone the chopper began a dizzying spin through the sky mercer had been tossed across the cabin when the pilot threw the mi onto its side and now was pinned up against professor sapozhnik and two of his scientists the world outside the small portholes whirled by as the chopper corkscrewed from the sky cockpit alarms blared over the roar of her engines and the cabin was quickly filling with smoke over the din of screams and the lingering effects of the explosion that had partially deafened him mercer heard the ping of small arms fire against the helicopter whoever had sprung the trap wasnt taking any chances in the fleeting seconds before the big cargo chopper plowed into the earth mercers mind turned to the perpetrator he knew it was poli whod ordered the helicopter shot down what he didnt know what had nagged at him repeatedly since first crossing the mercenary in africa was how he was always a step ahead crash positions sasha screamed most of the passengers were too paralyzed to move a few of the soldiers wrapped their arms around their knees and ducked their heads just before they hit mercer saw cali do the same and smiled shed doubled her chances of survival by protecting the fragile bones of her neck from the shearing forces of a crash mercer snaked his arm into sapozhniks safety belt and held on as the blades ripped into the gravelly soil above the rail spur not far from the mines entrance the tips threw up a cloud of dust before they disintegrated the pilot managed to torque the chopper ever so slightly so she came down not on her side but at a slight angle the damaged landing gear collapsed as it took the helos weight and the blades gouged deeper into the soil until they blew apart thrown like javelins across the mine site the mi slowly rolled onto its side burying one of the air intakes for her klimov engines in the ground it sucked up rock and dust and debris choking off the turbo shaft the engine bellowed for a moment then fell silent the second engine cut off almost immediately but smoke continued to thicken in the hold for the moment mercer couldnt hear automatic weapons ripping into the choppers thin skin and even if poli still had them in his sights the chance of aviation fuel catching fire was too great to use the helo as a redoubt mercer stood shakily bodies lay strewn across the cabin and for a panicked moment he thought he was the only survivor but he soon saw slow movement he looked to cali with the helicopter on its side she was on her back still strapped to her seat she was pale and there was a smear of blood at the corner of her mouth where shed been struck by the soldier next to her but her defiant expression told him she was all right mercer was on professor sapozhniks lap he looked at the mans face his mouth was slack his eyes open and sightless his neck was clearly broken the scientist next to him was also dead a boulder had punched through the mis side when it rolled over and crushed the back of his skull his head lay in a thickening pool of dark blood mercer looked up to where sasha federov dangled from his safety straps he was alive and working to release the belts catches trusting that the russian officer would open the cargo door mercer moved closer to cali are you okay he asked using his finger to gently wipe the blood from her full lips theyre going to be even puffier after this she coughed the smoke was as dense as tinys on a saturday night ill think only pure thoughts he unsnapped her belt and helped her to her feet the uninjured soldier was already checking on his comrades he was wasting precious seconds on a man who was clearly dead nyet mercer shouted at him when the soldier looked up his young face was a mask of uncomprehending fear hed never been in combat mercer pointed at the cache of weapons and made a grabbing gesture the boy had been conditioned by the army and seemed thankful to be given an order even if it came from an american civilian he crawled over the corpses of his friends to retrieve several aks and one of the rpg rocket launchers he handed them across to mercer just as sasha slammed the door back on its roller stops the acrid smoke boiled out the opening like a volcano but the sudden influx of fresh air also caused the small fire smoldering at the rear of the helicopter to flare up come on sasha shouted in russian he grabbed calis hand and helped her crawl up the hold when she reached the door he said jump as soon as youre outside and run fifty meters straight ahead the mine is behind us so they wont see you he handed her his ak round is chambered is okay cali nodded im familiar enough sasha helped her climb out the open door and she immediately disappeared from view next came the two uninjured scientists a man and a woman the man was frightened and shaking so badly he was ready to topple over the woman with her thick body and slavic features looked as imperturbable as a babushka sasha repeated his order and was about to give an automatic pistol to the man when he thought better of it and handed it to the woman instead he had to struggle to push her ample backside out the door mercer checked the rest of the passengers the pilot had already escaped through the shattered windshield the copilot was dead the only other survivor was a pretty girl from sapozhniks staff with a broken collarbone she screamed when mercer probed it gently with his fingers she said something in keening russian stolichnaya mercer said ah mir having exhausted his russian he unstrapped the girl and got her to her feet she cradled her arm against her chest the soldier was coming forward carrying a bundle of weapons and haversacks of ammunition over his shoulders sasha gave his orders to the soldier and together they tossed most of the weapons out through the door and onto the ground then the soldier scrambled up and out of the helicopter mercer shot federov a scathing glare thinking the girl should have been the next one out i need him to catch her and cover for her i also heard automatic fire they used one of the ak assault rifles as a step and boosted her up she paused on top of the chopper fearfully looking down at the young soldier outside go sasha hissed and reached out to shove her a sustained burst of autofire slammed into the underside of the helicopter opening dozens of sizzling holes in the aluminum skin and sending ricochets whizzing through the hold whenever a round struck something solid there was no mistaking the sound of several of the bullets punching through human flesh either the girl or the soldier or possibly both were dead cali had found cover behind a hillock some fifty yards from the downed bird from there she quickly silenced the gunfire with a pair of threeround bursts knowing that jumping out the hatch was suicide sasha and mercer scrambled for the cockpit and as the echoes of the exchange faded cali screamed rpg they dove headfirst through the remains of the windshield and hit the ground running the rocket veered slightly at the last second and hit the tail rotor the explosion blew the boom from the body of the chopper while the concussion knocked mercer and federov off their feet and into a drainage ditch a moment later the remaining fuel went up in a boiling cloud of orange flame and black smoke that lit the stark landscape like the hellish glow of a blast furnace whos out there sasha federov panted as he checked over his ak mercer inspected his own weapon and said a mercenary named poli feines i dont know what youve been told but the plutonium were here to secure is naturally occurring it was mined in africa back in the late s feines was in the village where cali and i found the old mining operation again in new jersey while we were tracking a clue about an american who first discovered the lode two days ago one of his men and a bunch of arab terrorists attacked us in niagara falls new york how is it hes here million dollar question mercer said he made sure the yarygin ninemillimeter pistol hed shoved behind his back was secure i suspect theres a leak within the organizations ive been dealing with it was the first time hed given voice to the nagging thought that had been with him almost since the beginning if true the ramifications of it were chilling because the only people who knew the truth were himself cali ira lasko and harry he trusted harry and ira with his life and cali had been shot at enough times to disqualify her as a traitor so the theory didnt make sense but there were no alternatives either he poked his head above the rim of the drainage ditch he spotted cali behind a mound of boulders the two scientists were with her and the young soldier had found cover behind a pile of mine tailings the body of the pretty female scientist had been immolated when the helicopter exploded the building that housed the headgear machinery was four stories tall and covered in corrugated metal the seams were streaked in rust creating a patchwork effect around it were several smaller buildings offices and workshops also littering the mine were piles of machineryold ore cars with broken wheel bogies small electric shunting locomotives pumps and hundreds of other items most of the old machinery had rusted together over the past decades and thorny weeds grew around everything but there were two trucks backed to the gaping mine entrance they were uazs rugged little fourwheel drives that resembled jeeps poli was here to steal the plutonium and transport the ore from the mine down to the train with the offroaders mercer spotted a dozen men around the trucks more than half of them armed as he watched a forklift emerged from the mine a single barrel lashed to a pallet it carried its driver wore a gas mask and protective suit at least the soviets had taken a few precautions mercer noted the barrel was massive and obviously well shielded and when the forklift lowered it into the bed of the truck the suspension sagged under the load he looked at the other vehicle its tires were still fully inflated which meant it hadnt been loaded yet this explained the train however the trucks couldnt handle the crumbling russian roads carrying such weight the guards didnt seem intent on hunting down mercers party they just wanted to keep loading their trucks so they could leave mercer turned to sasha do you have a radio or satellite phone the russian shook his head radio was on the helicopter and ive never even seen a satellite telephone this just gets better and better mercer plucked a sleek cell phone from the inside pocket of his leather jacket there wasnt a cell tower for a hundred miles but he tried anyway when he didnt get a signal he slid it back into his coat its up to us you seem like you can handle yourself sasha said cali too but that leaves us just four against eight or more five that other woman looks capable mercers eyes went hard but it doesnt matter we dont have an option we cant call for help and once they get those trucks on the train well never be able to stop them theyll be beyond russias borders by the time anyone comes to check on us sasha nodded grimly all right mercer turned back to study the terrain and come up with a plan a frontal assault was out of the question polis force was too large they could circle around the building but there was a lot of open ground to cover and if poli was smart which mercer knew he was hed have sent a couple of guards to cover his flanks as soon as he saw people escape the chopper crash the best way would be to circle even wider climb up the hill rising above the mountain and attack from above it would take time but mercer saw no other way he turned to run his plan by sasha but the russian was gone he looked down the length of the drainage ditch federov was crawling away and for a fleeting second mercer wanted to put a bullet in his back then he realized that sasha was getting into a better position to attack from the opposite flank behind a row of abandoned ore cars from there he could find cover behind the steel pylons that supported the ore chute sasha would still need cover to get into position mercer inched his way out of the ditch crawling across the cold ground the forklift disappeared into the mine once again as a man emerged one of the others used a hose attached to one of the trucks to douse his suit with water before he took off his gas mask even at two hundred yards mercer recognized the bald head and eye patch uncontrollable rage made him bring the ak to his shoulder not caring that the counterfire would catch him exposed he wanted the son of a bitch dead he centered polis broad chest in the weapons iron sites and eased the trigger the instant he fired mercer rolled to his left several times and lurched to his feet racing toward where the young russian soldier had found cover as polis men chewed up the ground at his feet with a steady barrage he reached the pile of crushed rock and ducked his head around the slope mercer cursed poli was directing his men and there wasnt a scratch on him mercer was a fair shot with a rifle but he was unfamiliar with the ak and hadnt compensated for the winds effect on the light millimeter bullet mercer glanced back and saw that sasha had reached the first row of small mine cars and settled his rifle on the side of one he fired picking targets who were covered from mercers position but exposed to his he dropped two of them before half the force swung their aim and raked the ore car he ducked behind it as rounds ricocheted off the thick metal mercer and the young soldier named ivan opened up hosing the trucks with little regard to how much ammo they were using up ivan had managed to keep his rucksacks of magazines as well as the rpg polis men sought cover behind their trucks as cali and the heavyset russian woman ludmilla added their guns to the attack three of the terrorists were down two dead and one had half his jaw shot away using all the cover fire federov ran from behind the train car eating ground to reach one of the ore chutes support pylons the forklift emerged from the mine once again judging by how the truck had settled mercer believed this was the last barrel poli would load on it he thought about using the rocket grenade but he only had the one so he could only take out one truck not both and he had no idea how many barrels had already been loaded onto the train polis men had no such shortage a pair of rpgs streaked from behind one of the trucks and exploded on the far side of the gravel pile where mercer and ivan crouched the fiftyfoothigh mound of mine waste absorbed the twin explosions as though they were nothing but a moment later the top of the pile shifted and a hissing avalanche barreled down the slope it came down so fast that mercer didnt have time to shout a warning as he jumped out of the way ivan looked up and screamed as a towering wall of fistsized rocks pounded into him the sheer weight of rock crushed him flat and the rough edges tore away his clothes and flayed great sheets of skin from his body he was dead before he was fully buried but that didnt stop mercer from trying to reach him as more rock shifted and slid down the hill mercer recklessly waded into the avalanche getting buried up to his knees in seconds and up to his thighs in just moments more but there was nothing he could do the barrel of the rpg launcher poking up from the ground was all that marked the young russians grave another rpg arced from behind the truck mercer watched its path as it slashed through the cold mountain air sasha federov was behind one of the pylons and had just a couple of seconds to run before the rocket exploded against the metal stanchion he was thrown fifteen feet by the blast landing in a tangle of loose limbs and when the smoke cleared he wasnt moving mercer fought to lift himself from the avalanche debris tearing at the stones with his bare hands until his fingers bled he heard the trucks engines fire with cali so far to the left poli had a clear path down the hairpin road to the railhead the convoy would pass no more than twenty feet from mercer and if he didnt get himself free he was dead frantic now he kicked and struggled his heart hammering painfully in his chest the trucks grew louder as they started across the facility they fired barrage after barrage in calis direction to keep her pinned mercer had seconds at most and rather than loosening the rubble seemed to be solidifying around his legs what a stupid way to die he thought fleetinglystanding thighdeep in a pile of mine tailings so trained gunmen could use him like kids with bb guns going after soda bottles in one desperate heave he managed to free one leg he lurched to his right painfully wrenching his trapped knee to tear it from the earth the lead truck rounded the massive pile as mercer dove flat his movements caused the heavy aggregate to shift again and a small wave of rock slid down the mound and buried him under a foot of loose stone the trucks roared by doing forty miles per hour and while a couple of the terrorists noticed the rock slide none saw the man hiding under the veneer of rubble moments later the vehicles turned down the first hairpin and vanished down the hill mercer began to heave himself from under the rock moving slowly because his body had taken a beating by the stones he was almost free when cali raced up to him the two russian scientists in tow the man was catatonic while the woman scanned the grounds warily cali threw herself into mercers arms tears on her cheeks i thought you were dead the boy is mercer said grimly holding her tight he wanted nothing more than to stand there forever forget about poli the plutonium and everything else and simply surrender to the embrace pulling his arms from around her neck took a force of will sasha we havent checked see to him im going after poli how theyll have the barrels loaded before you get halfway to the train mercer looked over his head like hell they will he grabbed the rpg from where it stuck up from the tailings checked that it hadnt been damaged and slung the long tube over his shoulder the steady growl of the locomotive at the bottom of the valley deepened as the engineer made ready to pull from the ore depot what are you doing im going to catch a train the pylons supporting the ore chute had integrated ladders so workers could access the halfmilelong slide for maintenance the metal was scaled with rust and the paint was badly flaked with the rpg and an ak over his shoulder mercer climbed the ladder wincing with the pressure of each step on his strained knee but thankful it would take his weight no sooner had he cleared the ground than he felt movement below him cali was climbing on his heels he wasnt going to make any chivalrous remarks he could use all the help he could get the support column was eighty feet high and it took them nearly two minutes to climb their hands were cramped from the cold metal rungs and mercers eyes teared up because the wind was gusting to thirty miles an hour from the top of the stanchion they could see the oreloading hoppers and the train far below although their vantage wouldnt let them see what was happening on its far side the twisty road down to the depot looked clear poli would have had more than enough time to reach the rail spur mercer helped cali up onto the small platform next to the chute you sure about this she threw him her trademark saucy grin as sure as you are the chute was more than twenty feet wide with curved sides to prevent ore from tumbling to the ground the decades of rain and snow hadnt rusted the metal it was still bright from years of being polished by ore headed to the hoppers down below mercer repositioned the rpg so it was across his chest and cinched the aks sling around his arm before he and cali climbed over the rim the angle was steep and they had to hold themselves in place by planting their rubbersoled boots and holding on to the edge just before he sat mercer saw the locomotive lurch and heard the rail cars couplings crash together as the train started to leave shit come on when they sat their view was blocked by the sides of the chute so it was like looking down a ski lift or a bobsled run mercer could feel gravity sucking at his chest as his eyes adjusted to the vertiginous scene he took calis hand and they eased their feet off the bottom of the chute they began to slide immediately slowly at first but the speed built quickly too quickly mercer tried to apply pressure with his feet to slow himself cali did the same and for a moment it was working then her shoe caught a seam in the metal chute and she flipped head over heels as mercer made to grab her cali careened into him and he too began to tumble out of control they somersaulted down the chute for fifty feet before mercer managed to grab calis collar the move vaulted him over her prone form and he slammed into the chute hard enough to make it vibrate but the maneuver stopped her from flipping again now flat on his back mercer eased his heels against the metal careful to lift when he neared a seam and had himself slowed enough to regain control of the slide are you okay he called over his shoulder feeling calis presence right behind him i think so she answered were almost there mercer was glad she hadnt asked about his condition his back ached from the impact and hed have a bump the size of an egg on his forehead if he survived the next few minutes theyd descended two thirds of the way to the ore hoppers and now that they knew how to handle the slide they rocketed downward crisp wind whipping at their faces so their eyes streamed tears with thirty feet to go they could see the top of the train through the open hopper it was still moving slowly but the last car was halfway through the loading trough they had seconds or theyd drop twenty feet to the hard rails below hurry mercer shouted and he and cali took their feet off the chute completely they shot down the last section of the ore slide like arrows the metal walls becoming a blur as they focused on landing atop the last rail car cali pulled slightly ahead the ore hopper was a long metal trough with steeply angled sides and an open bottom that allowed the crushed rock to stream into rail cars cali braced her feet when she reached the end of the slide slowing herself just enough so when she was launched off the lip she didnt crash into the far side of the hopper the impact was still brutal but she absorbed the blow and fell easily to the roof of the rolling boxcar mercer had to contend with the rpg as he came to the end of the chute tugging the weapon back over his shoulder at the last second he was in an awkward position when he shot off the end of the slide cali screamed his name he slammed into the opposite side of the ore hopper knocking the air from his lungs in a painful explosion of breath he looked down to see that the rear of the train was almost past him he pushed off from the hopper and fell through empty space his timing was a fraction off he dropped clear of the chute and hit the very end of the boxcar further bruising his aching ribs with his legs dangling off the edge of the train he struggled to find something to grab but there were no handholds and he began to slide off he looked down railroad ties emerged from under the car like an everlengthening ladder as the locomotive accelerated down the valley he slid farther clamping onto the edge with just his elbows his legs bicycling against the rear of the car as he fought to find purchase he couldnt support himself much longerhis body had taken too much punishment and he just wanted to let go instead he fought harder kicking at the rear of the boxcar with his steeltoed boots using his chin and the muscles of his neck to give him an ounce more leverage cali was running toward him he had to hold on for a few more seconds but he wasnt sure he could a head emerged between their boxcar and the next one in line mercer saw it through calis long legs then he saw a torso and an assault rifle behind you he gasped cali kept coming mercer managed another hoarse bellow behind you she barely slowed as she whirled around flipping her kalashnikov off her shoulder and under her arm in a fluid almost wellpracticed motion she fired from the hip sweeping across the gunmans midsection and continued to spin so she was still running toward mercer the three bullets that hit the gunman passed clean through tumbling as they transited his body and tearing fistsized chunks of tissue from his back he fell between the two cars and hit the tracks mercer glanced down as he felt calis hands on his jacket collar the gunman had landed across the tracks and the trains steel wheels had sliced his corpse into three pieces hold on cali panted struggling to haul him back aboard the boxcar if you insist mercer said knowing she had him she heaved and he rolled over the edge of the car and onto his back not caring that the rpgs pistol grip was digging into his flesh mercer gave himself just a second before getting to his feet poli wouldnt just post one man to guard the trains roof and with the train continuing to accelerate down the valley they didnt have much time to stop it before it was going too fast for what he had in mind are you okay cali asked shed seen mercer wince when he put weight on his bad knee doesnt matter he said grimly come on in a crouch they padded forward and as they neared the coupling to the next rail car mercer cautiously poked his head over the gap it was clear they leapt in unison and continued forward the train was starting to vibrate as it sped past twenty miles per hour watch our backs mercer said fearful now that one of polis men could still emerge from between the cars they leapt four more cars without seeing anyone and were a quarter of the way down the sixth car when three men began to climb up from between it and the next car they spotted mercer and cali instantly mercer opened fire and saw an explosion of pink mist blow away in the wind as one of his rounds found its mark but the other two men vanished back into the gap without cover mercer had to turn back and run he grabbed calis arm and they raced to the end of the car scrambling down the ladder before the gunmen at the front of the car recovered this situation was exactly what mercer didnt want it was a standoff and every second that passed meant the train was going that much faster he didnt think through his decision he just went for it he handed cali his ak and hung the rpg from a tear in the boxcars skin act like were both still here fire both weapons and weave back and forth so it looks like two people pinned here where are you going outflank them mercer ducked around to look up the length of the train with the exception of the big door in its middle the side of the railcar was a featureless wall of steel the tracks ahead ran straight down the valley floor boxed in by mountains on both sides theyll see you on the side of the train if they look around the corner cali said desperately trying to stop him i know without another word he climbed the rest of the way down the ladder and crawled onto the heavy coupling securing this car to the next the tracks were only two feet below him a blur of wooden ties and gray ballast stones he ducked lower still and peered under the railcar beyond the bogie trucks that anchored the wheels was a series of girders and beams that gave the boxcar its strength it would be difficult but not impossible mercer moved the yarygin pistol from his back into the front of his jeans and slung himself under the coupling an occasional weed growing between the tracks whipped at his head ignoring the distraction he reached forward and grabbed the bogie truck feeling the power of the trains engine through the cold metal he shifted his weight using the muscles of his legs and stomach to keep his body from sagging onto the ground and slowly inched himself into the space above the axles he heard cali fire a couple of shots as he eased himself above the whirling axles grease coated everything but the railcar was so old it was sticky rather than slick he flipped onto his stomach to jam his feet against one of the longitudinal beams and hold on to the other with his arms inch by inch he shimmied down the length of the car his stomach quivering with the strain of holding his body in a shallow arch the ground whizzed by a foot under his nose he could no longer hear cali because of the noise generated by the boxcar but when he reached the forward set of bogies he caught the sound of the gunmen he torqued a leg over the top of the bogie assembly felt the axle spinning against his skin and yanked the leg back one hand slipped from the beam and for a precarious moment he was suspended over the tracks by one hand and a foot and felt himself tipping over mercer scrambled to right his grip and keep his heart from exploding from his chest he took a couple of breaths before trying again this time his foot landed on one of the axles supports and he managed to awkwardly climb onto the truck the front of the car was only a few feet away he could clearly hear the men shooting back at cali precisely timed shots that made him think they had ammunition to spare he eased forward again and was reaching for the coupling when he felt the mechanism vibrate one of the gunmen had jumped off the ladder and onto the coupling hanging onehanded like a gibbon with his shoulder no more than an inch from the wooden ties mercer pulled the yarygin pistol just as the gunman got on his knees to see if he could pull off the same trick mercer just had in the microsecond of shock mercer saw he was middle eastern hadnt shaved in a couple of days and had perfectly capped teeth he put a bullet through the mans skull and swung out of the way as his body fell onto the tracks and vanished the gunman still on the ladder heard the shot and looked down just as mercer swung back extending the pistol over his head he fired as fast as he could absorbing the recoil with a stiff elbow to keep the barrel pointed at the assassin he had to give the man marks for courage because even as a wall of lead flew around him he tried to bring his gun to bear he had the barrel pointed downward when he ran out of time one of the ninemillimeter rounds entered his stomach just below the diaphragm and shredded his left lung before emerging out the top of his shoulder nearly severing the arm the next two hit him in the upper chest as he lost his grip on the railing and started to fall another punched through his head as the yarygin locked back empty the gunman hit the coupling and rolled off to follow his partner as so much litter on the tracks mercer heaved himself up and climbed the ladder he waited while cali fired off a threeround burst and then he shouted cali all clear what he thought to himself that if he was calling out to her she should realize it meant hed made it and it was clear to come forward its clear i got them bring the rpg he looked up as she scrambled onto the roof of the boxcar and he too climbed up hurry he urged and she broke into a run god youre filthy cali said when she reached him she gave him back his halfempty assault rifle yeah but you should see the other guy she made a face ill pass thanks on the last car before the locomotive mercer stopped and set his ak onto the roof hot exhaust spewing from the locomotive stung their eyes and made the air difficult to breathe this is close enough mercer said ahead of them they could see the tracks running down the valley the rail spur was so straight that it looked like they could see forever he checked over the rpg making sure he knew how to use it i think the trains clear so why dont you start back what are you going to do blow the tracks a couple hundred yards ahead of the train and derail the whole thing we can jump off the back she looked him in the eye we go together mercer made to argue but every second saw the train going faster and faster a leap off the back of the train was dangerous enough it would be suicide if it was traveling much faster in fact just to be safe he would need to give the engineer time to slow down to avoid hitting the destroyed section of track without a word he hoisted the rocket launcher onto his shoulder aimed at a spot three hundred yards ahead of the train and pulled the trigger the eightyfivemillimeter missile shot from the tube and an instant later the motor ignited blasting mercer and cali with a wave of hot gasses the fins deployed as the missle rocketed ahead of the train zeroing in exactly on the spot mercer had aimed for he had already dropped the tube and was turned to start the mad race to the end of the train when he saw the rocket motor cut out and the missile drop like a stone it hit the tracks and exploded less than two hundred yards in front of the speeding train sending up a shower of loose ballast stones and tearing one of the rails off the ties he and cali started to run lurching slightly as the engineer slammed on the brakes creating a keening screech like nails across a blackboard amplified a thousandfold mercer ignored the pain in his knee sprinting on his toes his lungs pumping in time with his pounding heart next to him cali ran with the grace of a natural athlete her head high her lips only slightly parted he knew she could have run even faster but she was determined to keep pace they took the leap onto the next car like a pair of olympic hurdlers with barely a check in their speed behind them the locomotive barreled on toward the ruined track her antiquated brakes fighting her massive inertia it was a losing battle the onehundredandeightton tem dieselelectric hit the broken rail doing twentyseven miles per hour when the right side wheels hit the ground they dug into the hard earth plowing a deep furrow for thirty feet before the entire locomotive tipped onto its side the coupling to the first car in the train was wrenched to one side and the car jackknifed splitting in half as it slammed into the back of the engine cali and mercer leapt onto the next car feeling the vibrations of the destruction behind them through their feet neither dared look back the second car came loose and rode up and over the first tumbling it like a log as the locomotives belly tank ruptured and the four thousand gallons of diesel fuel she carried spread out in a small lake they continued even faster running beyond what either thought they were capable of the sound of the awful destruction behind them never seeming to recede as they ran from it even with the train slowing they jumped to the second car from the end an instant before the one they left slammed into the pileup that car had a structural flaw of some kind because when it hit the front of it accordioned metal shearing and tearing as though it was paper the gaps between the trains were only about four feet but as cali and mercer neared the rear of the car mercer shouted jump with five feet to go cali did as he ordered and as they launched themselves from the car it hit the one before it the coupling to the last car broke free as the second boxcar was pulled off the tracks and onto its side falling as if in slow motion spreading ballast stones in an arc as it tore into the ground they landed hard on the last car both of them knocked off their feet by the impact mercer looked back with the preceding car pulled bodily from the tracks the last of the rolling stock had a clear path to the tangle of destroyed train cars it had slowed enough so he threw an arm over cali and together they held on as it hit most of the energy of the collision was absorbed by the squashed cars in front so it felt like nothing more than a mild bump cali and mercer shared a surprised look then burst out laughing i think this is our stop mercer quipped and cali laughed even harder but their laughter was cut short when both smelled burning fuel at the same time they scrambled to their feet and ran to the rear of the car cali descended the ladder first with mercer right behind hooking his feet outside the rungs so he could slide down the ladder like a submariner they ran for a couple hundred yards before turning back the railcars were piled three high in places two of them were flipped over on their roofs and as mercer and cali watched the spreading pool of diesel consumed the wreckage in a wall of flame that grew to a hundred feet mercer put his arm around calis slender waist and she snuggled into him as they watched the inferno mutely confident that poli was dead southern russia poli feines had been behind the wheel of the russian jeep for twenty straight hours yet the predatory gleam in his single eye hadnt faded his drive from the mine to the black sea had been over tortuous back roads and old smuggling routes and it was only when he reached the m motorway near the port city of novorossiysk that he encountered asphalt while this part of the black sea was famous for its resort beaches his destination was a small workingclass fishing village on the other side of the bay of zemess called kabardinka blind rage had erased any memory of the first part of his journey first africa then new jersey and niagara falls and now this though he hadnt seen him feines was positive that philip mercer was behind the attack at the mine just as the helicopter pilot had described him as the man on the barge in upstate new york even after twenty hours of thinking about his losses acid jetted from his stomach and scalded the back of his throat hed served with gavrail skoda for more than a decade in the bulgarian army and had partnered with him numerous times when hed gone freelance feines had five brothers one of them an identical twin but hed loved none more than gavrail and now skoda was dead killed by philip mercer on a barge on the niagara river feines admitted that they hadnt had enough time to plan that mission properly but he and skoda had pulled off far more elaborate capers with less time than theyd had and the men with him were combathardened veterans of afghanistan and iraq that they were willing to martyr themselves for the cause only made success more certain and now mercer shows up again polis hands tightened on the wheel until his knuckles went white and the bones threatened to erupt from the skin he welcomed the pain for it reminded him what he would do with mercer when their paths crossed again feines was a professional he never let his contracts affect his personal life but this was different when hed discharged his obligation to his client he would hunt mercer down kill everyone close to him then torture mercer so slowly that hed beg for death the lights of polis vehicle showed the sign for his turnoff he exited the deserted highway and drove slowly through the fishing town the smell of the sea which tinged the air was overwhelmed by the stench of rotted fish and diesel fuel north of the town a road ran parallel to the sea he could see the bright lights of novorossiysk across the bay there were several supertankers lined up to load oil transported on the new pipeline from kazakhstan and out on the still waters of the black sea more ships could be seen headed into or out of the port the laden tankers would need to transit the full length of the black sea and pass through the bosporus strait at istanbul one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world where on average there is an accident every three days before reaching the mediterranean they also faced the navigational nightmare of crossing the aegean sea the headlights revealed a small fish processing plant built on pilings over the water the parking lot was deserted but for two cars a luxurious audi a w and a limousine the lights were on in the office trailer at the edge of the parking lot alongside the plant was a long wooden jetty where an eightyfoot commercial fishing boat was moored poli could see the glow of navigation equipment through the broad bridge windscreen he parked the uaz jeep next to the black audi he reached over his shoulder to touch one of the barrels it was warm but not yet hot the heat was a byproduct of the exchange of subatomic particles from one barrel to the next by themselves there wasnt enough ore in any one of the containers to start such a chain reaction but two in close proximity created a critical mass in the mine the barrels had been stored well away from one another but in the confines of the truck it was almost as if they were calling to one another in a deadly siren song left unchecked the plutonium would eventually explode in a shower of deadly dust that would contaminate several city blocks or more depending on the wind two men emerged from the office trailer and he sensed movement on the fishing boat the older of the two walked up to feines and hugged him while the other held back at a distance poli didnt return the embrace the man released him he was of average height with thick saltandpepper hair his mustache was tell tended and below his arched brows were arresting blue eyes that even in the dim light of the parking lot possessed a devilish charm first of all he said in russian are you okay im fine but i think all the arabs sent to help me were killed what happened poli you didnt give me enough time feines snapped i couldnt stall the americans any longer grigori popov said ira lasko was about to go over my head if that happened there would have been an investigation and it would have been my ass on the line as it is ill have a lot of explaining to do i can only hope to convince my superiors and the americans that the timing was a coincidence or perhaps there is a leak within laskos office tell me what happened we were loading the last barrels when the chopper appeared we were ready for it but somehow the stupid raghead missed it was a mi for christs sake as big as a barn and the damn fool only managed a glancing shot with an rpg from the amount of fire we got after it crashed i estimated most of the soldiers survived so rather than get into a pitched battle i ordered us out but you decided not to go with the train popov asked slyly poli remained grim as was my plan all along just in case something happened to the train i wanted to make sure i got some of the plutonium here i heard the train wreck as i drove out of the valley and saw the fire even if i went back theres no way were going to recover those barrels how many did you manage to bring with you two popov nodded more than enough for their current operation good because i am done with this operation feines remarked youre not going after the alembic this operation has been a lot more than i anticipated poli admitted i thought id find what i needed in africa only to learn your army beat me to it by a half century then i thought i had it from the samples the american recovered and shipped home on the wetherby i have the pictures i took of the stele which might reveal the alembics location but your information about the old depot led me to complete the project im out of it now i dont blame you popov said im glad my only part in this thing was giving you information about the cache in samarsskaya you mean selling me that information popov shot him an oily smile weve known each other for a lot of years poli but business is business and helping you smuggle nuclear materiel out of russia well lets just say my conscience needed a little help accepting it in truth i wouldnt have given that information to anyone but you because i know you couldnt let these crazy bastards do anything to us it sounded like a question to poli in truth he had just a vague notion of what the people paying him were going to do with the plutonium and given the amount of money hed receive he really didnt care he doubted the little village in bulgaria he planned to return to was a terrorist target so nothing they did would affect him personally let them nuke the states and then face her wrath it wasnt his problem anymore what about mercer and the other survivors at the mine he asked federov reports directly to me i am supposed to be there tomorrow when the real train arrives i will tell the engineer and his crew that federov needs more time theyll be isolated for a few days at least good feines considered driving back up there with a sniper rifle and at least killing philip mercer but he didnt want to rush his hunt he would make certain he and mercer met soon enough popov motioned for the other man to join them i dont believe you two have actually been introduced formally poli feines may i present the deputy oil minister of saudi arabia currently stationed at the united nations overseeing charitable contributions from the cartel mohammad bin alsalibi your employer alsalibi shook feiness hand but there was a cold reserve behind his handsome face i understand that you ran into a setback he spoke with a slight british accent from having prepped and gone to university in england philip mercer not the janissaries this time no it was mercer resourceful man a man on borrowed time hes not a priority to me the saudi ambassador said this is personal poli snarled lets go into the office popov suggested a little coffee is in order i think the fish processing plants office was as unkempt as the plant itself it stank of fish oil and the furniture in the reception area was stained from years of supporting the backsides of dirty fishermen popov got the coffee machine brewing and poured when it was ready how much ore do you have alsalibi asked there are two barrels in the back of the uaz i estimate about a thousand pounds worth for curiositys sake how much was at the mine depot tons of it we loaded sixtyeight barrels onto the train before mercer showed a wistful look crossed the ambassadors face as he considered what could be done with such a deadly cache even for a stone killer like poli feines the look was disquieting that fishing boat out there he said just to cut the eerie silence is that the one they are going to use yes it was stolen a week ago in albania her names been changed of course so shes completely untraceable and your crew are ready to travel to turkey and are most eager to martyr themselves after the fire had died down some mercer and cali checked the wreckage for survivors first tying strips of cloth over their noses and mouths in case any of the barrels had ruptured neither was surprised that no one had survived the crash and subsequent explosion but both were relieved that the barrels they could see in the twisted pile of railcars remained intact they set out for the long walk up the tracks back to the mine mercer using a stout branch as a crutch at dusk they built a fire and slept in its rosy glow cali cradled in mercers arm her silky hair caressing his face they reached the mine two hours after sunrise the russians were camped near the remains of the helicopter ludmilla the heavyset scientist was cooking rations scavenged from the chopper while the other scientist and the pilot whod run from the gunfight because he had no weapons tended an injured man when they got close they could see it was sasha federov mercer hobbled up and knelt next to the soldier grinning i was certain that rpg had your number on it bah federov dismissed with a pained smile nothing more than a little shrapnel in my shoulder and one hell of a headache did you stop the train derailed it about twenty miles down the valley no one got off at their last stop im afraid someone didnt get on it at this one mercers relief that federov had survived turned to instant concern what are you saying yesterday i sent yuri the pilot down to the tracks one of the uazs was there its engine destroyed by gunfire so we couldnt use it the other was gone son of a bitch mercer shouted and got to his feet fucking poli he took off in the truck knowing i was going after the train do you think he had any of the barrels yes goddamn it there wasnt enough time to load the last two i had assumed poli would have cut his losses and left them behind what are we going to do cali asked sasha how long before your superiors send someone out here when they dont hear from us do not worry my friend the real train should arrive sometime today thank god that still gives him a days head start cali pointed out those barrels could be anywhere in the world by then her remark soured mercers mood even further she was right and he began to understand the stress of her job being right ninetynine percent of the time when dealing with nuclear materials wasnt good enough hed stopped poli from carrying off tons of the plutonium ore but failed to prevent a couple of barrels from slipping away how many people would die because he screwed up in theory that was enough plutonium to irradiate dozens of square miles or the water supply of an entire city what would happen when elevated radiation levels were detected in the aquifer feeding manhattan thousands would die just from the rioting and looting that would break out how many more would perish during the evacuation and then how many would suffer the devastating effects of ingesting the plutonium dust it was conceivable that cancer would claim tens or even hundreds of thousands more and what would become of new york city with every pipe and conduit potentially contaminated it would be uninhabitable for years a ghost town of skyscrapers mercer had been so proud of himself for blowing the train off the tracks and now hed never felt worse in his life it was his fault all of it he would feel as responsible for those deaths as if he was the one who released the plutonium well get him cali said reading the anguish in his eyes and if we dont at nest failure is simply not an option cali that looks good on the letterhead but its just not realistic he didnt want to sound so harsh but his emotions were running at the breaking point there is a lunatic out there with a thousand pounds of plutonium and were stuck here by the time sashas train arrives paris or london or rome could be a radioactive wasteland a voice came from the other side of the helicopter or new york or chicago or washington dc mercer recognized it immediately the janissary whod rescued cali and him in africa and had warned them off at mercers brownstone stepped from around the helos scorched wreckage he wore the same black suit he had in washington and with him was the same assistant however i believe ankara istanbul and baku are more likely targets mercer had his pistol out and trained on the janissarys head tell me why i shouldnt kill you now he smiled for a man whos been calling me for a week you dont seem too interested in what i have to tell you it took mercer a moment to understand youre professor ibriham ahmad of the university of istanbul he made a gracious half bow at your service i am also general ibriham ahmad of the most exalted sultans janissary corps tasked with being the last guardians of the alembic of skenderbeg mercer lowered his pistol this is devrin egemen ahmad introduced the young man next to him one of my star pupils and a trusted lieutenant egemen bobbed his head ahmad looked around the deserted mine noting the bodies covered in tarps we knew the russians returned to africa to mine alexanders adamantine ore but we believed they used it all up building their early bombs how much was here and how much did they get away with i dont know for sure we stopped the train cali and i could see dozens of barrels in the wreckage but theres probably more poli feines escaped with two barrels probably a thousand pounds worth in a truck more than enough for their plans ahmad said thoughtfully he moved away forcing cali and mercer to follow so they could have some privacy then in one graceful movement he sat on the ground with his legs crossed he patted the earth please sit this story will take some time mercer had seen his capacity for violence but he sensed that ahmads true strength came from his intellect it was in the way he spoke confident and assured and eager to teach mercer thankfully lowered himself and set aside his makeshift crutch like all janissaries gjergi kastrioti was trained in istanbul at the finest military college of his day he was an excellent student who intuitively grasped strategy and tactics so when he decided that the sultanate had become corrupt and revolted against murad ii it was little wonder his men followed him he went to albania and held off the sultans army for twentyfive years mercer said ahmad cocked an eyebrow youve done some research very good it was rumored he had a talisman that once belonged to alexander the great mercer went on i assume its the alembic correct the last credible report concerning the alembic came from a syrian scribe who said that the generals who took over alexanders army following his death were squabbling over who should carry it because there was no consensus they decided to return it to egypt where it would be buried with alexander along the way a contingent of soldiers decided to steal the alembic for themselves and escaped with it into the desert i can only speculate what happened from then suffice it to say the alembic was worth a fortune in the right hands and it must have passed from potentate to sheik to king over the next several hundred years it eventually ended up in the hands of the most powerful rulers in the region the byzantines and then when their civilization collapsed and the ottoman empire flourished the alembic of skenderbeg was in their treasury by then however no one knew what it was because it had sat forgotten for more than a millennium but skenderbeg figured it out that he did the story is that as punishment for staying out past curfew at the bedroom of a noblemans daughter if the tale is true he was sent to one of the armys massive storehouses and ordered to catalogue every item inside the story says it took a month but during that time he became fascinated with a large bronze urn and the strange writing on its side he found someone who could translate it for him and thats when he learned that it was alexanders secret weapon it must have seemed like fate to him for already some of his men were calling him skenderbeg or alexander the great when he planned his revolt against murad ii he made certain he took the alembic with him cali summed up saying and having the alembic allowed him to hold off murads army for so long i dont get something mercer interrupted if alexander used it for so long and skenderbeg used it too how much plutonium ore can there still be in it it might be big but it isnt bottomless there is very little ahmad said but it doesnt matter the alembic isnt used to disperse the radioactive dust then how does it work there are two chambers within the alembic when the mechanism is turned on the shield separating them is moved and the two samples of ore are allowed to interact unlike the raw plutonium found in africa and the barrels of it here alexanders alchemists had refined it somehow changed it in such a way that rather than emit weak gamma particles that are unable to penetrate human skin the alembic belches deadly swarms of alpha and beta particles that sicken in seconds and kill in minutes it was an insidious weapon that skenderbeg employed only when absolutely necessary but alexander used to wipe out entire armies there are accounts of fifty thousand enemy soldiers killed in a single night when his spies activated the alembic in their encampment when the siege of an ancient city called qumfar wasnt going as planned alexander opened the alembic outside the city walls and left it there for a week when he returned every man woman child and animal within the walls was dead a scribe wrote that their skin had blackened and peeled off their bodies that some were so covered in blisters that they werent recognizable as human he said many mothers had slit their own childrens throats to ease their suffering before turning the blades on themselves cali said when something is so heavily irradiated it would remain radioactive for weeks months even ahmad shook his head i am an historian not a nuclear engineer i can only tell you what i know of the alembic perhaps alexanders scientists did something else to the ore so that the effects were shortlived i do not know or perhaps the town was severely nuked mercer said and that is why today there is no such place as qumfar could also explain why alexander died so young cali added all i know for certain ahmad said is that in the wrong hands the alembic is much more dangerous than the ore feines made off with today what happened to the alembic upon his death skenderbegs generals knew that they would eventually lose to murads army even with the device the driving force of their revolt was dead and it was only a matter of time before the soldiers lost their will to fight rather than risk the alembic falling into ottoman hands they decided to honor both their leader and his namesake and do what alexanders men had wanted that is return the alembic to his tomb and did they ludmilla approached with plates of powdered egg and coffee from what little supplies survived the helicopter crash it was the first food mercer had seen since the flight from germany to samara and while surplus russian rations were far from cordon bleu he and cali attacked it with relish so did they return the alembic to alexanders tomb cali asked around a mouthful of egg ahmad turned to her and said brightly oh most certainly do you know where it is ahmad didnt reply to mercers question for several seconds you would have died in africa if we hadnt shown up in atlantic city too you managed to find chester bowies crates and make certain that poli feines didnt get them but it was a close thing no mercer nodded and just now you came here to secure the last of the ore mined by the soviets and yet feines escaped with two barrels and there are many dead dr mercer even if i knew where alexanders tomb was hidden i would not tell you you dont know where it is no miss stowe i do not every schoolchild learns its someplace in egypt supposedly but we have kept its location secret by not knowing it ourselves the janissaries thwart anyone interested in finding it long before they get close how do you know when theyre close mercer asked irritation in his voice there are certain signs along the way how do you think i knew about feines how he made the same mistake you did doctor only he made it earlier i am the world expert on skenderbeg anyone interested in him must first come to me and just as i took over from my mentor in time young devrin here will become the gatekeeper of skenderbegs secrets and anyone interested in following the lore of his alembic will have no choice but to contact him so poli called you we even met ibriham ahmad admitted mercer was outraged what were you thinking giving him enough information to lead him to the mine in africa alas he was already in possession of that information though i wasnt aware of it at the time no i tried to send him off in the wrong direction but he was more resourceful than i anticipated that was why when we learned he had hired a local rebel leader to get him to the central african republic we made sure we were there to stop him of course he escaped and so he began to track the two of you how did he already know about the mine because my mentor made a mistake there was a trace of bitterness in his voice but also a touch of understanding he divulged secrets to a student a beautiful and fiercely independent woman whom he met while on an archaeological dig in palestine in the s she was the daughter of an enlightened businessman who indulged her passion for learning she was to be the love of my mentors life and he wanted her to know all his secrets so that their son could continue on in his role he told her all about alexander and how when he returned from the deserts of egypt he carried a devastating weapon that gave him the power to pronounce himself god he told her how alexander believed the weapon was made of adamantine the mythical metal used to forge prometheuss chains he even told her that after alexanders death one of his most loyal generals returned to the african village to erect a stele commemorating the great victories he won because of the alembic mercer suppressed a smile while he wasnt sure what made him think the stele hed seen was important he was glad that hed asked booker sykes to photograph it if it was put in place after alexanders death there was a chance albeit a slim one he admitted that it might contain information on alexanders fabled tomb he said casually cali and i recalled seeing the stele just before the attack beautiful wasnt it old oblique obelisks arent my thing ahmad smiled at mercers wordplay not knowing that mercer was trying to distract him away from the subject besides we didnt take a close look oh too bad it was in marvelous condition i had never seen it before the hieroglyphics were barely weathered and were quite easy to make out though i confess i dont know how to read any of them mercers heart sank was ahmad gave him a look usually reserved for recalcitrant students who thought they could pull one over on him my dear doctor do you think i would leave it behind for the next poli feines to discover i had no choice but to destroy it i do feel bad about desecrating such an important antiquity if that makes you feel any better no mercer said miserably it doesnt central african republic so what do you think book sergeant paul rivers asked out of the corner of his mouth booker sykes didnt take the lowlight binoculars from his eyes as he surveyed the ruined town of kivu that im pretty lucky one of my ancestors wasnt the fastest runner in his village id hate to have been born in a shit hole like this the two of them had come ahead leaving sergeant bernie cieplicki to guard their truck a few miles shy of kivu although caribe dayce had been the greatest threat to the region his death had done little to quell the unrest small bands of armed teens roamed kivu and the surrounding villages drunk off their asses or so stoned they could barely see and that had made it easy for sykes and his small team to arm themselves on the road up from rafai they had been stopped at an impromptu checkpoint by four kids looking to shake down anyone foolish enough to be traveling in the striferidden area the checkpoint was at a spot where the trees crowded close to the road so vehicles couldnt turn around theyd forced the americans out of the truck and while one of them covered them with his ak the others began to rifle the fourwheel drive sykes had bought in the capital bangui with cash mercer had given them for the mission sykes had prepared for this actually hed hoped for it because he wanted weapons for when they got deep into the bush the kid watching the delta force commandos was probably sixteen or seventeen with deepset bloodshot eyes and an insolent mouth he held his assault rifle with casual indifference while the three men he was covering were big it was his experience that bullets trumped size every time he was more interested in the cartons of cigarettes and other items sykes had loaded into the truck for just such an ambush everything hed brought was chosen deliberately to make the gunmen want to probe deep into the back of the battered cherokee hey hey one of the kids rummaging in the cargo compartment called excitedly he emerged with a brandnew soccer ball and as sykes had predicted he bounced it on his knee for a second and gently kicked it toward the kid guarding them sykes watched the teens eyes and the instant they flickered from the captives to the approaching ball he and his men went into motion sykes lunged forward grabbing the ak by the barrel and thrusting the weapon skyward bernie cieplicki had been folding a tightly rolled magazine inside it was a sixinchlong nail that had been ground down so one end was as sharp as a needle he whipped the magazine forward sending the nail through the air like a dart it hit the gunman whod found the soccer ball in the shoulder embedding half its length in his flesh had cieplicki felt the situation warranted it he could have sent the nail through the kids eye and into his brain as it was the teen cried out startled by the sudden agony paul rivers who at six four was the biggest of the commandos shot past the wounded african and used all his weight to slam the jeeps rear door the two teens inside hadnt even begun to react to the attack the impact of the heavy door plus riverss weight broke three of the four legs dangling over the bumper with the gun pointed harmlessly in the air sykes struck the teen in the jaw with his elbow his eyes fluttered and he dropped unconscious bernie leveled the gunman with the dart in his arm with a roundhouse kick to the side of his head the counterattack had taken four seconds before continuing on cieplicki who was the teams medic pulled the nail from the africans shoulder swabbed the wound with antibacterial ointment and bandaged the puncture there wasnt much he could do for the broken legs except fashion some splints and give the two kids morphine injections to knock them out for a couple of hours the teen book had decked wouldnt need drugs to remain unconscious booker sykes checked over the weapons with illdisguised contempt the assault rifles were serviceable if dirty what he hated was the gun itself liberal groups back in the states loved to point out how the united states was the biggest arms exporter in the world and in absolute dollars that was true but what they failed to mention was that the billions of dollars worth of arms were generally aircraft like awacs and fs or warships past their prime weapon systems that invariably were never used beyond training and coastal interdiction missions meanwhile here was the ubiquitous ak there were more than a hundred million of them scattered around the globe and nowadays you could buy one in bazaars and souks in most third world countries for as little as fifty bucks they had considered buying arms in bangui but knew it would take too long to establish contacts with dealers booker had faced the ak on four continents and believed it had caused more death and more misery than just about any single weapon since cavemen started bashing one another with clubs nuclear bombs had killed a hundred and sixty thousand people at nagasaki and hiroshima men with aks had caused the deaths of ten times that number in africa alone so where were the protesters decrying how russia and her old satellite states had flooded the world market with aks with no regard as to who used them but let the american government try to sell a couple of kc aerial refueling planes to taiwan and everyone screams warmonger it pissed him off they left the inept highwaymen loosely bound and with a couple of cartons of cigarettes and enough food to see them through a few days and continued on toward kivu dusk was settling as they approached and rather than risk driving into an unknown situation booker ordered cieplicki to stay with the truck while he and rivers reconnoitered the town about the town smartass rivers said to his captain in delta rank had little meaning looks quiet enough book rumbled the hotel where cali had stayed was deserted its lebanese owner having fled with his family a couple of youths lounged on the veranda all the liquor from the bar and the food from the restaurant had long since been stolen so they simply sat at a table and watched the sluggish river roll by showing interest only when part of the bank fell into the waters from the constant erosion a pair of men were working on calis abandoned land rover from what shed told book back at mercers house all it had needed were tires and he was surprised it was still here he dialed up the binoculars resolution and noted the dark patch under the trucks high chassis someone had either drained the oil or more likely put a few rounds into the engine block he spotted a few families trying to put their lives back together and an old woman sat at the entrance of her mud hut with a squealing infant in her arms book imagined the childs mother had probably been raped to death god he hated africa because the cycle would never be broken so how do you want to play it captn drive right on through now or wait mercer said the village were looking for is another two hours up the road i dont see any cars or trucks down there that look like they can follow us but id rather pass through when its ohdarkthirty so they dont even know were in the area roger that booker had wanted to bypass kivu altogether but the only road cut right through the town center he did a comm check of their tactical radios and sent rivers back to the truck with orders to approach the town at three a m hed make sure nothing changed in the desolate village then meet them before they entered booker sykes couldnt remember how many nights hed spent watching over villages such as kivu places in iraq afghanistan pakistan somalia sudan and a dozen other countries hed just as soon forget but somehow knowing that this mission was connected to philip mercer made it all the more important he didnt know what to make of mercer without a doubt he was the smartest shrewdest man book had ever met he handled himself well in any kind of fight despite the fact hed never been in the military at heart he was a loner but people seemed to gravitate toward him finding in him a calm strength that few knew existed and booker was well aware of the way cali stowe looked at him even if mercer himself was blithely ignorant he knew mercer was still grieving over tisa nguyen but the boy was going to miss out on someone pretty special if he wasnt careful mercer was a close friend of the deputy national security advisor yet hung around blue collar guys like harry white he had a ton of money but didnt possess an ounce of ego or pretension booker hadnt figured out what made mercer tick what drove him to get involved when other people ran he suspected mercer himself didnt really know and that was just as well sykes didnt delve too deeply into why he joined the military and then volunteered for its most dangerous missions because if he found the truth he probably couldnt do his job anymore without electricity kivu shut down as the sun sank lower to the west the rebels on the hotel veranda grabbed up their weapons and climbed to the room theyd commandeered the woman with the baby entered her little hut she lit a lantern but only let it burn long enough to feed the child and tuck it into a makeshift crib the single street through town and the small square were deserted by nine oclock yet booker stayed with his plan and as insects fought their way past his barrier of deet repellent and feasted on his blood he sat motionless on a small bluff along the road and watched kivu sleep he called rivers at a quarter to three to tell him everything was set and retreated a hundred yards up the road the instant he heard the jeeps engine over the din of insects and nocturnal animals he radioed rivers to kill the engine he loped another hundred yards away from kivu to where the jeep cherokee sat silently wordlessly booker and paul rivers moved to the back of the fourwheeler while bernie cieplicki stood at the open drivers door together they began to push the twoton truck along the dirt road true to his role as the team prankster bernie cieplicki made sykes and rivers provide the bulk of the horsepower while he merely steered they passed though kivu as silently as wraiths and continued down the road for another two hundred yards sykes and rivers were lathered in sweat and blowing like draft horses you guys look a little spent cieplicki quipped i guess i shouldnt have left my foot on the brake youre an asshole bern paul wheezed thats what people keep telling me cieplicki replied with a grin cocky enough to make rivers want to swipe it off his face lets mount up sykes ordered with the lights off and using night vision goggles cieplicki drove them away from kivu at a crawl at first to keep the engine noise down but within a mile he had them up to forty the wind whipping through the open windows was hot and stank of the nearby river but they needed the windows down because book and paul watched the surrounding jungle with their weapons ready to engage it took them two and a half hours to reach the scilla river where it flowed into the chinko someone had destroyed the makeshift ferryboat mercer had mentioned the barrels lay scattered along the riverbank and there was no sign of its corrugated metal deck from here its all on foot sykes said unlimbering his big frame from the jeep lets hide the truck and wait until dawn i dont want to go stumbling around the jungle without knowing whos out there you mean what bernie said that too in the predawn hour they made their approach to the village where mercer had seen the stele the nocturnal animals had already found their dens for the day and the diurnals had yet to emerge there was no evidence that anyone was in the area but they took no chances they crossed the ancient mine noting the breach in the levee where mercer said he and cali had been sluiced down to the river farther on they came to the village covered by cieplicki and rivers who stayed at the tree line sykes entered the clearing nothing remained of the village but the burned husks of the huts blackened piles of grass and mud that had once been home to the innocent the air reeked of putrid flesh the utter futility and waste of it all sickened him he cast around for the stele mercer said it was about seven feet tall and impossible to miss but sykes didnt see it unable to shake the feeling that he was being watched and not only by his own men he methodically crisscrossed the jungle clearing the grass was littered with hundreds of spent cartridges he picked up one to sniff it it still smelled of gunpowder he passed a pile of loose rocks and was about to ignore it when he stopped and went back in the tricky dawn light he had to squint to make out the odd writing that remained on the larger pieces oh mercer aint gonna be happy bout this he jogged back to the tree line where rivers and cieplicki waited whats the word boss man the stele things all smashed up cant be more than a few pieces the size of a brick explosives cieplicki asked no id say they broke it with hammers or rifle butts also ive got the feeling we arent the only people in the area could be villagers returning not at five oclock in the morning sykes went quiet thinking through his options he had gotten a few hours of sleep on the flight to africa but that had been thirtysix hours earlier he was exhausted his eyelids felt like they had an inner liner of sandpaper but hed been trained to ignore such distractions he came up with his plan and issued his orders cieplicki and rivers took off at a run while he remained in the jungle watching over the clearing he heard no movement no coughs or the scrape of cloth over vegetation but he was certain he wasnt alone moving as carefully as a stalking leopard he made a wide half circle around the village careful not to step out on the exposed bluff overlooking the river he found nothing rivers and cieplicki were back in eleven minutes and had sykes not been so uneasy he would have reproached them for how long it had taken to run the mile to the truck and back they brought back three militaryissue backpacks heavy nylon bags that could support more than a hundred and fifty pounds leaving cieplicki to cover the woods sykes and rivers took the bags to the ruined stele and carefully started filling them with pieces of the ancient marker they were careful about weight distribution for while bernie could more than handle a load sykes and rivers were much bigger and stronger men when they had one filled rivers heaved it off the ground what do you think book asked hundred and sixty hundred and seventy thank god its only a mile sykes said and looked up sharply when a bird suddenly launched itself from a tree he waited a beat but nothing more happened they had secured all the larger pieces and were down to fragments the size of acorns halfburied in the ground when cieplicki opened fire his single shot was answered by at least eight guns ripping on automatic sykes and rivers dove flat shoving the bags into a row for cover their guns resting on the priceless relic cieplicki came out of the woods a moment later laying down a wall of fire to keep the rebels in the woods he reached his teammates leaping over the bags and rolling around so his ak was pointed back at the woods the jungle fell silent again this isnt good the delta operators only had two spare magazines each thats all the kids theyd taken the guns from had carried it wasnt nearly enough for a protracted fight with more than a half dozen rebels discretion and all that sykes said he fired a quick spray into the woods and slid his packs straps over his shoulders using the power of his legs to deadlift the heavy burden cieplicki and rivers did likewise as a team they started running back toward the jeep at the confluence of the chinko and scilla rivers the packs were too heavy to slap against their backs as they jogged along the embankment and before hed gone a hundred yards sykes felt the tendons and ligaments in his lower back popping then the muscle pulled it was a merciless knifeedged pain that exploded against the top of his skull and every step served to deepen the agony yet he did not slow he gritted his teeth against the torment the thought of dropping the pack never entering his mind the gunmen kept to the woods as they pursued the team taking poorly aimed potshots that forced the team to zigzag as they ran adding tremendous pressures to knees and spines as they returned fire to keep the rebels at bay grimacing with each footfall sykes kept telling himself to ignore the pain but the agony was beyond belief searing waves of pain radiated from his lower back and when he jinked the added strain sent a bolt of fire to his brain he could barely twist to return fire so he held the ak onehanded and popped off covering shots hed carried an injured man in afghanistan a local fighter whod taken shrapnel to the gut but it was nothing like this the deadweight in his pack ground him down made him question everything hed ever done in his life to bring him to this torture he glanced at his men they knew the pain too it was etched in their faces and in the sweat that poured from their skins even paul rivers a towering ox of a man was feeling it and still they ran on they reached the mine plunged down into the section of blownaway levee without pause and gutted their way up the other side legs moving like pistons sykes faltered near the top and felt bernie ram his shoulder into the pack to see him up those last couple of feet unbelievably they were outpacing the rebels thrashing their way through the thick jungle one of the rebels realized their quarry was getting away and dashed out from the bush as rear guard it was riverss job to cover their backs every few moments hed look over his shoulder he saw the skinny african leap out of the jungle and start sprinting without breaking his pace rivers fired a quick burst the rebel went down as if hed been jerked by a string last one cieplicki panted pausing to swallow the prevomit saliva that flooded his mouth last one to the jeep is a rotten egg he retched and a trickle of bile dribbled down his chin onto his khaki bush shirt more of the rebels emerged from the jungle behind them a phalanx of them coming on hard capt rivers called out unable to stop running because they knew theyd never start again the three men slowed enough so they could lay down a blistering wall of autofire the range was pretty extreme for firing from the hip but one rebel spun to the ground when his shoulder was shattered by one of the millimeter bullets and the others dove for cover the last part of the run was down a slight grade and the men let gravity work for them their boots slapping the hard african ground with each rubbery step sykes had tears coursing down his cheeks as he ran those last couple hundred yards it was the first time hed cried since his grandmother died when he was twelve the jeep was well hidden off the main road rivers didnt bother pulling away the branches theyd used to camouflage the vehicle he popped the rear door and turned to lower the backpack into the cargo hold the shoulders of his tshirt were sodden with blood from where the straps had chafed his skin despite the agony or maybe because of it sykes let cieplicki unload his pack next rivers was already moving to the drivers door cieplicki dumped his pack and just shoved booker into the back of the fourwheel drive he climbed in after his team leader and slammed the door as soon as everyone was in rivers gunned the jeeps engine reversing out of the jungle just as three of the rebels reached the mud flats around the convergence of the swift scilla and sluggish chinko they opened fire as soon as they saw the cherokee emerge from the jungle the rear window exploded raining gemsized chips of glass on cieplicki and sykes cieplicki was working on a large bundle in the cargo area opening it flat and maneuvering the three packs onto its rubbery surface while sykes returned fire though the shattered window a bullet found a rear tire blowing it flat rivers fought the steering wheel not daring to slow but knowing that the tire would slough off the rim if he didnt talk to me back there i need a minute bernie replied without pausing from his work shit three more gunmen raced out of the jungle in front of the jeep just as they started back down the road to kivu you dont have a minute more automatic gunfire ravaged the jeep punching holes through the windshield blowing off the passengerside mirror and puncturing the radiator so steam billowed up from under the hood we gotta do it now rivers shouted the steering wheel shook so hard he felt like he was holding an electric fence dont wait for me bernie cried im not hold on he cranked the wheel to the left aiming for the broad river cutting though the jungle the banks were about five feet above the level of the water so he pressed the accelerator to the floor the tired engine responded as if knowing it was going out in a blaze of glory the jeep hit the bank reared up and shot over the water it hit like a charging hippopotamus a frothing swell of water surging over the windshield and a bow wave curving out to crash against the far bank the suv was caught in the slow current almost immediately pirouetting in unseen eddies so it soon faced backward it also started sinking hows it coming back there paul asked as the water quickly filled the foot well you could help by bailing bernie said as he struggled to readjust the packs that had lurched forward when the jeep slapped the water sykes helped him as best he could but his back had so stiffened now that hed stopped running that he could barely move paul rivers climbed over his seat and knelt on the rear bench helping cieplicki with the packs the water was only an inch or so below the blownout rear window once it found that inlet the jeep would sink like a stone any piranhas in these waters bernie asked without looking up thats south america dipshit but they got crocodiles here the size of speedboats a wave washed over the rear sill and in seconds the cargo space was flooded the men braced themselves as bernie lunged to open the rear door then the jeep slid below the surface leaving just a small ripple on the water the rebels on shore watched it vanish and after a minute they began to cheer when none of the men surfaced theyd been denied any spoils but were just as satisfied with the kill thirty yards from where the jeep disappeared the water heaved upward unexpectedly and a huge set of jaws emerged from the river a gaping red maw surrounded by daggerlike white teeth the rebels pointed and shrank back as the rest of the flat oval monster erupted from the depths then it seemed to spit out bodies three heads emerged next to the creature first one then another jumped onto the animals back one of the men helped the third one mount the beast while the first man did something near its broad rump hurry bernie said as he helped drag sykes out of the water the threeman inflatable boat had been mercers idea hed reasoned that since they were going to be along a river it might not be a bad idea if the roads were impassable sykes had bought it at an outfitters in virginia liking the model with the sharks mouth painted on the bow and paid extra to have it flown to africa with them theyd shoved it out the rear of the jeep moments after it began to plummet to the bottom of the river cieplicki had waited as long as he dared to pull the lanyard that filled the rubber rafts hull with compressed air something theyd neglected to tell the airline about as sykes rolled over the soft rail paul rivers wrestled with the fivehorse outboard motor he didnt bother mounting it to the transom as soon as he pulled the starter he greased the throttle and held the whirling prop underwater the overloaded inflatable didnt exactly roar down the river but they picked up speed quick enough the rebels on shore merely watched them vanish from view not sure exactly what they saw all together now bernie called out merrily row row row your boat despite the pain booker couldnt help but laugh at cieplickis antics samarsskaya mine southern russia the sun had burned away the morning mist that had filled the valley like a blanket of snow a few birds fluttered around the tops of the nearby pine trees and the cloudless sky seemed to arch forever ludmilla and the other russian scientist whose name mercer didnt know had salvaged a pair of radiation suits and some radiation detection gear from a crate that had survived the chopper crash and using a handcart found on a small siding under the oreloading hoppers they had headed down the tracks to make certain none of the barrels had been breached by the train derailment sasha federov was resting while the pilot yuri was inventorying their meager supplies as soon as professor ahmad had told mercer the stele had been destroyed he had gotten to his feet and begun to pace with his head bowed hed sent booker and his team on a fools errand into one of the most dangerous places in the world book knew how to take care of himself and mercer wasnt too worried about him but the thought was heavy on his mind what bothered him more or at least in a different way was the dead end he now faced he was convinced that the stele would have told him the location of alexanders tomb especially since one of the conquerors generals had erected the marker well after his death archaeologists had been searching for the tomb for centuries so without some new clue mercer was stymied the worst of it was he was sure ahmad hadnt been lying about not knowing the tombs location the janissaries system of protecting the location eliminated temptation among their members it was truly brilliant mercer returned to where cali and ahmad sat on the ground but he said nothing as cali and ahmad continued to talk what became of the woman cali asked the one that your mentor fell in love with montague and capulet im afraid ahmad said lighting a cigarette her father would never allow her to marry a turk and he made her return home as soon as he learned of the affair he was enlightened only to a point you see and the girl had already been promised to another a member of a royal household thats so sad they were different times although im sure if it happened today the results would probably be the same marrying outside ones tribe is a modern idea that has really only taken root in the west outside your tribe for lack of a better word what i mean is it isnt uncommon for an american to marry someone from france or germany or a white to marry a black for that matter in the middle east you would never see a shia marry a sunni or a turk marry a kurd it just isnt done and ever since any chance there could be a melding of the various sects and ethnic groups has been further eroded why is that cali asked what happened in iraq invaded iran ahmad told her that conflict is largely a footnote to you but it was a watershed moment in the middle east the iranians were totally unprepared for the invasion and were nearly defeated early on in order to inspire his people ayatollah khomeini delved back into history resurrecting the story of the battle of karbala when in husayn ibn ali grandson of the prophet mohammad was defeated by the umayyad caliph yazid the date is still a holiday for shia muslims khomeini cynically turned what was a sectarian grab for land and oil resources into a holy war how is that mercer asked drawn back into the conversation despite his foul mood husayn and his army were slaughtered to a man they became islams first martyrs what khomeini did was tell his people that saddam hussein a sunni was the modern reincarnation of yazid and that in order to defeat him it would be necessary for every iranian to sacrifice themselves as did husayn he went on to decree that anyone who martyred themselves was guaranteed a place in heaven in one move he negated the korans pronouncement that suicide was a sin against god and created the middle easts first suicide bombers even as he was battling the iraqis khomeini sent cadres of trained men into lebanon during their civil war and occupation by israel to spread the word that suicide bombing is not a sin but a glorious sacrifice to allah remember this is something expressly forbidden by the koran yet he managed to convince desperate people that his word superseded the very words god uttered to mohammad of course word of his pronouncement spread from there to the west bank and gaza where again muslims were fighting a superior force thus we had young men convinced by a madman that taking your own life by blowing up a bus or a restaurant serves gods purpose and then on to cali said and madrid and london and indonesia and pakistan and iraq and the list goes on and on ahmad ground out his cigarette bitterly while shia and sunni have always had a difficult relationship it wasnt always like it is today now it has become acceptable for a sunni carrying thirty pounds of plastic explosives to walk into a shia mosque and blow himself up khomeini unleashed the savagery of the bloody war that first divided islam just to defeat his neighbor can it be stopped not until there is a cleric powerful enough to rescind khomeinis declaration and make suicide a sin once again i cannot emphasize enough the importance of his actions and how it has damaged our faith and im afraid your countrys invasion of iraq hasnt helped matters he held up a hand when he saw a blaze of anger flash in calis eyes im not saying hussein wasnt a tyrant or that he should have remained in power at the time of the invasion france and russia wanted to end the embargo and i am certain that the iraqis would have gotten the nuclear weapons they so desperately wanted no the invasion was a necessary step in the larger scope of world events but that doesnt mean it hasnt ah stirred a hornets nest mercer suddenly remembered ahmads first words when he entered the camp you said istanbul ankara or baku are more likely targets for feines and the plutonium why youve been paying attention very good ahmad said as if now praising the unruly student hed chided earlier i believe youve been operating under the misconceived notion that al qaida is bankrolling poli feines and that they want to contaminate an american city using the plutonium thus spreading more fear around the world that is not the case there is no such thing as terrorism for terrorisms sake each act has a specific goal cali interrupted like getting the us out of iraq or israel out of the west bank not entirely ahmad said those are the stated goals yes but what the organizers behind the suicide bombers ultimately want is power after those withdrawals the poor soul who blows himself up next to a police checkpoint thinks hes fighting for the liberation of his people the men who gave him the bomb are merely using him as a tool to further their political ambitions they want to rule over that mans family this is true in all cases the men who carried out the london and madrid bombings want to force the united states and western interests out of iraq even though the bombers werent even iraqi it was the men behind them who wanted these things the men who blew themselves up just wanted to obtain paradise unfortunately your media focuses on the soldiers and pays scant attention to the generals mercer saw a flaw in ahmads logic if that were true who does osama bin laden want to rule since he was the one who masterminded masterminded ahmad agreed but did he pay for it the guys worth a couple hundred million sure he paid for it ah but where did he get his money i think his father was a rich contractor or something in saudi arabia professor ahmad said nothing waiting mercer out knowing hed make the connection are you saying the saudis paid for the attacks theres no evidence they were involved other than that most of the bombers were saudi citizens isnt that enough ahmad said archly by your way of thinking the us government was behind oklahoma city because timothy mcveigh was an american i dont buy it perhaps i overstated ahmad conceded however there are factions within the saudi government who would like nothing more than see the united states off balance and now they have selected someone new to help them carry out their plans before it was bin laden now they are paying poli feines to do their dirty work the man most directly involved is the saudi representative to opec currently working with the united nations in new york mohammad bin alsalibi in the silence that followed mercer and cali exchanged a look this wasnt what mercer expected at all apart from exporting wahhabi fanatics to the four corners of the globe saudi arabia had never threatened her neighbors ibriham ahmad was saying that the saudis were responsible for the greatest terrorist attack in history and now wanted to use a dirty bomb against their neighbors and just so you understand our culpabilities as janissaries in what has transpired recently ahmad added salibis greatgrandmother was the woman who stole my mentors heart i can only assume she told salibi about the alembic and its fearsome potential mercer couldnt care less about that he was still grappling with the reason why anyone in saudi arabia would perpetrate such an act i dont get it he said after a moment why think like khomeini thought ahmad said wanting mercer to come to the right conclusion on his own this is war dr mercer and all war is about power be more cynical than you usually are oil cali said caspian oil sorry mercer but miss stowe gets to move to the head of the class she turned to mercer what we were talking about back at your house about how the only way to defeat fundamentalism is to make oil obsolete well the only way for the saudi government to maintain their house of cards is if they continue to be our principal source of oil if we start getting crude from the caspian sea they become marginalized two major pipelines are already running one to the russian black sea port of novorossiysk and another will transport a million barrels a year to the turkish city of ceyhan on the mediterranean ahmad said polis orders are to take out the caspian oil infrastructure mercer asked then went on to answer his own question wont work even if he got his hands on a lot more plutonium nothing short of nuclear bombs or a fullscale invasion could take out all the refineries tanker ports pipelines and terminals surrounding the caspian im no petroleum geologist but ive seen pictures of baku the infrastructure in just that city alone is enormous youre not being cynical enough you dont need to destroy those things you mentioned all that need happen is to introduce suicide bombings at a few key locations and have clerics and imams in place to rile the faithful in short order there will be dozens or hundreds of martyrs ready to kill themselves believing they are fighting a holy war against christianity when in fact they are preserving saudi oil interests in a few months oil from the caspian will slow to a trickle and saudi arabia and the rest of opec will be secure do they have such clerics in place ive heard them in the mosques of baku and istanbul ankara and groznyy where chechens are already employing suicide bombers for their own aims what the hell is wrong with the world mercer said rhetorically hating that he saw the logic behind the plot the question i often ask myself ahmad replied sadly and one that is more difficult to answer is what remains right with the world mercer would never let himself fall into that trap hed spent a lifetime searching for the good amid the chaos the image that would be with him longest from his most recent time in africa wasnt the misery and bloodshed it was the refugee giving him the tomato for saving his family an intimate act of friendship that he would cherish forever it was too easy to give in to the hate and ugliness hed been numbed by tisas death struck hollow by his own loss but he realized just now that he was allowing that pain to turn him away from who hed always been yes he would mourn her for the rest of his life but that wasnt the same as allowing her passing to poison him harry white had been trying to tell him that all along mourning wasnt about how a persons death made you feel it was about what that persons life did and how you carry forward with those memories the choice is yours were going to stop them there was a flinty edge to mercers voice honed by a new sense of confidence he hadnt realized hed lost cali noted the difference and gave him a long sideways glance she smoothed the goose bumps that pricked the skin of her arms my duties as a janissary are to protect the alembic of skenderbeg ahmad said rather pompously beyond that we have no responsibilities if feines attempts to locate it directly we will act however the plutonium ore and what he does with it isnt our concern what about your responsibilities as a human being for christs sake it is not for his sake i do anything miss stowe i have devoted my life to protecting the people of this planet from a devastating weapon as have all the men who have come before me i think that is enough to ask bullshit mercer was nearly shouting again ahmad arched his eyebrow a half smirk canting his dense mustache mercer went on hotly youve been feeding us just enough clues to whet our appetites and keep us going you wanted us involved because you needed our help you couldnt have pulled off the salvage job in new york but you practically led us to it by planting that canteen in africa ahmads jaw loosened and his dark eyes widened how did you know two reasons mercer was on a roll and checked off fingers as he spoke first of all the woman who gave it to me seemed unsure of it it even slipped from her hands a canteen like that would have been very familiar to her since it was probably her job to fetch water but she acted like shed never seen it before secondly theres no way in hell the canvas would have survived seventy years in the jungle you gave it to that woman a couple of days before we entered the village because you knew we were coming cali was as stunned by mercers deductions as ahmad wait mercer how did he know we were going to be in that village remember when i told you i was there on behalf of the united nations looking for a mineral deposit i knew wouldnt be there it was a setup from the beginning whats his name adam burke the un representative who requested i go wanted me to find the plutonium mine instead he turned to professor ahmad i assume you know him youre mangling his name ahmad said its not adam burke its ahdham berk with a silent r he was a student of mine fifteen years ago mercer had never met the man only spoken to him on the phone a couple of times and he hadnt detected an accent he would have never guessed that berk with a silent r was turkish he sounded more american than mercer did so yes i did set you up ahmad suddenly sounded very tired but also relieved to get the truth out you have rather unique talents and contacts that no one within the janissary corps possesses and you miss stowe i hate to admit are as much a victim of my machinations as dr mercer what she cried who do you think made available the information about the elevated cancer rates in that village you havent had time to speak to him much but perhaps you will recognize my pupil devrins voice when he returns with our vehicle he was the one who called posing as an archivist from the centers for disease control what would have happened if cali and i hadnt met mercer asked it was inevitable ibriham said dismissively no it wasnt cali shot back i would have gone on alone if some stupid kid hadnt used my truck for target practice ahmad gave her a patient longsuffering look that was you he nodded what if i had refused to help her my dear doctor you werent chosen at random i assure you neither of you were did you seriously question whether to help her or not of course you didnt you would have no more refused her than you would push an old lady into a crosswalk your dependability is one of your greatest assets jesus mercer muttered raking his fingers through his thick hair hed been played for a sucker the entire time blithely following the trail of crumbs ahmad had doled out hed called it dependability mercer saw it as predictability so what the hell happened at the village his tone was accusatory you let dayce and feines slaughter those poor people a shadow of guilt and remorse crossed ahmads face after all the planning we put into this would you believe something as stupid as a flat tire we were delayed on the road up from kivu when we were following you and only arrived after it was all over and what about poor serena ballard cali said have a flat in new jersey too miss ballard spent a frightened day being watched over at a hotel in philadelphia so poli could get no information out of her the scene at her house was staged using blood drawn from my men shes back home now more than a little confused im sure but i needed some way to warn you poli feines was aware you had gone to atlantic city i didnt realize hed get to your hotel so quickly mercer and cali shared a relieved glance both had liked serena and had taken her senseless death especially hard because theyd believed her last moments on earth being tortured by feines had been excruciating a truck raced up the mines access road a newer model of the uaz fourwheel drives poli feines had brought to loot the old weapons depot young devrin was behind the wheel no sooner had he braked next to where mercer and cali had been talking with ibriham than he threw open the door and spoke quickly to his teacher in turkish he brandished a satellite phone and judging by his ashen pallor and the restrained anger in his voice the news wasnt good what what is it mercer asked his guts suddenly tight were too late novorossiysk russia originally founded as a colony of the italian citystate genoa in the thirteenth century novorossiysk was later an ottoman fortress town until its capture by russia in since the disintegration of the soviet union when many black sea ports were handed over to ukraine and georgia novorossiysk had become russias largest warmwater export center with visits by more than a thousand tankers container ships and freighters each year half of russias grain exports left through novorossiysk and one third of her oil surrounded on three sides by the caucasus mountains the city of a quarter million sat nestled on the northern part of a deepwater bay that bore its name ships weighing more than two thousand tons were required to report to the harbor master several days before entering the port and a pilot was compulsory with tankers of up to three hundred thousand dwt regularly visiting the oil terminal on the eastern side of the city oceanborne traffic was tightly monitored this was why the eightyfoot commercial fisherman easing into the inner harbor just after dawn went unmolested by the maritime authorities only a few gulls paid it any attention at all wheeling and diving above her stern deck drawn to the smell of fish oil and scale but unable to find a meal the three men aboard the stolen fishing boat had trained on it for only as long as it took to get the vessel from albania through the bosporus and across the black sea where the professional hijackers had taken their money and returned to their native country the oldest of the three was a twentythreeyearold saudi and while he headed the mission a syrian teen named hasan was more adept at the controls they would have been incapable of taking the ship back out the bosporus and around turkey to the port of ceyhan as alsalibi had told grigori popov to convince him to help secure the plutonium as it was they had a hard enough time covering the thirty miles across the sheltered bay of novorossiysk hasans thin almost feminine hands looked too delicate on the rough wheel and he peered out on the world from behind long curling lashes his two comrades stood behind him in the cramped wheelhouse one clutched a small koran while the others fingers danced with the set of worry beads hed been given by the leader of the madrassa religious school in pakistan where hed been recruited for this mission theyd been told that their martyrdom today would guarantee their place in heaven where a harem of virgins awaited them hasan had been especially teased about that because of his girlish good looks they were also told they were striking such a blow against the crusaders that their names would be remembered forever and all the muslim world would unite in a brotherhood of jihad against america hasan had never met an american but hed been taught to hate them with a consuming passion he could barely understand his teachers and friends and the imams at the mosques all said that america wanted to destroy islam that they had caused the tsunami in indonesia that killed hundreds of thousands of his brothers and sisters that they had tried to spread diseases in muslim countries in africa that they themselves had destroyed the world trade center as an excuse to attack the arab world he was a bright boy had done well in school and yet he never questioned anything hed been told about the united states because none of his friends did and he didnt want to be ridiculed in fact they would often boast among themselves creating ever grander lies in an attempt to show off how much they hated america most of what they said was puerile and ribaldamericans have sex with animals or they eat their own excrementbut it served to fuel their ardor until hasan volunteered to help put a stop to americas offenses against god in a sense he had been peerpressured into blowing himself up as they sailed deeper into the harbor they could see the massive oil tankers at their moorings some were more than a thousand feet long more resembling steel islands than vessels meant to cross the oceans next to them was a container port with a spidery gantry crane for unloading the ships in the yard behind it the brightly colored boxes resembled a childs set of building blocks stacked in neat ranks even at this early hour workers were loading containers onto the vessel from flatbed trucks that were lined along the quay their orders had been specific they were to bring the fishing boat as close as they could to the tanker terminal before detonating the five hundred tons of fuel oil and fertilizer crammed in her holds the special barrels brought to them the night before by the oneeyed man were sitting on the deck hasan tried to clear his mind as they approached the tanker facilitys outer buoy when that failed he tried to picture paradise but all he kept seeing was the tears on his little sisters face when he left damascus to join the pakistani madrassa where hed been recruited by the great saudi caliph mohammad bin alsalidi he recalled his father staring at him stonily not understanding why his son would rather die than take over the family hardware store his mother had wailed inconsolably that morning and locked herself in her bedroom the cells leader the acnescarred saudi named abdullah spotted the trouble first and hit hasans shoulder a sleek harbor patrol craft had rounded the tall bow of a tanker awaiting its turn to be filled with crude piped to the facility from kazakhstan so wrapped in his own memories and feeling the weight of dread in his stomach hasan was startled as soon as he saw the patrol boat its lights werent on and they had yet to cross the boundary reserved for the supertankers but he panicked nevertheless he rammed the throttles to their stops and spun the wheel to its starboard lock so fast the spindles blurred while the hull and upper works of the fishing boat were weatherworn and used she had a new volvo marine diesel in her engine room black exhaust jetted from the twin stacks as the engine responded to hasans inexperienced command the boat heeled over as it accelerated the angle increasing as hasan kept the rudder buried in moments her port rail was awash the netting hanging from her stern derrick was caught by a swell and wrenched off the vessel hasan the barrels the two barrels sitting on the foredeck had fallen over and were rolling toward the rail behind them the harbor patrol had noted the fishing boats erratic behavior the security forces at the new facility were well trained and responded immediately red and blue lights mounted on a horizontal bar above the open cockpit snapped on the siren started to scream as the swift vessel began chasing after the fishing boat hasan saw that they were about to lose the precious barrels though he didnt know what made them so important he spun the wheel to the opposite lock without easing back on the throttles the big fishing boat leaned over to starboard stopping the barrels headlong plunge but then they started rolling the other way for a giddy moment it reminded hasan of a handheld plastic game he had as a boy where you had to maneuver tiny metal balls into little cups and keep them from falling from their slots until you had them all in only this game he lost he was too slow reacting to the barrels inexorable slide the first fivehundredpound drum smashed into the saltweakened railing the metal sagged but held then the second barrel caromed into the first the rail tore away and both steel casks rolled over the side and vanished under the black waters of the bay hasan looked to abdullah his beautiful face a mask of confusion and shame what do we do he cried the patrol boat was a half mile away and closing fast there were three uniformed men aboard one cradling a shotgun while another steered the speedboat the third was shouting into a walkietalkie abdullah cursed this wasnt how he envisioned meeting allah running from a little russian boat turn us back he snarled hasan spun the wheel once more cutting across their own wake and driving the boat closer to the tanker terminal when the patrol boat was fifty yards from the fishing boat one of the sailors called across with a megaphone and when his hails were ignored the man with the shotgun fired a blast across the bigger boats bows theyre shooting at us hasan screamed we must stop we are not close enough we can surrender no abdullah held the detonator that would blow a small charge of plastic explosives set amid the barrels of ammonia nitrate and fuel oil the fishing boat was still a mile from the nearest tanker when it erupted the explosion blew a hole in the sea a half mile wide and eighty feet deep the fisherman and the patrol craft were atomized instantly while the shock wave that raced from the epicenter at supersonic speeds blew out every pane of glass in the harbor flimsier structures along the quay were blown flat the container crane withstood the blast but the containers behind it were strewn in haphazard heaps many of them broken open their contents littering the ground the explosion sent a tidal wave rearing up in all directions part of it went harmlessly out into the open sea while massive walls of water pounded the port facility because the tanker was waiting to be loaded she carried no ballast and rode high in the water the wave smashed into its thousandfoot flank rolling the ponderous vessel on its side the titanic forces acting on it split the hull at the keel and she started to sink the subsea pipelines that fed the floating terminal structure were sheared off and crude began to erupt through the surface of the bay in great reeking clots the fireball rising in the middle of the harbor seemed to rival the sun climbing over the caucasus it topped out at four thousand feet a roiling column of fire and smoke that resembled a nuclear detonation as the explosive force dissipated the ocean surged back into the void the blast had gouged in the water the torrent created by the backflow ripped floating docks from their moorings swamping pleasure craft and small fishing smacks in the process a bulk carrier leaving the port was dragged back a hundred yards by the surge and slammed into another big freighter entering the harbor both vessels were holed and started taking on water the echoing roar of the explosion faded leaving in its wake the angry shriek of thousands of car alarms and under the surface of the churned waters of the bay two containers that had fallen from the deck of the fishing boat lay silent their tough metal hides dented as theyd been tossed like leaves in a maelstrom but they had not been breached they had come to rest close enough for the plutonium in one container to begin calling to the material in the other like a separated lover it would take time but the increasing exchange of charged particles would go critical and their bond would be consummated in a blast more deadly than the one that had just destroyed the harbor what happened mercer asked as devrin and ahmad continued to speak in rapidfire turkish an explosion in novorossiysk thats the oil port you just mentioned cali said how bad reports are just coming in now they say the harbor was leveled there are ships on fire and many buildings too the media estimates the death toll in the thousands some eyewitnesses claim it was a small nuclear blast poli couldnt have refined the plutonium to make a bomb that quickly if anything its a dirty bomb which is just as bad cali remarked and spreading plutonium dust over the sea will make cleanup virtually impossible it will be decades before the area could be rendered safe if its possible at all we have to tell the authorities about the plutonium mercer said thinking through the logical steps the russians would be taking the harbor would be jammed with rescue personnel firefighters and medical teams theyd be running into an invisible cloud of highly charged plutonium atoms inhaling just a tiny amount of the radioactive dust would cause cancers of unspeakable intensity they have to evacuate the city as soon as possible ahmad said something to devrin and the college student handed mercer his satellite phone i do not know who to talk with to get the russians to evacuate a city ahmad added mercer checked the phone waiting a second for it to make a link with an orbiting satellite he dialed ira laskos direct office number iras secretary answered carol its philip mercer i need to speak with ira right away im sorry hes in a meeting with the president and the national security team i assume youve heard what happened in russia can i take a message i have some critical information about the explosion youve got to get ira for me they should be done in an hour or so i can have him call you im on a satellite phone and i may lose the connection any second he said keeping a tight rein on his exasperation i know youre used to dealing with crises but unless you get him for me thousands of people are going to die a horrible death a few seconds passed the phone buzzing in mercers ear give me a minute to transfer you to the situation room she transferred mercer to a marine colonel stationed outside the situation room buried deep under the white house mercer had only to say the words dirty bomb for the colonel to step into the inner sanctum and bring ira lasko to the phone whats this mercer he asked gruffly were too late i stopped feines from getting the bulk of the plutonium but he managed to make off with two barrels i estimate about a thousand pounds worth of the ore i believe it was in novorossiysk any proof not a shred but feines steals two barrels of plutonium and twentyfour hours later a city within driving distance gets leveled i dont believe in coincidences weve already been in touch with the russkies my buddy greg popov is apoplectic that extremists would pull something like this but he says theyve already swept the harbor with geiger counters and gamma ray detectors the sites clean that wasnt what mercer had expected it has to be there maybe the drums didnt rupture or maybe their equipments bad but i know it was there he thought for a second how did they do it the explosion i mean greg tells me it was a fishing boat loaded with explosives amfo most likely ammonium nitrate and fuel oil they were approaching the tanker side of the harbor when they were spotted by harbor patrol last transmission from the patrol guys said the boat was turning away and throwing away contraband a minute later it went up and leveled about two square miles ira the contraband was the barrels i bet they rolled off the deck when they turned the boat go over popovs head if you have to i almost had to when i talked to him about the plutonium in the first place i told you hes a cagey operator something in the way he said it gave mercer an idea what was it ahmad had suggested earlier be more cynical than you usually are that cynicism had been born of grief but mercer could use it he spoke even as the idea coalesced in his mind the explosion happened this morning right it takes hours to begin any kind of relief operation and your guy popov says theyve already scanned for nuclear materials so fast is that standard operating procedure i really dont know ira replied warily what are you getting at you told me that the russians didnt even know they still had this plutonium until you called them on it then two days later feines shows up just before we arrive hes got rpgs capable of bringing down a chopper and enough firepower to hold off an army what if popov tipped him and let feines nuke one of russias most important ports the guys cagey not insane ira i have it on good authority that a faction inside saudi arabias behind the whole thing in a bid to prevent caspian oil from cutting into their bottom line what if popov was told they were going to hit the other big oil terminal in turkey he wouldnt have cared less it would actually help russia by eliminating competition only he was doublecrossed i just remembered he was supposed to be coming to the mine today what was he doing in novorossiysk anyway he did mention hed been there since yesterday hold on a second mercer strode across the camp to where sasha federov was chatting with the pilot sasha can you think of any reason grigori popov could have gone to novorossiysk last night the soldier looked confused by the question novo i dont know why he would be there he was supposed to land in samara last night so he could follow the train which is late by the way mercer thanked him and spoke to ira once again popov should have been in samara not on the black sea ask yourself do you think hes capable of helping feines if he thought the plutonium would be used outside russia ira didnt answer for a long moment which told mercer everything he needed to know go over his head ira hes stalling so he can recover the drums get them back up here and sweep this whole thing under the rug i hate to say it but its possible remember ibriham ahmad the turkish professor ive been trying to reach hes here with me right now turns out he also heads the janissaries but the important thing is that we stop fundamentalists from taking credit for the blast and inspiring others in the region from taking up the fight this shit feeds on itself if we stop it now its going to save us a whole lot of problems in the future what do you think we should do you have to convince the russians not to disclose this was a terrorist act have them report it as an industrial accident gas buildup in a tankers hull or something ahmad mouthed something to mercer he clamped his hand over the phone and asked him to repeat himself some extremist group will claim the attack on the internet the authorities must be ready to discredit any such statement good idea ahmad bobbed his head in acknowledgment i do this for a living ira youve also got to monitor web sites and shut down anything having to do with terrorists taking credit for the blast what else lasko asked sounding like he was writing notes to himself i dont know youre the spinmeister not me hey any word from booker nothing yet give me a phone number and ill call as soon as i have anything on either book or the russkies and mercer dont beat yourself up about this youve done a hell of a job ira clicked off mercers friends last words were meant to cheer him if anything they made him feel worse mercer handed the satellite phone to federov contact your superiors the trains not coming they need to send another chopper because i think grigori popov has betrayed us what i think he tipped off poli about the cache of plutonium here at first i thought there might have been a security leak on my side but it makes more sense that popov betrayed my boss and his own country what do you know about him not much sasha admitted he is a deputy minister a former admiral i have heard he favors western sports cars and is how you say a maverick a cowboy i would not be surprised if hes had dealings with criminal elements because in russia these days that is the only way to gain power do you think he would sell black market nuclear material sashas eyes turned sad as he considered such a betrayal i do not know in this world anything is possible ludmilla and her colleague trudged up the switchback road from the railhead while she seemed as fresh and imperturbable as ever the male scientist looked on the verge of a massive coronary she spoke to sasha for five minutes answering a few questions before heading off to eat what did she say mercer asked cali joined them while ibriham ahmad and devrin egemen consulted privately it appears none of the containers split open thank christ they were loaded into two of the boxcars the rest were empty she says there were sixtyeight barrels bringing the total to seventy accounting for the two feines stole so far there is little heat buildup but she says we must get the barrels isolated from each other soon to prevent the plutonium from obtaining critical mass and exploding shes right mercer said but theres not much the group of us can do for now he paused maybe there is is there any kind of record of what was in the depot not that im aware of mercer looked to cali she spoke first i guess were going to play grocery clerk and take inventory the rubberized contamination suit smelled of stale sweat and halitosis and what he was pretty sure was urine a nauseating combination that churned the tinned borscht lying in mercers stomach how you doing he asked cali as she sealed the hood over her head ugh smells like a locker room of a girls volleyball team ive got bad breath and pee in mine want to switch pass they were standing outside the entrance of the old mine with ahmad devrin and ludmilla the russian scientist checked over their suits using a roll of duct tape to seal their gloves and boots she ran her hands over the suits to make sure there were no rips or tears from when she had examined the train wreckage mercer wasnt sure whose backside she lingered over more his or calis but the examination in that region had been more than thorough perhaps you should leave this for the russians professor ahmad suggested for the second or third time devrin and i plan to leave here before the helicopter that captain federov requested arrives we can take you and cali with us to the airport in samara i told you ibriham mercer had to raise his voice to be heard outside the yellow suit the man partially responsible for the theft will want to hide his culpability hes in novorossiysk right now looking for those two missing barrels when he finds them hes going to return them to the train wreck and act like nothing happened it will be your word against his trust me this wont be going to any court of law mercer checked his flashlight and the spare in the bag slung over his shoulder he had no intention of being in the mine long enough to drain even one but hed spent half his lifetime underground and knew you could never be too prepared ms stowe he said with a gallant sweep of his arms toward the small forklift poli had brought and abandoned our chariot awaits they climbed onto the little machine each sharing part of the single seat their hips pressed tight though there was no feeling through the thick rubber mercer keyed the electric motor which hummed to life a foot pedal controlled the motor speed and a small wheel directed the agile rear wheels he noted that there was plenty of juice left in the batteries when he flicked on the lights mercer tossed the turks and ludmilla a wave over his shoulder and guided the forklift into the mine as soon as theyd traveled just a dozen yards down the dark tunnel he felt the temperature begin to drop as if the stone was leaching the heat from his body the shaft was at least forty feet wide and fifteen tall much bigger than mercer had expected so the lifts puny lights cast a feeble ring along the ceiling walls and floor that retreated just a few yards ahead of them as they drove downward the triple set of tracks for hauling ore and waste rock from the mine were dulled from exposure and the mines constant dank humidity the main shaft shot arrow straight into the earth for nearly a mile before they came to their first cross tunnel mercer cut the power to the lift to conserve its batteries and jumped to the ground cali followed him as he entered the secondary tunnel she carried a gamma detector and watched its readings intently after fifty yards they came to a chamber where the miners had employed what was called roomandpillar mining in essence they had excavated a broad cavern but left thick columns of rock undisturbed to support the weight of the mountain above mercer played his flashlight around some of the columns and whistled when something reflected the beam back at him he felt like hed stepped into a military museum he recognized the sharklike snout of an me the extraordinary jet fighter the germans introduced in the latter stages of the war the aircrafts wings had been removed and leaned against a pillar next to the deadly plane a little farther on he came to another and another then he saw planes he didnt recognize they were advanced even for today they were small and sleek oneman attack aircraft that looked capable of incredible speeds he said these must have been prototypes of planes the nazis ran out of time developing good thing too our prop jobs wouldnt have stood a chance anything on the gamma reader backgrounds a tad high but nothing like what we found on the wetherby they spent another fifteen minutes exploring the cavity just to be sure there were at least fifteen aircraft stored here all in remarkable condition they also found early rockets some were mounted on trailers to be launched as the worlds first surfacetoair missiles others were small enough to be carried aloft for direct aerial combat all of them were far more advanced than anything the allies had at the time clever werent they mercer said examining a multiple rocket pod intended to fire a deadly swarm of small unguided missiles just think what the world would be like if theyd turned their genius to helping humanity rather than destroying it satisfied that the plutonium had been stored deeper in the mine they retreated back to the forklift and continued their descent down the gently sloping floor the next cross tunnel revealed another chamber of captured german arms on benches were manportable weaponsmachineguns of a type mercer didnt know a bazookalike weapon that unspooled thin wires for guidance a table littered with rifles with curved barrels for shooting around corners presumably dominating the entrance to the chamber was the biggest battle tank mercer had ever seen it had to be three times the size of a modern m abrams the tracks were three feet wide and instead of a single cannon mounted in the boxy turret this behemoth sported two side by side its a maus mercer said awed my grandfather was a military modeler he built one from scratch using a couple of old pictures hitler ordered the prototypes when someone suggested their tanks were vulnerable to attack from railroad guns never entered his mind the allies didnt have any railroad guns of course i didnt know any of these survived the war cali looked at him askance ever thought of going on jeopardy hey dont blame me a photographic memory is both a blessing and a curse want me to tell you the tanks specifications he tapped his helmet theyre in here too another time maybe i got something where that way she pointed deeper into the chamber despite the mines chill mercer was sweating in his suit adding his own unwashed body to the stench permeating the rubber guided by the readings on the gamma ray detector they carefully made their way into a subchamber of the main excavation look mercer shot a finger toward the stone floor they could make out tracks cut through the dust by the forklifts solid rubber tires great job of tracking there cochise cali teased we could have just followed the trail mercer shrugged as he stepped forward he felt something snag his ankle and for a microsecond he wished he could take back that fateful stride he should have known poli would have left behind a surprise he threw himself onto cali knocking them both to the ground his body shielding hers as best he could the booby trap was a simple trip wire attached to a couple of grenades with their pins already partially pulled the wire ran around the room where the grenades were hidden behind a massive timber balk supporting the entrance back to the main tunnel the suit prevented mercer from hearing the pins pull free and the spoons flip up to activate the grenades but he knew it was happening open your mouth he shouted in the seconds before the bombs went off the trio of grenades exploded almost simultaneously confined by the surrounding stone the overpressure wave shot across the room and slammed into mercer and cali causing their suits to squeeze in on them painfully had cali not heeded mercers timely warning her eardrums would have ruptured he rolled off her as soon as the wave of compressed air had rolled over them the cavern was filled with so much dust his light could not penetrate more than a couple of feet he got to his knees then shakily to his feet he was dazed by the explosion his head ringing and his balance shot by the brutal assault on his inner ears he glanced down at cali and ignored all the priorities of mine rescue hed ever learned or taught hobbling because hed smashed his bad knee again he approached the exit to the main shaft he played his light over the portal the grenades had blown the timber support from where it had stood for a half century and the wooden lintel as thick as a railroad tie had fallen too the stone above the opening had been fractured by the blast and with nothing to support it cracks appeared and widened as he watched a chunk the size of an anvil crashed to the ground mercer took one last look to where he knew cali lay stunned perhaps injured or worse and raced through to the main shaft abandoning her behind an avalanche of rubble that buried her alive the white house washington dc you have to believe me vladimir its in both our countries best interest that this doesnt appear to be a terrorist attack the president of the united states said his smooth voice covering his irritation he listened to the russian presidents reply would you rather call it a mishap and look incompetent or admit it was a terrorist act and embolden more fanatics ira lasko and john kleinschmidt his immediate boss listened to the presidents side of the conversation from the laager of sofas in the middle of the oval office as national security advisor kleinschmidt had immediate access to the president day or night and had presented mercers findings to the chief executive an hour before the administration had been saved more than once by philip mercer so when he asked for the president to intervene the former senior senator from ohio generally listened apples and oranges the president said in response to the russian one plane flying into a skyscraper can be an accident three on the same day while another goes down over pennsylvania all on live television isnt something you can pretend didnt happen you have a different opportunity with the situation in novorossiysk weve talked about this before this is a war vlad and every time they score a victory a couple more fighters join their ranks a blow like this is going to incite hundreds maybe thousands to carry on the fight against us what no it doesnt matter if they feel that caspian oil is a threat theyre going to take it out what better way than to exploit a bunch of brainwashed kids who think theyre buying their way into heaven while sitting back and saying how awful it is that a tiny fraction of their population hates the west so much yeah youre the west now too whether you like it or not the president made a rude masturbatory gesture with his hand as the russian leader spoke for several minutes thats right grigori popov the president chuckled for the first time since the conversation began ive got a couple hundred deputy this and assistant thats i dont know half of them and i dont expect you to know all of yours either but i have it from a good source that he was responsible for getting the plutonium into the hands of the bombers i dont know why it wasnt released but we know popov is there now when he should be meeting a member of my staff five hundred miles to the north im asking that you send someone you trust to novorossiysk to find out what this popov is doing if its a coincidence fine i owe you a personal apology but if im right and hes scouring the harbor for those missing barrels while everyone else is trying to coordinate relief efforts then youll know im right the presidents voice deepened and took on a familiar companionate timbre that connected immediately with any listener pollsters had shown that this tone alone garnered him ten points in the election vladimir youre facing a national tragedy that could help fuel a global war if it isnt handled properly youve got the full resources of the united states behind you on this but you have to make the right call dont give the bastards the satisfaction of claiming a victory here take it away and spare both our nations a much tougher fight in the future this is about hearts and minds as much as it is about oil and power he paused again his handsome face showing nothing thank you mr president as soon as he hung up the phone john kleinschmidt asked well he said hed think about it he doesnt have the luxury ira said its going to be all over the internet in an hour or two that terrorists destroyed that tanker terminal and stopped the flow of oil from kazakhstan the president met laskos gaze weve put him in a tough spot asking him to lie to his people about the most significant act of terrorism since while at the same time telling him that one of his own top advisors might be involved what would you do mr president id like to think id come clean and let the chips fall where they will but our esteemed russian colleague is a hell of a lot more pragmatic than i am my gut tells me hell follow our script but hes going to ask for quid pro quo when the time comes mercer wanted to tear the suit from his body and attack the pile of debris with his bare hands knowing that on the other side cali must assume hed left her for dead he calmed his breathing because the suits filters couldnt keep up with his pumping lungs and he felt he was going to start hyperventilating the helmets plastic eyepiece was also fogged though with the dust choking the mines main shaft it was impossible to see more than a yard or two he groped his way along the shaft like a blind man his flashlight turned off since it was worthless anyway one of the first rules about mine rescue hed learned going back to stories his own father had told was that during a cavein you never leave your buddies you are going to live or die that was up to fate but you were always supposed to do it together that way you could rely on each other as you waited for rescue thats the reason mercer disregarded his training and instinct to leap through the collapsing mine entrance there would be no rescue the blast hadnt been big enough to be felt on the surface and even if sasha ludmilla and the others became worried after an hour or two mercer and cali had the only three flashlights if the soldiers on the rescue chopper tried to dig through the avalanche they would probably make matters worse and entomb themselves and if they were prudent and called in mine rescue specialists it would take days to assemble them here days mercer couldnt afford his heavily gloved fingers brushed against something smooth hed found the forklift he hoisted himself onto the seat and flicked on the motor he felt its reassuring vibration through the suit it took just a moment to reach the rubble that lay strewn halfway across the main shaft where it had collapsed rather than attack the pile closest to the entrance mercer began moving larger stones away from the area to give himself working room he lifted them with the forklifts tines and then manhandled them off farther down the drive by the time hed finished clearing a wide swath of debris the dust had settled enough for him to examine the rockfall he tapped a few stones with the butt of his flashlight and while his ears continued to ring he could feel the rocks stability or looseness through his hands reading the stones like a blind man reads braille in his mind he mapped out every boulder he wanted to remove calculating its effect on the rest of the pile in the same fashion a chess master plans out entire games before making the first move because he knows how his challenger will react mercer knew this opponent all too well had faced it a dozen times for real and a thousand times in his nightmares he shut out the distraction of knowing cali was on the other side of the barrier scared that she would die alone in the cold womb of the earth for twenty minutes mercer studied the pile and when he finally reached out he plucked a little chip of stone no bigger than his fist and watched as it created a cascade of pulverized rock he got down on his hands and knees to examine how the pebbles had settled on the floor satisfied that the effects of his action were within the parameters hed established he removed a larger stone and again analyzed the results noting that they werent exactly what hed anticipated he adjusted his attack plan slightly and got to work in a way he was like a master jeweler facing the most important diamond cut of his career only it wasnt one swift motion that determined success or failure it was dozens as he slowly whittled the pile away ever careful that the stones didnt become unbalanced shifting weight loads from stone to stone as he bored a hole through the debris when hed cleared enough away from his hole he used the forklift to remove the detritus it took him an hour to worm his way through half the mound and thats where he encountered a slab of stone he couldnt move the jigsaw of rock was locked tight he tried shouting for cali but with the bulky contamination suit muffling his voice the gesture was futile at that point mercer should have left her and returned when rescue personnel arrived but hed spent enough time with the stone to know how far he could push it he returned to the forklift and smiled to himself tightly when he saw that the tines were held on by knobs welded to the lift chassis with thick carbon steel pins he jerked one of the pins free and wrestled the hundred pound lance from the machine then slid the cupped end onto the other tine doubling its length careful not to disturb the edges of the hole hed created he eased the single elongated tine into the burrow hopping off the lift several times to ensure he was positioning it correctly the tip scraped against the slab of rock and he lowered the metal bar slightly to wedge its leading edge under the stone again he inched his way into the hollow to check the position he weighed odds cursed then tore the soft rubber helmet from his head cali can you hear me if you can dont take off your helmet bang something metal against the rocks he then realized his precarious situation and added but not too hard a second passed then five then ten and mercer began to worry she had been injured in the blast maybe hit by a piece of shrapnel she could be bleeding to death just a few feet away tap tap tap mercer sagged with relief hold on im going to get you out he slithered back to the forklift and slowly drove the elongated tine under the rock he could sense by the way the motors vibrations changed how much of the load the machine was taking judging the weight and balance of the rubble with his instinct and experience something in the pile shifted suddenly mercer eased off the accelerator and safed the chain drive that lifted and lowered the fork he peered into the hole the beam of the flashlight casting bizarre patterns on the fractured stone there was a foothigh gap under the big slab but he could tell it lay at an angle the side closest to cali was still on the ground by hand he moved a few other rocks his earlier plan all but abandoned this was no longer a chess match but a frantic game of checkers he got back onto the seat and tried to ram the fork deeper under the stone it wouldnt budge the slick wheels began to spin uselessly against the stone floor he wasnt going to get cali out anytime soon enraged he was about to give up when the plucky little forklift lurched forward another foot he raised the tine as high as it would go and leapt off the machine diving headfirst into the hole a brilliant light nearly blinded him behind it he could see the bright yellow of calis contamination suit she slipped her lithe body through the tight aperture and when their fingers locked mercer wanted to give a shout of triumph slithering backward he guided her out of the hole as soon as they were clear cali ripped off her helmet mercer opened his mouth to warn her that the mine could be contaminated but he never got the words out because her incredible lips were pressed to his in a kiss that squeezed his heart im so sorry he breathed into her i had to do it shut up she panted and kissed him more fiercely they held each other in the dim light of the forklift for all eternity it seemed or a blink of an eye when they parted there was laughter in calis eyes professor ahmad is right you know you are predictable i knew you wouldnt leave me if i hadnt jumped out we would have both been trapped thats what i figured when i realized you were gone it must have been terrifying not really i said i knew youd come get me while i waited i checked the rest of the chamber mercer couldnt believe it when they realized they were trapped most people would have thrown themselves at the pile of rock or sat in the dark and cried themselves insane but not cali she went exploring i found the rooms where they stored the plutonium just as we calculated they had seventy barrels left the rooms were pretty big i think to keep the barrels segregated so the plutonium wasnt allowed to reach critical mass the walls had absorbed some radiation but nothing too bad ill avoid dental x rays for a year or two and ill be fine you are amazing mercer said pride catching in his throat she smirked at him and he could imagine her freckles glowing pink on her cheeks sometimes i am she kissed him again a brief yet promissory caress of her lips no sense taking any more chances lets make like a tree and blow i thought that was make like the wind and leave she laughed we could make like a japanese board game and go make like a leftwing web site and move on this time she groaned thats enough right the forklift died before reaching the mines entrance forcing them to walk the last half mile cali helping mercer because his knee still bothered him ludmilla was the only person waiting for them when they emerged from the stygian realm she gave a little snort when she saw them but her bovine expression didnt change great to see you too milly old girl mercer said to get a reaction he didnt she accompanied them down to the remains of the helicopter sasha was sitting up against a tree stump the pilot and the other scientist were dozing near the chopper it looks like it went well sasha said to greet them hit a little snag cali said airily no big deal where are professor ahmad and devrin egemen when the helicopter reported they were lifting off from samara they got in their vehicle and left sasha handed mercer a piece of paper he asked me to give you this mercer unfolded the note dear doctor i want to apologize for how i manipulated you and miss stowe into helping us my janissaries have defended the alembic for generations and if not for a conversation among lovers decades ago we would not have faced the crisis we have it is almost contained now thanks in part to you the rest is our responsibility i pray you will heed my advice and return to your lives satisfied with the knowledge you have contributed to a noble cause it was unsigned what do you think cali asked after she read it he crushed the piece of paper without the stele there isnt much we can do this side of digging up half of egypt the russians will handle the plutonium and popov too if im right about him he felt the heat of their kiss once again and looked into her eyes i guess we go back and resume our lives like he says exactly like it was before she said teasingly he took her hand i foresee a change or two arlington virginia by the time their connecting flight from frankfurt touched down at dulles airport thirtysix hectic hours had passed since cali and mercer were picked up at the mine by the russian military with no luggage except the bag of dutyfree jack daniels mercer had bought for his depleted bar they were through customs quickly ira had sent a government car to take them home theyd agreed earlier they would drop cali at her condo first it had been a grueling couple of days and the promise of a budding relationship couldnt overcome two exhausted wornout bodies mercer saw her to her door and together they checked out her cozy twobedroom to ensure no one had been there in her absence he felt like a teenager on a first date as they kissed under the porch light it was their first since the mine without the bulky contamination suit her longlimbed body was all bone and hard angles but fit perfectly in his arms their eyes were at almost the same level and neither closed them ill see you tomorrow cali asked and the day after that mercer promised i have to report in to nest in the morning then im taking a couple of days off and i dont have any contracts lined up for two weeks ill see you at noon the twentyminute drive to mercers brownstone passed in a contented blur the lights were on when he opened the door and he heard a voice he tensed momentarily before recognizing harry whites jackhammer laugh he climbed the spiral stairs up to the bar his knee feeling better but still noticeable as he passed through the alcove library and the french doors he heard another voice and laughed aloud calling booker sykes dont you get in the habit of drinking my booze too book and harry were sitting at the bar with a couple of drinks and a nearly depleted bowl of pretzels a baseball game playing on the big television held drags rapt attention like he was almost following the action mercer slapped booker on the shoulder i already know your trip was a bust sorry about that are you and your men okay whend you get back couple hours ago sykes said and there isnt anything wrong with us that some ice and a chiropractor cant fix what the hell do you mean bust i talked to the guy who blew up the stele shit man you are a pessimist he waved his beer bottle check it out mercer turned to see what he was talking about on the floor behind one of the couches were three large backpacks mercer flipped open the biggest one inside was a bunch of gray stones so exhausted by the past days he couldnt comprehend what he was seeing he lifted one of the rocks from the bag it was a lump of unremarkable granite about the size of a blackboard eraser one side of it had been poorly smoothed he looked closer at the tool marks his eyes widened hed never be able to decipher it without expert help but he clearly recognized an egyptian cartouche and hieroglyphic writing it wasnt blown up booker explained looks like they broke it apart with hammers or rifle butts rivers cieplicki and i humped out every piece bigger than a marble mercer was grinning like an idiot booker you have my permission to drink as much of my booze as you want he tried to lift the bag jesus this thing must weigh a hundred pounds the lightest was a hundred and seventyfive according to the airline which charged an extra four hundred bucks for the weight thats the reason i look like a question mark when i stand up mercer reached into the bag for another smaller piece his smile fading when he realized he was actually holding two chunks of a sevenfootlong sixhundredpound threedimensional jigsaw puzzle it would take months to put the stele back together if it was possible at all hey mercer check out behind the bar harry said from his stool huh mercer grunted distractedly he carefully set the pieces of stone back in the knapsack and stepped behind the mahoganytopped bar nothing seemed out of place what is it nothing just wanted you to make me another drink bastard mercer scowled as he freshened harrys jack and ginger and made a gimlet for himself how the hell are we going to put the stele back together that thing is in more pieces than humpty dumpty harry commented you guys ever wonder what made them think the kings horses could fix him no booker and mercer said in unison seriously harry went on there must be five or six hundred pieces most of them are freakin tiny and the ones i examined at all look pretty much the same mercer said ill call ira in the morning he might have an idea who can reassemble it there must be some forensic guys out there who have experience reconstructing bones maybe they can do something he didnt sound optimistic should we tell him booker asked harry he called me a bastard i say let him twist awhile longer tell me what booker kept looking to harry until the octogenarian threw up his arms i give up go ahead and tell him only youre no fun i spoke with admiral lasko as soon as we landed weve got a meeting at the goddard space flight center over in greenbelt maryland tomorrow morning at nine whats there from what ira tells me magic greenbelt maryland was on the opposite side of the nations capital from arlington and it took them two hours battling a nearly gridlocked beltway to reach the exit fortunately the goddard center was two miles from the i and mercer eased his jaguar convertible to the main gate with five minutes to spare next to the gate was the public visitors center where a couple examples of nasas earliest rockets were on display in an outdoor garden nice lawn ornaments booker remarked beats pink flamingos after checking their identification and making sure they were on the days visitors list a guard handed over two passes and directed them to a new building at the end of explorers road on the far side of the sprawling government research campus mercer parked in a large lot next to a storm runoff pond a trio of ducks was lazing in the early morning sunshine the building was an unremarkable brick affair with only a few windows high on its facade mercer and booker were met in the reception area by a twentysomething man in a white lab coat below it he wore black pants and a black tshirt mercer assumed it was his black miata among all the minivans and suvs in the parking lot he had slicked back dark hair and stylish glasses not the image of a government scientist mercer had pictured dr jacobi alan jacobi you must be dr mercer call me mercer they shook hands this is booker sykes hi call me alan he looked behind them do you have the samples theyre in the car do you have a trolley or anything oh sure ten minutes later they had the three bags in jacobis lab the room was at least fifty feet square packed with workstations computers and sleek humming boxes whose function mercer could only guess i have to say when i got the call from the white house yesterday i was pretty blown away i mean we dont do anything highpriority here what do you do as you know the goddard center is one of the leading research laboratories in the country for earth and space sciences we run expeditions all over the world and beyond for that matter my lab here deals with threedimensional holography and materials analyses were adapting it for medical research and possibly archaeology and you think you can help oh no doubt lets see what youve got mercer opened one of the backpacks and started removing fragments of the stele and setting them on a table jacobi picked up one of the bigger pieces a twentypound misshapen chunk of stone that resembled a head of broccoli this should work nicely for a demonstration he took the stone to a piece of equipment that looked like a microwave oven and set it inside he closed the door and turned to a nearby computer he spoke as he tapped at the keys what this machine does is scan a threedimensional object into the computer creating an exact digital reproduction down to one micrometer or one millionth of a meter wow mercer said thats nothing they use machines like this in hollywood all the time to turn clay models of monsters and spaceships and stuff into digital effects my machine is just a lot more precise he swiveled the screen to show them what the computer had created it looked exactly like the chunk of stone only the computer had rendered it in green jacobi made a few adjustments and the digital rock turned gray there so now what booker asked now i scan every piece of stone into the computer when im done i will tell it the approximate shape of the object and it will digitally put it all back together he waited for a reaction ah nows the time you say wow the fuzzy logic algorithms alone took me the better part of three years to perfect im asking the computer to make tens of millions of decisions by itself as to how to reassemble the digital pieces this is cutting edge stuff jacobi laughed what did you think i was going to glue this mess back together or something no not at all mercer said to hide the fact that thats exactly what he thought would happen a digital image is perfect how long will it take ill get a couple of post docs in here to do the scut work of imaging the fragments thatll take some time because the imagers are slow and we have to number each piece if you want to reassemble the real thing his voice rose in pitch as he finished his sentence as if asking if his team could avoid the tedium of cataloguing every fragment no i think you should number them we might need the actual artifact mercer just wanted the rebuilt stele he thought it would look great in the bar you got it then jacobi shrugged knowing he wouldnt be doing the work anyway you passed a cafeteria on your way to this building why dont you give us a couple of hours and well see what we come up with mercer and book sykes returned to jacobis lab at eleven thirty perfect timing the young scientist said to greet them were just about finished with the last small pieces the bits of the stele were lying on workbenches and atop equipment all of them were in individually numbered glassine envelopes like the police use for collecting evidence well done mercer smiled i forgot to ask what this thing looked like originally i was told it was a stele but i have no idea what that is a small obelisk it was about seven feet tall the computer can do the digital reassembly without knowing the parameters since theres only one way the bits and pieces fit exactly but knowing its size and shape will save a whole lot of computing power and time im finished with the last one a post doc said removing a chip of stone from the digital imager and slipping it into a clear envelope numbered eight hundred and sixtythree mercer decided hed hire someone to rebuild the stele for him okay then jacobi said from his desk he drew an obelisk using a wireless pen like that a bit skinnier got it he typed in the size seven feet and here we go mercer blinked and a realistic representation of the stele was on the screen in front of him he could plainly see the hieroglyphs covering all four sides as the image rotated in space holy shit how long would it have taken if you didnt know what it looked like oh god at least a minute jacobi replied smugly as jacobi zoomed in on the steles surface mercer could see where ahmad and his men had smashed it there were a few chips missing that either book didnt find or that had been powdered by the blows still there was more than enough to work with from what jacobi had been able to reconstruct mercer shook his hand thank you you did an amazing job i can see how this could help doctors map out how to rebuild broken bones and archaeologists to put ancient pottery back together truly remarkable i wish i could tell you why the government wanted something like this in the first place but its classified booker sykes smirked only reason is to put blast zones back together after an explosion to determine what type of bomb was used jacobi went pale how did you i mean thats you couldnt sykes clamped a big hand on the scientists shoulder dont sweat it man its the only thing that makes sense mercer and booker drove straight to the smithsonian mercer had called while jacobis people were imaging the stele and used his white house credentials to arrange for one of their top egyptologists to be waiting hed also left a voice mail for cali at nest telling her the hunt was on again a small woman in her sixties wearing a threadbare cardigan despite the rising heat was pacing the steps outside the museum of natural history where shed said shed meet them she saw them mounting the steps and descended toward them with quick birdlike movements do you have it she asked breathlessly youre sure it was placed by alexander the great do you know what a find this is i must study the actual stele she said all this in a rush her words blending together in her excitement you are dr mercer and mr sykes right mercer smiled thats right youre emily french yes ive already accosted two sets of tourists coming into the museum hoping they were you i just cant believe this there are so few new discoveries in ptolemaic egyptology anymore at least that the egyptians dont publish themselves first ptolemaic yes the time when egypt was ruled by the greeks to b c it ended with cleopatra who was actually cleopatra vii but no one would make movies about the first six oh listen to me im babbling lets go to my office and take a look shall we how can this possibly be a matter of national security she asked as she led them through the public part of the museum and into a warren of offices on the third floor this is an ancient artifact not the plans for a nuclear bomb or something mercer almost gasped at how closely shed guessed were not at liberty to discuss that maam book replied in his deepest baritone oh my she led them into her cramped and cluttered office making an apology for the mess as if it wasnt always so chockfull of books stacks of papers and knickknacks and mrs french mercer added you are not allowed to discuss this matter with anyone what i believe is written on the stele could change history and lead to one of the greatest archaeological discoveries since tutankhamen if i am correct and these findings are made public you will receive all due credit i assure you her enthusiasm waned until mercer slipped the computer disc into her laptop and the stele appeared on the screen she plucked a pair of large glasses from her desk and settled them on her tiny nose mercer showed her how to use the mouse as jacobi had taught him to manipulate the image and zoom in on specific spots its magnificent she breathed look there thats the sign for battle heres something about a burial a king perhaps she kept changing her point of view peering at the computer with her face only inches from the screen some of this is in ancient greek but heres a cartouche let me see it is about a kings burial thatsoh my lord she looked across her desk at mercer and book her eyes wide and owlish behind her glasses alexander the great booker said we know we believe the stele reveals the location of his tomb it was placed near an old mine in central africa after alexanders death his tomb her enthusiasm peaked again his actual tomb do you know how many people have searched for it over the years yes maam can you do a full translation of the stele mercer asked of course it will take me some time hieroglyphs are open to interpretation they tell a story more than lay out words like a sentence mercer handed her a business card from a goldandonyx case hed gotten as a gift years earlier from a petroleum heiress hed dated for a short time the number on the card was an answering service so he scribbled his cell and home numbers on the back you can call me day or night for dinner cali cooked mercer book and harry pasta carbonara which she claimed was her best recipe and which made the men fear her worst her disappointment that she couldnt be alone with mercer had given way to excitement when he explained what theyd done that day and showed her a copy of jacobis disc after the meal they settled in the bar with brandies still talking and speculating about the possibilities beyond the alembic alexanders tomb was rumored to be the richest most magnificent in history his crystalandgold sarcophagus was said to be the greatest work of art ever produced in the ancient world mercer was on his second snifter when his phone rang the conversation died with words still poised on lips hello i have good news and bad news emily french said without preamble okay mercer said drawing out the word hoping but trying not to it took her five minutes to explain her findings she summed up by telling him shed email the entire translation he gave her the address set the cordless back on the coffee table and roared with laughter the others stared at him but soon his laughter caught on and they started to chuckle and laugh along with him until harry finally said are you going to let us in on the joke mercer actually had to wipe tears from his eyes and take several deep breaths and still the laughter was in his voice it was there all right the tombs location yup he wasnt buried in alexandria or the sawi oasis as some scholars speculate they took his body south along the nile and buried him in a cave at the very head of a valley they called shuta so we go find this valley grab the alembic and put an end to this nightmare cali said not so fast mercer chuckled again emily french did some research on our behalf and discovered the exact location of the shuta valley in the process she learned that in it was submerged under about a hundred feet of water when they built the aswan high dam i still want to go see it for myself but she says the area is totally inaccessible the irony of it all made mercer break out in laughter all over again aswan egypt mercer couldnt help but recall the last time he was in egypt it had been a couple years earlier and he had spent two weeks cruising the nile with an eritrean diplomat named salome he hadnt seen or heard from her since making her memory just an enigmatic smile penny for your thoughts cali said they were seated by the pool of a luxury hotel on elephantine island right in the middle of the sluggish nile between them and the town of aswan tourist boats and lateenrigged feluccas plied the waters i was here once with somebody mercer replied refusing to cover the truth with a white lie no matter the consequences lucky girl cali said she comes here for a romantic getaway and im stuck chasing old tombs and dirty bombs he should have known cali didnt have a jealous bone in her body booker approached their table in a black tank top and khaki cargo pants cut off at the knee he made an imposing figure he eased himself into a seat mindful of his stilltender back we got us a boat terrific when mercer had told ira lasko about the tombs location the admiral had reported the findings to the president two hours later ira phoned mercer back telling him that they didnt want to involve the egyptian government just yet in truth they didnt want to involve them at all if they could help it by the terms of international law the tomb and everything within it belonged to egypt no one in the administration wanted to see another middle eastern nation with nuclear capabilities relations with cairo were good but that didnt mean they couldnt deteriorate in the future like so many other arab nations they had a minority population of fundamentalists eager to turn their country into a theocracy it was decided that mercer cali and booker would travel to egypt as tourists and reconnoiter the sunken valley first if possible the president wanted them to snatch the alembic a guided missile cruiser was being diverted from a courtesy call to cyprus and would transit the suez canal if they could get the alembic they could meet the vessel on the deserted coast of the red sea at that point the location of alexanders tomb could be revealed in such a way to politically benefit the united states if they couldnt retrieve the alembic covertly then it would be up to the diplomats to figure out the best solution although the head of the shuta valley was only a half mile from the shoreline of lake nasser mercer decided to use a boat rather than an aircraft to reach the sunken tomb they needed to bring a lot of equipment and he didnt trust any of the charter flight companies to keep their activities secret booker had gone out first thing this morning to find them a suitable vessel what is it mercer asked booker smiled broadly hope youre keeping a running tab on what the government owes you cause the only thing that would work for us is a riva mercer was familiar with the italian luxury boat builder and could just imagine the rental price how bad shes a sixtyfoot mercurius sleeps four and has a compressor for refilling scuba tanks provided extra of course according to the lease agent she has a top speed of forty knots and was only available because the german couple who had rented it this week ran into a little difficulty when the husband found the wife in bed with his business partner and because we dont want to use the owners crew the price is a paltry two grand a day cali winced admiral lasko will need to be awfully creative explaining this during his next budget hearing mercer slipped on his sunglasses when can we leave theyre topping the tanks right now they checked out of the hotel putting the three rooms on mercers amex and took the ferry to aswans riverfront corniche where hawkers immediately tried selling them statues postcards tshirts and assorted tourist geegaws there was a taxi stand near the main post office ten minutes later they were passing the aswan high dam a twomilelong concrete behemoth that held back the waters of the nile built at a cost of a billion dollars in the s it was financed partly by the soviet union in a political ploy to curry favor in the region and partly from revenue generated by the egyptians seizure of the suez canal to make way for the fifteenhundredsquaremile lake it would create nearly a hundred thousand nubians in northern sudan and southern egypt were relocated often to unsustainable lands twenty ancient temples and shrines were disassembled and rebuilt above the flood mark the most famous being abu simbel far to the south and the temple of philae near aswan countless more ancient sites were left for the inundation and an unknown number more would remain undiscovered because of the project while the dam did its job of preventing the nile from flooding its banks and wiping out villages all along its length it had also prevented nutrientrich sediment from reaching farms necessitating the import of a million tons of fertilizer per year the fragile nile delta was being slowly eroded away without the replenishment of dirt from the interior of africa and salt contamination from the mediterranean had reached as far south as cairo ten miles south of the dam they came to a marina mercer paid off the driver while booker hauled their luggage from the trunk the waters of lake nasser were deep blue and still hemmed in by desert hills sprinkled with the occasional palm it reminded mercer of lake powell in utah where the colorado river had been penned behind the glen canyon dam it wasnt yet ten in the morning but the sun was a sizzling torture baking the dry earth the egyptian leasing agent greeted booker like a long lost brother and ordered two marina workers to lug their bags to the jetty amid the houseboats waterski runabouts and hundredfoot tourist cruise ships the riva looked like a thoroughbred in a herd of shetland ponies she was beamy but her long rakish lines made her look like a javelin she had a small dive platform at her transom a white inflatable and an open cockpit over the main salon her hull was a deep black while her upperworks and radar arch over the cockpit were snowy white with a pair of man horsepower engines under her deck mercer didnt doubt her speed she looked like she was already on plane just sitting tied to the dock her name isis was painted in gold at her bows cali pecked booker on the cheek and threw mercer a look now you know how to treat a lady mercer would have gone for that rowboat over there yeah and made me row book laughed i wont tolerate a mutiny until were at least on the boat the slick leasing agent led them aboard and showed them the highlights he demonstrated how to remove the little inflatable from its concealed garage as well as the compressor and all the dive equipment the interior of the motor yacht was as elegant as the outside with sleek leather furniture marble in the two baths and silk sheets on the beds the galley was small but functional and the refrigerator was packed they were shown where extra stores were hidden in secret compartments throughout the salon mercer said he was satisfied when he found an assortment of liquor in one of the cabinets the agent had a wireless pointofsale device and happily swiped mercers card if he had any questions about two men and a single woman going out for a week alone on a floating bordello he kept them to himself just think of all the airline miles youre racking up booker said when this is all said and done ill have enough for a flight on the space shuttle the masters cabin in the bow had a queensized bed and private bath cali staked it for herself book had already tossed his bag into the other large cabin leaving mercer with a single bed tucked into a tiny room in a corner booker laughed at him and nodded at the closed master suite door damn man just go in there and do it already mercer grinned ruefully ive got the feeling if your sorry ass wasnt here id be invited booker shook his head and went for the stairs leading to the main deck muttering crazy white people mercer threw his duffel onto his bed and changed into shorts and a penn state tshirt cali emerged from her stateroom as he was about to join booker she wore sandals a brief pair of shorts and a bikini top her red hair fell over her shoulders in a shimmering cascade it was the most revealing mercer had ever seen her and his imagination hadnt done her body justice though her breasts were small they were perfectly shaped and proportional to her lean torso and her legs seemed to stretch forever her skin was flawlessly smooth and freckled im sorry about the sleeping arrangements she said shyly its just with booker hereyou know i wouldnt feel comfortable thats okay mercer said stepping close enough to smell the tropical sunscreen shed already applied if i didnt bring you to a screaming orgasm in the first five seconds hed never let me hear the end of it she slapped him playfully pig the leasing agent was still on the dock and without ever taking his eyes off cali he managed to cast off the lines when mercer fired the rivas engines after the engines had come up to temperature mercer bumped the throttles and eased the motor yacht from her berth there was a lot of boat traffic around the marina fishing boats mostly and a little cruise ship coming back from its regular sixday excursion to abu simbel mercer kept his speed to ten knots working the wheel to get used to how the boat responded it came as no surprise she was as nimble as a jetski a few tourists waved as they passed while fishermen either ignored them altogether or eyed them with illdisguised contempt when the boat traffic thinned as they reached the broad lake mercer began to edge the throttles the big boat reacted instantly as vessel and master tested each other and the more mercer asked for the more the riva wanted to give until they were planing across the water at thirtyeight knots he could hear calis laughter chiming over the bellow of the engines and the wind whipping past them i love boats she screamed her upper chest and throat were flushed her lips had plumped and reddened and her eyes had gone startlingly wide the adrenaline rush of speed had obviously aroused her mercer felt it too and once again he cursed bookers presence he looked over his shoulder booker had also noticed and he shot mercer a cocky wink they stayed well out of the regular shipping lanes used by the tourist boats so it seemed they had the lake to themselves mercer took lunch at the helm enjoying the chunks of flatbread smeared with hummus cali fed him and while beer had first been perfected in egypt thousands of years ago there were no modern breweries in the muslim country so he settled for an italian peroni from the fridge to wash it down booker and cali took turns spelling mercer at the wheel as the day wore on shed put on loose cotton pants and a top to protect herself from the sun a baseball cap taming her windtossed hair at six thirty they turned westward as if chasing after the sun as it sank toward the barren horizon it painted the desert surrounding the large bay they were entering in a hundred hues of red and purple mercer thought cali looked especially beautiful in its scarlet glow according to the boats gps the shuta valley was at the end of a long bay that cut into the nubian desert like a dagger the coastline was mostly sandstone bluffs that fell into the lake there were no inhabitants in this region no sign that anyone had ever lived here and the sparse vegetation clinging to the hills sage and camel thorn could only survive by absorbing evaporation off the lake they were entering an area as desolate as the moon and one even less well studied with five miles to go mercer inexplicably throttled back the engines why are you slowing cali asked he pointed ahead coming out of the sun another boat was cutting across the water toward them at this range it was impossible to tell what type of boat but mercer doubted the occupants were fishermen or tourists you know that scene in horror movies where someone always says theyve got a bad feeling about this yeah ive got a bad feeling about this booker came up from the galley where he was throwing together their dinner we there weve got company poli possibly he had time to take pictures of the stele when dayces men were tearing that village apart and this is the last place on earth he can get his hands on natural plutonium how do you want to play this book asked mercer ducked below the dash so the men approaching wouldnt see him poli doesnt know about you so maybe seeing a black face will throw them you two are tourists just cruising the lake on your honeymoon im going to hide he crawled to the stairs at the stern of the riva and vanished booker put his arm around cali when the other boat was a hundred yards off it was a twentyfivefoot speedboat painted a military gray there were two men in uniforms aboard and from his high vantage booker could see they had pistol belts strapped around their waists one said something that was carried away by the wind and made a gesture for booker to cut the power he idled the big engines to a low gurgle sup man sykes called down sounding like a hiphop artist the helmsman spoke in arabic again i aint diggin your rap man speak english there is military training in area you must leave booker looked around the deserted shoreline and said i dont see no trainin man how many are aboard your vessel just me and my ho the two boats had drifted close enough for one of the uniformed egyptians to leap onto the dive platform what the fu you think youre doin booker shouted the man still on the patrol boat pulled the automatic from his holster and pointed it up at books head booker raised his hands smiling now its cool man its cool no need to draw down on me you want to have a look at the boat you take your sweet time the soldier whod jumped aboard looked through the salon peering into closets and under beds he checked the two shower stalls and any storage bin large enough to hide a man and while the riva was a large boat its open floor plan meant his search only took a minute he emerged once again climbed up to the flybridge glaring at booker and cali then descended and leapt back to the patrol boat he spoke briefly with the helmsman shaking his head the helmsman brought a radio to his lips and spoke for a moment when he was finished he shouted back up to booker you will leave now booker flashed another wide smile you got it bro he rammed the throttles almost to their stops and spun the wheel the powerful wake rocked the smaller egyptian boat forcing the two men aboard to clutch the railing to keep from being tossed overboard booker eased back on the power and kept his attention straight ahead while cali surreptitiously studied the patrol craft it lingered for a couple of minutes where they had met presumably to make sure someone hadnt jumped from the riva to elude detection it then took off in the opposite direction to wherever they maintained their picket line mercer reappeared well after they were out of range of the patrol craft were still alive so it went okay huh where were you hiding cali asked i heard the soldier check everywhere down there the garage for the inflatable on the stern he walked right over me didnt even know it could open what do you make of them they claimed they were conducting military maneuvers in the area but they werent regular army cali shot him a look really could have fooled me the egyptian army patterns their uniforms on the british these guys were wearing us issue bdus and neither of them had any rank insignia and their gun belts didnt match also their boat was a civilian craft painted gray i could still see the white of her hull along the water line mercer went quiet for a moment their plan to sneak in and out was blown once again poli had beaten him to the prize for all he knew the oneeyed mercenary had had a team working in the desert since right after he saw the stele they could be moments away from finding alexanders tomb and the deadly alembic we need to see whats going on up there lake nasser egypt say again poli repeated into his handheld radio there were two people on the boat the patrol leader said over the crackling communications link a man and woman what was their nationality american mercer poli hissed under his breath was the man about six feet tall muscular but not big with dark hair and gray eyes no he was much bigger almost two meters very muscled and he had black skin a kaffir feines wasnt sure how he felt in a way he was disappointed it wasnt mercer surely he had realized the significance of the stele and gone back to photograph it and have the writing translated that would lead him straight here could it be the american had given up youre sure no one else was aboard he asked to the guard out on the lake yes tawfiq searched very careful okay let them go and tell them not to return yes sir poli clipped the radio back onto his belt around him was a small tent city housing for the fifty workers and guards mohammad bin alsalibi had arranged most were saudis or iraqis whod been trained at al qaida camps in pakistan and syria poli had gained their fear if not their respect his first day here when one of the guards spat at his feet when he was given an order feines had summarily shot the man on the spot telling the others through his translator that the guard hadnt been a martyr just an insolent fool who should have seen poli as an ally not the enemy when it became clear that the attack on novorossiysk had failed to produce the desired results salibi had practically begged for poli to find the alembic of skenderbeg for him the saudis pleas did nothing to move him but with the promise of an additional twenty million dollars feines had agreed telling salibi that there were no guarantees hed made his way to odessa where he caught a flight to cairo salibi had given him the name of an al qaida operative who could put together everything they would need including finding a translator to decipher the photographs hed taken of the stele of course the academic had to be killed to ensure his silence the biggest delay had been finding men with scuba experience once they realized the tomb was under lake nasser now that they were here they found that diving wouldnt be necessary sometime in the five centuries since skenderbegs men had returned the alembic to alexanders tomb an earthquake had cracked the sandstone hills that once towered over the flooded shuta valley many of these fractures were mere cracks in the earth but there was a long gouge that extended up from the lake the feature was too straight to be a natural phenomenon poli recognized immediately that there was a tunnel rising up from the bottom of the valley and the quake had collapsed part of its roof he set teams of men to begin digging at the top of the depression where he believed the tunnels ceiling had remained intact already they had dug down six feet just offshore the boat hed planned to use as a dive platform a fortyfoot houseboat theyd bought in aswan sat quiet theyd also bought two outboard boats to act as pickets to keep fishermen and others from the area poli saw mohammad bin alsalibi emerge from one of the tents with his darkly handsome features and traditional white robes he cut a dashing figure the men all stopped as he passed greeting him with deference or touching the hem of his robe they might all be fanatics but they knew who the money man was who was that on the radio salibi asked picketboat stopped a yacht about five miles from here just some tourists ah salibi looked around the encampment theyd accomplished an amazing amount of work in just a short time all the tents were up the kitchen was putting out meals and the men had already settled into their routines so how long do you think this will take i do not know the tunnel may be under another inch of sand or another fifty feet it is possible i am wrong altogether which means i will have to dive and look for the caves entrance you have to be prepared for the likelihood that it has been buried by the earthquake and may never be found allah will bless us i know it salibi gazed out across the bay and continued in a dreamy voice we failed in novorossiysk because the plan displeased him it wasnt a blow worthy of our abilities when you find the alembic we will strike at the very heart of our problem yeah and whats that poli asked curious at the depths of depravity salibi was capable of he fully understood that the saudi was doing this for political gain and economic advantage and not for some religious cause but how he could warp his motivations to convince himself he was doing gods bidding was fascinating turkey is the key their leaders are all godless secularists who care nothing for sharia the blessed laws of islam if we can make the people see that their government will not protect them they will rise up throw off the yoke of western influence and embrace their faith poli thought to himself thereby giving you the ability to cut off the million barrels a day that flows across the country in pipelines and use the bosporus as a choke point to prevent tankers from entering the black sea this is about saving the souls of the turks because they believe women should have rights and that the church and state should be separate this is about freeing a people and letting them know gods love i wish i could join the martyrs who will die in istanbul for their glorious deaths will lead to a revolution that will see islam elevated to its rightful place you plan to use the plutonium against istanbul yes it will be like in russia only this time we will not fail feines gave a little thought to the fourteen million people who lived in the city straddling the bosporus and shrugged whatever makes you happy in a secluded bay twenty miles from where theyd been stopped mercer killed the rivas engine and dropped the anchor the silence seemed to rush in on them after so many hours on the loud boat theyd already made their plans and used a satellite phone to apprise ira lasko of the situation he agreed they should reconnoiter the head of the bay before bringing anything to the president dinner was subdued as they ate in the cozy dining nook after the meal they changed into dark clothes mercer wondered if subconsciously theyd all known this could happen because each of them had brought clothing suitable for a night operation they waited another hour for the last rays of the sun to be snuffed out before hauling the small inflatable raft from the stern garage with the three of them plus one set of diving gear it was a snug fit and the little rubber boat sank almost to the gunwales their only weapons were a fourinch dive knife and a twopound hammer booker had found in the rivas tool box using a handheld gps they motored to within two miles of where theyd been stopped by the guards book was at the controls he slowed the little dinghy to an idle and they crept forward another mile this is good mercer whispered book drove the inflatable onto a beach and he and mercer dragged it out of the water bring the tanks or leave them there was sixty pounds of equipment to lug another couple of miles over the rough desert but with three of them they could spread the load leave em for now we can always come back later they walked single file and widely spaced with his years of military experience booker took point and mercer had the drag slot book took them inland about a half mile in case poli had men watching the shore with the gps there was no chance they could get lost the ground was mostly sand and small rocks easy enough in the daylight but a misplaced step could turn an ankle and it wasnt until the landscape was bathed in the milky glow of the halfmoon that they started to make time there were no sounds except the gentle wind and their own careful footfalls an hour into the march book raised his hand and lowered himself to the ground such was his skill that it was as if hed vanished mercer had seen the spot where he had been standing a second earlier but now there was no sign of his friend he and cali paced forward in a crouch until they came to a shallow wadi that hadnt seen a flood in a century peering over the far bank of the old streambed mercer saw the moons reflection on the lake a dancing white line that stretched to the horizon nearer he saw lights and quickly made out an encampment he counted a dozen tents anchored near the shore was a speedboat identical to the one book said the guards had used and a larger boat farther out in the bay it looked like there was a guard aboard it manning a heavy machine gun the sounds of men talking wafted above the rumble of a generator book handed mercer the binoculars hed been carrying looking closer he spotted armed men on patrol walking the perimeter of the compound and another guard stationed near the speedboat a few men sat in a loose circle listening to another by the listeners expressions mercer could see the speaker held them spellbound nothing short of an air strike is going to take them all out booker whispered his mouth so close to mercers ear he could feel his breath mercer just nodded he was looking at a spot where polis men were digging into the side of the hill that rose at the head of the bay the excavation was lit by floodlights and the men worked in teams hauling buckets of sand and loose dirt from the hole mercer saw that their work was at the apex of a straight trench that ran down to the waters edge by mentally extending the line mercer realized it went directly to the bottom of the valley exactly where the stele said theyd find the entrance to alexanders tomb he thought back to his visit to egypt years earlier hed toured the valley of the kings with salome and he recalled that the ancient egyptians had dug long tunnels into the mountains in order to bury their pharaohs he imagined what the shuta valley would have looked like before the aswan dam had filled it with water it would have mildly resembled the fabled burial place of egypts kings so was it possible that alexanders men had ordered the excavation of a tunnel only instead of descending into the mountains his had risen from the valley floor theyre going to have the alembic by tomorrow or the next day he said softly and explained his suspicions for a tunnel collapse to show on the surface like that it cant be more than ten or fifteen feet deep what are we going to do thatll be up to ira theres nothing the three of us can do against that army down there what if there were more than three the voice had come from behind them mercer whirled around bringing up the knife in a lightning move ibriham ahmad had approached so silently that even booker hadnt heard him he wore his trademark black suit even in the desert though he prudently wore a dark shirt and tie behind him were five more men they wore dark camouflage and combat harnesses loaded with ammunition pouches all carried several hightech automatic weapons mercer recognized ahmads protege devrin egemen the young man bobbed his head shyly in greeting when he met mercers gaze even bedecked with an arsenal of weaponry mercer couldnt see the young scholar as a fighter i should have known youd find a way ahmad told mercer his admiration was clear even though he whispered and i should have known you lied to me about not knowing the location of alexanders tomb somehow mercer wasnt surprised ahmad was here how long have you been here ive had two men camped above the tombs entrance since feines first approached me months ago i myself arrived this afternoon you know hes going to find the tomb quickly ahmad looked shamefaced i never realized the significance of that trench until poli started digging i had hoped to bring more men but we are attacking tonight are you out of your mind cali hissed there are fifty or sixty of them and only six of you caribe dayce had more than a hundred ahmad replied mercer remembered the savagery of that counterattack as he and cali awaited execution and he estimated dayce had at least a hundred and fifty fighters ahmads team had killed them to a man in minutes that was just the six of you he couldnt believe it actually devrin was in istanbul we were only five dr mercer the janissaries are a military order weve trained for warfare our entire lives mercer told me about what you did in africa booker said taking out a bunch of drunk and drugged up teenagers isnt the same as going up against fifty battlehardened terrorists we dont have a choice ahmad said simply this ends now its suicide cali said you know what these fanatics are capable of theyll blow themselves up if they think they can get just one of you hes right cali mercer said theres no other option he couldnt believe what he was about to say when he turned back to ahmad im in whats your plan before ahmad could outline his strategy there was a loud cry from polis camp everyone in the wadi looked to where the workers were digging into the hillside several of them were dancing in tight circles cheering and raising their shovels over their heads in triumph when nearby guards realized the diggers had succeeded in burrowing down to the tunnel they fired triumphant bursts of gunfire into the air one of them ran off toward the tents mercer followed him with his eyes even before he arrived at one set a little apart from the others poli emerged he was wearing just pants and desert boots his chest was very pale in the dim light but the breadth of it defied imagination his arms looked as thick as tree trunks and hung from shoulders as broad as a hangmans gallows he started jogging up the hill to the excavation the man who had been giving a lecture to some of the terrorists stood in a swirl of robes and crossed the desert in polis wake shit theyve broken through ahmad wasnt watching the workers celebrating their success he studied the man in the robes his mouth set in a grim line fiery anger behind his dark eyes alsalibi thats the guy funding the operation cali asked the one who works for opec he is using islam as a tool to increase his wealth and power devrin said with as much hatred as his master poli waded into the cheering throng shouldering aside qaida fighters until he was at the top of the hole alsalibi joined him a moment later slapping the big mercenary on the shoulder a broad smile on his face even feines looked pleased with himself for coming up with this plan to gain easy entrance to the tomb you did it my friend salibi said to congratulate him salibi would never be his friend but poli let the comment pass the hole was four feet square and sand poured over the sides into the darkness the sides of the tunnel below were dressed with stone laid in neat blocks playing the beam of a flashlight over their surfaces poli could see they were covered in hieroglyphs he couldnt see the floor of the tunnel because it was flooded water that must have seeped through the rock over the eons and become trapped he called for a rope once an end had been tied around a nearby boulder poli tossed the other end into the fissure he climbed down using just the strength of his arms as he reached the still surface he tentatively lowered himself into the cool water feeling for the floor with his foot when he touched bottom the water was as high as his upper chest the tunnel had to be fifteen feet tall and at least as wide aiming his beam downslope he could see the loose rubble of where the roof had partially collapsed there were gaps in it where the ceiling slabs had only crashed partway to the floor as he pointed the flashlight up the gentle grade the beam of light was swallowed by darkness the tunnel could climb another two hundred feet before reaching the top of the hill he ordered that the construction lights ringing the pit be lowered into the tunnel and for more wire to be readied he also ordered someone back to his tent for a shirt his geiger counter and a set of scuba tanks in case they needed them it took ten minutes to get everything in place alsalibi had changed into more practical clothes and joined him in the ancient tunnel along with two of his most trusted fighters every square inch of the walls and the ceiling where it hadnt collapsed were covered in twothousandyearold glyphs depicting the egyptian creation stories and commemorating alexanders journey through death the natural pigments were as fresh and vibrant today as the day the master artisans had applied them one of the fighters nudged his comrade to show him how he could scratch out the faces of the gods with his trench knife they shared a laugh at the senseless desecration poli tied the scuba tanks to the rope and started up the tunnel carrying one of the halogen lights high over his head in his wake the shorter saudis were forced to half walk and half swim to stay with him we have to act now ibriham said they will load the alembic onto a boat as soon as they bring it to the surface we have a boat of our own you do excellent how long will it take to get it mercer thought through the timing added a thirtyminute cushion and glanced at his watch by two am the boat might be necessary ibriham mused mercer shifted his gaze to cali can you do it she looked defensive trying to protect me again mercer was he didnt want her anywhere near the fighting theyd been lucky so far but this went beyond anything theyd faced since meeting in africa having her with them when they took on polis men wouldnt make a dent in the odds so there was no sense putting her in danger then he asked himself if he was doing it for her or him he remembered tisa lying bloody in his arms as they were lifted off a sinking ship by a rescue helicopter she never heard him say he loved her do you really want to be here if our attack fails do you no but i feel a responsibility here and you dont think i feel it too cali shot back cali this isnt about protecting you i lost someone i cared very deeply for i cant go through that again she touched his cheek tenderly ill do it but mercer im not her and you cant always be there as my knight in shining armor okay thank you was all he could say ill come charging in at exactly two oclock ibriham said to her if you see one of their boats attempting to escape stop them with a whispered order from him one of his men gave her an automatic pistol while others handed over some of their weapons and ammunition to mercer and booker sykes cali gave mercer one last look but didnt kiss him good luck you too man youve got yourself a handful booker remarked quietly after she faded into the darkness with books gps she is one fiery redhead mercer said nothing trying to put the awkward exchange out of his mind and focus on what lay ahead he didnt care that they were standing feet away from perhaps the greatest treasure in human history the value of which was incalculable in the monetary sense even more important was the insight the tomb would give on perhaps the greatest military mind who ever lived alexander the great had singlehandedly drawn the map of the ancient world establishing boundaries that were still in effect today all mercer thought about at that moment was preventing poli feines and his sponsor from getting their hands on the alembic of skenderbeg let the archaeologists have their day when it was over tonight was about preventing genocide whats your plan he asked ibriham again ten minutes before miss stowe is to return we attack the compound what just a frontal assault ibriham nodded mercer and book exchanged a look and shook their heads booker said we can do better than that by one thirty the revelry infecting the camp had yet to die down men still talked animatedly as they peered into the hole no doubt excited by the promise of so much death only a few had drifted back to the tents where they were kept awake by celebratory gunfire mercer and devrin were in position fifty yards from the kitchen while booker had made his way around the encampment toward the lakes edge his job was to take out the houseboat if he failed the guard on board could turn the camp into a slaughtering ground with the machine gun theyd mounted on the boats rail for the first time in his life mercer found he was eager for a fight he wanted revenge on poli on alsalibi and on the men who thought wholesale destruction was their gods greatest desire the adrenaline pumping through his body was as familiar and rousing as an addicts drug of choice even with the darkness he felt he could see perfectly he could feel the barest whisper of the breeze against his skin and hear the muted lapping of wavelets on the shore he could smell the spices from the kitchen as though he were standing at the stove the gun ibriham had given him was a heckler and koch hk a compact millimeter assault carbine with a detachable millimeter grenade launcher in the pockets of his cargo pants he carried four extra twentyround magazines and two additional grenades although unfamiliar with this particular weapon he was more than confident of his abilities with it he checked his watch for the fifth time in five minutes more anxious than nervous booker would be slipping into the water about now he looked toward the lake but couldnt see his friend whose skin blended with the night keeping low so only his eyes appeared above the surface booker sykes moved easily through the water the houseboat was only fifty yards from shore and while the gunner was still awake he wasnt looking around the craft only at the celebration he was certainly disappointed to miss book cut a wide circle around the boat to come at it from the seaward side light spilled from a window on this side of the boxy vessel and he could hear arab music being played on a cassette deck he edged closer to the stern away from the guard the boat was woodenhulled and slimy he reached for the railing that circled the low deck moving slowly so water didnt drip from his clothes rather than heave himself up he slipped a leg through the railings stanchions and slowly rolled onto the deck he made no sound and his motions had been so smooth that his added weight didnt rock the flatbottomed houseboat the square superstructure took up most the deck space leaving a narrow catwalk ringing three sides of the boat only the back deck where the machine gunner stood vigil was open space booker padded aft ducking when he reached the lighted window moving a millimeter at a time he positioned himself so he could see through the grimy glass two arabs were at the dining table reading their korans while a third was asleep on a threadbare sofa booker eased himself down again hed expected there would be more than one man on the houseboat but he hadnt expected four and he didnt know if anyone was asleep in the cabins during a combat mission booker was able to keep a precise clock ticking in his head so he knew the time almost to the second he had two minutes before ahmads men broke cover and started their assault he didnt know how many men hed killed in his military career in just one night in mogadishu he estimated a hundred rebels had fallen under his guns but the ones he remembered eleven of them were the ones hed taken with a blade his nightmares were filled with every detail of their deaths from the smell of their last meals to the heat of their blood he could still feel the stubble on his palm from the sentry hed taken at a drug lords hacienda he could still hear the wheeze of air when he severed the throat of a north korean sailor guarding a minisub packed with explosives and their eyes the eyes were always with him asleep or awake slowly so it made no more sound than an infants sigh he withdrew the knife given to him by one of the janissaries mercer slithered under the side of the kitchen tent hed heard only one man snoring inside with the moon nearly set the tent was pitch black he waited a moment for his eyes to adjust there was a gentle glow from the stoves pilot light that allowed him to discern the layout of the tent there were actually two stoves several large plastic drums of water and serving tables a cot was against one wall a single figure sprawled under the sheet the cooks clothes lay in a pile next to a small prayer rug an ak hung from the tent pole moving silently mercer approached the bed he found the mans kaffiyeh he had no idea how to properly wear the traditional headscarf so he just draped it over his head and wrapped the tails to hide his face he checked his watch one minute though the man was part of a terrorist cell he was just a cook mercer imagined hed been given these duties because he wasnt a capable fighter and no matter how mercer tried to rationalize it in his head he simply couldnt kill him in cold blood so when he smashed the butt of his hk into the mans skull he checked his swing just enough to render him unconscious he bound the cooks wrists behind his back with the kalashnikovs sling and was just about to stuff a greasy rag into his mouth when he sensed motion he whirled bringing up his assault rifle but it was only devrin you are taking too long he saw what mercer had done and quickly strode over to the side of the bed he looked down at the unconscious cook then glanced at mercer this is why you will never defeat them he said and unceremoniously plunged a knife into the cooks chest they ask for no quarter so you shouldnt give it he wiped the blade on the sheet resheathed the knife and together they exited the back of the tent booker came to the edge of the superstructure there was about eight feet of open deck between him and the machine gunner he had twenty seconds he crept forward lifting his feet no more than a fraction of an inch from the astroturfed deck book came to within a foot of the guard and he still hadnt felt his presence he kept leaning against the rail and watching the celebration on shore sykes was grateful hed never see the arabs eyes he moved no slower or faster in those final seconds simply took another practiced step and prepared to reach around the guards head with one hand while the knife in the other was poised to open his throat a casual voice called from the open door to the cabin the guard turned to answer he saw booker no more than a foot away with reflexes honed through decades of training booker lashed out even before the guard realized what he was seeing sykes drove the blade into the arabs neck and ripped outward tearing through muscle and blood vessels so nearly half his throat was slashed open blood fountained from the ragged wound splashing across the deck and into the water the man inside called again booker let the body fall and tried to swivel the russianmade fiftycaliber so it pointed at the cabin door but the gimbal only moved through thirty degrees another guard appeared at the doorway booker threw his knife in a desperation toss because the weapon wasnt balanced for throwing the butt end hit the bridge of the mans nose breaking the delicate bones as he reeled back roaring in pain booker kicked at the machine gun and grunted when it swung freely to get the proper angle he had to jump over the rail and hang off the side of the boat his finger found the trigger as a third guard appeared at the door booker was ahead of schedule by eleven seconds but there was no help for that now he pulled the trigger and the big gun came alive in his hands empty brass casings arcing into the night the heavy slugs blew the guard back through the doorway ripped the door off its hinges and shredded the cheap wood superstructure unable to see where the other gunman was inside the houseboat booker let go of the railing and dangled by his grip on the machine gun even with the superior firepower he knew he was too exposed to counterfire from inside the boat or an astute sniper on shore he crossdrew the beretta pistol ahmad had given him and aimed at the fiftycalibers ratcheting bolt before he pulled the trigger a pair of guns opened up from inside the cabin there had been more men than booker had seen with bullets whizzing by book fired five rapid shots the machine gun fell silent as the bolt jammed in the ruined receiver the plan had been to use the weapon to cover ahmads assault but he had to settle for denying polis men from using it themselves he took a deep breath as he dropped off the boat and began swimming away from the craft a good five feet under the surface so he would create no wake as soon as he heard the machine gun out on the houseboat bellowing its deadly tattoo mercer started running boldly across the camp he wasnt dressed exactly like the arab fighters but he hoped the kaffiyeh would give him anonymity the men had instantly ended their reverie and reached for their weapons their gaze directed at the dark houseboat mercer was halfway to the sheltered hole theyd dug down to the tunnel when ibriham ahmads janissaries engaged two of them appeared on the hill above the encampment as if defying the qaida terrorists they took down several of the confused men before anyone even saw they were there in seconds thirty aks roared as one and the crest of the hill disappeared in a hail of gunfire and kicked up dirt mercer could only trust ahmads men as they caught the arab fighters in a withering crossfire the ground exploded at his feet as bullets flew in every direction he had another thirty yards to go when the officers began to organize their men behind natural cover positions their return fire became more disciplined and mercer could only detect three of ahmads men still in the fight so far no one had paid him any attention but there were two men guarding the excavation who hadnt left their posts they stiffened as mercer came closer he tried to shield his face but the wary men started to raise their weapons mercer kept on running gesturing wildly and shouting gibberish his ruse worked to a point neither man fired but neither did they lower their assault rifles mercer was five feet away from them when he staggered as he pretended to trip he swung the barrel of his hk just enough to put a round through one of the guards chests the other man reacted a fraction slow and mercer rammed into him with all his strength the two of them crashed to the ground just at the edge of the pit with their guns sandwiched between them their faces were inches apart mercer could see the mad fanaticism in the other mans eyes like the glassy stare of a fever patient the terrorist shouted something about allah and fired his ak the heat as the gun discharged seared the flesh of mercers stomach and the blood that pooled between them was as viscous as oil the guards mouth split into a filthy smile but then his expression changed mercer nimbly pushed himself off the terrorist his clothing was sodden with blood but apart from the burned skin he was unharmed the guard looked down the length of his body and saw the barrel of his assault rifle pointing up into his own chest in seconds the murderous light faded from his eyes in an attempt to kill them both hed only managed to commit suicide you cant be a martyr if you dont kill your enemy mercer said and heaved himself over the precipice into the tunnel hed been prepared to hit the water because hed seen poli bring dive equipment but he nearly impaled himself on the scuba gear dangling from the rope the sound of the raging gun battle was muted by the stonework even when he heard a grenade explode it was little more than the sound of distant thunder with no light to guide him mercer started up the long tunnel keeping the hk over his head after twenty feet he couldnt hear the fighting at all which meant poli and salibi didnt know about the assault preserving his element of surprise hed gone fifty yards when he tripped over a set of steps hidden under the water as he climbed he became aware of light ahead a ghosts glow as feeble as a guttering candle his hands unconsciously tightened on his rifle he left the water completely at the top of the stairs and saw that the tunnel turned ninety degrees mercer approached cautiously peering around the corner with his cheek almost touching the floor this had to have been as much wire as poli had brought because the powerful flood lamp sat in the middle of a vast chamber the ceiling lofted thirty feet over mercers head supported by tight ranks of sandstone columns fashioned in the shape of palm trees it was typical ancient egyptian architecture they knew they didnt need that many supports for the ceiling but the design was to depict a dense and bountiful forest the sides of the room were hidden in shadow but the parts close enough for mercer to see were covered in hieroglyphs straining to hear anything mercer almost laughed aloud when he thought the immense space was as silent as a tomb he slid into the chamber keeping close to the walls he had passed twenty columns when he spotted something glinting in the darkness mercer forgot himself for a moment as he stared at the object it was a marble statue of a man holding a short sword in his right hand in the other was a ball of rope that had been sliced in two mercer realized this was alexander the great after he had cut the impossible to untie gordian knot fulfilling the prophecy that he would one day rule asia he continued on on the opposite wall from where hed entered was another open portal wavering light spilled from the next room of the tomb complex the room was smaller than the first the ceiling a bit lower and there werent as many columns flames danced atop several low bronze braziers the oil that poli had poured from the earthen amphorae could still burn after twenty centuries as stunned as mercer had been by the statue this room revealed something even more remarkable he immediately thought of chester bowie and his crazy ideas there were eight dioramas set up in the room each one depicting a different monster from mythology a towering manshaped giant had a rib cage made of some large animal a horse or cow but its head mercer realized was the pelvic bone of a creature he wasnt familiar with a prehistoric cave bear or maybe some kind of giant sloth he recognized the skeleton of a griffin a fabled creature with the body of a lion and the head of an eagle the body was that of a large extinct cat but its eagle head was the armored frill of a triceratops beyond it alexanders artisans had created a threeheaded snake the heads were from some kind of dinosaur like a raptor or another flesh eater the teeth were four inches long everything was held together with bronze braces and wire as expertly assembled as anything in a natural history museum today bowie had been right that the creatures out of mythology were the ancients way of making sense of the bones theyd discovered of animals that had long ago gone extinct they didnt know what parts fit with what so they made it up as they went along producing fantastical creations and the stories to go along with them mercer wasnt sure what impressed him morethe imagination it took to put together such marvelous creatures or the fact that an obscure professor from new jersey had figured out the truth there came a sudden jolt and bits of sand rained from the ceiling mercer shook his head to bring himself back to reality something massive had exploded on the surface and for a moment he was sure cali had arrived only to have the riva blown out of the water by an rpg but the explosion had been much closer and for it to shake the ground it couldnt have occurred on the water he heard voices from the next chamber he moved behind one of the dioramas a massive skeleton with elephant tusks for ribs seconds later a terrorist with a thick beard hurried past carrying a flashlight heading for the exit tunnel mercer waited in the shadows for him to return he came back a minute later sprinting through the gallery and into the next room shouting incoherent arabic as he ran in english mercer heard poli roar mercer could barely hear the words someone has collapsed the tunnel we are trapped on shore about two hundred yards from the al qaida camp booker had cached the machine pistol given to him by a janissary he climbed out of the lake and found the weapon hidden in a tangle of dried grasses just as a searchlight on the houseboat snapped on the beam turned the darkened shore into daylight just a few feet from him a second gunman kept his weapon trained on the ground illuminated by the light there was nothing book could do about the wet trail hed left on the beach so he waited more exposed than hed have liked the beam brushed past the wet sand paused and returned the two men on the bow of the houseboat jabbered excitedly pointing a third man emerged from a door that led to the pilothouse all three raised their weapons book fired first the range was long for the stubby machine pistol and rounds just sprayed the boat randomly their return fire was much more accurate he dove to his right to get away from where his fire had attracted their aim bullets peppered the ground all around him as he combat rolled a dozen times never losing his bearings his movements kept giving away his location on the open beach and the firing intensified sykes knew he didnt have a prayer a streak of light shot from the hill above the camp followed by a sharp whistle the rocketpropelled grenade fell a little short of the houseboat hitting the lake at its side in an eruption of water that doused the three fighters book used the distraction to lunge to his feet and start running the terrorist hed seen manning the light saw him dash into the darkness and opened fire again walking his bullets up bookers trail he felt a bullet pass between his legs knew the next one was coming for his spine and threw himself to the left he hit the rocky earth rolled once and was back on his feet in an instant but the torn muscles in his back sent searing lances of pain radiating in all directions his attempt to sprint away from the lake was little more than a drunken hobble and he came under fire almost immediately a second rpg slashed though the night flying in a flat trajectory that sent it into the houseboat just aft of the bridge it exploded and the houseboat disintegrated the superstructure was peeled apart like an orange fire erupting from the jagged seams as chunks of wood and metal rained down across the lake two of the gunmen were killed instantly their backs flayed open by shrapnel the third was blown off the boat and could have survived had there not been thirty pounds of rusted chain lodged in his abdomen he hit the water and sank like a stone booker turned and started limping back toward the compound the battle was the most intense hed ever seen the two sides were exchanging fire at a staggering pace he ultimately knew it was unsustainable the janissaries had only brought what they could carryat most a couple hundred rounds each polis men had arrived with a near limitless supply the simple truth was the janissaries would be out of ammunition long before the qaida forces he paused behind some cover to study the killing field there were still twenty men firing up into the hills and he could see an officer organizing a patrol of another ten men to try to outflank the janissaries of ahmads troop of six he was only sure that three were still in the fight then he spotted a fourth it was ibriham himself somehow hed found a gap in the qaida perimeter and was crawling toward the excavated section of tunnel from the turks perspective he couldnt see that there were two new men guarding the hole hed stumble right into them blindly behind booker was a twentyfoot sandstone cliff he slung the machine pistol over his shoulder reached for a handhold and hauled himself off the beach the agony in his back was like a hot coal lodged in his spine he gritted his teeth against it lifting himself another eighteen inches on stubbornness alone sheets of sweat bathed his body and he could feel tears rolling down his cheeks he found another toehold braced himself for the pain and lifted himself higher up the sandstone face nauseous saliva flooded his mouth and a whimper escaped his lips fearing he was doing permanent damage to his body booker thrust aside concerns for himself and fought on it took him five minutes to scale the cliff and when he rolled over the top he wanted to lie there and let the pain wash over him instead he got to his feet and surveyed the battle from his elevated perch a pile of dirt was all that separated ahmad from the men guarding the pit and still he hadnt seen them the range was nearly three hundred and fifty yards bookers massive chest heaved and his heart was racing he raised the machine pistol but his hands shook so badly he couldnt get a sight picture one of the guards spotted ibriham he pointed and was going for his weapon dear jesus dont fail me now book tensed every muscle in his body for a second drew down again and opened fire letting instinct guide his aim the first two rounds went wide the third drilled the guard though the thigh spinning him in place and dropping him the fourth and fifth hit the second guard center mass the bullets slowed enough that they ricocheted through his body shredding his internal organs book put the sixth through the wounded guards head just as ahmad rolled over the pile of excavated earth he didnt acknowledge his guardian angel he fumbled with a knapsack hed carried to the pit and disappeared down the hole leaving the bag behind booker knew that cali should be arriving any second and even as he thought it he looked up the dark bay and could see the white of the rivas upper hull she had idled the boat far enough out so she could react to a speedboat coming from the encampment but not too close to draw attention as much as he knew she wanted to be in the fight she knew how to take orders and do her job he had turned back to study the battle and see where he needed to help the attack when the knapsack ahmad had left near the tunnel entrance exploded the bag had to have contained thirty pounds of plastic explosives because the blast was massive the fireball lit the head of the bay like a second sun as it climbed into the night fighters within fifty feet of the explosion were killed by the concussion scrambling their insides others a little farther were scythed down by debris their bodies lying as limp as rag dolls in the fading light of the diminishing fireball booker could see that the tunnel entrance had been obliterated ahmad had sealed the tomb to prevent polis escape poli and salibi emerged from the farthest reaches of the tomb complex to see for themselves the two guards followed in their wake mercer couldnt guarantee taking them all so he let them go as soon as they retreated to the first room he dashed into the space where theyd been the oil lamps burning all around the chamber revealed it to be smaller still and unlike the others there were just a few columns instead the room was filled with the possessions alexander would need in the afterlife there were boats made of wood and reeds tents and furniture there were several chariots and countless chests that would contain such household items as bowls and utensils unlike tutankhamens tomb there was very little gold for alexander hadnt been a man bent on material wealth instead his tomb was filled with all manner of weaponsswords by the hundreds javelins and lances shields and helmets as well as bows and slings alexanders generals had provided him everything he would require to outfit the army he would need for his military conquest of heaven mercer wouldnt let his attention focus on the golden sarcophagus sitting on a raised dais at the front of the room with its panels of rock crystal shaved so fine they were as transparent as glass or the mummified body within instead he looked at the large bronze drum that had been taken down from a niche in the wall its surface was dented and pitted from having been dragged all over the ancient world and later used in battles in europe the alembic of skenderbeg was about six feet tall and four wide and was covered in ancient greek script the two chambers were separated by a complicated mechanism that prevented the active plutonium from coalescing there was something ominous about the device that went beyond mercers knowledge of what it did he sensed the alembic as a presence in the room with him not alive exactly but aware he could tell that it wanted to be found that it wanted to be taken from this place so it could unleash its deadly radiation on a new world the hairs on mercers arms stood erect when he realized he was in the presence of pure evil the sound of gunfire echoed through the tomb mercer whirled as one of the guards burst into the burial chamber mercer was a fraction of a second slow reaching for his assault carbine the guard fired a snap burst from his ak the rounds stitched alexanders sarcophagus shattering the delicate panes of crystal and powdering the mummified remains mercer dove as the string of bullets cut through the air toward him and came up hard against the wheels of a chariot he slithered under the ornate vehicle as the terrorist started taking better aim the filigreed wood splintered as it was savaged by the assault mercer got to his knees and fired through the spoked wheel catching the gunman in the legs the guard kept his finger on the trigger as he fell the wild spray tore apart more of the chariot and sparked off the stone floor where mercer knelt his hk virtually exploded in his hands when a lucky bullet slammed into the receiver the ak fell silent when the bolt came down on an empty chamber the terrorist had fired through the entire magazine mercer jumped to his feet before the guard could reload he snatched a short sword from the pile nearby and vaulted over the chariot for a moment he didnt understand what the wounded guard was doing the object in his hands wasnt the distinctive curve of a kalashnikov magazine it was round then he saw the beatific smile the guard yanked the pin of the grenade and held it to his chest mercer had five seconds and knew it wouldnt be enough to get clear of the blast radius he rushed forward and without pause swung the sword down onto the prone figure the ancient weapon held a keen edge and the terrorists head jumped free in an eruption of blood and escaping air mercer scooped the grenade from his lifeless fingers and with an underhanded toss flipped it over the sarcophagus the explosion destroyed the rest of the priceless casket and sent alexanders remains into the air like so much dust but the blast wave passed harmlessly over mercer where he lay with his head cradled in his arms he got up and blinked the gunfire in the next room sounding distant to his tortured hearing he shot a concerned look at the alembic and breathed a sigh when he saw it hadnt been hit by the fragmentation grenade he grabbed the fallen kalashnikov and searched the corpse for more magazines cursing when he realized the man hadnt been carrying any alexanders burial chamber was a storehouse of stateoftheart weapons for their day but they were worthless against automatic rifles mercer could only hope that however many janissaries followed him into the tunnel could take care of the remaining three killers then he saw the bows one in particular caught his eye the wood was glossy smooth and it had a handle of inlaid ivory it was a magnificent weapon surely alexanders own hanging from its tip was a bowstring of tightly wound wire mercer took up the ancient weapon reversed it and tried to bend it to hook the string on the top notch he could barely cause it to flex he repositioned himself and pressed with all his strength throwing his weight on the bow and digging in with his feet the tough wood dug into his chest as it bent ever so slightly mercer ignored the pain and redoubled his efforts slowly the weapon bent curling downward so the loop on the string was tantalizingly close to the notch but mercer couldnt get it that last half inch he felt his body weakening and the half inch gap grew to an inch then two he wasnt up to the challenge only alexander himself had ever managed to string the mighty bow what made him think he could handle the weapon of a god yet mercer refused to give up he pressed all the harder closing the gap once again he drew a deep breath strained with everything he had and the loop touched the top of the bow and then slid over the notch mercer relaxed and the wire held he marveled at the weapons balance and how the handle fit perfectly in his hand the quiver for the arrows was a bronze tube its strap had rotted away eons ago so he improvised one with the sling of the ak he nocked an arrow and tried to draw the string back the muscles in his chest and shoulders taking the strain no matter how hard he pulled he could only get the bow to about half cock not wanting to become trapped in the dead end burial chamber mercer made his way to the exit in the diorama room he could see tongues of flame shooting out from the darkness as poli and his men fired at the unseen janissaries he padded silently around the perimeter of the chamber keeping to the shadows away from the burning braziers as he sought a target a long burst of autofire to his left caught his attention he could just make out a man on the other side of three of the skeleton tableaus firing at someone farther down the arcade of columns mercer drew the bow and paused not sure of who he was aiming at it could be booker or one of ahmads men the gunman moved just enough for light to flit across his face for a second mercer recognized mohammad bin alsalibi and his hatred flared between mercer and alsalibi the three rearing monsters out of mythology made the shot next to impossible mercer would have to thread the arrow though the gaps in their skeletons if he wanted to hit the terrorist leader and he hadnt fired a bow since summer camp when he was thirteen he drew back on the wire pulling it past what hed managed before until the downy feathers at the end of the arrow touched his cheek salibi had shifted position hiding behind a towering thighbone of what the ancients believed was a cyclops mercer could just make out a sliver of his face through the forest of interwoven bones shifting his aim a fraction of an inch mercer let fly the ninety pounds of pull hed maintained on the ancient weapon sent the arrow singing though the air it shot through the gap between the hips and tail of the hydra passed the length of its rib cage and out a hole in its shoulder before streaking to the next skeleton here too mercers aim held true the arrow barely brushed the tooth of the snakelike creature as it arced through its open jaw and then it passed through the bones of another monster salibi must have heard the sound of the bow because he turned at the last second the arrow sliced though his cheek breaking when it hit the bone but still carrying enough speed for the tip to pierce his skull he was dead before he hit the ground mercer readied another arrow and continued the hunt the firing suddenly stopped and he lowered himself behind a column waiting to see what would happen next he detected shadowy movement heading in the direction of alexanders tomb but he wasnt quick enough with the bow he continued around the perimeter of the chamber his eyes straining to see in the uneven light of the braziers while making sure whoever had entered the third room didnt reemerge a hand reached out and grabbed his ankle he jerked it free and heaved on the bow letting off the tension when he saw ibriham ahmad lying on the stone floor his customary black suit was shiny at the shoulder and along his side the sheen was fresh blood mercer knelt at his side how bad are you hit i am dead dr mercer his voice was a hoarse croak yet i go to my grave knowing the alembic will not leave this place you dynamited the entrance to seal us in he nodded stiffly when i blew up the tunnel only devrin and one other were left i could not risk losing the fight had the turk not already been dying mercer would have killed him with his bare hands you could have fucking warned me you were going to pull something like this for gods sake it is for gods sake i did it there was no other way our sacrifice will save millions that was the difference between them mercer was willing to risk his life on even the slimmest odds but willingly knowing there was absolutely no chance was something he couldnt comprehend i only managed to get one of them ibriham slurred he was going fast poli no an arab i got salibi may allahs blessing be upon you and may he rot for all eternity in the most foul hell trapped in this subterranean nightmare he might be but as long as mercer was alive there was always hope hed take care of poli first and then try to figure a way to get himself and ahmad out of here that must have been the oneeyed assassin hed seen skulking back into the burial chamber wheres your gun mercer asked the janissary i am out of ammunition i think we all are that is why poli stopped shooting havent any of you heard of fire discipline mercer spat well if i could take salibi with a bow i can do the same to poli are you going to be okay for a couple of minutes no doctor i will be dead he said it with calm resignation mercer didnt know what to say he laid a hand gently on ahmads good shoulder vaya con dios what does that mean its spanish it means go with god you could give me no better blessing ibriham said with a faint smile and then he simply didnt take another breath mercer gently closed his eyes enjoy your virgins my friend youve earned them he stood and quickly made his way down the columned promenade an arrow at the ready at the entrance to the burial chamber he paused and scanned the space unable to see anyone hiding amid the clutter of funerary artifacts he took a cautious step into the room the bronze sword swung in a tight arc and sliced into the tough wooden bow which saved mercers life poli had been hiding just inside the entrance ready to ambush him the blow sent mercer staggering back and the sword lodged in the bow was ripped from polis hand stunned by the attack mercer tried to dislodge the blade but it was stuck fast poli reared from around the corner his single eye glinting in the firelight mercer backpedaled to give himself room when he drew the bow the weakened wood broke where it had been sliced and the weapon just sagged in his hands poli was only a couple feet away his massive arms outstretched as he towered over mercer mercer threw the bow at him poli caught it contemptuously tossed it aside and came on like a machine you are a dead man funny mercer said i was about to tell you the same thing poli lunged at him mercer dashed to his left to avoid the attack and almost got free but one of polis big hands clamped down on his wrist he turned on the inside and punched the bulgarian under the arm it was like hitting a truck tire poli bent his wrist back forcing mercer to his knees the mercenary fired a fist into mercers face using all his weight mercer felt his nose break and the blood jet from his nostrils before he lost consciousness for a second poli yanked on his arm to rouse him and punched him again even harder mercer felt like he was being worked over with a sledgehammer poli heaved him to his feet and shoved him back against a wall he tried to knee mercer in the groin but mercer shifted just enough to take the blow on the thigh the leg went numb to his toes i have never particularly enjoyed killing people poli said he wasnt even breathing hard it is something i happened to learn i was good at doing so maybe nows a good time to quit mercer said and spat a glob of blood on the ground but i am going to enjoy killing you it will be hours before they dig us out so i am going to take my time he casually cuffed mercer on the side of the head when he let go mercer couldnt stay on his feet and he collapsed poli grabbed him by the hair and started dragging him back into the burial chamber mercer grabbed polis wrist to lessen the pain as his scalp was nearly ripped off poli dragged him upright again and using one hand to hold him and one hand to punch him fired a rapid series of shots into mercers already bloody face there was nothing mercer could do but take the beating hed fought and even defeated men who were bigger than himself but nobody with polis size or immeasurable strength he felt as powerless as a child at the hands of an abuser when poli stopped mercer collapsed again the big assassin went to a pile of swords leaning against a stack of sandalwood boxes he came back testing the edge and showed mercer the bloody line it left on his thumb how do you think youll look without skin mercer could just lie there and stare up at him poli set the weapon down and forced him onto his feet again saying i thought you were tough the least you could do is make this interesting holding one of mercers arms poli spun in place like a discus thrower and tossed him across the room mercer smashed into one of the chariots almost flipping over its side he couldnt straighten himself by the time poli grabbed him and threw him again this time he crashed into the long wooden skiff alexander was to use on the rivers of the underworld poli reached for him again and just as his hands clamped on the back of mercers neck mercer turned and rammed the butt end of a skinny oar into the giants eye poli feines roared in pain as blood and clear ocular fluid sprayed from the wound mercer took a painful step forward and rammed the oar deeper into the eye socket polis screams turned shrill mercer reached out and yanked the oar from polis eye and the merciless killer fell to the ground clutching at his ruined face youve blinded me mercer grabbed a nearby lance to help keep him on his feet not exactly an eye for an eye you sadistic son of a bitch but i think you get the point dawn was just brushing the eastern horizon when cali stowe brought the big riva close to shore where booker sykes and devrin egemen were waving her in behind them the camp was still littered with the corpses of fifty terrorists the janissaries had won but at what cost she scanned the beach for mercer but there was no sign of him hes not dead she whispered as tears formed in her eyes hes only a little wounded hes okay as soon as she was in earshot she shouted wheres mercer hes not dead he cant be booker and devrin looked at her stonily she dropped the anchor and raced for the stern dive platform she didnt even kick off her shoes before jumping into the cool lake and stroking for the shore she scrambled to her feet as soon as it was shallow enough and charged out of the water practically colliding with booker wheres mercer she screamed there was blood on bookers uniform and his eyes were glassy with exhaustion he could barely stay on his feet devrin was in even worse shape his pants leg was sodden where hed taken a bullet he was underground when professor ahmad blew up the entrance to the tomb the young turk said cali fell to the ground and started to sob was there anybody else down there when no one answered her cali knew the worst how many four including poli feines booker said he might already be dead her sobs turned into choking gasps as the enormity hit her mercer was dead oh god oh god booker hunkered down next to her we dont know that for sure hes one tough piece of work well dig him out we just need to get people here with heavy equipment that will take days what if hes injured he could be bleeding to death right now honey theres nothing we can do booker soothed the quicker we get going the quicker we can come back well call admiral lasko and hell get the ball rolling we have to go devrin needs to show that leg to a sawbones but her voice trailed off cali i know you think you should stay but sitting here watching a pile of dirt isnt going to help him we can be back here first thing tomorrow with a chopper and enough people to get him out i just cant i mean hes i cant believe it either but this is the only thing we can do come on cali let booker draw her to her feet they used the terrorists speedboat to motor out to the riva booker and cali had to carry the injured janissary onto the luxury yacht the scholar was going into shock from exhaustion and loss of blood they set him in calis cabin and they tucked blankets around his shivering body after booker had redressed his wound booker asked cali to stay with devrin until he fell asleep and then climbed up to the cockpit cali stroked devrins feverish forehead carefully brushing back his hair her emotions in such turmoil that she could focus on nothing but the simple gesture the big engines rumbled to life and the riva started to pull away from shore cali left devrin and made her way to the stern window the camp was quickly receding behind them as booker brought the boat onto plane a fat white wake forming a v that spread across the whole width of this narrow part of the bay she was about to turn away when she spotted something else marring the flat surface of the water she almost dismissed it as a rogue wave but something piqued her curiosity a vague sense of something she knew was caused by grief still she ran out into the open dive platform unable to make out what had caught her interest she launched herself up the stairs to the top deck for a better vantage book she screamed and when he didnt hear her over the rumbling diesels she ran up and smacked him on the shoulder go back go back theres someone in the water what theres someone in the water turn around booker shot her a dubious look but cranked the wheel over anyway they backtracked fifty yards keeping the engines at low rpms both of them scanning the water but unable to see anything except their own wake you sure you saw something doubt crept into calis eyes i thought i did come on weve got to get devrin to a hospital he had cranked the wheel again and eased up the throttles when cali shouted and pointed on the crest of their fading wake a man was lying facedown in the water booker changed direction and gunned the engines in seconds they were gliding by the pitiable figure i dont believe it cali grabbed a life ring and jumped over the side of the boat the ring was torn from her hands when she hit the water and was driven deep but she found it when she resurfaced she began to paddle wildly pushing the ring ahead of her it hit the man and turned him over one arm came out of the water and draped over the flotation device mercer lifted his head from the water with a rakish grin on his battered but still handsome face i never figured booker would try to steal my girl cali kissed him hungrily but mercer had to push her back his mouth was a bloody mess how she asked as they bobbed in the water the tunnel was only partially collapsed mercer panted i used polis scuba gear to swim down until i found a place where the earthquake had opened up the ceiling enough for me to fit through i let buoyancy do the rest arlington virginia hi harry im home mercer called as he stepped through the doorway feeling like a suburban husband from a fifties tv show harry must have gotten the same feeling because he growled down from the upstairs bar im not getting your pipe and slippers what about mine cali asked with a smile pipes are unladylike and ive got a foot fetish so id rather see you without slippers harrys tone then darkened can you guys come up here theres something you have to listen to mercer was on crutches because of his bad knee and it took him a few moments to negotiate the curving staircase harry got up from his bar stool when they entered he looked at the crutches and scoffed i lost my leg fifty odd years ago and only just started using a cane while you get a little booboo on your knee and youre on crutches painkillers too mercer said a little dreamily lots and lots of painkillers which i plan to mix with a drink and promptly pass out harry kissed calis cheek with his face all banged up like that no one would blame you for dumping him and going out with me i dont think i could keep up with you she teased back id go easy on you he smiled lecherously seriously when mercer called from egypt i was very relieved you were okay and booker too i like him what about me mercer asked sarcastically ive seen your will i get the house if you buy the farm so i was rooting for the terrorists youre all heart mercer settled onto one of the couches laying the crutches on the floor drag sprawled on the opposite couch with his legs raised stiffly in the air if not for his snoring mercer would have thought he was dead youve got something we need to hear harry went behind the bar he fixed drinks for everyone then set the answering machine on the polished mahogany cali handed mercer his gimlet and sat next to him couple of things actually first off ira called with a report out of russia seems they recovered seventy barrels of plutonium from that train theyre on their way to a permanent storage facility we counted sixtyeight cali said harry held up a finger for her to be patient they did a check of them and discovered two had recently been submerged in sea water we were right about popov then mercer said he was in novorossiysk to find those last two drums and cover his ass ira said that his arrest trial and execution took place yesterday gotta love russian justice mercer said whats the second thing a guy called yesterday when i was doing the crossword i let the machine pick it up but when i figured out what i was listening to i grabbed the phone listen for yourself he pressed the play button ah yes dr mercer i apologize for not calling sooner however i was on an archaeological dig near ephesus mercer didnt recognize the voice but the accent sounded turkish the speaker also sounded elderly this is professor ibriham ahmad of the university of istanbul i understand you wanted to discuss the legend of the alembic of skenderbeg theres really nothing to it but i will be happy to talk to you feel free to the answering machine beeped thats when i picked up harry said the warm glow of the percocets coursing though mercers veins turned into a cold chill when he found his voice he said stupidly and you talked to him for about twenty minutes and i can tell you right now that hes not the guy who kidnapped cali or saved our butts in atlantic city or died in alexanders tomb four days ago like you told me mercer and cali just stared at each other he is the professor you originally called about skenderbeg harry went on hes an expert on him knew everything down to his hat size but he said that the legend of him using a weapon belonging to alexander the great is just that a myth it never happened well hes wrong i saw the damned thing im just repeating what he told me he also said that hes never heard of any new janissary order it took mercer a second to grasp what harry was telling him then the guy in egypt and russia isnt ibriham ahmad skenderbeg guru and professor at the university of istanbul harry finished for him who was he cali asked harry shrugged couldnt tell you its not like any of us asked him for id toss me the phone will you harry mercer rifled through his wallet for a slip of paper he held it up this is the phone number of the nurses station in the aswan hospital mercer dialed and let it ring for a minute before someone picked up it took a few moments to find someone who spoke english harry smoked through a cigarette cali went to the kitchen to get some ice for mercers knee id like to speak with devrin egemen mercer said when an englishspeaking doctor came on the line hes a young turkish man brought in with a gunshot to the leg a couple of days ago mercer shook his head as he listened he thanked the doctor and hung up devrin left the hospital yesterday without permission they dont know where he went after a pause cali asked what does this mean other than the fact he sacrificed himself to stop poli and alsalibi mercer replied well never know who he was consider this harry said they guarded their secret so closely that the world expert didnt know about them now theyve gone back to ground our government is negotiating the location of alexanders tomb with the egyptians so we get the alembic so hopefully theyll never need to emerge again well i do have something else harry said in a brighter tone after i transcribed chester bowies notes about adamantine i finished the rest of his letter as we all know he was partially right about the mythological ore and was dead bang on about how the ancient greeks created mythological monsters out of fossil bones he has another theory that might be worth checking out whats that mercer asked warily he believed that the story of jason and the argonauts is true sort of he believed that the golden fleece jason sought was actually a treasure barge used to pay for the protection for a queen of thessalys children when she sent them to live in the kingdom of colchis he thinks the barge sank in a storm on the black sea off the coast of presentday turkey mercer and cali broke out in laughter what harry said looking from one to the other no more adventures my friend chester bowies got his place in the history books if someone else wants to prove the rest of his ideas theyre welcome to it im done that goes double for me cali agreed i want nothing more to do with bowie ancient legends or myths hey come on harry wheedled there could be a fortune out there for us think about it a treasure barge loaded with loot wed be rich ive got everything i want right here mercer put his arm around cali as he spoke she nestled into his embrace oh great harry threw up his hands you end up with the girl and ive got nothing youve got the satisfaction of knowing you helped mankind cali said sweetly that dont pay the bar tabs he groused and ill pay you back the twenty grand i borrowed in new jersey mercer added harry suddenly looked like he wanted to be anywhere but in this room ah you ah dont have to bother trepidation crept into mercers voice why what did you do you know i was on a roll right at the craps table i mean and if youre on a streak you keep going right well tiny knows a guy who floats a game it was a sure thing i couldnt lose so i sort of borrowed something of yours for collateral you didnt i did did what cali asked switching attention between the two men harry looked at her with an expression more pitiful than anything drag was capable of i used mercers jag to cover my marker he turned to mercer if it makes you feel any better i lost the rest of my thirty grand too besides ira promised to cover all your expenses we can get your car back no problem or better yet buy a new one and i swear on my soul tiny and i will never borrow it either mercers head was cradled in his hands harry when the vodka and percocets wear off you and i are going to have a very long talk about boundarieslike how i need to set some drinking twenty grand worth of my booze over the years isnt the same as hawking my car he looked at his old friend with a rueful smile and you dont have a soul knowing hed be forgiven harrys old face scrunched up in a matching grin he lofted his highball in a salute youre a prince and i dont care what anyone else says about you ill drink to that cali said they both downed their cocktails and as cali went behind the bar to recharge their glasses she said theres something i dont understand whats that mercer asked were pretty sure the janissaries sank the wetherby on the niagara river but we discounted them being behind the destruction of the hindenburg was it the russians who blew it up or the nazis themselves who sabotaged it im afraid thats one more mystery piled up on all the rest hell it really could have been an accident after all you dont really believe that not really ive never liked coincidences someone wanted to stop chester bowie from telling the world about the plutonium well just never know who postscript may princeton new jersey the rain continued to fall as evening turned to night it wasnt a fresh spring storm but something darker and uglier that kept people indoors and huddled under blankets the residential street on princetons campus was deserted the only motion was the swaying of naked branches and the flutter of sodden leaves stripped from the trees by the wind a shadow detached itself from where it had cowered behind a parked car and approached a white twostory house its street number was affixed to the steps leading up to the broad front porch the home was an unassuming greek revival with black shutters and just a tiny patch of front lawn the man who approached had never been there but had corresponded with its occupant numerous times he knocked on the door his suit was soaked through and because he wore no hat his longish hair hung past his collar in greasy strings a woman opened the door she was in her fifties and slender with dark hair just turning to gray and a pinched severe expression she had the look of a guard dog and said nothing when she eyed the unkempt stranger with the thick mustache and crazed eyes is he here i must speak to him the stranger spoke in a heavy accent that was more guttural than the womans native german he is not seeing anyone tonight go away she made to close the door and the stranger blocked her by slamming his hand against the wood and sending the door crashing back to its stops glass rattled in the windowpanes you cannot come in she said forcefully the stranger ignored her protests and stepped into the entryway his shoes squelching on the floor he looked around his eyes narrowing are you here he called a gentle voice called from further in the house wer ist helen a man herr doctor helen dukas said in german i do not know who he is and i dont like the look of him the most celebrated scientist of his day emerged from the kitchen wearing baggy trousers and a cardigan his hair was a wild tangle atop his head and he smelled of pipe tobacco while he was normally an affable man there was concern and sorrow etched around his eyes and mouth he studied the stranger dripping rainwater on his carpet but didnt seem to recognize him then his eyes went wide as he realized who the man was how could you do it nikola albert einstein thundered in an accusatory tone nikola tesla met his piercing gaze i had to stop you albert i couldnt let you unleash that horror on the world as soon as i heard the news on the radio i knew you had done it i know an anarchist a croatian immigrant who was more than willing to help me tesla said defiantly you left me no choice writing to you about natural transuranic elements was just an intellectual exercise you were never supposed to try to find them are you mad even as he said it einstein knew the serb inventor was do you think blowing up an airship full of innocent people will stop others from seeking out such elements my god man in a few years we will be able to create them in a laboratory to what end tesla shot back we both know there can be only one outcome of such research you and i are the only two people in the world who can foretell the death and destruction we can not spread that knowledge nikola you must understand that a war is coming a war for the very soul of humanity we have to be ready it is only a matter of time before hitler grabs more territory germany lost after the great war and a clash between america and japan over the pacific is inevitable teller and fermi and szilard and i have seen this coming and have been working on a plan so we have a weapon before the nazis we could stop such a world war from even starting with a single demonstration of its power but we need that plutonium otherwise it might take us a decade to create a bomb we were planning on telling the president as soon as we verified the sample bowie was bringing us from africa if we started work right away teller thinks that with a couple pounds of plutonium we could have a working weapon by now we must wait and pray that somehow bowie managed to ship some ore separately if he didnt then all is lost because only he knew the mines location without an atomic deterrent there is nothing to stop that austrian paper hanger from taking over all of europe or the militarists in japan from continuing their expansion you not only killed the passengers of the hindenburg youve sentenced millions more to die needlessly already close to the breaking point because others had profited from his genius while he languished in a manhattan coldwater flat tesla said nothing his lips working like a fish gulping air a string of saliva dripped unnoticed from the corner of his mouth as the enormity of what hed done echoed in his fractured mind and the last vestiges of sanity slipped quietly away he started to sob come inside and warm up einstein said softly let us get you some dry clothes he placed a hand on teslas shoulder tesla shoved him away his expression feral he said nothing as he raced from the house and back into the storm who was that einsteins longtime secretary asked the man who has prevented me from averting a second world war
