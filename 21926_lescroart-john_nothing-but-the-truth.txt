have finally jr and js you guys are like totally awesome to the big cactus and the little gambas no mask like open truth to cover lies as to go naked is the best disguise william congreve part one at the tail end of a dog of a morning dismas hardy was beginning to fear that he would also be spending the whole stiflingly dull afternoon in municipal court on the second floor of the hall of justice in san francisco he was waiting interminably since nine am for his client to be admitted into the courtroom this would not have been his first choice for how to celebrate his fortyeighth birthday now again the clerk called out someone not his client this time a young man who looked as though hed been drinking since hed turned twentyone and possibly for two or three years before that maybe he was still drunk certainly he looked wasted the judge was peter li a former assistant district attorney with whom hardy was reasonably friendly the prosecuting attorney was randy huang who sat at his table inside the bar rail as the defendant went shuffling past the public defender was a tenyear veteran named donna wong judge lis longtime clerk another asian named manny see read the charge against the young man as he stood swaying eyes opening and closing at the center podium the judge addressed him mr reynolds youve been in custody now for two full days trying to get to sober and your attorney tells me youve gotten there is that true yes your honor donna wong declared quickly judge li nodded patiently but spoke in a firm tone id like to hear it from mr reynolds himself counsellor sir reynolds looked up swayed for a beat let out a long breath and shook his head mr reynolds judge li raised his voice look at me please do you know where you are donna wong prodded him with her elbow reynolds looked down at her up to the judge and his clerk across to huang sitting at the prosecution table his expression took on a look of stunned surprise as he became aware of his surroundings of the asian faces everywhere he turned i dont know a pause china but the courtroom humor such as it was mingled uneasily with tragedy and the sometimes cruel impersonality of the law twentyfive very long minutes after the drunken mr reynolds had been removed from the courtroom another case had been called another defendant not hardys brought in he was beginning to think that his own client wouldnt get his hearing and that another entire day would have been wasted this was not all that unusual an occurrence everyone bitched about it but no one seemed to be able to make things better the new defendant was joshua bonder and from the penal code section read out by the clerk hardy knew the charge was dealing amphetamines but before things got started judge li wanted to make sure that the three material witnesses in the case were in the building and ready to testify hardy was half nodding off half aware of the jockeying between judge li and the attorneys when suddenly the back door by the judges bench opened at the sound of rattling chains shades of the middle ages hardy looked up as a couple of armed bailiffs escorted three children into the courtroom the two boys and a girl seemed to range in age from about ten to fourteen all of them railthin poorly dressed obviously terrified but what sent an almost electric buzz through the courtroom was the fact that they were all shackled together in handcuffs and leg chains joshua bonder whose own handcuffs had been removed for the hearing screamed out you sons of bitches and nearly knocked over the defense table jumping up trying to get to the kids what have you done to my children hardy had seen many murderers walk into the courtroom on their own without any hardware he thought hed seen most of everything here but this shocked him to his roots and he wasnt alone both of the courtroom bailiffs had leapt to restrain mr bonder and now held him by the defense table but judge li himself was up behind the bench his normal calm demeanor thrown to the winds at this outrage what the hell is this he boomed at the guards uncuff those children at once his eyes raked the room stopping at the prosecution table mr vela the assistant da whod drawn joshua bonder what is the meaning of this vela too was on his feet stammering your honor you yourself issued the body attachments for these children as witnesses we were afraid they would flee they wouldnt testify against their father hes their only guardian so we have been holding them in youth guidance for how long vela clearly wished the floor would open up and swallow him two weeks your honor you must remember li listened then went back to shouting i remember the case but i didnt order them shackled for gods sake vela the bureaucrat had an answer for that too thats the mandated procedure your honor when we transfer inmates from juvenile hall and we think theres a flight risk we shackle them judge li was almost stammering in his rage but look at these people mr vela theyre children not even teenage the fathers attorney a woman named gina roake decided to put in her two cents worth your honor am i to understand that these children have been at the ygc for two weeks vela mumbled something about how ms roake shouldnt get on her high horse it was standard procedure but roake was by now truly exercised her voice hoarse with disgust you locked up these innocent children in the company of serious juvenile offenders is that what youre telling me mr vela they are not innocent no what was their crime reluctance to testify against their father thats all and for this theyre shackled vela tried again the judge ordered but li wasnt having any part of that exploding he pointed his whole hand at the prosecutor now booming at the top of his voice i ordered the least restrictive setting that would ensure the childrens return to court least restrictive mr vela you know what that means the smallest of the three kids had started crying and the girl had moved over putting her arm around him as the bailiff moved in to separate them gina roake cried out dont you dare touch them your honor a plea which li accepted let them alone a moment of relative quiet ensued into it gina roake inserted a heartfelt reproach your honor this is the inevitable outcome when children are drawn into the criminal justice system there has to be a better way this is a travesty at long last it was hardys turn his client a yearold recent dallas transplant named jason trent made his living laying carpet and was now in custody charged with three counts of mayhem and inflicting grievous bodily injury pursuant to a fight in the com stadium parking lot after a fortyniner game trents story and hardy believed it was that a trio of local boys had taken exception to his dallas cowboys attire and after the niners had been soundly thrashed thought they would work out some of their frustrations by ganging up on the lone cowboy this in common with most of the other niner decisions on the field during the game turned out to be a bad idea for the home team jason trent had black belts in both karate and aikido and had also been a golden gloves champion in his teens back in fort worth after being sprayed with beer and pushed from two directions at once and all the while warning his assailants about his various defense skills jason had finally lost his temper in a very short fight he put all three boys on the ground then his real mistake hed gone around with a few more ragedriven punches in the process breaking two arms one collarbone and one nose you should have stopped when they were down hardy had told him to which jason had shrugged they started it even so the story probably would have ended there had not one of the three victims been the son of richard raintree a san francisco supervisor and political ally of district attorney sharron pratt raintree contended that jason trent had overreacted to what amounted only to goodnatured hazing and was himself drunk on beer sharron pratt agreed shed ordered jason arrested and charged now hardy addressed judge li your honor he said this is my clients first alleged offense he has no criminal record not even a parking ticket he holds a steady job hes married and has three young children he shouldnt even be here in this courtroom his alleged victims started this fight and he was forced to defend himself li allowed a crack in his stern visage glancing over at the bandaged and splinted victims at the prosecution table and did a good job of it didnt he hardy kept at it the point your honor is that mr trent was pushed to this extreme by three punks who were ganging up on him for all he knew they were planning to kill him this woke up the prosecutor frank fischer who objected to the use of the word punk and further your honor the victims were on the ground at the time of the attack they posed no threat to mr trent at that time they are the reason anything happened at all your honor the odds were that he was whistling in the wind but hardy felt he had to go ahead this was san francisco in the nineties the ultimate responsibility for any action only rarely got all the way back to a prime mover there were always too many victims in the path who could claim stress or that their rights had somehow been violated the law said that jason trent had gone beyond simple selfdefense trent himself admitted that hed been driven to loss of control he wouldnt pretend he didnt do it hed hurt these slimeballs on purpose because theyd hurt and threatened him first whose fault was that he wanted to know so law or no law hardy felt that for his clients sake he had to make the point mr trent didnt do anything wrong here your honor the law recognizes selfdefense as a perfect defense these young men scared and outnumbered him he felt he had no option but to immobilize them until he could get away even after they were down on the ground li asked hardy nodded he wanted to make sure they wouldnt get up until he could remove himself from any further danger he didnt use anything like deadly force which he very well could have your honor he used appropriate force to stop a vicious and unprovoked attack hardy noted vibration at his belt his silent beeper going off he glanced down at it a message from his office well he was almost done here finally the judge had heard his little speech and now would set bail and assign a trial date and then but li no doubt still simmering in his earlier fury with the das cavalier style suddenly had a different idea after he listened to hardys argument he allowed a short silence to reign in his courtroom then he looked over at the prosecutor mr fischer he said do the people concede that messrs raintree et al assaulted the defendant here mr trent without provocation of any kind other than his choice of clothing fischer was a nondescript functionary in his midthirties by his reaction this might have been the very first time that a judge had surprised him or even spoken to him in the course of a proceeding now he stood up slowly looked down at his notebook and brought his eyes back up to the judge your honor there was an exchange of words and insults we have witnesses who li interrupted who hit who first fischer scratched at the table before him regardless of whatever instigated the fight that resulted in lis face remained placid but his voice hardened excuse me mr fischer i asked you a simple question would you like me to repeat it no your honor that isnt necessary then would you do me the kindness to answer it li repeated it anyway did mr raintree and the others start this fight fischer looked over at hardy finally he had to give it up yes your honor hardy thought he saw a momentary glint in the judges eye and was suddenly certain he knew what the judge was going to do next he wasnt supposed to do it but li obviously had had enough and didnt care a couple more seconds of thought then he tapped his gavel and stunned the courtroom with the words case dismissed hardy had no time to savor the triumph he thought hed just quickly call his office pick up his message and then go have a celebratory birthdayfreedom lunch with jason trent enjoy a rare midday martini maybe two but the phone message ended all thought of that it was the call all parents fear his receptionist phyllis told him that theresa wilson from merryvale needed him to get in touch with her as soon as possible merryvale was where his children rebecca and vincent went to school and theresa wilson was the principal there it was one thirty a thursday afternoon in the middle of october are the kids all right he blurted it out hardy had lost a son michael twentyfive years before and that wound still hadnt completely healed it never would now any threat to his children blanked his mind and brought his stomach to his throat theyre fine he closed his eyes and let out a breath of relief but no ones come to pick them up frannie hasnt called no of course she hadnt thats why mrs wilson was on the phone with him he flicked a glance down at his watch how late is she he knew it sounded lame he wasnt in charge of taking care of the kids that was frannies job so he wasnt certain what time school got out somewhere in the back of his mind he recalled that they had one early dismissal day every week it must be thursday about an hour an hour without even a call frannie liked to say that if a punctual person was a lonely one then she was one of the loneliest people on earth have you heard from erin i mean mrs cochran shes on the call list this was rebeccas grandmother who often picked up the kids at school when frannie had other errands that was my first call mr hardy to erin but i just got an answering machine i thought id wait a few more minutes before calling you at work maybe somebody got caught in traffic she hesitated your sons pretty upset he wants to talk to you hardy heard his third grader vincent trying to be brave but his voice was cracking frayed he responded with a hearty confidence its ok bud ill be down to pick you up in no time tell rebecca its all right too everythings fine but wheres mom i dont know vin but dont worry im sure its just a communication mixup that or shes running late from something he was selling himself as well as his son maybe frannie had arranged for another parent to pick up the kids and that person had forgotten shell probably show up before i get there although he didnt really believe that frannie would have told the children if someone else other than erin were going to pick them up they had strict rules about not going home with anybody other than mom dad or grandma unless the arrangements had been approved in advance you be a big guy he said everythings ok i promise hardy made a quick call back to his reception desk and questioned phyllis was she sure frannie hadnt left a message earlier but phyllis was an efficiency machine if his wife had called she told him icily she would have told hardy as she always did he checked his watch again it had been less than five minutes since hed talked to mrs wilson undoubtedly there was a simple explanation even in this day of ubiquitous communication there were places that didnt have phones or access to them frannie might be at one of them stuck trying to reach him he got the answering machine when he tried at his home where could she be if she were not picking up the children something was wrong perhaps shed been in an accident hardys fertile brain played with the possibilities of what might have happened might be happening to his wife he didnt like any of them a few minutes later he was in his car negotiating the downtown traffic he tried to remember something about frannies day her plans for the life of him he couldnt retrieve anything if in fact shed told him truth was lately she probably wouldnt have mentioned anything about her daily schedule and even if she had it might not have registered with him more and more the two of them were leading separate lives both of them knew it and admitted that it was a problem but it was the toll of daytodayness and neither of them seemed able to break the cycle hardy knew about as much of his wifes routines as he did of his childrens school day which was precious little though it was cold comfort he told himself that it was just the way things had evolved the family dynamic had changed gotten more traditional he was overwhelmed with the simple mechanics of making a living frannie volunteered for everything never said no and was always there to support the other moms her circle of friends all of it frannies very existence it seemed revolved around their children as he supposed it should that was the job shed wanted he made the money and helped with discipline that was the deal finally beyond van ness the traffic started to move along out toward the avenues with luck now hed be to merryvale in ten minutes by the time he got home with the children and searched the house for some kind of a note he was really worried his wife didnt simply disappear with no explanation he sent the kids to the backyard and got on the phone his first call was to erin cochran but he got another answering machine next a flash of insight he called moses mcguire frannies brother bartending at the little shamrock she probably left you i would have long ago she wouldnt have left the kids mose well thats probably true youre right i dont know where she is moses took a minute i wouldnt worry about it diz shell turn up well thats heartening thanks for the input he hung up big help from the brother front while he sat at the kitchen table contemplating his next call the phone rang and he snatched at it are you really worried some you really dont know where she is no im kidding you actually shes right here next to me we just thought it would be fun to call you and say she was gone see how you react moses got serious when did you last talk to her this morning you guys fight or anything no the line hummed with silence then id try erin i already did she isnt home maybe they went somewhere together and got hung up maybe hardy agreed he didnt want to alarm her brother any more than he already had moses had raised frannie he often said that of the ten things he cared most about frannie was the first eight either erin or one of her other friends but she didnt call you this of course was the nub of it but hardy played it down phyllis might have lost the message happens all the time he lied ill call susan moses said referring to his wife maybe shes heard something ok hardy looked at his watch two fifty im sure shell be home anytime ill call fortyfive minutes later the phone had rung twice more but neither one was frannie first had been susan checking to make sure that moses had not misinterpreted what hardy was saying was frannie really missing hardy didnt want to say that not yet she just wasnt home yet hed call susan back when he heard from her the second call was erin cochran home from a long weekend that she and her husband ed had spent in the napa vineyards no she hadnt talked to frannie in a week mrs wilsons call on her machine had told her that frannie hadnt gone to pick up the children then shed gotten hardys message what was going on was frannie back yet she tried to hide it but the worry in her voice was unmistakable it was now nearly three hours since frannie should have picked the kids up at school and hardy still hadnt even heard from her did he need help at home erin could be right over hardy admitted that maybe that wouldnt be a bad idea hed put off making the next call for as long as he could but now nearly four thirty with two redeyed children at the table listlessly pushing around some graham crackers and milk he punched in a number he knew by heart glitsky homicide lieutenant abe glitsky the chief of san franciscos homicide department was his best friend being in the criminal justice system glitsky could circumvent a lot of bureaucracy abe its diz this was so different from their usual obscene or ironic greeting that it raised glitskys red flag what the matter hardy told abe to hold a minute then stood up with the portable phone and told rebecca and vincent he was talking to uncle abe adult stuff he was just going into the living room for a little privacy hed be right back they should keep eating their snacks frannies running about three hours late he whispered from the front of the house he cast his eyes up and down the street out front no frannie three hours i thought you might check around hardys casual tone didnt camouflage much for glitsky he knew what his friend meant by check around accidents hospital admissions or the worst recently dead jane does unidentified women three hours glitsky repeated hardy looked at his watch hating to say it maybe a little more glitsky got the message im on it he said hardy hung up just as vincent let out a cry in the kitchen the cochrans big ed and erin were the parents of frannies first husband ed who was the biological father of rebecca their son had been gone a long time now but ed and erin still doted on their granddaughter and her brother vincent they loved frannie and her husband hardy and his wife with no living parents between them considered them part of the family now after getting the word about frannies absence they had come to hardys house erin was shepherding the kids through their homework at the kitchen table trying to keep their minds engaged hardy and ed were making small talk casting glances at the telephone waiting hardy was on the phone before the ring ended it was abe glitsky with his professional voice on she back yet hardy told him no and endured a short pause ok well the good news is nobodys dead not anywhere i checked alameda marin santa clara the counties surrounding san francisco and its a slow day on the prairie barely a fenderbender no reports of anything serious nothing in the city at all hardy let out a long sigh so what now i dont know we hang shell he stopped glitsky whod lost his own wife to cancer a few years before wasnt one for stoking false hopes she driving the subaru id guess so if shes driving give me the license and ill put it out over the dispatch broaden the net all right hardy hated the sound of that broaden the net it was getting official now objective harder to deny even to himself where was his wife earlier that morning scott randall was hosting an informal bull session with some law clerks in his tiny cubicle of an office on the third floor of the hall of justice even his most ardent admirers among these clerks would admit that scott was the near embodiment of welldressed postgenx arrogant disdain but none of them viewed this as a negative indeed the trait had allowed scott though only thirtythree to rise to homicide prosecutor in the das office an eminence to which they all aspired this morning scott had a theme and he was rolling listen up he told the acolytes you are looking at someone who has gotten convictions on his first three murder cases and i dont need to tell you how difficult that is in our compassiondriven little burg no false modesty for scott randall but do you know what those three convictions have done for my career or what the same kind of cases will do for yours the question was rhetorical and he breezed ahead zero zilch nada you know why because no one cares about the people in them look he held up a finger one a motorcycle gang brawl over one of their commonlaw women two another finger a drug dealer killed by an addict hed tried to cheat three a bum stabbed after hed stolen another bums grocery cart this is not stuff over which newspaper readers salivate believe me one of the young men spoke up so what do you do ill answer by way of an example i think youll all have heard something about the murder of bree beaumont he reached for a manila file that sat atop his desk and from it extracted a couple of eight by ten glossy photographs holding them up exhibit a on the left he began scott spoke a precise legalese even in private is a picture of the deceased bree beaumont very pretty a player in the bigmoney oil business also married two kids and he paused for effect rumored to be dating damon kerry this was a trump that had been kept from the media and scott enjoyed the reaction perhaps our next governor thats right scott raised the picture in his right hand exhibit b is bree beaumonts body lying in the enclosed patio area underneath her penthouse apartment where she landed after a long fall as youve read in the papers there were shards of glass in brees hairline they didnt find glass where she landed none in her apartment so someone conked her on the head and threw her over she was six weeks pregnant too scott cocked an eyebrow he had their interest this is high profile careermaking stuff you cant let these cases get away and if they start to slide youve got to go proactive the first male clerk spoke again how is it getting away its been three weeks and our friends in the police department dont have a suspect after that amount of time the odds say they never will thats how one of the female clerks checked in but they must be looking isnt it just a matter of time scott conceded that sometimes it was but in this case the original inspector carl griffin was working solo and got himself shot to death apparently unrelated just a few days after bree was killed the new guys batavia and coleman havent found anything and it doesnt seem like its bothering them and until they bring us a suspect weve got no job scott let them absorb the facts for a moment so if youre me and you want this case i mean you really want this case what do you do this was the kind of information the clerks came here to lap up they were rapt as he continued ill tell you what i did do i went to ms pratt san franciscos district attorney sharron pratt and told her promised her that if she gave me my own investigator i would bring the case before the grand jury to get an indictment the second young woman spoke up how scott flashed a grin im glad you asked that question kimberly and heres the answer the grand jury is your friend you know how it works no defense lawyers allowed no judge in the room you present your case to twenty average citizens and do it without worrying too much about legalities if youre not brain dead you get your indictment but if the police dont have a suspect who do you call as witnesses kimberly asked everybody i can think of including kerry his campaign manager al valens jim pierce this caloco oil vice president who was brees old mentor then i go after the personal connections and remember that no matter what else might be involved murder is usually personal so i subpoena brees husband ron rons friends and friends of friends her professors colleagues lab partners somewhere im betting im going to pull a break so its a fishing expedition the first clerk commented but weve always been told not to scott was brusque forget the garbage they taught you in law school heres real life onea theres lawyers who win in front of juries theyve got careers all the others wind up pushing paper or crunching numbers your choice so im going to take this murder of bree beaumont and get my name on the marquee the grand jurys my vehicle im riding it and taking no prisoners scotts eyes were bright this time next week mark my words this case is front burner and its mine scott had served his witness a mrs frannie hardy at her home on the previous friday the subpoena had instructed her to call if her time on the witness stand presented a conflict or hardship if that had been the case scott would have rescheduled hed done so with several other witnesses if mrs hardy had called he would have told her how long he expected her to be on the stand and what kinds of questions he was likely to ask scott had no indication that the witness had ever met bree beaumont he got her name from ron brees husband whod said that he and mrs hardy had been having coffee together on the morning of brees death so she was rons primary alibi and as such scott wanted to talk to her but it wasnt going to be the inquisition frannie hardy was not a suspect if shed called to discuss anything scott would have reassured her but no call so this morning when mrs hardy had arrived late at the grand jury room ten minutes after it had gone into session at nine thirty scott had already begun talking to james pierce a senior vice president and calocos community relations officer he had worked closely with bree before shed left the company and had known her since shed been recruited from cal if there were any bones in her closet scott thought pierce would know where they were hidden ironically scotts initial plan had been to take mrs hardy before pierce thinking that hers was probably going to be a much shorter questioning scott hadnt wanted to hang her up for the whole day but when she hadnt been there on time and pierce had that was too bad for her shed brought it on herself so now scott was going to let mrs hardy sweat it out no hed told her during a break in pierces testimony he didnt know how long it would be until he got to her no she couldnt come back another day he trotted out his favorite phrase this was not a parlor game this was a murder investigation i know all about murder investigations she told him my husbands an attorney too then you know how serious this is mrs hardy did not seem convinced i know how important you all think it is she said mildly look mr randall im just trying to find out how long this will be ive got to pick up my children at school if im not going to be out of here by one oclock im going to have to make some phone calls i think thats a good possibility he said with conscious ambiguity she didnt think it was too important did she well shed find out as it developed he began with her just before noon she had just decided to make her phone calls when scott called her to testify she thought it couldnt be too long shed have plenty of time there was no need to call after he administered the oath that she tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth scott had her identify herself and then started right in mrs hardy were you acquainted with the deceased bree beaumont no i never met her but you did know her husband ron thats correct mrs hardy was sitting at a table in the front of the room facing the twenty jurors now she looked up at them and explained ron is the fulltime parent in their family so we saw each other mostly at school and other childrelated events and how long have you known him i dont know exactly a couple or three years another explanation to the jury hes kind of an honorary mom we tease him about it we you know the other moms at school scott was just fishing talking about whatever came up here before the grand jury strict relevancy wasnt much of an issue did he seem to resent this role what do you mean i mean being mr mom did he ever talk about resenting that his wife worked and he didnt mrs hardy gave that a minutes thought no i dont think it bothered him did you find that strange what that he took care of the kids or that he didnt resent taking care of them i dont know both either another beat while she reflected not any more than anybody else mrs hardy broke a smile to the jurors i think sometimes our little darlings get hard for anybody then back to scott more seriously but with ron he seemed fine with it his wife did her job he did his hes a good father she made the money and he didnt thats right mr randall it happens here in the nineties and that didnt bother him being the man and not making any money i just said that it didnt seem to her voice took on a sharp edge i dont know what youre trying to get at im trying to find out who killed mrs beaumont well it wasnt ron he was with me when she died we were having coffee at the starbucks on th and geary near merryvale school this seemed to remind of her something and she glanced up at the wall clock pursed her lips scott randall pushed ahead and how did that come about what having coffee i dont even understand that question we just decided to go get a cup of coffee there wasnt anything sinister about it i didnt say there was well it seems to me you implied it we met at school dropping off the kids and ron said he felt like a cup of coffee and i said i thought that sounded good so we both went again she glanced at the wall clock look im sorry but are we almost done here ive got to go pick up my kids pretty soon when were done scott replied after were done scott did not view himself as a cruel person but a womans tears on a witness stand were as unimportant as the temperature in the room or the lighting sometimes you had to deal with them that was all but you had no feelings about them one way or the other frannie hardy on the stand before him now crying did not make his heart go all soft true enough she was quite lovely well dressed with striking green eyes and bright red hair and if hed been anywhere but in a courtroom with her he might have had other thoughts but not now shed brought her troubles upon herself and now she was paying the price she wasnt sobbing scott was sure these were tears of anger he didnt care you have to let me make my phone call no maam im sorry youre staying here you told me wed be finished by now scott shrugged i said we might be it was possible i thought we would be but youre not answering my questions thats slowing things down it was already half an hour past when she was supposed to have left to pick up her children shed been on the stand for two hours lets go over this one more time all right im not saying anything until you let me use the phone it had devolved into a pitched battle of wills and scott held the high ground he made the rules in this room and mrs hardy was going to play by them scott had long since abandoned the casual approach he was standing at one end of the front table so he could look now at mrs hardy and now at his jurors mrs hardy youre putting me in an awkward position as it stands now if you dont answer my questions youre going to force me to go to a judge in the superior court and get a contempt citation issued against you you might very well get thrown in jail do you understand that if that happens if it gets to there then youll get your phone call to your attorney but im not letting you off this stand in the middle of your testimony we can be finished here in ten minutes if you cooperate but if you dont its going to be a long afternoon now scott pressed her lets try again one more time you have testified that you knew ron beaumont had confided in you that his relationship with his wife was in a difficult stage isnt that true yes he told me that and did he tell you the nature of these difficulties a little bit did mr beaumont tell you anything that suggested he was unhappy or angry with mrs beaumont frannie shook her head no i wouldnt say so but really i have no idea how he felt we didnt talk about them but he did tell you he was having difficulties i would say so scott randall turned over a few pages on his yellow legal pad he looked at the jury then back to the witness mrs hardy do you find mr beaumont attractive her lips went tight i have never thought about it scott conveyed his disbelief clearly to the jury never thought about it you obviously had a relationship with him a close relationship isnt that true and you didnt notice if he was attractive or not i may have noticed but i didnt think about it we were friends thats all and yet he chose you and you alone to confide in about his marital problems i dont know that he might have confided in other people i dont know if it was only me were you two having an affair mrs hardy is that it frannie hardy was biting down hard on her lower lip she clipped out the words ive already told you we were friends scott randall remained matteroffact thats right thats what you told me but friends have affairs all the time did his wife find out about you was that it was she going to make problems for the two of you im not going to dignify that with an answer well youd better dignify something with an answer and pretty soon youre digging yourself into quite a hole here dont you realize that frannie was shaking her head back and forth wearily how had it all come to this so quickly she closed her eyes and forced her voice to remain calm rational look mr randall what do you want me to say im late picking up my children thats what im thinking about im not having any affair with ron beaumont and never did i never met his wife i dont think rons problems with his relationship led to his wifes death let us decide that mrs hardy youve admitted that the problems existed just tell us what they were frannie didnt know it but scott randall and the grand jury had already heard ron beaumont say that bree and he were getting along fine and there were no problems between them scott thought it might be a good time to mention this to frannie she sat still her face a blank now mrs hardy i promised him it would remain between us and i wouldnt tell anybody i gave him my word scott sensed an opening mrs hardy lets be realistic no one believes that promises are that sacred anymore this could be a crucial element in a murder investigation are you sure you havent mentioned what mr beaumont told you to your husband or one of your girlfriends she was staring at him trying to keep her anger in check more tears threatened a drop escaped from her right eye i promised she repeated i gave my word scott looked back out to the jurors he took a beat and sighed all right mrs hardy he said you dont leave me any choice by four thirty superior court judge marian braun had already had a long day on the bench presiding over an unusually depressing murder trial members of a gypsy clan had convinced several wealthy old people that they were their friends they had persuaded them to sign over their assets and then poisoned them with magic salt digitalis the magic salt was a big yuk the defendants had giggled as they sprinkled it on marian braun was used to bad people committing heinous crimes but this one got under her skin today had been particularly dispiriting because a dozen or more very toughlooking relatives of the defendants had put on a show of force by appearing in her courtroom just in time to intimidate the states main witness another of the clan who hadnt been able to live with her conscience and whod been promised immunity from prosecution in return for her testimony but the thugs in the courtroom got their message across the woman suddenly couldnt remember witnessing any of the defendants sprinkling salt on anything now it seemed possible that these heartless killers were going to go free when judge brauns bailiff came to her chambers and told her that scott randall had a contempt citation for her at the end of her already lousy day she grabbed her robes breathing fire and strode impatiently through the hallways to the grand jury room no maam as mr randall has explained to you you dont have a choice unless youre claiming a fifth amendment right but youve told me that your testimony will not incriminate yourself which rules out that option youve got to tell him what you know frannie hardy shook her head this had been going on for so long that all her patience was used up i cant believe this is the united states she scanned the faces of the jurors went to scott randall and finally rested on marian braun whats the matter with all you people you all ought to be ashamed of yourselves dont you have any real lives i havent done anything wrong this line of discourse turned out to be a tactical error judge braun wasnt about to have the validity of her life and work called into question by some nobody witness she snapped out her reply first in this room you address me as your honor next as to doing something wrong you are refusing to cooperate in the investigation of a murder case like it or not thats a crime now for the last time young lady you answer the question or you go to jail im not your young lady a pause maam braun slapped at the table all right then im ordering you held in the county jail until you decide to answer mr randalls questions judge braun half turned bailiff but frannie was on her feet now her voice raised color high you want to talk contempt i hold you in contempt god help the system if you cretins are running it brauns steely gaze came back to her you just got yourself four days before this grand jury citation even starts to run you want more young lady just keep talking bailiff the guard came forward hardy got frannies call at six twenty and made the halfhour drive downtown to the hall of justice in seventeen minutes on the way he stopped fuming long enough to think to call abe glitsky on his car phone to see if he could work some magic the county jail and the hall of justice were on the same lot maybe glitsky could get the ball rolling but the lieutenant was waiting for him by the back door of the hall at the entrance to the jail he wasnt wearing his happy face hardy came up at a jog slacks and shirtsleeves no coat knowing before he asked she still in there shes really in there though he never doubted she was this wasnt the kind of funny birthday prank frannie was likely to pull on him yep barely slowing hardy swore and turned in toward the jails entrance glitsky reached and caught his sleeve stopping him hey let me go abe im getting her out of there not without a judge youre not i couldnt when glitsky let go ofhis arm he stayed put glaring in the dusk the night had turned windy and cold the lawyer in him knew that his friend was right it wasnt a matter of summoning some patience they had to find a judge the night magistrate somebody to facilitate nighttime warrants and other late business the judges rotated magistrate duty so that there would be one judge on call every evening even as hardy said wheres braun he was moving again toward the hall glitsky on his heels but though they had no trouble getting by the night guard and into the building after they took the stairs to the second floor they couldnt get into the area of the judges chambers which were behind the courtrooms hardy banged on doors all the way down the hallway no answer a clerk working late in one of the rooms opened her door and poked a head out its closed up back there everybodys gone home hardy kicked the door and the sound echoed off the walls then suddenly just as they turned to head back downstairs the door opened whats all this goddam racket leo chomorro wasnt hardys favorite judge although he was glad enough to see him now it didnt appear to be mutual chomorro was scowling then noticing glitsky he nodded more genially evening lieutenant whats going on here glitsky laid it out in a few words they needed a judge to vacate a contempt citation and get hardys wife out of jail your wife yes your honor theres been some kind of screwup chomorros scowl deepened what was she doing down here shes not an attorney too is she no she got called before the grand jury and the next thing she knew she was in jail chomorro looked like he wanted to ask some more questions but hed heard the magic word grand jury and knew nobody was allowed to discuss anything about its proceedings theyd already told him the charge was contempt though he might pursue that who issued the citation he asked warily marian braun glitsky said making a face and no promises chomorro got a few more details then finally said hed put in a call to braun and get some answers if he could but he told them they shouldnt expect much any communication about grand jury proceedings was prohibited if they wanted to wait glitsky stayed with the judge but hardy decided he had to see frannie hed been to the jail dozens of times and knew the routine so within minutes he was in the attorneys visiting room waiting for his wife he hadnt really prepared himself with other clients he made it a point to previsualize their entrance into this room it was often the first time he would see them in the jails orange jumpsuit and the reality of someone hed known in civilian life dressed for the slammer was always something of a shock in this case the first sight was more in the order of a physical assault frannie always petite looked positively gaunt in the rooms institutional glare his wifes cheeks were ghostly the washedout faded yellowgray of ancient paste her beautiful red hair had already lost its luster and now hung flat and drab a glance reconnected them and they crossed to each other nearly falling into an embrace frannie clung to him her face buried in her chest repeating thank god thank god over and over he held her finally their hands enfolded on the table they began to get to it frannie trying to explain away the subpoena and the fact that she hadnt told him about it i didnt think it was anything thats why hardy shook his head this wasnt tracking right no he said you thought it was something frannie if you thought it was nothing you would have told me about it you would have said i got this subpoena today to go testify in front of the grand jury i wonder what its all about instead you kept it to yourself she was silent biting at her lower lip after a minute hardy prompted her frannie all right she admitted all right what pulling her hands away from his she crossed her arms over her chest now youre crossexamining me i think ive had enough of that for today hardy kept his voice in tight control im not doing that he brought it down to a whisper i dont know why youre here im confused i dont know whats going on you want to help me out with this im on your side closing her eyes she let out a breath ok she said she reached again for his hand i know i should have told you i mean i know that now its just weve had such different lives lately i didnt want you to misunderstand i guess to have to deal with it at all deal with what she met his eyes taking a long moment before answering ron ron hardy repeated his voice hardening in spite of himself i dont believe we know a ron ron beaumont she said max and cassandras dad hardy knew the children a bit from their visits with his kids from sleepovers the older one cassandra had become one of rebeccas good friends maybe even her best friend although he wasnt sure of that hardy had some vague sense a dim memory of a charming vivacious child although the kid thing as he called it had been pushed off banished from the front burner of his life but he had never met the father max and cassandras dad he repeated his voice flat ron frannie looked at him and he saw desperation even despair in her expression and behind that maybe a disturbing hint of defiance hes a friend of mine like you with the women in your life this was a sore point hardy often went to lunch or sometimes even dinner with other women colleagues who he worked with got along with even his exwife jane too once in a while he and frannie finally had to put a moratorium on questions about who they all were the various personal and professional relationships they were all just friends theyd leave it at that but on the other foot hardy discovered the shoe cramped him up he suddenly had to get away from what he thought he might be hearing walking across the room to its doorway he stood looking out through the wired glass opening into the hallway of the jail finally he turned ok well leave it where you want but ive got to remind you that you brought all this up i never heard of ron beaumont until two minutes ago and youre in jail because of some subpoena involving you and him i dont think a little curiosity is out of the question his wife was murdered hes a suspect by the door hardy stood stock still and the grand jury decided it had to talk to you about him she shrugged i was with him drinking coffee she added quickly on the morning she died in public he waited so they wanted to see if my alibi matched his hardy was still trying to figure out the logistics did you ever talk to the police about this before today no this wasnt making sense if frannie was the alibi of one of the main suspects in a murder case the police would have interrogated her as a matter of course if for no other reason than to have her words on the record hed have to remember to ask abe why they hadnt if abe knew and if it were true but first he was here ok so you got the subpoena you didnt tell me about i thought it would be a quick hour in the middle of the morning dismas there was no need to bother you with it hardy didnt want to start down that road again there were lots of facts he wanted to know when they got home and out of this environment things would seem different theyd be able to talk until they got somewhere here in the jail time pressed on them all right so i assume you verified rons alibi i did and after that well this lawyer the prosecutor do you know a scott randall hardy shook his head ive heard the name hes the guy who put you here she nodded he asked if ron had told me about any problems between him and his wife that might have something to do with what happened to her why would he have told you that why did this scott randall think to ask that i dont know but he did their eyes met across the room again and this time hardy left the doorway and came back to the table sitting on a corner of it so what did you say i said he had she shrugged so mr randall asked me what it was to tell the grand jury what ron had told me and and i couldnt do that why not because id promised ron i wouldnt ok so what was it this big secret she looked up at him imploringly dismas come on at this moment before hardy could respond there was a knock at the door and the guard admitted abe glitsky who was a study in controlled rage of his own stealing a quick look at frannie his eyes narrowed for a millisecond and the scar between his lips went white then he focused on hardy its not happening he said brauns not budging instinctively forgetting their disagreements hardy reached a hand out on the table and frannie took it he looked down at her and her eyes were brimming he didnt blame her i cant stay here dismas abe miserable the two men looked at each other they didnt have to say anything jail was a reality in both of their lives when a judge ordered it people wound up staying all the time finally hardy let out a breath so whats left abe what are our options the lieutenant was shaking his head i dont know i could talk to the desk maybe get her in adseg whats that frannie asked im right here guys dont third person me administrative segregation glitsky explained to her basically its isolation a nicer cell keep you away from the general population which you want trust me on this this cant be happening hardy said evidently abe went on looking at frannie you broke the first rule of the courtroom you dont insult the judge shes a pompous ass frannie retorted she insulted me first shes allowed to insult you its in her job description what did you say to her i told her i held her in contempt that this whole thing was contemptible hardy was shaking his head believing it all now when frannie got her dander up watch out it got her four days glitsky said four days hardy gathered himself for a beat this isnt about some secret what secret not that i heard from chomorro its about braun glitsky changed to a hopeful tone maybe shell talk to you tomorrow diz no maybe about it hardy said ill tackle her in the hallway if i have to frannie reached across the table dismas you cant let them keep me here the kids need me this is some horrible mistake it just started with this stupid promise thats all they wanted so what is it tell me i promise i wont tell anybody you can hire me as your attorney and itll be privileged nobody will ever know and maybe we can use it as a chip ill go wake up the judge at her house explain the situation glitsky butted in i wouldnt do that what secret frannie ignored abe they could just ask ron you dismas could ask ron go to his house and wake him up call him from here even if he knew i was in jail hed tell them what they want to know he wouldnt let this happen to me what is this secret glitsky asked again frannie finally raised her voice the secret isnt the issue her eyes pleaded with her husband trying to tell him something but what it was remained shrouded in mystery then she shifted her glance quickly to abe i promised ron i gave him my word its his secret dismas maybe if you could call him or go to his apartment and tell him whats going on im sure hell tell you then you come back and get me out of here abe was sifting through an armful of files hed brought in from one of the desks in the homicide detail he found the file he wanted and pitched it across his desk to hardy as you recall from your days as a prosecutor the address is there on the top right broadway hardy glanced down then looked up no phone number a phone number would be nice a lot would be nice in that file diz theres next to nothing there he sighed my first inspector got himself killed about a week into the case you might remember him carl griffin hardy nodded yeah he got killed how he didnt want to talk about any dead policemen especially to his best friend the live one but this might bear on frannie and he had to know some witness meeting went bad we think sergeant inspector carl griffin didn t know it but when he got up from his desk in the homicide detail on the fourth floor of san franciscos hall of justice on monday morning october it was for the last time he was the lone inspector working the murder of bree beaumont a yearold environmental and recently political consultant hed been on the case for six days griffin had been a homicide inspector for fourteen years and knew the hard truths by now if you didnt have a murderer in your sights within four days of the crime it was likely you never would carl was a plodder with a d in personality everybody in homicide including his lieutenant abe glitsky considered him the dullest tack in the unit loyal and hardworking true but also slow culturally ignorant and hygienically suspect still on occasion carl did have his successes he would often go a week sometimes ten days conducting interviews with witnesses and their acquaintances gathering materials to be fingerprinted and other physical evidence throwing everything into unlabeled freezer bags in the trunk of his cityissued car when he was ready hed gather all his junk into some semblance of coherence and sometimes wind up with a convictable suspect not that he often got assigned to cases that needed brains to solve in san francisco nine out of ten homicides were open books a woman kills a man whos beating her a jealous guy kills a wandering girlfriend dope deals go bad gang bangs drunken mistakes lowlifes purifying the gene pool in these cases homicide inspectors collected the evidence that a jury would need to convict the completely obvious suspect and their job was done carl was useful here connecting the dots once in a while since homicides came in over the transom and got assigned to whoever was on call griffin would draw a case that had to be worked this hadnt happened in over two years when the call came in about a politically connected white woman on broadway so glitsky really had no choice it wasnt apparent at the outset that the case was high profile and if the lieutenant had suspected that it would go ballistic he would have assigned other inspectors and carls feelings be damned but as it was griffin got the beaumont case and he was in his sixth day and he hadnt made an arrest after receiving her doctorate from uc berkeley in the early eighties bree had run that institutions environmental toxicology lab for a couple of years before leaving academia to consult for the western states petroleum association and later to work for caloco oil only a few months before her death though shed abandoned the oil company and changed sides in the volatile wars over the multibilliondollar gasoline additive industry going public with her opposition to what she had come to believe were cancercausing additives in california gasoline bree had aligned herself with the state assemblyman from san francisco damon kerry now running for governor the central plank of kerrys platform played on the publics fears that these petroleumbased gasoline additives particularly a substance called mtbe methyl tertiary butyl ether was seeping into californias groundwater in alarming amounts it was dangerous and had to be outlawed but the government wouldn t move on it when bree the oil industrys very photogenic baby had agreed to join his campaign it had given kerry a terrific boost and now after her death radio talk shows hummed with theories that the oil companies had killed bree beaumont either in revenge for her defection or to keep her from giving kerry more and better ammunition to use against them with the election four weeks from tomorrow kerry trailed his opponent by halfadozen points brees death had become big news and every time someone mentioned her name damon kerry came up as well but carl griffin wasnt troubled he had a plate full of active homicides and knew the suspects in three of them he was simply assembling the packages on bree beaumont he was confident he was close to asking for a warrant there was just one piece of information he had to verify and hed have it tied up and wouldnt that just show glitsky and the rest of them who thought he couldnt get anything done on this kind of case thats why he never told anybody about his progress or lack of it he wasnt good with criticism it rankled when other inspectors secondguessed him about what theyd do differently where they d look why they wouldnt talk to the people carl was talking to carl didn t take this as goodnatured ribbing and maybe it wasnt he considered that he was an oldfashioned cop a dog sniffing where his nose led discarding anything that didnt smell following what did his nose told him he was about a step away on beaumont he stood in glitskys doorway on his way out of the office he wore his black raiders windbreaker over an orange and blue hawaiian shirt that he tucked into a shiny pair of ancient black slacks the shirt billowed over his belt he looked about halfway to term griffin was telling his lieutenant that he was going to be seeing a snitch on a gangrelated in the western addition first thing this morning he was late for it now which didnt matter because the snitch would be late too then depending on how things broke with the snitch if he got time he planned to try to find the knife in the sanchez case the crime scene investigators hadnt been able to locate it in the house but hed bet it was somewhere on the block so griffin was going to poke around the shrubs and see what he came up with his guess was she got out of the house and threw it somewhere and then came back before she dialed anyway then glitsky interrupted him how we doin on beaumont pretty good glitsky waited couple more days you writing it all up griffin lifted his windbreaker to show glitsky the notebook tucked into his belt he patted it every word there was no point in pushing griffin would tell him when he had something and hed write it up when he got to it meanwhile it sounded like he was moving steadily on at least two of his other cases it would have to do for now but if beaumont didnt close in a couple of days glitsky knew he would have to pressure carl to share his discoveries he was starting to take heat about it all right griffin started to turn and for some reason glitsky said watch your back carl a nod always griffin wasnt the brightest light in the detail abe said you ever meet him couple of times yeah so you know anyhow we figure he arranged some kind of sting putting the heat on one of his witnesses guy might have been on something and didnt like the way it was going anyway he didnt respond well under pressure felt he was getting doublecrossed and shot carl something like that glitsky made a face we may never know for sure hardy clucked in commiseration then gestured down at the file he was holding so whos got the case now glitsky nodded at the stack of folders hed just gone through i got these off tyler colemans desk that one doesnt look much like its been worked why not glitsky shrugged its their sixth active time they got it the things already over a week old priorities hardy knew homicide inspectors didnt want to waste their time when the kill was no longer fresh the scent disappeared suddenly hardy pulled the telephone around and punched for information a minute later he hung up unlisted of course if it were listed i could just call and save myself an hour but i wouldnt want to do that now would i he was on his feet ive got to go are you going to be around glitsky checked his watch nine oclock i was thinking about seeing orel glitsky was a widower with a fourteenyearold son at home he tried to make some time for him every day some now he looked across the desk into the worried face of his friend you get something call me at home fair hardy pointed a finger they had a deal and hit the door running as hardy drove out to the site of bree beaumonts death he realized that it was going to take some kind of miracle to get frannie out of jail tonight even if he convinced this guy ron frannies friend ron to divulge his secret then what glitsky had counseled him against calling on judge braun at her home and he was right it would only make matters worse and perhaps get hardy his own contempt citation he had to put it out of his mind and take things one step at a time but he kept getting distracted he couldnt understand it how could frannie have let this happen degree by degree now the family truly had a problem that was going to impact both him and their children in a major way and all because frannie had simply gotten her back up at any point she could have done something differently and avoided this mess but she hadnt and that had something to do with ron something personal he didnt want to follow that train of thought which of course made it irresistible what about if frannie was simply a novice at covering her tracks at making excuses shed never had to learn those tricks before because shed never cheated before theyd always told each other everything but now suddenly with ron whoever the hell he was with his dead no his murdered wife things had changed frannie hadnt even mentioned the subpoena hardy couldnt imagine getting a subpoena to appear before the dogcatcher to say nothing of the grand jury and not discussing every detail of it with his wife what had he done how was he connected how should he act what did it mean and yet frannie had been summoned days ago to be a witness in a murder investigation and hadnt mentioned it to him even in passing didnt want to bother him with it he didnt think so he didnt think that was it at all something else was in play here he missed his left turn on to broadway immediately swerved not in time and swearing slammed his hand on the wheel so hard that he thought he might have broken it finally his insides curdled he made the next left that presented itself five blocks later why had he left frannie at the jail allowed himself to be conned out to ask ron beaumont about his damned secret he and frannie had each others trust or they had nothing something was very very wrong with the picture with frannies actions as well as her explanations for them how could she have done this to all of them and perhaps more fundamentally what exactly had she done he opened his window to breathe in some of the cold seascented air it wasnt just anger after all he brought his hand to his chest and pressed his heart was beating strongly all right but he felt as if a piece of it had been nicked away when it gets down to north beach broadway is famous for its strip shows and tawdry tourism but after it moves out of the old italian neighborhood through the citys longest tunnel then across van ness avenue it begins to define the ridge of the escarpment that falls steeply down to cow hollow and the marina at this point the avenue boasts some of the most impressive residential structures in san francisco the palazzos of power brokers share the street with consulates and private mansions and estates the mayor lives on broadway so do one of the states us senators the bestselling author west of mississippi the head of the countrys most profitable fashion house and the managing partner of the citys largest law firm broadway is the legal address and occasional residence of the heads of three of the ten most wealthy families in california overlooking from a great height the spectacular panoramic view of the bay and both of its famous bridges broadway particularly its north side seems as far removed from the mundane cares of working people as it is possible to get and yet hardy reflected this is where bree beaumont had been murdered he had gotten his emotions back in check and was in the grip of what he knew to be a dangerous calm he was sure it was his bodys natural defense to his tendency to feel things too deeply to fall prey to his emotions he would sometimes get this way at trial his concentration focused down to a single point he was going to do what he had to do and do it right later hed reflect on it curse himself drink too much laugh get sick whatever but not now now hed act doublechecking the address he pulled up and parked at the curb aided by his glance at the police report in glitskys office he was recalling the story hed followed in the newspaper after it had broken hed known that the woman bree had been max and cassandras mom so it had been more than ordinarily compelling but frannie had even then never mentioned ron what hardy remembered was that the mother of some of his kids classmates had been killed talk of politics big oil which meant big money a beautiful young victim and somehow his wife was now in the mix the beaumonts lived on the top floor of this monster the penthouse twelve floors up the brass surrounding the glass doubledoor entry was polished to a shine inside the expansive marble foyer which opened on to the elevator banks seemed to shimmer under a couple of enormous chandeliers but there was no getting in the doors were locked as hardy realized he should have expected at this time of night there was a night bell to one side of the door which he pressed but nothing happened he suddenly noticed a light flickering over one of the elevators somebody was coming down turning away he walked about halfway back toward his car then did an about face and waited until the couple came out of the elevator he got to the door at the same time as they opened it going out and thanked them as he passed inside he rang another bell this one from a bank next to the elevators marked beaumont and waited and waited it was a school night at half past ten the family should be home if this were in fact home anymore after brees death the elevator stood open before him and he stepped in pressing the penthouse button he didnt really believe anything would happen in luxury residences such as this one the elevator doors on the upper floors would often open directly into a living area you needed a card or a key to go with the button much to his surprise though the doors closed and he started up he stepped out into a dimly lit lobby ten feet on a side with a hardwood floor covered by a persian throw rug through a westfacing window he could recognize the blinking lights on a tower of the golden gate bridge there was only one door in the lobby and he was standing in front of it but no one answered his ring his knock in a last gesture of futility he grabbed at the handle and the door opened all right he whispered the kid gets a break behind him he heard the elevator door close but he couldnt force himself forward immediately he wasnt fooling himself this wasnt a deserted residence aside from being a recent crime scene although there wasnt any police tape it was somebodys home and entering it without invitation was trespassing if he went in he was putting himself at great risk he might get himself confused for a burglar always bad luck if he got caught he could be disciplined by the state bar and perhaps lose his license to practice law unlawful entry was a very serious matter but there were times that called for risk and this he told himself was one of them his wife had never been in jail before either if ron beaumont came home or a building superintendent or security guard for that matter while hardy was inside he would explain the situation technically he wasnt there to steal so it wasnt a burglary hardy would say he was worried there might have been another crime but really he didnt care he needed to find out where ron might be and the sooner the better in any event fortified by his rationalizations it was always good to have some story he pushed the door all the way open stepped over the lintel and switched on the lights his first sight of the place stopped him cold he thought he remembered from the newspapers that bree beaumont had been a professor at uc berkeley whod gone into industry that may have once been true but if the first glimpse of their abode were any indication the beaumonts had left academic privation far behind he closed the door behind him and was standing in an enormous sunken living room out of architectural digest wealth seemed to infuse the air around him framed modern original art graced the walls each piece tastefully illuminated by recessed lighting there were two seating areas couches in leather and wing chairs in brocaded silk elegant end tables coffee tables a writing desk a pair of matching marble pieces on pedestals along his right side floortoceiling windows displayed the glittering city below following his eyes he stepped up into a formal dining area a granite table and six tubular chairs under an ultramodern lighting device a spacious gourmet kitchen was to his left across a bar of a dark spaceage material beyond the table the wine racks the little seating area off the formal dining room hardy got to the drapes covering the back wall he pulled them back a foot or two the dim light from the living room now all but lost behind him french doors gave on to a balcony he opened them and stepped out noticing the red spanish tiles a small round outdoor dining table and chairs and several plants the balcony was neither large nor small but the view made it magnificent facing due north it was unimpeded for a hundred miles especially on a night like tonight when a brisk breeze scoured the sky free of fog and haze it suddenly hit him this was where bree beaumont had gone down walking to the edge of the balcony he leaned out over the substantial castiron railing and looked down into what from this height appeared to be a square of light the enclosed garden where she had lain undiscovered apparently for several hours stepping back he sensed rather than felt a gust of wind out in front of him it didnt even rustle the plants on the ledge though it did raise the hairs on his neck but he was wasting time out here taking in the sights he had to get something to lead him to ron and then get out if he was to do frannie any good if tonight wasnt already a wash he came back through the drapes into the sitting area off the dining room in a moment hed passed through the kitchen into a hallway hed ignored on his first pass it led off the sunken living room to another wing and on the first step in he turned on the lights the room on his left had a blinking light that caught his attention on a desk sat the telephone answering machine it was an office and as such it might have what he needed crossing the room planning to check first the messages then the rolodex then the computer he heard a creak frozen he stood listening a step back toward the hall an unmistakable sound now the front door opening there was a shift in the light coming out of the living room into the hallway he had company there was no other option hardy cleared his throat loudly and went out to face whoever it was hold it right there im holding it he was standing in the halls entrance his hands wide apart palms out before him at chest height he was looking at a man about his size wearing black slacks tennis shoes and a green windbreaker the man was holding a gun as though he knew what to do with it and this got his complete attention youre hardy guilty he kept his hands in the air it would be a bad time for a sudden movement to get misunderstood i generally let the guy with the gun talk first but maybe i should explain why im here are you ron beaumont the man looked down at the weapon then put it back into its shoulder holster no im phil canetta a sergeant out of central station he came forward youre glitskys pal it wasnt a question hardy nodded i was at the station when he called he said somebody might want to keep on eye on you you were on your way over here and might need some help an aggressive look i didnt expect youd be inside the door wasnt locked i tried it and it opened ive got to find the guy who lives here do you know him beaumont no i saw him the day of the murder thats all i did meet her a couple times hardy must have changed expressions since canetta went on to explain i do some moonlight security convention work parties caloco does a lot of that and bree would be at these things he nodded yeah then and when she was around you noticed i saw her picture in the paper goodlooking woman canetta almost angrily shook his head didnt come close hardy wondered a little at the strong response but canetta was going on so where is everybody i dont know i hope they didnt run were they close to bringing him in the husband i think its crossed their minds are you helping out on this murder somehow hed touched a nerve are you kidding station cops dont investigate murders this is my beat thats all the day it happened i got the call and showed up here and secured the scene until glitskys people showed the professionals he almost sneered the word but then maybe remembering that hardy was glitskys friend he got back to business they must be at a movie out to dinner or something the wall clock read almost eleven hardy shook his head its getting late for kids on a school night but i dont want to just assume beaumonts on the run not when theres so many other alternatives maybe this place freaks out his kids maybe theyre all with relatives does he have any hardy wished hed copied the file that glitsky had given him it might contain some of these details there was one other avenue but hardy wasnt sure how to bring it up he only knew he hated to leave before exploring it you know he said theres an answering machine in the office down that hall eight calls hardy remarked popular guy either that or he hasnt been here in a while canetta nodded i was going to say that next he pointed to the machine lets hit that thing see what it says hardy pushed the button whatever else was going on ron beaumont either hadnt checked or hadnt erased his messages since one oh seven pm on tuesday two days ago it was one of those systems that announced the date and time of the calls so hardy and canetta could place them exactly the first was a man named bill tilton who wanted ron to call back about insurance and left his number canetta had come up beside hardy borrowed a pen from its holder on the desk and was scribbling into a spiral pad hardy thought this was a bit odd but maybe the sergeant wanted to be an inspector someday get beyond station work he also might simply want to solve a murder and rub it in homicides nose the machine kept talking a woman with an asian name kogee sasaka called to remind ron about their appointment although she neglected to leave her number or the time or place of it or what it was about james pierce from caloco asking ron to call him back there were some questions about brees effects and hed like to come up sometime and another woman marie just calling to say hi moving through tuesday afternoon al valens something about brees files some new data she had been working on both sides of the fence hardy pushed the pause button whats that the first guy pierce and this new one valens he works with damon kerry the candidate for governor his campaign manager hardy turned back to canetta for a station cop youve got a pretty good handle on this case dont you a defensive shrug i read the papers whatever they say downtown theres no rule says were not allowed to think so what do you think about these guys sergeant pierce and valens a moment of hesitation seeing if hardy was playing with him then deciding he wasnt something with brees work id guess theyre on opposite sides in these gas additive wars so what would they both want with ron a moments consideration he must know something about her work i dont know maybe thats what i read it was her work that got her killed that means it probably wasnt ron i dont know maybe not canetta shrugged with what hardy thought was an exaggerated nonchalance which brings us back maybe ron knows something i wonder if he knows what it is canetta nodded or finally figured something out if it was her work maybe thats why he ran if he did hardy knew next to nothing about gas additives or the wars related to them his concern was limited to his wife at the moment but if canetta needed to air his theories it wouldnt hurt to listen he pushed the play button again theyd gotten to wednesday morning now yesterday déjà vu as hardy heard theresa wilsons voice again from merryvale the beaumont children hadnt yet arrived at school and she was calling ron to find out why where they might be hardy hit pause so if we assume the kids were at school and got picked up tuesday he left right after that next up was marie for the second time then the last voice hi ron you know i told you about this subpoena i got im worried im sure theyre going to want me to talk about you and bree we need to get together to keep our stories straight but dont call here after about six thirty ill try to reach you again when i can talk are you there ron the tape went silent keep our stories straight canetta said into the vacuum that doesnt sound very good does it hardy turned to him his voice flat that was my wife canetta fixated on frannie telling ron that they had to keep their stories straight to hardy the most telling line had been when she told him not to call after six thirty not to call that is after hardy might be home again the truth jolted him it had been no simple oversight that had kept her from mentioning the subpoena to him she wanted to keep her relationship with ron hidden and this realization though maybe predictable hit him like a jab to the solar plexus but it wouldnt be smart to share his reaction with canetta the point was that there were no hints about rons disappearance on the answering machine hardy wasnt going to locate him not tonight and that meant he wasnt getting frannie out of jail to hardy it was obvious that canetta was consciously resisting the urge to talk about frannies involvement the sergeant cursorily rearranged a few items on the desk when hed stalled long enough he straightened up turned around and cleared his throat well since were here we might as well make sure nobodys dead in the other rooms what do you say they walked down the hallway and turned into the first of the bedrooms a childs room with a twin bed made up neatly with a white lace bedspread there was a collection of dolls on the bed and a decentsized pile of beanie babies in the corner on the wall stenciled roses in halfadozen colors bloomed on the powderblue spongepainted wall canetta walked directly across the room and opened the top dresser drawer look at this hardy came up behind him except for a couple of pairs of socks there wasnt anything to see theyre gone canetta observed wed better be too on the way out hardy made sure the front door was locked behind them the two men rode down the elevator in an awkward silence then crossed the lobby and stepped outside whats your plan now canetta asked hardy didnt know it was late and nothing had worked he shrugged try to find him see if his kids are in school if not tell glitsky i suppose if hes on the run a silence fell and hardy sighed your wife a nod theyve got her locked up at the county jail the two of them frannie and ron he told her some secret again he just trailed off it sounded so lame she told me hed never let her stay down there if he knew she was in jail but it was his secret to tell not hers she promised him canetta had no solace to offer hardy could see what he was thinking and worse didnt blame him well good luck he drove around for a while trying to decide whether to visit the jail again go home and sleep or wake up a judge everything felt wrong finally he wound up on sutter street in front of david freemans building where he worked upstairs in his office hardy called and woke up glitsky at home the lieutenant agreed that ron beaumonts disappearance if thats what it was increased his profile as a murder suspect it didnt help frannie either finally glitsky promised that he would get in early tomorrow and talk to scott randall maybe try to pull a string or two at the jail but he didnt hold out much hope after he hung up hardy thought a moment and seriously considered a night raid on brauns house maybe getting david freeman to accompany him to make his case to the judge but he knew hed only make things worse with any kind of spontaneous act in the mood he was in he had to think develop a plan stay rational but the thought of his wife lying on one of the jail cots surrounded by scum terrified and unprotected made this a tall order it took very little imagination to see her there curled under the thin fabric of the institutional blanket smells of disinfectant sounds of desperation wideeyed and sleepless on the unyielding mattress wondering what shed done how it had happened what tomorrow would bring four days hardy suddenly sat upright with the realization braun had given her four days she couldnt do four days even in adseg he knew his wife or thought he did four days in jail would cause a lot of damage that would be a long time healing he sat trying to come up with something anything but it was the middle of the night and the world was asleep at a little after one oclock he accepted that hed failed he wasnt getting his wife out of jail today if he didnt get at least a little rest he wouldnt be any good for her tomorrow either there was nothing to do but go home but his night wasnt over yet his house was a railroadstyle victorian a long hallway down one side with rooms coming off to the right about fifteen blocks from the beach well within san franciscos belt of nearly perennial fog hed run into the wall of it and by the time hed reached his street his windshield wipers were beating a steady rhythm of course there was no available street parking but tonight he decided to take the risk and left his car in a noparking zone right around the corner on clement he figured hed be up and out before dawn anyway most days the parking enforcers didnt get rolling until well after that the house sat between a brace of fourstory apartment buildings and was set back maybe forty feet from the curb hardy couldnt see it until he was right in front as he opened the gate through the white picket fence he couldnt see moses either sitting on the darkened porch with his back against the front door where is she the surprise of the voice out of the dead night fog almost knocked him backwards when he got moving again he didnt waste any words still locked up lets go inside erin sat in her bathrobe her feet up under her in the window seat the blinds closed against the night and the fog moses paced in front of the fires embers ed cochran snored gently in hardys favorite recliner so hardy had pulled in one of the diningroom chairs and now straddled it backwards after twenty minutes of regaling them with the highlights of his frustrating night hed just asked if either one of them had heard frannie talk about ron beaumont his kids brees death or anything that might relate moses stopped walking folded his arms and scowled he loved his sister but between his work as owner of the little shamrock bar and his family they didnt spend a lot of time sharing special moments hardys eyes went to erin she shifted where she sat and looked somewhere off into the middle distance erin he prompted her what she came back to him i dont know im not sure its anything really she never mentioned anybody by name she hesitated and hardy forced himself to wait until she figured out how she was going to say it from the way she talked i assumed it was another woman one of the mothers from merryvale but it could have been part of this what erin sighed hating to betray her own confidences if thats what this turned out to be this is all nebulous but one of her friends it might not have been this ron or bree evidently had had a marriage go bad a long time ago years now they had a new life here and suddenly this person was afraid the old spouse was going to show up and start causing problems what kind of problems erin shifted again and picked at some thread on her bathrobe for a few seconds custody problems i think but how could that be divorces dont get final until all the custody issues are settled how did this come up anyway if this is her giant secret i dont know why i didnt say it was dismas i dont know if it had anything to do with this thats about as far as it went anyway then suddenly she didnt want to talk about it maybe as though she remembered she couldnt that could be it moses said hardy wasnt so sure but at this point hed take anything how did the whole thing come up in the first place erin shook her head as though she were unsure herself we were just sitting watching rebecca and vincent in the backyard here it couldnt have been more than a couple of weeks ago they were having one of their great afternoons just playing and laughing and being wonderful anyway suddenly really out of the blue frannie said she couldnt imagine maintaining any kind of normal life if she thought someone were going to try to take away her kids i told her she didnt have to worry why was she thinking about that so she started to say something about this friend of hers just what ive told you not anything really she didnt mention a name but now tonight when you asked it occurred to me it could be this ron moses piped in it might explain why he ran hardy was desperate for answers but he didnt think this was one of them we dont know that he did run mose he might be staying at grandmas house for all we know well how can we find that out hardy was done in im working on that he said on his best day david freeman would never qualify as debonair and charming and this wasnt close to his best day he sat now in the predawn at his ancient kitchen table which was laden with yellow legal pads pencils wads of kleenex open and closed lawbooks and a dozen or more unwashed perhaps from the look of them never washed coffee mugs he wore the frayed remains of a maroon bathrobe that had been new during the nixon years gray chest hairs peeked out the top of a similarly graying tshirt of course he hadnt shaved hardy had buzzed him awake only five minutes before his jowls hung his hair rioted and for good measure he was chewing the stub of last nights cigar you know david if the law business ever fades out on you i think you could go into the movies become a leading man maybe marry julia roberts who hardy shook his head never mind if it didnt have to do with the law freeman probably didnt know about it and certainly wasnt interested and hardy wasnt much in the mood for witty banter himself hed slept less than three hours before rolling out of his bed which last night had been his frontroom couch hed given his bed to ed and erin and god bless erin she was taking care of the kids getting them to school covering all those essential bases this was a great relief even though the situation filled him with guilt but hardy couldnt waste energy thinking about the time he wasnt spending with his children frannie was still in jail so i thought youd talk to braun freemans lugubrious face didnt offer any solace its always a pleasure to chew the fat with marian diz but if you think shes going to let anybody out of jail on my personal sayso youve got our relationship wrong how did your sweet wife get herself in so deep hardy outlined it briefly david shifted the cigar butt to the other side of his mouth hardy started to say something ready to stand up for frannies integrity to explain away her insult to marian braun but the old man held up his hand it doesnt matter what she did diz or why you ought to know that by now just wait let me think a minute freeman was justly famous in san francisco as much for his courtroom theatrics as for his knowledge of the law the point was that he got results in an extraordinary number of cases and he didnt care how as a defense attorney his legal mandate was to provide the best defense the law allowed and whether that included arguing some arcane legal point or standing on his head and spitting wooden nickels thats what hed do he was damn proud of the fact that he had no pride and now he was thinking strategy frannie might not be his client yet but hed gotten lots of folks out from behind bars in his time and at base thats really what hardy was asking him to help with it seems to me that weve got two separate contempt charges the secret then getting smart with the judge am i right hardy nodded ok freeman pondered i dont think weve got a habeas on the secret randalls got every right to throw her in jail if she wont spill it talk to susan mcdougal hardy thought it was typical of freeman to show no interest in ron beaumonts secret but if shed apologize to marian say maybe they were both having a bad day would she go there hardy wasnt sure a lot of things involving frannie were in doubt lately and he said so well if she would that might get us to first base then maybe we hit randall or pratt but thatll be a tough nut too glitskys already working on that freeman shook his head you think a police lieutenant is going to persuade randall to let somebody out of jail a lieutenant i might add who somehow got himself out of the loop on this particular homicide and didnt even know the grand jury had convened over it i think youre whistlin dixie obviously somethings going on here between the da and the police glitskys not the way randall will stonewall him how do you know you know randall i caught a couple of his closing arguments for fun hes a hell of a trial lawyer but i dont know what hes made of inside i cant imagine jailing an otherwise good citizen over this unless he knows its the key to a murder conviction it wouldnt be trivial it would help to know if hes got political ambitions whys that freeman regarded hardy as though he were a slow fiveyearold if he is we use the media call a press conference and make him look like an unreasonable detestable miserable son of a bitch keeping a good mother from her loving family but theres a flaw with that too which is your typical prosecutor it makes his day to keep mothers from their families as you know hardy used to be a prosecutor and he remembered it wasnt exactly that he had wanted to separate mothers and children but hed never shed a tear over sending someone hed convicted off to jail even if a relative or lover was sobbing horribly behind him in the courtroom which happened quite frequently so freeman was right hardy shouldnt put any hope in a media campaign with scott randall but pratt might be different the old man said shes got to care about public reaction about votes right weve got an election here in a couple of weeks unfortunately not pratts shes got two more years no matter what we do now still we can try it freeman conceded though it was plain he considered it a long shot of course after her night in jail frannie might have decided that this precious secret of hers isnt the hill she wants to die on especially when she learns her friend may have left town hardy was at the jail at six fortyfive and they let him inside at seven sharp freeman was going to talk to marian braun and try to make some apology with which frannie would go along he hoped he also knew that glitsky would light a fire under the homicide inspectors working the beaumont case to find ron but first there was frannie he had to see her again get some sense of what was happening and to that end he was here the door to the visitors room opened and she stood still as though afraid to move forward perhaps afraid of him the guard shot a questioning look at hardy this ok you ready and as the door closed behind her frannie took one step into the room he wasnt home hardy was using his ive got bad news lawyer voice uninflected and neutral reciting facts ron wasnt there hes moved out she didnt look any better than she had the night before but she didnt look worse either maybe shed slept a little the worst thing was this tension that seemed to keep her from moving forward hardy had spent so much time punishing himself for his inability to get her sprung out of jail that it had never occurred to him that she might be harboring similar selfloathing feelings for what shed put him and the kids through something in her look and that thought struck him now he would take the first literal step reaching for her with a heartrending sob she fell into his arms i couldnt tell you last night dismas abe was there remember he came in just as we got to it or started to so tell abe too she shook her head i couldnt do that i told ron that i couldnt promise not to tell you that i told you everything but abe wouldnt be the same thing at all couldnt you have just asked him to leave last night step outside for a minute no not in front of you then he would have known id told you something wouldnt he and what could that be except rons secret he wouldnt have let it go you know abe its not a matter of trust but hes a cop hes always a cop first even with you hardy knew she was right a couple of years before hed had a case where hed gotten confused on that point and abe hadnt talked to him for several months if abe knew that hardy was holding a secret that related to one of abes cases and didnt tell him about it it would be tricky at best frannie had saved him from having to deal with that she sat next to him her hands holding his on her lap she was still in jail but at least they were talking now man and wife again what he really wanted to know about was the relationship between her and ron but he wouldnt ask that specifically it shouldnt matter she was his wife and she needed his help that was todays issue when she was out of this situation hed deal with the rest of it also he told himself that if it did matter if something threatening to their marriage was going on then she should tell him she would tell him wouldnt she he knew that the betrayal of failing to tell would be worse than anything she might have done she would tell him but he couldnt ask directly hed go general and see how she went with it he put on his lawyer face and asked in his least aggressive tone so whats this all about frannie was using his hands as a pair of worry beads he noticed she was shaking and took off his nylon jacket he put it over her shoulders the guard knocked and said she was going to miss breakfast if this meeting didnt end but hardy with his vast legal expertise finagled a couple of cups of coffee and this mornings food unit biscuits and gravy for which they waited a few minutes in an uncomfortable silence why doesnt he ask me she was thinking can he really care so little that he doesnt even ask if it were me thats the only question id have about me and ron hes been in this business too long thats it its changed him so fundamentally now he sits there so cold and clinical and hes got another case another problem to solve never mind if his wifes been unfaithful he just wants to know what happened just the facts maam but it wasnt a joe friday joke with him it was his essence please dismas would you just care enough about us to ask she tried to will him to talk but he only sat at the table patient and understanding waiting for her breakfast to be delivered occasionally he would squeeze her hand the way he might comfort any female client she wanted to punch him when the tray arrived frannie took a few quick bites she was famished she had been so upset last night that shed been unable to get down any of her evening meal finally she put the plastic spoon down and sipped at her coffee ok she spoke to herself in a near whisper as though afraid that even in this private room someone would hear but this has to stay between us this secret that can get you out of jail you want me to know and not use it thats the only way i can tell you dismas thats what i promised ron i cant tell you as my lawyer especially not as my lawyer only as my husband youll understand when you hear what it is hardy wasnt sure this would prove to be true he wasnt understanding much of this as it developed but he knew he had to know and to know he had to promise not to tell he wasnt comfortable with any part of the idea and beyond his own personal reservation there were two other basic professional reasons for his reluctance to make this promise as a licensed attorney he was an officer of the court obliged to cooperate with law enforcement in a whole slew of public matters the second reason was even more fundamental if frannie told her secret to him as her lawyer it would be protected under the attorneyclient privilege no court could make him reveal it it was a shield what frannie was asking was fraught with danger as a private citizen he could very easily find himself called before the grand jury and in the same position as his wife unable to testify tossed into the clink beyond that if he got into any investigation about ron beaumont and he couldnt claim privilege then he could very easily picture himself having to lie about what he did or didnt know to the very people glitsky canetta who might be helping him it was ugly in all respects and he tried to explain it all calmly to frannie but she wasnt budging no she still spoke in a nearwhisper but her voice was firm what will happen is that youll trust the privilege and whats your point thats how it works but sometimes it doesnt sometimes the system doesnt work uh oh hardy said what the system doesnt work that oldie but goodie greatest hit of the sixties except i get nervous when i hear it because ill tell you what sometimes the system does work it didnt in rons case it betrayed him her eyes had some of that old spark back in them although hardy wasnt especially delighted to see it she reached out toward him and her voice softened dismas you have to believe me on this ron had a reason not to trust lawyers youll see i dont doubt that hardy said i dont trust too many of them myself but this is me you the person not you the lawyer he hung his head and shook it from side to side his wife had her hand on his knee he drained the last gulp from the plastic cup of tepid coffee all right he said i promise its between you and metheperson metheson and metheholyghost lets hear it frannie took a last look back toward the door to the room making sure no guard lurked to overhear then she came back to hardy took a breath and began ron and bree had been fighting a lot over this change in her jobs hardy didnt like this opening i really hope that after all this preamble youre not going to tell me oh yeah i remember he did kill her after all the concept wasnt all that funny but she forced a smile he didnt kill her he was with me when she died whether or not this was good news remained a question but he wasnt saying anything about it right now all right im listening what were they fighting about well her old job with the oil company was evidently pretty great anonymous but big money she did her research and wrote her papers and nobody paid too much attention out in the real world she was kind of a star inhouse i mean she played a big role paving the legislative way for this threebilliondollar industry but she wasnt really a public figure but when she signed on with kerry that changed right she started getting a lot of press right away about all the problems with these oil additives so why was this an issue with ron i mean if she was the one working why did he have any say in it same reason i have some kind of input on what you do the clients you take at least i think i do dont i this was true frannie wouldnt want him to defend say the tobacco companies or a mass murderer and if he decided he had towanted toneeded to they would certainly have words on the topic but this whole area didnt need to be aired not this morning on top of everything else hardy glossed over it youre right but were not talking about me and you were talking about ron and bree and they were arguing right right she was tightening up as clipped as he was but he had to keep pushing her he had to know ok and what were they arguing about politics money but frannie surprised him no nothing like that it was the kids rons kids max and cassandra they werent her kids no ron was already divorced once theyre his from that time ok and and what how was this new job going to affect the kids suddenly hardy remembered the discussion hed had with erin and moses last night is this the custody thing you mentioned to erin a look of chagrin her own carelessness coming back to hurt her how did erin connect that with ron i never mentioned him she didnt even mention him to erin this news more secrets didnt make his heart sing but hardy had a craggy smile he could trot out for juries and he employed it now a deflection when something really bothered him and he didnt dare show it i think some crafty lawyer might have helped her but im missing the connection here job and fights ok but how does that relate to custody frannie wasnt ready to say exactly not just yet ron thought she was sacrificing the safety of his children for some vague notion of all future children at hardys uncomprehending gaze she pressed on she had come to believe that these gas additives were ruining the water supply she was all worried about cancer clusters and deformed babies and st ron didnt want her to expose all of this why not she frowned they were getting to the crux of it because the more bree became a public figure the better the odds that rons exwife found out where he was and why would that be a problem for the children i mean was she a stalker something like that not exactly he waited then had to prompt her frannie it sounded to hardy as though she were trying the words out for the first time to see how they flew she was abusive who the exwife a nod dawn her name was dawn she was frannie seemed to be stumbling over the words uh she was starting to try to make money off the kids ron found some pictures are we talking kiddie porn here frannie nodded hardy blew out a long breath jesus so he filed for divorce but even before it got to court she started accusing him saying he took the pictures and the judge believed her and she got custody but hes got them now i know she said he had to take them back what do you mean take them back it took a beat for the meaning of it to sink in are you saying he kidnapped his own children frannie didnt like that terminology maybe technically but that wasnt what it was he was saving them and then after hed gone through all that bree was going to threaten the whole he held up a hand wait a minute wait a minute forget about bree youre telling me ron lost the custody battle in court and then he took the kids when was this about eight years ago hardy sat riveted to his chair barely hearing her she continued he managed to get set up out here change his name get together with bree and everything was going along fine until she got involved with this kerry she stopped hardy couldnt hold back the sarcasm everything was going along fine except that he was wanted for kidnapping but that wasnt a real problem yes it was frannie i dont care what he told you but she was shaking her head no that was over nobody was looking for him anymore there wasnt a problem until he and bree started fighting and he thought even that would blow over until hardy cut her off again his earlier patient and understanding persona was taking a beating until she had the bad grace to get herself killed he dragged his palm across his forehead so where is he now i dont know he tried to keep his voice modulated but wasnt entirely successful you realize of course that if the police get anywhere on this theyre going to come to the conclusion that he killed her the truth is i think he killed her he didnt kill her dismas hes desperate hes trying to save his children he kidnapped his children to save them maybe he killed his wife to save her or heres a thought maybe he killed his wife to save the kids again maybe hell kill you next he didnt kill anybody hes not going to kill anybody hardy would have said that he was at the end of his tether when hed arrived at the jail now there was no doubt about it he was completely wrung out frannies hollow denial gonged in his ears but he knew he was powerless to convince her of anything but what she already thought not today in any case not now he consciously reined himself in sought a different path so rons gone and youre here telling the grand jury what you know cant make any difference now to him of course it can if they search for him and find him theyll take his kids but theyre not even trying to locate him yet you told me that they will be frannie hes going to be their prime suspect as soon as hes officially missing which is going to happen like two minutes after abe starts looking for him by tuesday morning when it meets again the grand jurys going to indict him for brees murder you wait and see this hard fact and hardy believed it was the whole truth finally seemed to get through to her she slumped back in her chair hugging his jacket around her when she looked up at him the fight had gone out of her still she wasnt backing down she said it flatly he didnt kill her dismas he sighed all right lets go with that either way what do you want me to do now lou the greeks was a dark barrestaurant in the basement of a bail bondsmans building across the street from the hall of justice when hardy was at court hed often stop into the place for some kind of lunch or a drink at the end of the day lou the greek had married a chinese woman and every day she would put together her own version of californiaasian cuisine all over the city celebrity chefs were making their reputations and fortunes by marrying the finest ingredients from the pacific rim and creating stunning masterpieces lobster ravioli in a lemongrassinfused beurre blanc tuna sashimi over tuscan white beans with thyme and wasabi mustard here at lous youd get stuffed grape leaves with sweetandsour sauce fried squid floating in a bowl of dip made from garlic cucumbers and yoghurt surprisingly most of lous wifes stuff tasted pretty good even if the architecture of the plate as they called it left a little something to be desired but it was still hours from lunchtime and hardy wasnt there to eat anyway he was tucked into a corner booth around a mug of coffee waiting for david freeman after leaving frannie hed gone by glitskys empty office leaving a note about rons disappearance then went down to the third floor to confront scott randall personally physically wasnt even out of the question even though it was well past eight oclock there wasnt a soul in the entire das wing and they wondered why their conviction rates were in the toilet convictions hell they didnt even charge crimes in san francisco at the same rate as in other counties so hardy went to lous to wait perhaps to try and think hed all but forgotten about the existence of the drinking breakfast crowd guys and girls who were here when the door opened at six am and had a couple of beers or a bloody mary he recognized halfadozen fringe players from around the hall and wondered how many of them recognized their need for a morning pickmeup as any kind of danger sign but being a supercilious bastard was an easy game to play at the moment he didnt feel he had much of a leg up on any of them his wife was still in jail and all of his training discipline sobriety and connections werent doing her any good at all for half a second he considered downing a couple of shots of something put himself into creative mode and out of his linear head until some great idea presented itself except that those great wet ideas and hed had plenty never seemed to make the cut after the hangover lou was silent with a surly edge this morning and that suited hardy to his toes he pushed his mug toward the side of the table and got it topped up just as david freeman slid into the booth across from him hey lou give me one of those fast would you three sugars black christ its dark in here you ever notice that diz the food looks better that way what did braun say freeman wasnt in any hurry to get to it he fiddled with his jacket for a minute and squirmed down into the leatherette seat marian you know i took her out a couple of times when we were both starting out everybody called her marian the librarian of course great legs freeman sighed remembering then clucked sympathetically she used to be a lot more fun we all did david not true take me for example im in my prime have been for a while actually im happy for you hardy replied whats the opposite of prime thats where i am what did marian say about my wife freeman had his hands folded on the table between them lou was back with his coffee and freeman pulled it over in front of him blowing on it stalling david a glance over the mug truth is and she didnt make any bones about it shes not too happy with her truth is im not so much either a pause so i gather she didnt tell you the big secret hardy shrugged that off he didnt even want to start trying to explain this mess to david freeman if he got even a taste of the bone hed gnaw it to dust she says its a matter of honor she gave her word and she cant tell he made a face but that wasnt the issue with braun anyway no freeman agreed though that might have been better if it was only a matter of law he let it hang there shes pissed very hardy swore would it help if i talked to her got frannie to apologize did you tell her there are young children involved here i brought out the heavy artillery diz she doesnt how can i put this give a shit she said frannies done it to herself brauns never in her career had anybody show such disrespect for the bench thats got to be an exaggeration it doesnt matter if it is if thats how the judge feels freeman shrugged the two of em got into a cat fight diz thats what happened but frannie didnt do anything david shes going along living her life our life shes not a criminal not even a suspect for anything material witness not even that not really again freemans maddening nonchalant shrug the law was the law you could rant about it all you want as people complained about the weather and to about as much effect its the grand jury diz you know as well as i do hell youve even used it hardy couldnt deny it grand juries had awesome power when hed been a prosecutor going before the grand jury had been one of his favorite pastimes he would take a recalcitrant witness put him in front of the panel without his attorney present no judge to keep things on point and keep that poor sucker up there for hours often without a food or water or bathroom break asking leading questions doing whatever it took to get his evidence on to the record because thats what the grand jury was for and though scott randall was certainly abusing it now hardy had to remember that the grand jury had come into existence and still functioned as a vehicle to protect civil rights because of its secrecy provisions and the teeth with which infractions against them were enforced the grand jury was the only place where prosecutors could get answers from scared or recalcitrant witnesses where the truth could come out nobody could ever know you were even there or what you might have said you were safe from your enemies from corrupt officials from the prying media in theory anyway but now frannie he would not have dreamed this could ever happen to someone in his personal life and never to his wife frannie wasnt living on the edge of the law she wasnt like the others except that now to marian braun and scott randall it appeared that she was even after all of his experience with the law this perspective hit him with almost a concussive force the law could happen to anybody again freemans analogy with the weather a hurricane had just swept frannie up and now she was in it but freeman was resolutely moving ahead as he did problemsolving have you talked to anybody yet whos found the husband whats his name beaumont ron beaumont no glitsky wasnt around i left him a note im going back up after were done here but lets not leave frannie im not leaving her i think we ought to go to the newspapers with this after all even if randall and pratt dont fold marian might be responsive to that kind of pressure at least its worth a shot he drank some coffee but i think we need to consider cutting our losses which are the four days unless they locate mr beaumont and can get him to talk shes got herself a bigger problem than four days scott randall was sitting in a folding chair his legs crossed comfortably with him in the large but spartan expanse of sharron pratts office were homicide lieutenant abe glitsky homicide sergeants tyler coleman and jorge batavia and randalls own das investigator peter struler randall was having himself a fine morning at last things were moving along on beaumont and all because of this frannie hardy woman sometimes he reflected you just had to take prisoners and if it got to that as it had here then invariably you alienated some people in this case it was glitsky and his sergeants well randall thought maybe next time they got a hot homicide they would try to keep their investigation alive even if there happened to be a crisis in the department for now they just had their noses out of joint because randall and struler had actually made progress on a case they considered all but closed turf wars too bad for them but glitsky as head of the homicide detail naturally had to put a different face on it now he was barking at pratt i know this woman sharron she is a close personal friend she watched my kids for a month after my wife died she should not be in jail evidently judge braun doesnt agree with you lieutenant im not sure i do either pratt didnt like glitsky she thought the police were out to undermine her authority and make her look bad whenever and wherever they could for her part the da took every opportunity to criticize the force shed run for office on a platform of stomping out police brutality nowhere near the greatest of the citys many problems the police department union had supported her opponent and she wasnt likely to forget it she would often choose not to have her office prosecute a suspect that the police had already arrested because she didnt believe in socalled victimless crimes so at least every week or two shed simply set free suspected prostitutes druggies and other assorted misunderstood persons but she wasnt going to release frannie hardy no siree there were legal principles involved here she was standing her ground isnt this woman she asked isnt her husband the attorney he used to work at this office didnt he randall spoke up until he got fired glitsky shot him a look he quit randall didnt rise to it check the record he retorted mildly back to pratt dismas hardy and he was fired pratts mouth turned up a millimeter a beaming smile for her ah yes ive tried to work with him before glitsky noted the emphasis on the word tried and pratts use of it didnt bode well for the hardy camp but he wasnt through fighting for frannie not by a long shot look he summoned up a conciliatory tone sharron we dont have any evidence at all that connects ron beaumont to this murder were looking at him sure but by all accounts he was in fact out having coffee with mrs hardy when his wife was killed even mr randall doesnt dispute that but scott wasnt going to let glitsky put words in his mouth he piped right up its a big window of time actually theres a lot of room for doubt but this wasnt where glitsky wanted to pick his fight so he resisted the urge to snap back instead he rolled his eyes and pressed on and if we find that mr beaumont fits into that window of time well probably get closer to a warrant but thats my point right now the investigation is nowhere and precisely why i took it over and gave it to senior investigator struler here glitsky tried to ignore randall to direct himself to pratt the original investigating officer died sharron there wasnt any intentional footdragging i havent heard anyone make that accusation lieutenant pratt smiled again thinly but the point my point is that mr randall was conducting his own investigation due to the unfortunate lack of progress that yours was making glitsky started to open his mouth but she stopped him holding up a hand and in the course of his investigation mr beaumont became a suspect for the murder and so his associates became relevant targets for interrogation ok glitsky conceded and frannie hardy didnt answer a question he turned to randall do you have any idea how often our witnesses dont answer questions scott if we locked any percentage of them up any percentage one two per cent wed have to rent the whole city of san bruno just for the warehouse space to hold em randall wasnt hearing it but this a murder case abe were not looking for some shoplifter here glitsky all but exploded what do you think im talking about im in homicide all i see are murder cases and i dont get a witness in a hundred wholl tell me what time it is if theres not something in it for him and his dog he modulated his voice again feigning a calm rationality that fooled no one in the room what im getting at sharron is that this may have been an overreaction on all sides frannie should have been given a day or two to go home and think about what she would be comfortable comfortable randalls turn to let go i dont care if shes comfortable i dont want her to be comfortable she knows something critical to a murder case you dont know that and until she tells what that is weve got a murderer walking around on the streets this time it was batavia who interrupted youre out of your mind randall you got nothing youre nowhere here shes probably just fucking the guy and doesnt want her husband to find out the lieutenants right you got nothing on beaumont no motive no means opportunity forget it let the lady go would you jesus i got to go to the bathroom and with that he was out the door charming gentleman pratt said good cop glitsky responded randall came forward in his folding chair i dont care if hes the king of england hes not giving me any suspects so i develop my own and build my case and from where im sitting frannie hardys right in the middle of it glitsky caught the eye of batavias partner tyler coleman gave the secret sign and they both stood up i wish youd think about it some more sharron this is really wrong she looked him right in the eye i will abe i promise while glitsky and coleman were waiting for the elevator batavia emerged from the hallway behind them if assholes could fly he said that place would be an airport glitsky himself tried to limit his profanity to a word or two a year but he appreciated a wellturned phrase the scar between his lips tightened in amusement but coleman was still seething implicit in everything that had just transpired in pratts office was the accusation that he and his partner had booted one if theres such a fire under this one abe why didnt we hear about it the elevator door opened and they squeezed in amid the rest of the clerks cops lawyers and citizens glitsky had at one time decided that it could be an instructive display of authority to talk in a crowded elevator and he answered coleman as if they were alone in his office he also thought it wouldnt be all bad if some spy from the airport he hoped that batavias new nickname for the das office would have a long life heard him taking mr scott randall to task for his misguided enthusiasm maybe hed also drop a little rumor about scotts ambitions that his boss wouldnt appreciate all that much randall wants a highprofile case thats all vince he wants out of this lowrent office into the big private money this buildings not big enough for him so due process takes a powder batavia was also immune to elevator squelch his voice boomed in the enclosed space but he doesnt have a goddam thing abe like i said in there the doors opened and they stepped out whats this window of time shit anyway everything weve read or heard the guy was dropping the kids at school going for coffee but here though he hated it glitsky had to admit that technically randall wasnt all wrong he had to give coleman and batavia his reading that even if frannies alibi was righteous ron beaumont still could have killed his wife brees body hadnt been discovered in the patio for several hours and the coroner hadnt been able to fix a precise time of death it could have been three hours plus or minus he concluded were going on around eight thirty on the theory that ron left the house a little before that and says she was still alive the kids say it too how about that batavia wasnt ready to give anything to scott randall but glitsky knew that the homicide cops worst enemy was imprecision well maybe second worst after jumping to conclusions but certainly way up there he corrected batavia i hate to say it jorge but the kids were a little vague coleman popped in hey its two days after their mom died for christs sake and they didnt remember what she had for breakfast i dont blame em hell i dont remember what i had for breakfast today i dont even know if i ate breakfast donuts batavia said remember lanier brought up guys glitsky stopped at the door to the homicide detail the point is rons not eliminated ok batavia wasnt letting it go the kids said the mom was there abe glitsky shook his head ron prompted them read the one transcript griffin got around to getting typed carl didnt get the kids to talk to him with their father out of the room and not to speak ill of the dead but i do so wish he had and lets not forget that ron has left his home and gone to parts unknown all right shit batavia had a habit of dismissing himself he was turning now on his heel on his way to his desk jorge it was his lieutenant he had to stop were not done here this is still our case randall hasnt charged anybody he took a step back i thought you just said glitsky cut him off i didnt say it was ron i said he wasnt impossible but one things for sure hes randalls guy isnt he i mean the das committed to ron beaumont now nobody else you hear what im saying coleman did he looked at his partner anybody else would be like a teeny tiny embarrassment dont you think glitsky watched his inspectors making sure they both got it as batavias face broke into a smile of comprehension he pointed a finger go he said but ive got to find ron hardy said how about your guys find ron first then they start on everybody else it was a longstanding tradition in homicide that the lieutenants desk held a stash of peanuts glitsky was taking advantage of this naturally occurring phenomenon eating a hearty breakfast of donuts peanuts and tea he broke a shell thoughtfully you got any ideas where we look to find ron no but hes got to have some family maybe somebody at the school who hed want them to notify in case of emergency a reluctant sigh ok thats not bad we can try that ill send a squad car back to his place too couldnt hurt but i wouldnt hold my breath diz if he took his car and hes gone what did you say three days already then he could be in chicago by now if he flew it could be anywhere ok but if he flew especially with the two kids theres a record of it glitsky was shaking his head slowly sadly his friend hadnt gotten much sleep and it was showing diz you know im feeling for frannie i just went a few rounds with pratt over it but we cant go large on ron we dont have the personnel and if we did theyd have better things to do abe the guys a murder suspect maybe maybe but he came in and talked to the grand jury when they asked him and answered all their questions they were done with him nobody gave him a thought as a suspect until frannie mentioned their little secret he threw a peanut into his mouth and grabbed for his tea randall didnt even tell him not to leave town maybe they went camping or to disneyland who knows the mom just died diz they feel squirrely where she lived its weird there this stuff happens whats up with frannie hardy shook his head shes not talking glitsky did his stilllife imitation after a few seconds he cracked another peanut braun cut her any slack nope another long moment of nothing finally glitsky spread his hands well hardy stood up this cant be happening he said glitsky had lost his own wife to cancer a few years before that couldnt be happening either he nodded there wasnt anything left to say hardy finally got finished at the hall and the jail his latest frustrating and unproductive visit with frannie after that he had stopped by his office to check on freemans progress if any and then waiting for freeman to return from court had nodded off when he awoke from the twohour nap on the couch in his office nothing had changed he couldnt sit still any longer he had to make something happen glitsky had promised him that hed send a squad car over to merryvale to try to get an indication of ron beaumonts whereabouts but that wasnt going to be good enough it would fall under the category of ordinary business hardy doubted whether glitsky would even send homicide inspectors some uniforms could take the information and pass it along upstairs well hardy decided why should he wait when he could do the same thing himself merryvales principal theresa wilson was a nononsense handsome woman in her midforties she was standing as hardy was shown into her office her handshake would have been impressive in a linebacker and her smile under a closecropped henna mop appeared at the same time to be both genuine and professional also impressive she didnt hide behind her desk either but met him by the door leading him to a small corner grouping of upholstered chairs mr hardy i hope your being here doesnt mean bad news for your wife please sit down the barebones explanation took less than a minute it was a misunderstanding about some point of ron beaumonts alibi on the morning of his wifes death and somehow frannie had gotten in the middle of it but thats terrible shes not under any kind of suspicion herself i hope theres no sign of that so far mrs wilson read between the lines of that so how long might this continue until they let frannie out of jail a shrug downplaying the drama of it best case it might only be a couple of days she thinks ron beaumonts gone camping or something with his kids and when he gets back and finds out whats going on with her hell come in and straighten out the whole mess but you dont think that no what do you think i dont know if ron killed his wife but my guess is he started to feel some heat from the police investigation and decided to take his kids and run but i thought she paused hardy read her mind the alibi with frannie was solid but evidently the time of death opened another door he thought he was going to be arrested at least thats my opinion he leaned back into the chairs cushion and its why ive come here to you she looked him a question i realize youre probably not allowed to give out any information about your students but i was hoping you might be able to tell me if you know im wrong how would i well say if the beaumont kids have been in school the last couple of days if rons given some kind of excuse hardy gave her a weary smile it looks like hes moved out of his home probably tuesday afternoon id like to know if youve heard anything from him since then as he expected she was torn between his dilemma and her duties as principal ron beaumont is a wonderful man mr hardy he volunteered here all the time really i dont believe hes any part of this either but that wasnt hardys dilemma he had to give it more urgency please mrs wilson i want to be clear that im not asking you to tell me where he is if you know also if youre protecting the children ok i understand they must be having a rough go of it no matter whats happening but if youve heard nothing then i think that increases the chances that ron is on the run either that or a sudden new possibility or somethings happened to him he stopped elbows on knees hands spread please he repeated if i dont find him frannie stays in jail after an excruciating minute mrs wilson stood up and crossed to her desk where she reached over grabbed at a folder opened it and withdrew a sheet of paper another beat of hesitation she turned around crossed back to hardy and handed him the paper im really not allowed to discuss any details of the childrens lives without the parents consent as i know you understand it was a list of about twenty names under the heading absentees and the days date there were asterisks next to four of the names and two of them were beaumont there was also the number three in parentheses which hardy took to mean number of days running at the bottom of the page an asterisk indicated that the absence was unexcused mrs wilson hadnt heard a thing the children were gone without a trace you dont think somethings happened to mr beaumont and his children too do you maybe the person who murdered his wife a startled expression at the unthinkable that had just surfaced you dont think it could have been him after all do you i sure hope not mrs wilson lets not think that ok hardy was waiting by the curb outside merryvale when the bell rang to end the school day vincent was in the car almost before hardy saw him gingerhaired after his mother and freckly he was the allamerican tenyearold boy wheres mom now why are you here he was sure that his son didnt mean it to sound so accusatory so unwelcoming but there it was hed better deal with it since he had a feeling it was going to get worse after his daughter arrived rebecca had developed an impressive knack of late pushing his buttons not letting anything go driving down on his way to the school hed decided how hed break the news on his precise phrasing your mothers down at the jail this had a decidedly familiar ring in the family since hardy himself was often visiting clients who were behind bars his children were accustomed to hearing the words they wouldnt by themselves produce trauma he hoped and when he tried them on vincent they seemed to go down well enough what for he asked still calm hardy went for the noble spin they wanted her to tell a secret that shed promised not to and now wheres mom rebecca had the back door open throwing backpack and lunch pail into the car in front of her she promised shed be helping paint our classs halloween booth she promised and it was today and beck hold it hold it shes at the jail vincent piped into the silence he appeared to be delighted with the news and definitely happy to be the one to break it finally he got to tell his sister something she didnt know although for a moment it didnt register well she promised me first there were two other moms waiting and waiting and she didnt even call and so here i am with my friends and their moms showed up and im all embarrassed hardy snapped his fingers and pointed directly at her stop it right now his daughter glared sullenly back at him did you hear what your brother just said she turned to vincent easier pickings what she snapped never mind anyway power play of the fourth graders hardy thought hed better get driving so he wasnt tempted to thrash his children right there in front of the school where everybody would see the becks teasing nanana voice i dont care i heard you anyway oh yeah so what did i say braceface vincent you said she was in jail stupid this brought the wail daad you heard that the beck just called me stupid he called me braceface first tin grin in the back seat something was thrown something connected vincent was screaming and swinging hey hey hey hardy knew his face had gone crimson somehow hed pulled over to the curb again and turned around in his seat at the top of his voice stop this stupid stupid bickering and fighting stop it right now another finger pointed this time at vincent and dont tell me im not supposed to say stupid this is stupid dont you two ever think about anything but yourselves i said your mothers in jail and youre screaming at each other about nothing just to hear yourselves scream youre the one screaming the beck had selfrighteous indignation down to a fine art she was right and that was just too bad for the rest of humanity you didnt say in jail vincent wailed as hysteria mounted more tears broke you said she was down at the jail not in jail so much for plan a at last rebecca seemed to hear moms in jail what do you mean in jail how could mom be in jail vincent when does she get out what did she do are we ever going to see her again now they were both crying daddy beck asked anguish through her tears how could you let this happen finally finally after they got home he and erin and ed succeeded in convincing the kids that frannie was going to be ok this was a funny glitch in the legal system which they were always hearing dad talk about anyway right this time it had just happened to their family mom was sticking up for a friend of hers and uncle abe was there working right across the way taking care of her and sure she might be gone for a few days but she was all right in a really nice cell a country club in fact it was kind of like a vacation for mom and the beck and vincent got to stay with grandma and papa ed for the weekend it would be fun an adventure there wasnt anything to worry about hardy alone on friday evening pacing his home front to back was trying to come to some any conclusions and develop a plan all he knew for sure was that he would go back and see frannie again tonight freshly armed with the news that ron hadnt simply gone fishing or something if that had been the case he would have told mrs wilson and there would have been no asterisk but he knew that this information wasnt going to sway his wife she would tell hardy that of course ron had had to disappear because of his children he couldnt let the law get involved with him he would have had no choice and fool that he was hardy had promised frannie that he wouldnt reveal what she had told him whether or not he believed a word of it never mind that hed lost his claim to attorneyclient privilege he realized that hed done something that was potentially far more debilitating he couldnt talk to anybody about this not glitsky freeman moses erin nobody he shouldnt ever have promised frannie but now that he had if he wanted to keep faith with her he was stuck the telephone jarred him from these thoughts sometime before he must have stopped pacing because he was sitting at his kitchen table a cup of coffee untouched and cold in front of him the light had changed as another afternoons load of fog had settled outside he stood and picked up on the second ring its going to be on the five oclock news freeman wasnt much of a preamble kind of guy he heard hardys voice and he was talking i called a press conference and it must be a slow news day everybody came you should have been here this is where the action is what are you doing home anyway im picking out new curtains for the bedroom he said whats going to be on the news frannie and braun and randall they loved it they ate it up i wouldnt be surprised if it hit the national wires if i were you id expect some calls myself pretty soon play up the wife and mother torn from her family part what other part is there freeman hesitated well theres probably going to be some reporters with dirty minds too you might take this as a heads up not blow off on them then back to strategy i really think this might get to pratt persuade her to pull the rug out from randall and get him to reconsider what do you hear about brees husband he left town hardy told him about checking at merryvale the kids being gone do the cops know this hardy realized with a shock that they probably didnt he hadnt thought to call glitsky because the lieutenant had told him he wasnt really interested in ron beaumont as a suspect but freeman was right his running changed that ill call as soon as i get off with you you ought to get to frannie too she discovers that hes really run he looks like a murder suspect she might want to change her mind about protecting him thats a good idea he said biting his tongue ill do that check the news first freeman said starts in about five minutes channel four im on it and david thanks freeman laughed are you kidding this is what i live for he thought the idea of calling glitsky was a good one although his inspectors would be happy if they found a suspect other than ron for the murder of bree the fact that ron had apparently fled the jurisdiction would have an impact on abe hed have to do something why is that the lieutenant asked exasperation starting to leak out what do you want me to do find him abe he looks a lot better for the murder now youve got to admit that maybe a little better but scott randalls already out beating the bushes trying to find him the feeling here is that it might be fun to watch him for a while and meanwhile frannies rotting hardy could hear the patient exhale over the telephone line another beat have you made any progress with judge braun did freeman no well then it looks like frannies in for four days no matter what doesnt it hardy had no ready answer for this it was the truth glitsky went on logical and detached ron could walk in here tonight with a signed confession including everything randall wanted from frannie and my understanding is that it wouldnt make a hill of beans difference am i wrong hardy knew he wasnt frannie was in jail on two separate contempt charges even if she talked now she would still have to complete paying her personal fourday debt to marian braun and on the other hand even if braun rescinded that citation frannie would remain in jail on the secret until scott randall said she could go hardy knew all this although it wasnt any solace look abe maybe i can still get braun maybe is the key word here look diz ive pleaded with pratt ive tried to bully randall ive been over to see frannie twice and make sure theyre taking care of her which it seems like they are i dont like this any more than you do i know abe im not saying youre not but anything to do with ron beaumont isnt the issue for the next three days your immediate problem is with braun but if you found ron put out a warrant got other agencies looking then what thats going to happen when the grand jury reconvenes on tuesday anyway theyre going to indict him unless my guys find somebody else and then the whole world will be looking for him so theyll probably find him but even then if hes a killer hes not going to say anything then whats frannie going to do i dont know abe i just dont know lord the cop voice softened abe clearly felt for him was even trying to help on several fronts but there just wasnt anything he could do what do you think diz she give you a hint what this is this all about you got any ideas at all he had to force the words not a clue abe he lied not a damn clue fifteen minutes after the news ended he had his coat on and was walking out the door when the telephone rang again he was sure it was the beginning of the onslaught of the reporters and was going to let his answering machine get it while he drove downtown but then he remembered that it might be erin or the kids so he decided to monitor the call and stood listening at the hallway extension hello an unfamiliar voice probably a reporter and one who was good enough to have scored hardys unlisted number he sounded obviously disappointed that it hadnt connected with his interview well hardy didnt want to talk to reporters he got to the front door on his way out the voice continued im trying to reach dismas hardy my name is ron beaumont and i just saw the news report on hardy grabbed at the phone and said hello mr hardy how are you well not so good to tell you the truth you know theyve got frannie in jail thats why i called you it was on the news and i thought i might be able to help you could where are you now a pause uh id rather not say not too far away i thought it would be smarter to get away before the police decided i was their suspect the police havent decided that its the da a dry laugh same thing to me i cant afford to get in their sights did your wife tell you about about the situation here with me yeah we talked hardy knew he sounded furious impatient he was he didnt feel compelled to dissemble for poor ron the prime mover the thing is frannies in a pretty damn bleak way right now shes already done a night in the can i know i feel terrible about that thats why im calling to find out if theres anything i can do you want my recommendation yes hardy gave it to him straight you come see me now give me a note to take to frannie at the jail and tell her shes got your permission to talk to the grand jury she takes this wordofhonor stuff pretty seriously obviously you do too hardy didnt answer that he wasnt sure how far his nobility would go if frannie stayed locked up much longer but for the moment let ron think whatever would help frannie the point is she needs to tell the grand jury or you do a long silence then you must know i cant do that sure you can you give frannie permission to talk then go back to wherever you are now you said youre still local you can just i didnt say that hardy wasnt going to get into semantics with him hed said he wasnt far away and that was good enough for now ok youre not local but wherever you are you want to help frannie right isnt that why you called here but i cant look you can im a lawyer i can broker this thing through the courts no you dont understand thats not happening last time i tried to play by the rules and do things through the courts i had a good lawyer then too you know what happened the courts gave my kids to their mother you hear what im saying the rules dont give the kids to the father i cant have that again i cant take the risk there doesnt have to be a risk it doesnt have to come up at all all they care about is if you killed your wife if you didnt you go back to your normal life no i dont think so thats what id like but i dont see normal life in this picture anymore hardy took a beat lowered his voice he was sweating in the cool house his hands white around the receiver he let out a breath spoke softly then i really dont understand why you called i dont know what else you can do to help frannie after another pause ron beaumont finally said ill try to think of something im sorry no wait maybe we the line went dead he wouldnt even write you a damn note frannie how about that his wife didnt let it faze her i know he wants to help oh yes hardy dripped with sarcasm hes all for helping he just doesnt want to do anything arms crossed her body language swearing at him she spoke through tight lips what could he do what can he do that wouldnt threaten his kids how does it threaten his kids to let you talk he stays hiding besides tell me why theyre not threatened right now youve said it yourself because hes not a suspect even abe said it on tv the police arent looking for him that had been hardy had to admit one of very few sweet moments in an otherwise disastrous day glitsky would undoubtedly wind up paying hell for saying that there wasnt any evidence to arrest ron beaumont for murder the da would complain to the chief theyd foot drag even more than they already did on his cases even so to glitsky it was probably worth it but that wasnt why hardy was here how about our children dont you see that theyre a little threatened here how can you not see that dont you dare patronize me she snapped of course i see that dont you think this is her eyes flashed with fire and tears of rage this is impossible dont you think i see that i feel that she whirled in the small space behind the table in the attorneys visiting room nowhere to run but what do you want me to do thats an easy one i want you to give him up and his kids its either his or ours frannie doesnt seem like that tough a call to me just give him up he thought that maybe at last shed heard him with an effort he reined in his temper hes gone anyway frannie hes on the run its going to look like he killed bree as soon as that gets out then hes really in the news and the whole story kids and all comes out anyway then whats all this been for her face remained set its not there yet what isnt where nobodys going to look into rons life not unless he gets charged ron isnt anybodys focus yes he is hardy said hes mine hes scott randalls oh thats real nice thats swell dismas frannie spit the words out at him side yourself with my pal scott randall im not siding with scott randall jesus christ im trying to get you out of here im trying to put our family together again and all i get from you is poor ron fucking beaumont because ill tell you something frannie he and his kids theyre gone she looked up at him defiantly you always think you know everything youve got everything figured out well ill tell you something no theyre not gone he called you an hour ago he doesnt want to run he wants to go back to his normal life dont you see that deflated hardy rested a haunch on the corner of the table dont you see that thats not going to happen he asked wearily its not going to happen no matter what it will if they find who killed bree hardy shook his head not true frannie thats just not true he forced a persuasive tone listen on tuesday the grand jury is going to reconvene and by then scott randall even without glitskys help is going to discover that ron has cut out thats going to be enough to get him indicted after that hes high profile then it all comes out ok thats tuesday she said if somebody maybe abe can find brees killer before that some real evidence unlikely why because its already been three weeks the case is dead youre talking three days its not going to happen what if ron helps what if he tells everybody what he knows about bree tells who like abe but infuriatingly she shook her head he cant get involved with the police oh thats right i almost forgot and while were at it are you saying he didnt tell the police all he knew when they asked last time no im not saying that and you dont have to be such a bully he answered their questions but just sort of forgot to volunteer anything interesting he might have known about his own wifes murder give me a break frannie this is ridiculous she slammed her fist on the table pathetically its not ridiculous dont you see the tragedy of all this dont you care about anybody else dont you have any feelings anymore oh please he was up now spun around on her ive got more feelings than you can imagine right at this moment i feel like killing the son of a bitch for example i feel like whats going to happen to our kids without their mother whats going on with our marriage for that matter he glared at her but she said nothing no denial just a cold stare back at him shit he said and walked as far away as he could up against the glass block wall and stood there her chair scraped a second later he felt her behind him although their bodies didnt touch help him she whispered he couldnt think of a thing to say and she spoke into the vacuum youve told me im in here for another three days anyway no matter what isnt that right thats got nothing to do with the secret glitskys distinction but what was frannies point so so if youre right they wont indict ron until tuesday which means that the kids that whole thing it wont have to come out until after that and never if he doesnt get indicted that means you have three days he turned i have three days yes for what to save some lives dismas and how do i do that you find brees killer he hung his head his wife had no idea what she was talking about oh ok ill just run out and do that why didnt i think of that before its so simple he turned any bright idea of where i might begin with ron she said i told you he wants to help well hardy responded old ron didnt get around to telling me where i could find him maybe next time he calls i might know she said there was a hole in the floor a socalled turkish toilet against the back wall a block of concrete with a mattress on it and on the mattress a sheet and two gray woolen blankets there was no sink the walls were padded because the administrative segregation unit was where they put the bonafide crazies before they got medicated the door closed behind her she hardly realized and certainly wasnt grateful that it wasnt bars but a true door with a peephole and a place to slide food in on the bottom she stood numb and mute without moving for a minute or more at some level she was aware of the cold coming up through the paper slippers she wore everything was cold overhead there was a light recessed behind wired glass the light would go off sometime soon and plunge the cell into darkness there was no control anywhere she alternated between not letting herself feel anything or reacting to everything last night when the light had gone off shed cried for nearly an hour tonight the darkness itself would no longer matter she could tell that already she was trying to feel her children to imagine them with erin at least warm and safe but the connection was gone for now in its place was only the physical stuff here the bed and the padded walls and the smell of disinfectant maybe she told herself her emotions had played themselves out but an aura of panic seemed to shimmer around that thought as if maybe her emotions had been cauterized so deeply that now they had been completely burned away and shed never let herself feel anything again not at a certain level anyway and then her husband every time he came all she felt she could do was fight and argue and explain when all she wanted was the understanding they used to but she wouldnt be weak weakness would leave her helpless unable to make decisions for the kids if it came to that what was it going to come to no she would just put feelings away for now dismas was on her side she would believe that he was working for her interests as well as his own and the childrens though their intimacy was lost perhaps irretrievably it certainly felt that way she knew she bore some of the blame for that for all of this she had never planned to do anything wrong and now all she had done had gotten her to here why did she still feel as though she should defend herself that it was all defensible everything felt wrong every decision and act had cost her and her family dearly would anyone ever forgive her and why should they abruptly the cell went dark an undetermined period of time passed during which she remained motionless finally she reached for the bed found it and pulled the blankets to her chin holding them fisted against her chest she couldnt imagine her babies where they were if they were sleeping and this finally brought the blessed tears in another lifetime when hardy had been a prosecutor with the very district attorneys office that he now despised he sent people to jail all the time because his first wife jane had been worried that some of his convicted and dangerous felons might get back to freedom with a chip on their shoulders hardy had applied for a ccw carry a concealed weapon permit in the normal course of events this would have been denied but janes father was a superior court judge and it got approved and through some combination of politics and inertia got renewed every year over the years hardy had had occasion to take one of his guns out with him twice neither time did he have to fire at anyone although once he had enjoyed letting off a round for the immediate and gratifying effect yet tonight in a kind of cold fury grabbing for a weapon didnt feel strange at all it was a little past dusk and he was taking his colt special out of the safe where he kept it since the beck had been born he hadnt even held the damn thing in a couple of years but when hed last taken it to the range hed cleaned oiled and wrapped it carefully in its cloth before putting it away now he lifted it out and unwrapped it a wipe with the rag and the finish shone he checked to make sure that it was unloaded then spun the cylinder and worked the action several times on the way back from his visit with frannie he had decided if that was the word the impulse had been more spontaneous than cerebral to carry the piece he probably couldnt have said why surely not to shoot the man who might be sleeping with his wife if he had a thought about it at all he would have said that the gun might be persuasive in moving ron to do what hardy asked whatever that might turn out to be so he wasnt going to be home for long frannie had told him where ron had once told her she remembered after she found out hed fled where rons first stop might be if he needed to run hardy hadnt told frannie that he was going to confront ron no more impetuous promises and his wife perhaps having erroneously concluded that hardy had been converted all the way to rons side hadnt demanded any wearing jeans a blue shirt over a rugby jersey and a pair of running shoes he stood in the dim light in the back room behind the kitchen and slid the bullets where they belonged he stuck the gun into his belt pulling the blue shirt out over it he put the rest of the box of bullets back into the safe carefully closed the door and spun the lock on the way out he grabbed a jacket from the peg near the front door it hadnt taken five minutes and he was back at his car ready ron brewster now he was ron brewster frannie had explained it all to hardy thinking she was making points for ron showing her husband the lengths to which this great guy was willing to go to protect his children but the excuses and lies that he ran into every day in his criminal practice had honed hardys natural cynicism into a sharpedged and profound skepticism that cut a swath through normal human feelings at least whenever the law was involved although he fought it in his home life and with his few close friends he found that he didnt take much at face value anymore he tended not to believe interesting stories there was always something else that didnt get said frannies explanations of rons behavior his easy skill with name change for example his successful kidnapping of his own children only convinced hardy that he was dealing with a very intelligent and resourceful criminal one who had at the very least conned frannie and at the worst much more than that as if he needed more fuel to fire his rage they were at the airport hilton hardy had seen it before in people who were fleeing the first instinct was to go to ground stay close see which direction your pursuers took and then light out the other way fifth floor room a do not disturb sign was affixed to the doorknob hardy checked his watch it was precisely nine sixteen the sound of a television came from behind the door canned laughter he felt for the gun in his waistband felt its reassuring presence and left it where it was he knocked within a second the television was turned off and now behind the door there was only silence he knocked again almost tempted to call out candygram instead he waited giving ron every chance to do it in his own time ron beaumont held a finger over his lips telling his children to make no sound he crossed to the door of the hotel room he too had a gun with him but it was packed now in the false bottom of a suitcase he had to pray it wasnt the police or if it was that it was only one man then he might be able to talk himself a couple of minutes enough time to get to his suitcase do what he might have to do hardy gave it another knock harder ron open the door another couple of seconds then from behind the door a firm voice were trying to sleep hardy leaned in closer spoke with controlled urgency this is dismas hardy finally the door opened but just a crack ron had turned off the lights inside the room and left the chain on hardy had to fight the impulse to slam his shoulder into the door and break the chain free hardy spread his hands wide no threat just open the door and lets talk ron beaumont was a handsome man though hardy hated to admit it strong angular features and clear brown eyes set in cheekbones so chiseled that now with his evening stubble they looked like you could strike a match on them an aquiline nose with a high bridge was perfectly centered over what hardy supposed would be called a generous mouth the full head of dark hair had a streak or two of gray at the temples although the unlined face made that seem premature or even dyed almost exactly the same height as hardys six feet he weighed at least ten pounds less and none of it was soft the door was open and he moved to the side to let hardy in all the way down from the avenues to the airport hardy had indulged in fantasy savoring the moment of confrontation when he goddamit made ron fess up to his responsibility to frannie to the damage hed done the other stuff too whatever it might have been the true nature of their relationship the alibi whatever story theyd had to get straight max and cassandra skewed the dynamic immediately rons kids as human beings in the center of this drama hadnt made center stage before the lights went on in the hotel room before that he was aware of their existence of course but they had been mere pawns in the chess game hardy had been playing the fact that they were here now taking up the same physical space as ron whateverhislastname changed everything cassandra lit up when she saw him mr hardy hi natural as can be surprised and delighted at his appearance suddenly the name clicked with the face for hardy too cassandra was no longer a halfremembered presence in his daughters life but one of the really good ones polite funny able to speak in whole sentences he glanced at the boy max now placing him as well theyd both been to the house several times to play with his children although hardy hadnt engaged either of them in meaningful dialogue it threw him to see it but even now in this stressful environment both remained obviously wellcaredfor children newly bathed and wearing pajamas are you here to help us cassandra asked she turned to her father explaining rebecca says thats what her dad does he helps people hes a lawyer ron didnt seem as impressed with it as his daughter was but the statement seemed to play into his plan and he didnt miss the opportunity thats right he responded easily hes here to see if he can help us out a sideways glance tacitly asking hardys complicity at the outset which hardy couldnt think fast enough to deny hes trying to get us back home its time you guys turned in ok a couple of minutes of small talk finally dwindled down before hardy got strong handshakes from both of them as they were heading off to bed and the acid test they both looked him in the eye it was a bit disorienting for hardy to realize that these were welladjusted children who appeared to love their father if they were a bit reserved hardy had to remember that it was near their bedtime they were in strange surroundings and their stepmother had been murdered only three weeks before he wouldnt have expected giggling high spirits but he didnt pick up any scent of peoplefear either of him or of their father and that was always the inevitable companion to abuse it threw him off his stride whatever hed been expecting it hadnt been this cozy domestic scene with father and loving children the gun rode heavily inside his belt a stupid clumsy macho pretense what had he been thinking shifting uncomfortably pulling at his jacket to cover the gun he felt a wave of disgust for himself who was he kidding he wasnt some kind of gunslinger it had been two decades since hed been a cop now he was a lawyer a paper pusher a persuader words and strategy the tools of old men like david freeman and now dismas hardy all this was the thought of an instant though ron was keeping things moving ok youve told mr hardy goodnight enough times now march firm goodnatured in control amazingly there was no argument chez hardy bedtimes were often the most difficult time of the day impatient depleted parents struggling to get their exhausted children to admit that they were even remotely tired the exercise would wind up turning into a war of wills that left all sides defeated but max and cassandra were up and moving another polite goodnight stalling for that last precious second both of them telling hardy they were so glad he was here for the first time hardy noticed that they were in a suite with a separate room for the kids and ron said hed be back in five minutes after hed tucked them in and gotten them settled but hardy hadnt come all the way down here only to have ron and the kids slip out another door so feeling foolish he nevertheless went and stood in the doorway to the bedroom where he could watch in case the good father decided to bolt and run with his children but the bedtime rituals made it immediately obvious that this wasnt on the nights agenda apparently ron had decided to accept hardys unexpected presence and work within these new parameters hardy finally went back to the other room sat in the chair at the desk and half listened to the familiar goodnight noises the gun remained an uneasy presence the unyielding pressure in his side his stomach roiled with the unspent rage the tension and hunger a rogue wave of fatigue washed over him so powerfully that for a moment snapping out of it he was disoriented out over the bay the huge planes on their airport approach floated down out of the darkling cloudscudded sky so what do you intend to do ron had closed the door to the kids room and pulled over a wing chair you want some coffee a beer anything the rooms got everything i dont want anything except my wife out of jail yeah i can see that ron sat look i dont blame you for being mad i cant tell you how sorry i am but nobody could have seen this coming you saw it enough three days ago that you left your apartment and took your kids out of school that was when i learned they were going to talk to frannie hearing his wifes name used with such familiarity rekindled some of the flame of anger hardy fought it it wasnt going to get him what he needed not now but ron was going on explaining rationalizing how none of this was entirely his fault thats when i realized the investigation was coming back to me i couldnt hang around and let that happen no it was better to let them come after frannie i didnt foresee that you just said you knew they were talking to her what did you think was going to happen i had no idea i told them i had been drinking coffee with her i thought theyd probably want to make sure he leaned forward in the chair i dont know if you realize it but the grand jury had already questioned me i answered everything they asked me but obviously lied about fighting with your wife suddenly the floor seemed to hold a fascination for ron finally he raised his eyes what was i supposed to do put myself on their alist the theory is you tell them nothing but the truth thats the one frannie went with you might have told her she could tell your little secret i thought all they wanted was corroboration on the alibi youve got to believe that the other stuff i never thought it would come up well it did but this was old news and hardy was sick of it so why didnt you just take off when you knew theyd started looking you had three days you could be in australia by now the kids uprooted again no insurance income from brees death the police after me theyre after you now thats not what i hear not yet macho or no hardy almost reached for the gun to put an end to this stupidity take the man in and let the chips fall but then he remembered the three innocent shackled children from judge lis courtroom an example of what could happen something similarly terrible almost inevitably would happen to cassandra and max furious as he was he couldnt be responsible for putting them into the criminal justice system not yet anyway not if there were any other way ron was leaning forward tightlipped and earnest his elbows were on his knees and his hands were gripped whiteknuckled together in front of him look i know this is bad for you horrible but my first responsibility has to be to my guys in there i know you understand that hardy couldnt say anything it galled him but the fact was that it was true he understood it completely ron was going on and were not absolutely committed to running away either not yet anyway if this passes the kids are back in school next week with a little unscheduled vacation and no one thinks a thing about it the original plan was wed take a few days off and see which way the wind was blowing he let out a deep breath maybe we wouldnt have to go after all go where wherever anywhere and do what ron hung his head again for an instant and brought it back up start over again if this was a notsosubtle play for sympathy it was misdirected hardy snapped out and meanwhile what happens to frannie i release her she gets out hardy didnt like the sound of that either you release her a nod from the promise i got an idea ron why dont you do it now like right now this minute hardys voice had picked up some heat he snatched up the pen and telephone pad from on the desk held it out to him once again considering the gun ron was shaking his head no the minute she talks we have to run we have to relocate dont you see that hardy looked around the suite what do you call this this isnt running the pen was still out there in the air between them ron stood up slowly took it sat at the desk and wrote for a minute when hardy had read what hed written though it didnt strike him as nearly enough the note was brief and specific telling frannie that the next time she went before the grand jury she should feel free to reveal his secret if she felt she needed to but hardys problem was that the grand jury wasnt meeting until next tuesday morning which left frannie exactly where she was right now in a cold fury hardy raised his eyes and spoke what the hell kind of good does this do ron sat on the edge of the bed and spoke with a desperate calm my understanding from the television am i right is that poor frannies in jail down there for four days no matter what happens with me hardy nodded thats how it looks but palm out ron stopped him please may i so my hope is that i wont have to do all this again move my family start over ive already done it once as you know but the idea of doing it again he drew in a breath id rather avoid that and maybe i can hows that if they find who did it this was what frannie had suggested only a few hours earlier but hardy was damned if he was going to make the same argument hed made to her he could be a lot more straightforward here he heard his volume going up and what if they dont ron how about that then on tuesday the kids and i we go and frannie can talk she can tell the grand jury youve kidnapped your kids i dont see it that way but yes put the fbi on your ass a weak smile theyve been there before they wont find me and frannie gets out of jail she tells them everything yes you have my word meanwhile if brees killer is found he indicated the kids bedroom those guys maybe get to go back to a normal life thats all i want really and here was frannies impetus in deciding to ask her husband to help her maybelover save some lives shed said and hed let himself be persuaded that she was talking about their own family but no again it was ron his kids hardy knew nothing of the truth about ron and frannie about ron and his earlier marriage the custody battle bree or her life or any of the political issues surrounding it three days wasnt enough time even if he had an entire police department working with him even if he was motivated to do it which he wasnt he couldnt use his cop friends his lawyer connections or any of his personal channels because hed sworn himself to secrecy finding a likely suspect for brees murder was a ridiculous notion and why would he want to anyway ron beaumont might not be anything he appeared right now it might all be an act help the man hardy still didnt feel as if hed completely ruled out killing him hardy glanced at the note a last time folded it over and jammed it into his pocket ron seeing this picked a bad moment to comment we can do this he said all sincerity and hardy suddenly lost all his patience slapping a palm loudly on the table in front of him raising his voice in a rage what is this we shit theres no we here theres me and what i need to do for my family then theres you and dont kid yourself theyre nothing like the same thing not trusting himself to keep his anger checked any further he might pull that gun out after all he got up and abruptly strode across to the door youre not leaving this wasnt rons voice and hardys surprise at the sound of it whirled him around it was cassandra standing in the doorway to the suite it was obvious that she had been crying though now she had gotten herself back under control please mr hardy you cant leave at her father we do need help daddy he can help us rebecca says thats really what he does thats why he can almost never be home because hes helping other people the innocent unintended stab slashed deeply across hardys insides but ron kept to the point not the subtext answering his daughter calmly i think he can too honey but its not my decision there was a tentative knock from the childrens door and now max stuck his head through the crack im sorry i covered my head with the pillow but i still couldnt help hearing you yelling he looked from hardy to ron are you all mad at each other cassandra reached back and put her arm around her brother were scared daddy whats going to happen its all right hon theres nothing to be scared of daddys right here ron cast a glance at hardy and went to stand up but his daughter had advanced a step into the room trailed by max who now held on to her hand the little girls face was set with determination another step and she spoke right to hardy mr hardy didnt you come here to try to help us is that true hardy stammered well i because we cant go back to dawn they cant make us do that even max remembers the tears had begun again we just want to stay with daddy and have everything be like it was again max piped in through his own tears and bree back too please i want bree back oh guys ron went to stand up but cassandra didnt move toward him she had her eyes on hardy do you have to be our lawyer to help us is that how it works how do you become our lawyer hardy crossed over near her went down to one knee and tried a tired smile its not that its that i dont know what i can do cassandra its complicated rebeccas mothers in a lot of trouble too and ive got to help her shes got to be my first priority you can understand that but the girl was persistent maybe you could do both though and daddy isnt sure what to do right now ron reached out to her oh sweetie come here both of you guys ron was holding out his hands and the kids went to him he enveloped them both in his arms in a strong and soothing fatherhood come on now come on theres nothing to be scared of lets say goodnight to mr hardy and go back to bed itll all look better in the morning but cassandra turned please mr hardy if you can it was monday october less than a week after bree beaumonts death in fact it was the day she was to be buried baxter thorne a portly man with a gray goatee a softspoken manner and a gentle disposition nervously paced the floor behind his computer banks in his office on the thirtieth floor of embarcadero two outside his inoperable windows it was a gloriously clear day with boats on the bay and treasure island a nineiron pitch across a mile and half of blue water but thorne had no use for the view hed told the cop griffin hed be here first thing in the morning he had no idea what the man might have found but the fact that he knew of baxter thornes existence at all was a very bad sign the sign on thornes door announced that these were the offices of the fuels management consortium fmc in fact the organization was the center for the lobbying efforts of one of the countrys two multinational farming conglomerates spader krutch ohio sko along with its chief competitor archer daniels midland adm was one of the countrys leading producers of ethanol but while adm was colloquially known by the benign nickname of supermarket to the world skos reputation was somewhat less savory sko had been having a rough time in the last several years and thorne had been assigned to california to direct a campaign on behalf of its interests hed proven himself as a creative media consultant sko might be thornes biggest client but the quiet wellmannered gentleman with the goatee worked to please himself he had a persuasive way with words true and could sway opinion with his pen if his clients believed that his silver tongue and lucid prose alone were converting the multitudes thorne was happy to let them but in reality he knew better sometimes to be effective you simply had to shake things up and this was his real love operations wet work it had lots of names thorne got his own personal jollies by pursuing an extralegal agenda all his own and it was far more extensive and dangerous than anything any of his clients would ever order or even if they became aware of it tolerate for example two years before sko had been getting a lot of bad press the companys ceo ellis jackson was fighting off charges of illegal campaign funding giftgiving and influence peddling because of this the senator from kansas got cold feet and reluctant to be identified with sko threatened to renege on his support of ethanol subsidies this support was finally guaranteed by a donation of a million dollars to the senators campaign fund but without thorne it is doubtful that the senator would have found a way to accept the gift on his own thorne had discovered the mans weakness for other young men then thorne had seen to it that one of these men had been on the corporate jet on the junket to hilton head finally thorne had decided precisely where to position the cameras but while thorne loved his own covert operations more than anything else on earth he didnt shrink from his nuts and bolts work information management and spin control in fact the fuels management consortium produced reams of paper every month for dissemination to radio shows newspapers think tanks consultant firms and lobbyists in addition thornes company produced campaign leaflets for political candidates who supported ethanol or opposed mtbe which amounted to the same thing the most prominent of these was damon kerry running for governor of california unfortunately in thornes view damon kerry was a man who did not appreciate the big picture like the senator from kansas he didnt want to be publicly associated with sko with its questionable lobbying history damon kerry was pure he wasnt proposing the use of ethanol he wasnt being bought by any special interests no sir he was merely opposed to the cancercausing alternative mtbe so damon kerrys campaign was in the thick of the gasoline additive wars except one of the generals was ignorant of where he got his army baxter thorne came to california to bolster kerrys campaign but kerry had rejected his advances fortuitously kerrys campaign manager was a young man named al valens greedy unscrupulous devious and skilled valens was more than happy to accept thornes help as well as a little personal financial support in the role of kerrys best friend consigliére and strategist valens in fact was a double agent his role was to keep his candidate focused on the evils of big oil all things considered and up until last night when the cop called thorne had believed that things were going pretty well kerry had come from nowhere to get within spitting distance of his opponent and with a couple of good spins and perhaps a trick or two thorne was confident he could eliminate that gap and bring his boy home but suddenly there was a problem the damned beaumont woman and some homicide cop with an alleged connection to the fuels management consortium that he wanted to talk about thorne looked at his watch for the fiftieth time he was on time where was griffin what the hell did he think he knew from long experience in the political arena thorne had learned to distrust first impressions there were a host of fat slovenly boorish elected officials in this country who were powerful decisive and dangerous he wasnt sure where he was going to place griffin just yet from all appearances the inspector was unimpressive but the fact that he was sitting here at fmc meant that hed made some unsettling connections something might be going on between the mans ears so thorne was playing it close as was his inclination in any event he smiled in his benign fashion and spoke in kindly and professorial tones im afraid i dont see anything sinister in bree beaumont having some of our literature at her apartment she was in the combustion business wasnt she griffin had stuffed himself into one of the secretary s rolling chairs and now was hunched forward one leg awkwardly crossed over the other rocking as though maybe he thought the chair was a rocker but thorne didnt think this was nerves under the workingclass nonchalance griffin was intense as a surgeon he didnt bother with returning any smiles yeah we got your letterhead at the scene he said i got that but then i got valens al valens this did bring a smile dont bullshit a bullshitter mr thorne al valens your guy with damon kerry this was truly alarming and thorne had to struggle to retain his equanimity there was no way anybody official much less this oafish flatfoot should know about thornes relationship with al valens if that became public if damon kerry discovered that he was being deceived by his campaign manager it would be the end of months of work of a program that was on the verge of success so his brain now on full alert thorne smiled again and leaned back in his chair bringing his fingertips together over the tweedy vest that buttoned over his stomach how do you conclude that this mr valens is my guy as you put it i got a better one griffin replied how about if i ask the questions since thats what im here for in exchange i dont bring you downtown thorne tried a little humor to soften things here ive always considered that these offices were downtown griffin s face was a slab of meat what do you know about valens relationship with bree beaumont there was nothing to do but stonewall until thorne discovered a little more about what griffin knew as well as the source of it i dont know anything about his relationship with bree beaumont but you admit that you do know him valens i didnt say that he certainly wasnt ready to admit it and griffin had just cued him that he was fishing thorne reminded himself the flip side of first impressions that sometimes people looked and acted stupid because they were but youve obviously heard that i do he ventured an educated guess jim pierce pierce was an executive vice president of caloco and thome had heard exlover of bree beaumont when shed left the oil company to join kerry thered been hard feelings all around pierce had the money and the motivation to discredit kerry and to make bree see the error of her new ways and come back to him and caloco griffin looked at his notepad and this verified thornes suspicion poker wouldnt be this inspectors game because if it was pierce youve got to seriously consider the source he held up a hand now im not telling you what to think but jim pierce jesus what about him hes big oil is what thorne sighed look sergeant im a consultant in this business i know the players and pierce is a very big player so heres what happens if kerry gets elected which isnt looking too bad right now pierce s people the petroleum folks theyre going to take the big hit on you know about mtbe griffin nodded lately yeah ive heard of it well take my word on it thats what this is about three billion a year goes down the drain if kerry wins so pierce is trying to disrupt the campaign griffin seemed to remember what his original position had been so youre saying youre not involved with valens thats your story another avuncular shake of the head i dont have a story sergeant all i know about bree beaumonts death is what ive read in the paper im especially saddened because frankly she was starting to make a real difference in the publics perception of the dangers of mtbe which are substantial also quite honestly several of my clients stood to benefit from her recent work as did kerry and probably valens not only is there no motive there theres a positive disincentive thorne was fairly certain hed deflected griffin again from pursuing his own relationship with valens but he thought he could push things even further look sergeant i dont mean to speak out of turn but let me guess what mr pierce told you he said that al valens hated bree didnt he that al was jealous of all the attention kerry was giving to bree something like that am i right an ambiguous shrug and whos the guy who tells you all this only the guy whose business is in the crapper if bree succeeds who by the way just got dumped by her personally griffin finally showed a spark you know that word on the street thorne returned griffins open look hed answered his questions been straight with the police if there was anything more hed continue to cooperate but his message was clear griffin was barking up the wrong tree here finally the sergeant straightened his body and grunted his way up out of his chair i know where to find you he said a last smile im not going anyplace thorne extended a hand and after a beat griffin took it listen to me al the man was here i dont know for sure what pierce told him but it wasnt news to him that you hated the woman al valens swore then did he mention the report did he know anything about that no i dont think hed know what it was if it bit him but hed obviously been to her place and gone through her papers some with my letterhead howd she get those thornes voice took on a mild tone of reproach well al i was going to ask you the same thing valens took it in silence so whered you leave it i sent him back to pierce valens was silent for a long moment how close was he to us way too but now hes looking at pierce who had every reason more than every reason thorne smiled thinly i think sergeant griffin will come to the conclusion that mr pierce must have done it and with no physical evidence hell have to go to the strongest motive but valens didnt sound convinced what if he comes back to us though after all weve thorne cut him off al he wants to catch a killer our arrangement is not his area of interest he wont be looking this way valens voice betrayed the panic thorne knew he must be feeling but what if he does baxter what if he does thorne spoke in his most soothing tones then hell have to be managed thats all the limousine bearing the democratic candidate for governor pulled up to where a crowd of perhaps a hundred citizens waited in the chill by the union square entrance to the saint francis hotel in the back seat damon kerry nodded appreciatively at the man next to him good job al nice turnout valens wore a distracted air there was no doubt that the crowd here would be satisfactory you tell semiindigents that youll pay them twenty bucks to go someplace and stand around for fifteen minutes and you can generally get some good percentage of them to show up and do it and since both sides did it neither could snitch off the other to the media five months ago damon kerry had unexpectedly taken the primary after the two other democratic contenders had vilified each other to death in a series of tv debates since that time valens found himself more and more coming around to the opinion that the system could be improved by simply eliminating the middle men and paying people directly to vote in a cynical moment and there had been hundreds lately hed amused himself doing the math hed concluded that for about the same amount of money theyd already blown through on this campaign they could have paid every registered voter in the state twenty bucks to go into the booth and mark the x next to kerry if he took the number of citizens who actually voted somewhere near thirty per cent of californias adults and only wanted to ensure a simple majority of fiftyone per cent he could up the ante to nearly a hundred dollars per vote with that kind of incentive people would take the whole day off with pay to vote that was the way to do it hell theyd even make money on the deal what are you thinking about al youre not here the limo had stopped at the entrance he couldnt very well answer honestly but since that wasnt an issue with him at any time it didnt slow him down now a quick shift of the mental gears and he was back to strategy the campaign life or his anyway oh sorry he said distractedly bree i suppose this new angle with bree the woman in jail the television news had broken the story about frannie hardy only hours before and it was already clear it was going to become large anything to do with damn bree beaumont was going to continue to have an effect on the campaign valens couldnt get away from it it had surprised al to see how bree had come from out of nowhere to be such a focal point in the campaign certainly it had never been valens intention to get bree and damon together she had been with the enemy but then after a radio program they had both appeared to defend their respective positions things changed bree had always viewed herself as a pioneer against pollution she took pride in the fact that her mtbe was really doing a great job of cleaning up californias air it wasnt just science to her she cared that she was doing good she was it appeared altruistic she wanted a better world in this way she was very much like damon kerry more so than valens could have ever imagined valens didnt understand principled people at all but these two the candidate and the scientist connected to each other in a big way damon kerry passionate and personally charming hadnt attacked bree on the program hed been either smart or lucky enough to zero in on their common concern keeping poisons out of the environment and what hed made bree do which even valens at the time had thought was brilliant was direct her attention down into the ground before this one radio show brees entire scientific life had been directed into the atmosphere she had been cleaning up the air defending how she did it and that had kept her busy enough that she hadnt looked too carefully at the ground she assumed and the corporate culture in which shed been immersed had aided the assumption that her stuff mtbe in the ground would act like regular gasoline eventually it would dissolve or evaporate out reports even scientific reports to the contrary were paid for by the ethanol industry by sko bree considered the source and discarded the facts so in her mind she had always been on the side of the angels doing good work and then suddenly damon kerry had made her see it all differently and in the immediate aftermath of that conversion shed been the greatest thing for the campaign since the battle of the frontrunning mudslingers but soon afterward from al valens perspective she became a substantial liability something personal started going on with damon kerry before valens knew it bree was showing up everywhere with his candidate late dinners early lunches fundraising breakfasts by the time of her murder bree had mutated from occasional irritant to constant influence kerry was paying more attention to her than to valens giving more credence to brees idealistic stupid advice than to his own campaign manager as the relationship evolved valens saw that it was only going to be a matter of time before the opponents camp to say nothing of the media got wind of the story and used it to ruin everything hed done valens had had nightmares about the headline candidate in affair with married mother of two no it wouldnt do bree beaumonts death was not at all a bad thing for damon kerry although it would probably be a while before he would see it now in the darkened back seat of the limousine kerrys face grew grave in the immediate aftermath of brees death hed gone into hibernation for three days valens had had to cancel all of his appearances pleading a virus the flu something for one terrifying moment it had even looked as though kerry was going to stop campaigning altogether to give it up valens had had to employ all of his wiles to get his client back on track invoking brees sacred name bree would never have wanted him to quit he had to hold on and win the governorship for bree if for nothing else fight the oil companies who had used bree for their own evil purposes if he didnt go on bree would have died in vain all that nonsense but ultimately it worked now valens leaned forward rolled the connecting window down and spoke to the driver peter take it around the block one time will you were a little early this wasnt true but kerry wouldnt know that and now that hed mentioned bree it wouldnt hurt to solidify the spin no doubt someone would question kerry about it at the almond growers association cocktail party tonight and it would be bad luck to give an answer upon which they hadnt already agreed valens laid a protective hand on his knee the message bore repeating she and ron were happy damon the marriage was a good one he had no reason to kill her you have to remember that kerry turned his face to the tinted windows valens continued if ron and bree were unhappy she never mentioned it to you ok right for an answer kerry blew out a long breath look valens pressed on lets concentrate on the good news from this front look whats happening on the talk radio shows kerry snorted i hate those people i know i agree with you but they dont hate you and bree in the news is good for you throughout the campaign the talk radio campaign against mtbe had been one of his strongest weapons never mind that it was funded by baxter thornes client sko or that several callers linked themselves to groups that had targeted oil refineries and corporate offices with bombings and other vandalisms valens didnt mind terrorists so long as they were his terrorists valens patted kerry on the leg but like these folks or not damon they are doing you a lot of good right now theyre getting your message out my message isnt just about gasoline additives al its about the public trust public safety valens bit back his reply there were worse things than a sincere candidate he supposed he tried to recall the great line was it george burns the politicians best friend is sincerity once you can fake that youve got it licked instead he said yes of course i agree with you public safety public trust but the public has a handle on mtbe theyre nervous around it they should be granted but my point is that these people are keeping the issue hot and its your issue youre against this bad stuff damn straight and the oil companies are making it to the tune of a threebilliondollarayear industry al when only five years ago agreed agreed valens had to stop him or hed go into his whole speech right there in the limo about how the oil companies had gotten together and decided that hey maybe it was dirty burning gasoline that was causing air pollution after all they should do a study and if that radical theory turned out to be true they should out of the goodness of their corporate hearts do something about it and sure enough thats what the study draft written by bree beaumont phd had found gasoline wasnt burning cleanly enough it needed an additive to burn more completely away the hydrocarbons that contributed to smog the california legislature and the us governments environmental protection agency fell all over themselves passing laws that mandated the use of this magical additive if a good one could only be found valens had to admit kerry was good at this next part hed heard it from dozens of podiums up and down the state and it always played beautifully the great american public hating rich corporations as it did so guess what these noble oil companies did they spent lots and lots of their own money developing the very additive that their own gasoline needed to become clean and efficient our old friend mtbe here valens was pleased to note there was often if not always a chorus of wellorchestrated boos after which kerry would continue and then as it turned out just a coincidence my friends i assure you it turned out that the oil companies found that their production of mtbe made of a byproduct of gasoline refining that they had earlier been throwing away well would you look at that heres a surprise mtbe started to bring in a yearly income of three billion dollars more boos oh and darn they forgot to tell us one last little detail a moment of suspense wouldnt you just know it the dang stuff causes cancer and respiratory degeneration actually the oil companies didnt really forget to tell us that what they did was tell us the opposite that mtbe was nearly medicinal in its impact on human health the air so much cleaner wed have a new eden why read the initial reports again drafts by bree and youd almost come away believing its so safe you could drink the stuff except for one other problem and here kerry would turn his most serious except it makes water taste like turpentine it leaks out of holding tanks and jet ski engines and everywhere else liquids leak out of and once it gets into the groundwater the wells and waterways of our great state it never comes out never ever it doesnt evaporate it doesnt break down chemically ask the city of santa monica which had to shut down five of its wells thats half of its water supply because of mtbe contamination from local corner gas stations and even now ladies and gentleman even today as im talking to you this stuff is added to every gallon of gasoline sold in california at a rate of up to fifteen per cent per gallon thats fourteen point two million gallons of mtbe every single day this statistic usually stunned the crowd into silence the candidate would wait as long as it he could then hang his head a moment his timing was excellent hed look up sometimes even able to summon a tear it cant go on for our children and our future its got to be stopped my name is damon kerry and im here to stop it so bottomline we cant comment about ron and bree we have to stick to the issues weve been through this all before damon its only a couple more days i know but but valens knew there couldnt be any buts listen he said with intensity every day in every major city in this state the callers to these shows are spreading the word that the oil companies killed bree to punish her for betraying them changing her mind and campaigning against mtbe because she changed camps and came over to your side valens stopped any reply a hand up look damon heres what im saying you know it as well as i do people love conspiracies they love to hate these oil guys this helps you but im not accusing the oil companies of and that whats makes it so brilliant valens knew that his candidate could see this clearly so why did he have to keep explaining it damon youre mr clean but your worthy opponent who favors pumping mtbe until more research can be done guess what he looks like hes with the oil interests which he is lord valens couldnt get over kerrys fascination with the literal truth yes of course he is but what matters for you is that we couldnt buy the radio time theyre giving us if we get them thinking about ron beaumont as a villain it all gets diluted i dont know al i wish they would come up with some villain some suspect somebody to take the heat off take the heat off who who do you think al me what about you and bree you had a professional relationship whats to talk kerry gave him a look this would be a bad time for somebody to find out though wouldnt it shes back in the news the storys no longer dead reporters start digging and find nothing do you hear me you have to relax they find nothing the limo had pulled to a stop kerry hated to keep his crowd waiting he needed to get out and press the flesh keep connected to his voters he reached for the door handle all right al i hear you i hear you abe glitsky lay awake trying to ignore the television noise in the next room his housekeepernanny rita loved the tv as much as glitsky hated it shed been living with them now for almost five years and was a treasure especially with orel abe needed her so badly he knew he would tolerate much worse in her than an unfortunate taste for popular dreck still tonight with frannie hardy in jail and an unsolved highprofile murder starting to get renewed media attention the inanities soothed like a buzz saw finally he pulled off the covers and sat up five minutes later fully dressed he was out of the house walking down lake street on his way to where hed parked his cityissue car about six blocks away the closest parking space he could find he was telling himself that maybe it wasnt the television after all what had gotten him up and moving was the sudden bolt that frannie and his unsolved highprofile murder were one and the same case not that he hadnt known it before but hed been viewing them as more or less separate problems and suddenly it struck him that maybe they werent one other thing was certain he hadnt woken her up from the looks of her eyes she hadnt slept yet in her cell abe hi a quick look around the walls of the interview room although there was no place anybody could hide glass block and lightgreen stucco the question was all over her face where was her husband what was abe doing here by himself in the middle of the night the door closed behind her and she took a little halfstep hop jumping out of the way of something the sound then a pitiful smile embarrassed im not good at this abe was standing close who is he came up and put his arms around her for a second she felt almost dangerously insubstantial all tiny bones he pulled back and looked at her swimming in the orange jail jumpsuit are you eating she shrugged no answer is dismas coming in is he out there no its just me checking on how youre holding up frannie crossed her arms the ghost of her old self trying to appear a dance in her eyes no checking on how im holding up was last time before you went home this is something else the scar stretched between glitskys lips his own beaming smile his head bobbed appreciatively you should be the lawyer ill pass thanks boosting herself on to the table she looked up at him so what is it the deal glitskys brow furrowed what deal its not that i thought they must have come and asked you i dont know any deal what deal who offered you a deal scott randall that bastard he wasnt here an hour ago doesnt understand why i dont feel all warm and fuzzy about him like he really didnt get it she was watching glitskys face you really havent heard about this nothing what did he want he wants ron and how was he going to get that from you he said hed drop the contempt charge and stop worrying about the secret i wouldnt have to tell that to the grand jury in return for what for where ron was he thought id know where he was but you dont right frannie was studying the wall over his shoulder right abe repeated but he already knew damn it the rare profanity came out with slow deliberation what are you doing frannie ive been on your side up to now trying to get you out of here because i have known and loved you for years and i know youre not involved in any murder am i at least right on that she nodded met his eyes i swear to you abe he sighed heavily perhaps reassured all right then what else did mr randall want just that he wanted to get his hands on ron and question him he said he knew thats where the answer was with ron and where is that sitting on the edge of the table frannie hung her head and swung her feet back and forth like a child finally she looked back up abe he left the house and she was alive when he came back she was dead somebody killed her glitsky started to respond but she put her hand on his arm stopping him i know i know you told me remember the time of death technically he could have done it before he left to take the kids to school i like that eyeroll thing you do come on can you picture it ron takes the kids down to the car then says to himself hey heres an opportune moment i think ill just nip back upstairs kill my wife throw her off the balcony to make it look like a suicide clean up the glass from whatever convenient murder weapon i find up there she was shaking her head please i was with him that morning and he was fine he was normal we just had a cup of coffee and kvetched about life about children you know how you do youve had kids still do you know what i mean school age little guys glitsky nodded ok but he told you a secret so important that youre here in jail no he didnt abe what do you mean i mean not that morning that morning was nothing but scott randall gave me the impression i know and now everybody assumes ron told me something that morning im telling you thats not what happened i dont even remember if we mentioned bree at all not on that day then why are you here because i wouldnt tell what ron told me which had nothing to do with brees murder so far as you know thats what i said on the stand frannie had been admonished that revealing anything about what happened inside the grand jury room was a separate contempt of court at this point she couldnt have cared less i said i didnt know i didnt think so but i wasnt sure finally she pushed off the table and got back to her feet but im telling you abe listen to me she had grabbed at his arms the sleeves of his leather jacket it doesnt matter even if he did have an incredible compelling reason to kill her which he didnt and forget that hes just not the kind of person who would ever ever kill anybody forget that the point is that even if he wanted to he couldnt have done it he wasn t there why is this so hard for everybody to understand glitsky the cop almost found himself believing her for the practical reason that what she said particularly about the timing of the murder made sense if ron beaumont had killed his wife in the morning before taking the kids to school while they were still hanging around or even waiting in the car and managed to hide it from them he had to admit that had been one hell of a party trick not that he couldnt have done it and abe had only recently argued that it was in fact possible except that in the real world possible didnt mean likely but there were still questions there were always questions so why is he on the run how do you know he is that he hasnt just gone fishing or something to get away for a day or two this was the wrong answer and glitsky clucked in frustration your husband told me he went by the school a meaningful glance i know that diz also told you that which brings up the question of why are you pretending you didnt know it also brings us back to why he ran maybe because he was scared abe people get scared even when they havent done anything wrong thats true glitsky conceded they also get scared when they think theyre going to get caught for what they did ive seen it happen also i notice you didnt answer the first part why youre pretending you didnt know suddenly her eyes really flashed because theres things i dont have to tell anybody thats why even you even dismas ive got a right to a little privacy abe just like you do how about that she took a few steps away then stopped abruptly and turned back and while were on questions ive got one for you what did you come down here for it wasnt to check on me and you said it was why did you lie to me glitsky held out his hands she was right she was hardys wife one of his closest friends in her own right and being in jail didnt make her a criminal a suspect or anyone he had to deal with professionally she was still the woman whod cared for his boys for a month after his wife had died im really sorry she relented a little arms still crossed though sorrys good sorrys a start but she wasnt giving up on her questions either so why did you come down here i couldnt sleep i thought maybe you could tell me something i didnt know about bree it occurred to me that with everything else going on nobodys thought to ask you but i dont know anything about bree you dont have any ideas about who killed her ron didnt have any im sure nothing he didnt already tell the grand jury glitsky tried to smile im on your side frannie always how about if i ask you some questions to see if they point me toward anybody else her shoulders slumped the fatigue showing everywhere how about if we sit down theyd been at it maybe twenty minutes glitsky feeling that hed barely begun when the guard knocked and the door opened and dismas hardy appeared party in room a he said but he didnt look like he was partying glitsky thought more like hed been through some kind of sleep torture frannie got up and walked to him glitsky stood realizing that his interview was over for tonight he came around the table ok you lovebirds i can take a hint abe thats ok were just but he was at the door i know what youre doing diz ill be in my office for awhile he turned to go then remembered something oh and frannie yes he pointed a finger at her eat then they were alone holding each other hardy had come straight from the airport hilton wanting to fill her in he gave her rons note which seemed to make almost no impression and really he reasoned why should it it would have no effect if any for days more than that though frannie was far more concerned with another issue before anything else she said this thing about me and ron ok his breathing had stopped and that was all he could get out we liked each other like each other a pause maybe a little more than that hardy tried to keep any hurt or recrimination out of his voice how much more his wife sighed i think for a while i was infatuated with him he seemed to feel the same way about me she read something in his face and let go of his hands now youre going to hate me arent you no he said nothings going to make me hate you i love you she stared at him for another beat we didnt she stopped but he was there dismas he was a friend he listened i just want you to understand i dont listen yes i mean no you know you dont not about some things you glaze over the kids school life all those what you call mindless suburban activities and i dont even blame you not really i know its not the most exciting stuff in the world but its my life and sometimes its just horribly lonely and mindnumbing and then suddenly there was this nice man who didnt think all of this was tedious to listen to so hed listen did he old ron she nodded going on ron and i we were just having so many of the same issues with the kids he couldnt hold it any longer wait a minute frannie what about us i seem to remember were doing some of the same things too live in the same house do the kid thing have friends over like that that stuff doesnt count i know i know youre right there was pain in her voice too perhaps some faint overtones of the desperation she must have been feeling but you know how things have changed with us were different i hope youre still committed of course im still committed you think id be sitting here listening to all this if i wasnt pretty damn committed ok i know that but the romance she stopped they both knew what she was getting at the romance and there used to be plenty had been all but swallowed by the maw of the mundane and hardy knew why were both working now we work all the time well whatever the reason we both know were not the way we used to be theres whole areas of each others lives that we dont have the time or energy for anymore hardy brought his hand up to his eyes all the fatigue of the past hours suddenly weighing in everything frannie was saying was true nobodys lives were the way they used to be but the accommodation hed reached was to put it out of his mind he had his job making the money she had hers the house and the childrens daytoday activities they shared the childrens discipline and some organized playtime they werent actually fighting they were both competent so there wasnt much to fight about this was adulthood and it was often not much fun so what but she evidently had reached another conclusion she needed something he wasnt giving her and shed gone out and found it what are you thinking she asked talk to me im thinking everybody he started over i mean married people i dont know he rubbed at his burning eyes i dont know we all get further apart he shook his head maybe but ive been trying to support us all here for the last few years it takes a little bit of my time hell it takes all my time you think im ok with no leisure in my life you think i dont miss it too the fun but whats the option live poor let the kids starve nobodys going to starve dismas its not that you know that actually im not sure that i do know that it feels like if i stop working somebody might the world might end but you never talked to me about that did you that fear he shrugged and she pressed him because you dont talk about those kinds of things not anymore he shrugged that off i never did frannie nobody wants to hear about that all those nebulous fears yes they do and nebulous hopes too and little insignificant worries that just need to get aired out and the occasional dream thats just a dream like we used to have all the time what we were going to do when we got older when the kids have moved out frannie youre talking a decade minimum we dont even know if well be alive in a decade why talk about it she folded her arms thats exactly what i mean we dont know something for sure and therefore its not on the top forty list of acceptable topics but ron does is that it youve got hopes and fears you can share with ron but not with me he was hurt and mad and starting to swing pretty freely maybe rock her with a roundhouse so what kind of dreams did you and ron share and talk about i didnt have any dreams with ron dismas i only have dreams with you that stopped him her eyes were beginning to well up he reached over pulling her to him i dont want to yell at you he said i dont understand this right now im trying he pulled back so he could look at her ive been trying with our whole lives too you know i do try to be there for you and the kids i havent been distant on purpose i know i shouldnt have let ron even be friends not that way thats all it was really but i it seemed innocent really starting out you know connecting finally to somebody hardy knew just before vincent had been born hed had the same experience connection infatuation fire that he had ducked away from before it had burned him and frannie he knew i shouldnt have let him get important she said i should have seen it and stopped but we were just talking it didnt seem it would hurt anything except its put you here that brought them back to where they were although of course they hadnt gone anywhere it was almost midnight and the next morning their own children would be waking up at grandmas with neither of their parents around frannie shivering now looked down at her orange jumpsuit this time the tears did well over im so sorry dismas im so sorry he pulled her back to him and moved his hand up and down over her back feeling pretty damn sorry himself glitsky was at his desk sipping from a mug of tepid tea trying to get a take on what frannie had told him which wasnt much that he hadnt already known bree and the oil wars but so what hed been a homicide inspector for a long time and the idea that this was some sort of businessrelated slaying was for him almost too farfetched to consider when he got back to basics and asked himself who stood to benefit from brees death he came up with ron so regardless of how much hed prefer sharron pratt and scott randall to be wrong he was thinking hed be wise not to forget entirely about him it might be nice to find an alternative suspect but if homicide took the road less travelled and found no one on it after the da had shown them the way he had a hunch hed be hearing about it for a decade or two he was vaguely aware of two inspectors writing reports out in the open homicide detail suddenly there was a shadow in his doorway and he looked up i was half expecting you not to show which half hardy asked he stepped into the office and crabwalked around the desk which barely fit into the room to one of the wooden chairs wedged into the tiny space that was left frannie told me you two had a nice talk the lieutenant was twirling his mug around and around wrestling with something im not too happy about what i heard diz im thinking it may be ron after all hardy was pokerfaced keeping it casual how could he have done it i mean like when and where i know there are problems with it like he wasnt there would that be one of them lowkey but the last thing he needed now was to get homicide on ron because they would have a good shot at finding him which would put him and his kids back in the system it would eliminate hardys own private agenda the only one he believed that could produce a satisfactory conclusion to this mess so he asked what do you have on bree what did griffin get the mug stopped halfway to glitskys mouth then came back down glitskys normal expression was something between a frown and a scowl and now it moved a few degrees south carl might have had the case closed in two hours if he hadnt died or he might have been nowhere either way he didnt get to writing up his reports paperwork wasnt his strong point what was glitsky narrowed his eyes what are you getting at well he must have done something just because theres not much in the file doesnt mean theres nothing he had glitskys interest now and he kept going was griffin married did he talk to his wife anybody in the office here who supervised at the crime scene they must have gotten some kind of physical evidence at brees place i mean griffin was in this right he had to have something hardy found it a lot easier getting into the penthouse with the key that ron had given him once inside he turned and locked the door behind him then switched on the lights nothing obvious had changed since he and canetta had walked out together last night but hardy felt a dim charge as he started for the office with the answering machine what was it stopping completely telling himself that it was probably the difference between being merely tired which was last night and semicomatose now he still took a minute getting his bearings casting his eyes around the periphery of the rooms while hed been visiting downtown with frannie and then glitsky hed left his gun stowed in his trunk when he got back to his car hed tucked it back into his belt now feeling stupid about it for the second time in five hours didnt stop him from pulling it out again the paintings the view the dining area all the same it was nothing he concluded he was the walking dead at the moment seeing ghosts maybe playing with them but suddenly there it was hed gone out to the balcony last night and to do that hed pulled the drapes aside a foot or two he remembered it specifically because from the inside of the house where he stood now he hadnt been able to see the french doors leading out to the balcony from which bree had been thrown he hadnt known that the doors were there and now they were covered again the drapes pulled closed he crossed the living room again the dining area with its seating nook trying to remember growing more sure of it neither he nor canetta had come anywhere near this area last night and as hardy was leaving hed glanced back at the room one last time the french doors stuck in his mind and that meant the drapes hadnt been pulled closed moving them aside again he pushed open one of the doors and stepped back out on to the balcony over to its edge it still was a long way down fighting vertigo he backed up a step nothing had been moved nothing had changed so somebody had pulled the drapes against the unlikely event that he would be seen moving around twelve floors up at the scene of a murder a last glance and hardy was inside this time pulling the drapes behind him he still had the gun in his hand hello he called out anybody here silence flicking the hall and room lights on before him he took a tour of the back rooms as he and canetta had done last night nothing looked disturbed even the office presumably the location of brees important files was as hed last seen it except for one thing the counter on the answering machine which last night had read now was a zero all the messages had been erased part two saturday morning in an empty house gradually over the past several years but chronically it seemed in the last few months hardy wasnt happy at home kids constantly underfoot frannie with her women friends talking about kids mostly kids fighting discipline kids sports games school homework lessons meals they didnt eat pets they didnt care for kids kids kids whenever anyone asked him directly he always said he loved his own kids and he thought he did but if he had it to do over being honest with himself he had doubts when theyd started out frannie and he had read all the books about marriages coping with the changes of a growing family hardy had often wondered since why somebody hadnt written the real book called children dont because hed come to believe that having a family didnt simply change things it ended that earlier existence you might go into it thinking you were retaining the essentials of the old life merely adding to its richness and variety but in a few years you had a whole new life and it felt as if none of it was really yours hed come around to accepting as absolute fact that paradise would be sleeping in on a saturday and waking up to an empty quiet house maybe one that would stay that way now doing it suddenly he wasnt so sure the sun was in his eyes he threw a forearm over them then squinted out his bedroom window over the city where was he anyway it came back to him hed slept in his clothes crashing on the bed the gun was on his reading table where the clock read eight thirty he must have been a zombie on wheels he didnt remember anything about driving home where hed parked letting himself in god it was quiet bones creaking he forced himself to sit up saw the gun and reached for it he got up and went into the bathroom throwing cold water on his face trying to wake all the way up through the rooms then to the front door which hed locked then back down the long hallway to the kitchen the house felt hollow as though the soul of it had been sucked out the kids he realized frannie it struck him forcibly a revelation standing by his sturdy roughhewn table in a wellequipped and beautiful kitchen on a fantastic indian summer morning he felt nothing but an underlying sense of terror a vast pervasive unease this was the alternative but he had work to do and yesterday had been a reminder that the engine wouldnt work without fuel his black and ancient castiron pan was in its place on the back burner no matter what he cooked in it nothing ever stuck he cleaned it only with salt and a wipe with a rag since hardy had first cured it the pan had never known detergent or water and now its surface was a flat black pearl turning the gas on under it he threw down a thin layer of salt from the shaker then crossed to the refrigerator he grabbed a couple of eggs evidently frannie had been marinating filet mignons for thursday night when the grand jury session had intervened hardy picked one of the steaks from its ceramic bowl and dropped it into the pan then broke an egg on either side of it there was a loaf of sourdough in its bag by the bread drawer and he sliced off about a third of it cut it down the middle poured some olive oil on to one of the cut sides and placed it next to the sizzling steak while everything cooked on one side he put on a pot of coffee then turned the bread and the meat laid the eggs on the toasted side broke the yolks turned off the pan and went in to shower the day when he hit the street outside was impossibly bright warm and fragrant he felt hopeful and motivated a far cry from how hed woken up when he couldnt figure out a move and then unable to focus hadnt been able to locate his car for ten minutes but running on automatic he knew that whatever else he did he had to go to erins first to check in and see vincent and rebecca make sure they were getting along all right at their grandmothers and that visit had provided him with a bonus as well as the usual territorial disputes last night ed and erin had taken them to the planetarium and they were telling him about all they had learned and the cool way the night sky came up vincent didnt believe it was an optical illusion he was sure it was the real night sky it was it was exactly the sky dad they just opened the roof and there was the moon and the stars and everything shooting a glare at rebecca the literalist daring her to contradict him but hardy cut them off ive seen it too vin it is the exact sky i love that too a warning eye at his girl dont say anything let him have this one finally he got to her so beck whatd you see his daughter always ready to show off a fact no longer cared about the truth of the night sky her father had finessed vincent and given her the floor and that was all that mattered well the main thing was about whats that moon vin i dont know but around jup yeah thats it around jupiter one of the moons has an atmosphere and water and everything you need for life what about heat inside dad molten core and volcanoes just like a mile under the ocean here on earth wheres the heat there inside see great i bet it could happen definitely they even showed what could grow as if we were there some of them you know what i thought was the best thing vincent had to get a word in the becks not done vin one more shell never get done shell keep going till you have to go hardy thought of a new name for his dont have that child book the endless referee but he sighed beck are you almost done but she must have been truly happy to have her dad there or else wanted nothing more than to please him which did happen she hesitated only a second before smiling he can go ok vin what did you think was the best thing the boy was so thrilled with his good fortune interrupting his sister and it worked that for a moment hardy thought hed forgotten what he was going to say this happened all the time and invariably made vincent cry but it was suddenly a morning for miracles the fact had come back to him how you can see a star when you cant see it it must have been obvious that hardy didnt understand vincent tried it another way when its too dim when you cant see it otherwise what is a star or a planet or anything in the sky if its really dim the way you see it is you dont look right at it you look to the side we did it it really works so when hardy left his next stop wasnt frannie or abe or his reporter friend jeff elliot to catch up on the beaumont case at his sons suggestion he wasnt going to look directly at it for a while he still had clients and phone messages and paperwork so he went to his office to attend to those and sure enough somewhere in the middle of that he remembered that phil canetta had stood behind him with his spiral pocket filing system and hed written down all the names on rons answering machine he had told hardy he worked out of central station so he looked up the number and made the call the central station close to the border of chinatown and north beach was where hardy wanted to open his restaurant when he retired not that there werent dozens of other fantastic dining establishments within a couple of blocks firenze by night amelios rose pistola the north beach restaurant caffe sport the gold spike but the smells of coffee breads licorice sesame roasted duck cheeses fish and sausages kept tourists in a near constant feeding frenzy even the locals such as hardy werent immune after his breakfast he wasnt at all hungry but as soon as he stepped out of his car and caught a whiff of it all danged if he didnt think he could go for a little smackerel of something it was a wonder he thought that the cops out of central werent the most overweight in the city plus parking the fivestory public parking structure was directly across the street and would never under any conditions be approved by todays city planners because after all what kind of political statement could a parking structure make its only purpose would be functional and the shakers in the city hadnt cared about that issue in years and years hardy was walking out of its utilitarian perfection now trying to figure whom he could bribe to condemn the station building so he and maybe david freeman could open some hip new spot there somebody had done it recently with mel bellis old building and you couldnt get inside the place now freeman another old lawyer might react to the precedent and certainly hed know whom to bribe canetta cut a completely different figure in his uniform with the three stripes on his arm his handcuffs bullet belt gun and nightstick he was definitely a cop through and through he appeared more substantial than hed been the other night heavier older thicker in the chest hardy had arrived at what might be considered early lunchtime and canetta obviously wanted to get away from the station if he was going to talk about any of this they stopped at molinaris deli so canetta could get a sandwich mortadella and swiss with the waxy sharp pepperoncini hardy loved and usually couldnt resist although today he did he bought a large pellegrino water instead they walked up columbus to washington square a few minutes of small talk an update on frannie brought them to an unoccupied bench directly across from the twin spires of sts peter and paul coit tower presided over the row of buildings to their right in front of them a barechested man with gray hair in a long pony tail was trying to train an irish setter to fetch a frisbee canetta unwrapped his sandwich and hardy started talking somebody had been in the penthouse and at least erased the tape perhaps theyd taken something as well canetta let a few seconds pass looked sideways at hardy fiddled with his sandwich wrapper that was me hardy tried not to show his surprise you went back after we left last night a bite of sandwich a long time chewing then a nod i already had whod called right wrote em all down he patted his back pocket where he kept his notebook then he went on explaining my answering machine at home it only takes nine messages i figured his might be the same and if somebody else called him i didnt want the machine full up makes sense hardy said although that wasnt what he thought but it was a done deed and in any event canetta was going on you know they always say its the husband hardy nodded i used to hear that a lot when i was a cop now im not so sure its true you were a cop canetta looked him over with new eyes its been a few years but just after nam before i went to law school i walked a beat glitsky was my partner matter of fact a moments reflection while this settled then a question so the head of homicides your old buddy and youre coming to me im the one whose wifes in jail glitskys got two guys on the investigation but its three weeks old now and theyre dont have a thing and you think you can help them no i think i can help me canetta liked that and smiled little slow for you are they huh the suits and there it was again the animosity between the street police and the inspectors hardy had picked up a trace of it the first night and not looking directly at it it had seemed he might be able to get something out of it but he had to play the hand close the way i see it is this theyre holding my wife because of something she knows about ron right ok because rons their suspect another nod so if i can give them somebody else anybody but ron the heats off frannie theyll let her go since what she knows isnt part of a murder he could see that the idea appealed to canetta the strategic considerations were provocative enough but suddenly there was something more the chance to show up the inspectors downtown if canetta was any part of the solution to a homicide hed get a hell of a lot of print and even more prestige i told you the other night and ill say it again i think its brees work and youre saying youd start with the phone messages hardy nodded ron had calls from both of brees camps so im asking myself why theyd call ron what was in those files one of them talked about youre saying that was why she was killed his sandwich now forgotten canetta was already digging for his notebook not exactly im saying if it wasnt ron and for my own reasons id prefer it wasnt then this is the next rock to look under valens and jim pierce yeah what canettas eyes had narrowed he was staring out across the park nothing really except i know pierce a little that freelance security work i told you about and a shrug i dont think i should talk to him about any of this he knows im not in homicide and hed bust my sorry ass this made sense and hardy agreed easily enough but how about some of these others you still in this marie for example whos she canetta answered with a guarded enthusiasm clearly he still wanted to be part of this but he wasnt going to show how much the insurance guy would probably be the easiest one to get a hold of he said bill tilton if hes local hes probably listed hardy had his own notebook out now and was copying the names he planned to see ron later today and get many of these answers but canetta could be useful a badge in his service ok weve got one other person with a last name this woman sasaka with the mystery appointment a thought struck canetta ron knew a lot of women didnt he hardy didnt want to pursue that ron wasnt going to be his focus tapping his fingers on his pad making a show of thinking he finally looked up what was the security work where you met bree hotel stuff bunch of suits down from sacramento lobbyists politicians one time the vice president secret service yada yada so what was your assignment did you guard individual people no nothing like that canetta obviously didnt like the work stand at the doors take your hardware be a presence you know these guys they like to make a show how important they all are but even at these meetings bree was somebody he nodded somberly oh yeah she stood out i mean first was the looks thing especially in this bunch of geeks and wonks but then shed always give some talk and bring down the house she had this sincere quality a lot of passion i guess canetta was stumbling over himself trying to make hardy see like she really believed in things i mean she got to people you know what im saying at least hardy was thinking she got to canetta but now the cop his eyes far away again seemed to be considering something he was halfswallowing and his next words nearly decked hardy couple of other times you know i talked to her he kept his voice neutral but it was an effort you mean personally canetta still wasnt completely committed to revealing this but after a beat he nodded coincidences really the way it started i was doing traffic duty a day or two after one of these shows a pause deciding to keep talking i dont know three four months ago its early evening i pull her over for speeding about a block from her place its obvious shes had a couple she was drunk maybe a quick exhale letting some of the tension go hardy suddenly understanding a little about why canetta didnt want to talk to him at the station house he was already involved here im alone in the cruiser i recognize her of course i dont cite her shes not like out of her mind blowing maybe a one is my guess long story short she gets in and i drive her home she got in his cruiser hardy wanted to ask if anything else had gone on in his line of work it wasnt uncommon to hear about some cop pulling over a pretty woman because the tread on her back tires was worn down so he could meet her be charming and find out if she was available much more seriously if less common was that it wasnt unknown for a cop to get a womans address off her drivers license and start stalking hardy was sure it was because hed established his credentials as an excop a member of the club that canerta was telling him that hed broken every rule in the book with bree still it was unsettling and it wasnt over so anyway little while later im passing the building and shes standing out on the sidewalk i stop and ask her does she need a lift someplace but no shes waiting for somebody to come pick her up we talk a minute what about a shrug she just thanked me for not writing her up said she didnt usually drink too much shed just been under a lot of pressure recently job stuff i tell her i heard her talk a couple of times it seems to me shes doing some real good with her work making a real difference but she shakes her head its all a mess she says then like stops not wanting to say anything else says shes sorry i ask her for what and she says like everything a silence did you tell any of this to griffin who carl griffin the inspector who got the case a sideways glance he didnt ask me im just a station cop what could i know the sergeant had gotten himself hunched over elbows on knees during the telling now suddenly he sat back up as though surprised at where they were he remembered his sandwich and took a bite his jaw working furiously hardy killed a minute with his water you married phil eleven years he said evenly we got a son just turned twelve sometimes you think if things were different if you could have a choice hardy clearly heard what he didnt say you meet someone like bree and you wish you wish you wish but the option isnt there anymore but youd meet with her with bree nothing that arranged id pass by the same time of day and she got so shed be there sometimes wed say hi hows it goin like that tell the truth the feeling i got was she wanted to be reassured that i was there like her protector he took in a ton of air and let it out slowly and then she gets killed on my watch jim pierce lived in a threestory italianate structure set behind a wraparound high white stucco wall the property was in what realtors would call a serious neighborhood on north point a block from the palace of fine arts on this lovely saturday in the early afternoon the tourists and even what appeared to be some locals were out in droves enjoying the marina district escorting hordes of children through the exploratorium eating gourmet picnic items and feeding the ducks in the lake with the leftovers all of which hardy got to see in his sevenblock walk back to north point from the parking space he finally located after circling the lake four times as he went hardy found himself considering the possibility that the ducks were inadvertently being fed bits of duck from chinatown the odd smear of duck paté maybe some seared duck cracklings or breast slices from someones salad and that this cannibalistic feeding would someday give rise to the dreaded mad duck disease which wouldnt be discovered yet for another twenty years by which time it would be too late todays trendy duck eaters would be dropping like flies hed let his mind wander as a defense to the sense of intimidation hed felt when hed first identified the house from the address canetta had provided but now he was here before the imposing black solid metal gate and there was nothing to do but push the burton a pleasant contralto cultured female voice answered yes who is it hardy told her said he was afraid it was about bree beaumont again he was sorry keeping his role vague since he really didnt have one she hesitated then asked him to please wait for a moment he thought he might have gotten lucky and he put his hand on the knob waiting for the click as it unlocked instead an impatient male voice rasped through the speaker who the hell is this ive already talked to you people halfadozen times ive talked to the grand jury when are you going to let me have a little peace i swear to god im trying to cooperate but im tempted to ask for a warrant this time this is getting a little ridiculous but the gate clicked and hardy pushed it open for all the imposing nature of his house and even with the impatient tone in his voice jim pierce came across as a nice guy he opened the front door before hardy was halfway up the walk do they change investigators downtown every five minutes nowadays no wonder you people arent getting anywhere hardy squinted in the bright sunlight pierce wore a white polo shirt with a colorful logo over the left breast a pair of wellworn but pressed khakis tassled loafers with no socks im just watching the game notre dame usc the irish are eating them for lunch you like football i used to like notre dame back when parsegian coached hardy said he was on the porch stairs and pierce was already a step into the dark interior of the house you ought to know im not with the police pierce stopped and turned back i thought carrie said it was about bree oh never mind it was his turn to squint hardy stayed outside framed in the doorway so what can i do for you whats this about hardy introduced himself as a lawyer doing some work for brees husband ron you called him last week a flash of surprise i did yes sir i believe so the expression held as apparently he tried to remember all right then i must have did i say what it was about you asked him to call you back something about brees effects did you ever hear back from him pierce didnt have to think about it no can i ask you what you wanted the niceguy image was fading slightly pierce was getting tired of fielding questions about bree one of my duties involves community relations he said i think she took a lot of boilerplate with her when she left form letters standard language pr materials disks it would be helpful to have it back so why didnt you ask her for it when she was alive i did she wasnt very well disposed toward the company after she left i thought ron might be a little more malleable by degrees pierce had moved back to the doorway and now stood perhaps two feet from hardy his hand back on the door by all signs ready to say goodbye but something stopped him now how about if i ask you one sure as a lawyer what are you doing for ron the police dont have suspicions of him do they theyre eliminating suspects right now and hes one of them maybe i can find something to get them off him so you dont think he killed bree something in his tone set off bells hardy cocked his head you do no i didnt say that thats funny thats what it sounded like no he sighed again this time the weariness unmistakable lord where will this end i dont know who killed bree im still having a hard time believing anyone could kill her that someone purposely ended her life hardy suddenly noticed the pallor under pierces ruddy cheeks lack of sleep time spent indoors the darkened house he put it together that like canetta pierce was in a kind of mourning another guy laid out by brees death the woman certainly had cut a swath if you had to guess mr pierce why was she killed a blank look his mind no longer on hardy i dont know i realize that you cant talk about what you told the grand jury suddenly pierce seemed to realize they were still in the doorway im sorry where are my manners keeping you standing out here come on in hardy stood a minute inside his eyes adjusting now that hed asked him in pierce seemed uncertain what to do next he motioned to a large bowl on a table next to the door help yourself to some candy if youd like almond roca the best hardy thanked him and took a couple unpeeling the gold wrapper on one of them as pierce led him back through the foyer it wasnt just the almond roca the best seemed to be the underlying theme of the place formal living areas oneofakind furniture tenfoot ceilings they bypassed the winding staircase the television droned in a small room and pierce poked his head in halftime he said and kept walking the last door on the right opened into a modern kitchen where a woman sat at the island counter facing away from them reading a magazine she half turned as they entered excuse us carrie mr hardy my wife then explaining hes not with the police after all mr beaumonts attorney she got off her stool and stood extending a cool firm hand a nod of the regal head holding on to hardys hand an instant longer than was customary mrs pierce was no child no recent trophy wife she appeared to be just to either side of forty but hardy decided immediately that she was not just very attractive but almost disturbingly beautiful widely set startling blue eyes dominated the face of a northern italian goddess he estimated she was wearing two thousand dollars worth of tailored casual wear that emphasized the slim waist her dark hair was pulled back in a severe style that highlighted the sculpted bones of her face simple designer gold earrings dangled from what seemed to be designer earlobes and a wide gold necklace graced a flawless expanse of finely pored honeytoned skin over the rise of a deep and dangerous cleavage have they charged mr beaumont she asked in her cultured voice a pretty frown clouding her perfect brow not yet hardy hoped he wasnt stammering im trying to keep that from happening i was just asking your husband why he thought bree beaumont was killed or why hes a suspect carrie pierce said it matteroffactly he was brees mentor from the beginning thats why they worked closely together and of course people talked people tend to be jealous not to believe that men and women who work together can be friends without a brief look of distaste i mean the world doesnt really turn around sex after all hardy thought it was good coloration for carrie pierce to believe that he doubted that any man had ever looked at her and not thought about sex but if she wanted to retain a sense of her value as a person outside of that context shed better believe that there was more the point is pierce said that evidently someone one of my colleagues perhaps had told the police that id been furious at bree for leaving caloco especially so abruptly and were you pierce looked at his wife then nodded pretty mad yes betrayed hurt all of it but that was personal but her leaving changing sides in these gas additive wars i keep hearing about that was business pierce wore a look of amused toleration and you think that the big bad oil companies got together and because shed had a philosophical change of heart we decided to kill her hardy had to smile himself actually hearing it out loud it doesnt sound too plausible its completely absurd carrie said regardless of what you may hear on the radio murder isnt really one of calocos business tools or any of the seven sisters seven sisters pierce explained thats what they call us the spinoffs of standard oil after antitrust broke up the mother company but none of the sisters would have any reason to kill bree or anybody else frankly we dont need to hardy said it mildly even for three billion dollars pierce had on his tolerant face the one hardy supposed he used for the public and what is that figure three billion dollars where does that come from thats the number ive been hearing isnt that the yearly income from this gas additive everyones fighting about mtbe thats the one pierce nodded that sounds about right three billion he pulled out a stool sat on it and indicated hardy take one too which he did carrie excused herself and moved over to the main counter to pour more coffee hardy tried not to follow her movements but it was not easy he tore his eyes away back to pierce so my point is that thats a lot of money and if bree led the charge against this stuff but pierce was shaking his head no he lifted his hand ticking off the points on his fingers first bree didnt have anything like that kind of power she wrote our drafts she was a great and persuasive spokesperson but jesus christ himself could come down and say mtbe was the devil and it wouldnt just go away the stuff has cleaned up the air unbelievably it works mr hardy the epa loves it hell it mandates it thats a long way from being outlawed its not going away because one woman says it might have side effects which ps is nowhere near proved second and this is always a tough one to sell but three billion really isnt all that much money hardy had to reply three billion were talking three billion dollars pierce nodded its all relative its mixed into gas at eleven per cent and basically the stuffs only used in california and only for half the year at that so you do the math three billion represents about ten per cent of half of californias gasoline bill its a drop in the bucket youre telling me you wouldnt miss three billion dollars somebody in some department might notice but longterm thats exactly what im saying its nothing carrie came back over with an urn of coffee china cups and saucers sugar and cream on a silver platter its the hardest part of jims job mr hardy making people see that this isnt all about money they think because we make a profit that we must be evil but jim hired bree to do good to find out how to make a better product better for the world no one seems to understand that and that cost billions too to retool the refineries pierce reached over and patted her hand what carries saying is that its a complicated issue its true that weve spent billions developing mtbe and for a while everyone was thrilled with it it seemed to be doing the job now some questions have come up and were looking into them but the point is that were committed to clean fuels and if it turns out that we have to develop some new refining tool well do that even if it costs billions which it will because everything costs billions thats the price of admission in this league he took a sip of his coffee but the other point mr hardy is that bree getting a case of the doubts is no reason on gods earth for any oil company to do anything much less have her killed and thats essentially what i told the police hardy picked up his own cup and took a drink most of what pierce said made logical sense if he accepted the premise that three billion dollars wasnt a lot of money but that remained a bit of a leap i once figured out how long it would take to count to a billion he said if you did nothing else one number every half second twelve hours a day you want to guess pierce shrugged i dont have any idea a week hardy shook his head thirtytwo years give or take a few months pierce chuckled get out of here its a really big number a billion hardy said can that be right carrie asked hardy nodded its right but my point is it might be why people seem to have a hard time thinking three billion isnt a lot of money why bree might have been killed for it she was one person mr hardy pierce said so was hitler if hed been killed it might have avoided world war two he shrugged look im not saying i dont believe you im trying to get a handle on what i keep hearing on the radio that the oil companies had a motive to kill her pierce remained unruffled as though hed heard it all before which he probably had youre welcome to look mr hardy but it will waste a lot of your time he sipped coffee hardy had the impression he was stalling for a moment then he seemed to reach some decision and sighed you know the source of all this radio nonsense dont you no i thought it was kind of a groundswell pierce was shaking his head not at all its a wellfunded group of ecoterrorists dont laugh thats what they call themselves ecoterrorists and and they all seem to be working to get damon kerry elected since hes the standard bearer against mtbe all right hardy didnt see where this was going well at the time she left us bree was very much under the spell of damon kerry too perhaps more although i shouldnt say that after all ive had to endure on that score he glanced at his wife whose lovely face again betrayed her distaste at this subject pierce turned back to hardy what im saying is that at least these are the kind of people who admit to resorting to violence or the need for it maybe somehow bree crossed them joined the camp and was going to renege something like that youre not saying kerry no no no not personally but somebody behind him possibly really i dont know i dont like to point a finger at anybody but he trailed off hardy remembered canettas comments about al valens who had also left a message for ron beaumont a question presented itself you said this group these terrorists are wellfunded where do they get their money carrie nearly blurted it out thats easy sko pierce snapped at her we dont know that not for sure of course we do husband and wife glared at each other who hardy asked making a show of reluctance pierce let out a long breath spader krutch ohio the farming conglomerate hardy asked pierce nodded corn ethanol the other additive its a huge company as you say heavily subsidized by the government theyve got a stake in seeing mtbe outlawed so they could make the three billion dollars hardy asked carries color was up they would kill for it pierce shook his head from side to side i doubt that but there is i believe very little doubt that they are the source of these funds hardy digested this information for a moment have you told the police about this what exactly is there to tell pierce stood up hed given hardy several minutes nearly a halftimes worth and now the interview was over they asked me about my suspicions i told them id heard about these economic motives and frankly gave them short shrift poor bree wasnt assassinated she was murdered hardy realized that this from an oil companys senior vice president was selfserving but that didnt mean it wasnt true still he thought three billion dollars they had all begun moving back toward the front door carrie laid a hand on his arm guiding him through the dimness if there is anything more you need she said jim and i want to help but we dont really know anything more than weve told you theyd arrived in the foyer and pierce went for the door now that weve opened this can of worms mr hardy if youre convinced it isnt beaumont you might look into kerrys campaign after all the funding maybe the ecoterrorist thing there could be something there he sounded skeptical though hardy stopped blinking in the sudden sunlight let in by the open door it was the second time that pierce had inadvertently alluded to rons involvement in the murder but personally you still think its beaumont dont you a temporizing smile i believe these things tend to be personal lets say that if bree had just started an affair with one of kerrys people and ron found out he trailed off well thats motive anyway hardy wanted to say sos three billion dollars but instead he merely thanked the couple for their time handed them his card and turned back for the long walk to his parking space sergeant canettas sandwich from molinaris had given hardy the idea for all his peregrinations of the morning there hadnt been a minute when frannie wasnt somewhere in his consciousness now heading downtown for another visit to the jail it occurred to him that perhaps every instant she spent locked up didnt have to be hell since it often worked for him he reasoned that some good food might improve things temporarily for frannie to the point where it was only as bad as purgatory same conditions as hell but you really knew it would end someday so he stopped and bought a spread of delectables from davids delicatessen lox bagels cream cheese chopped chicken liver pastrami onion rolls pickles even three bottles of creme soda which was her favorite drink in the world that wasnt made from grapes only to be harshly rebuffed when he arrived at the jail was he crazy the desk sergeant wanted to know didnt hardy know better by now visitors werent allowed to bring anything for the inmates into the jail any piece of cake might have a razor blade or weapon in it any drink some dissolved drugs so reluctantly hardy left the bag at the desk the best of intentions one step into the room frannie turned from the guard and saw him sitting at the table smiling at her he spread out his arms sorry its just me he said i bought all your favorite food in the whole world i really did but they wouldnt let me bring any of it inside with a helpless expression he repeated that he was sorry she dissolved into tears just standing there in her orange jumpsuit hands at her sides looking at him and crying nat glitsky didnt like being interrupted when he was at temple lots of times when hed been younger hed been less than diligent at keeping the sabbath but now in his eighth decade hed come to believe that the ten commandments had gotten everything exactly right if you wanted to have a world full of healthy and productive people people should pay attention to the wisdom in all ten of them he believed they really should keeping the sabbath taking a day off kept you sane but nowadays even religious people mostly only acknowledged nine keeping holy the lords day was not only forgotten it had been completely subverted even reversed woe betide the lazy bum who took a whole day off every single week to reflect and try to gain some perspective on his life and work and the world around him there wasnt time for that there was only work it was wrong nats working days were over and all he wished now was that hed kept the sabbath sacred more often back when hed get overwhelmed with childraising or working or the pressures of his marriage it might not have changed his life much but at least it would have planted the seed in his son abraham who was always crushed under his workload and who now was sitting fidgeting really next to him and that was what adhering to the commandments was all about too it was generational it fostered the long view that human nature never changed only individual humans did but not so often as youd think nat finished his prayer and hit his son on the thigh ok they could get up and go outside now on the steps of the synagogue they both stopped squinting into the bright sunlight i love the boy abraham you know that its nothing to do with that its you abe drew in a deep breath whats me i didnt plan this you know having to go downtown on ritas day off they need me down there nat rolled his eyes dismissing that excuse they always need you down there your son needs you out here suppose i just say no ive got to go back to temple then what i dont know i guess i go get orel and bring him down with me among the criminals theres a fine solution better i should take him back here except hes got his soccer practice oh yes right much more important than temple on the sabbath well hes there dad and i told him youd be picking him up if youre not fine but ive got to know right now all right suddenly the serenity of the temple vanished and a rare flash of anger took its place nats voice took on a hard edge everythings now with you abraham you want to ask yourself why that is maybe abe raised his own voice no i dont need to ask myself that dad you want to know why its because everything is a crisis everything has to be done five minutes ago and so saturday rolls around and all the stuff that needed to be done on friday abe reined in his own escalating temper i dont know he said i dont know i dont mean to yell at you nat reached up and put a hand on his sons shoulder abe had his mother emmas height and of course her color he towered over his jewish old man who now shrugged i been yelled at before abraham its not the yelling im worried about its your boy its time passing and then its gone and you never saw it glitsky had told his father hed be getting home in time for dinner with him and orel nevertheless the discussion nagged at him as he drove down to the hall of justice it was still on his mind when he walked through the doorway into the long hall that led to the das office airport for flying assholes airways what did they really need him for now anyway on saturday afternoon the politicos thought they could just snap a finger and hed have to come arunnin and he was proving that they were right because here he was he should have just said no he had other plans he couldnt come down and discuss ron beaumont but it was too late now scott randall was in sharron pratts office with her lordship the das investigator peter struler chief of police dan rigby and abes predecessor as head of homicide captain frank batiste who was now an assistant chief and my werent things heating up four of the five of them everyone but batiste were already in a friendly discussion about something that abruptly halted as glitskys shadow crossed the rooms lintel ah lieutenant glitsky pratt was sitting on her desk and actually clapped her hands as though in delighted surprise that abe had dropped in batiste glitsky noticed had found a convenient neutral corner and was memorizing the stains on the ceiling tiles he was a good guy and his body language was telling abe a lot this wasnt his party which meant that hed been called down by the chief to neutralize abe and make sure that homicide accepted the message whatever it was rigby and randall sat on either end of the low couch looking at some papers spread on the table in front of them ah ms pratt unable to stop himself glitsky silently brought his own hands together sometimes imitation wasnt the sincerest form of flattery sometimes it meant that you saw through pretense and were telling the pretender that she was full of shit he stopped in the doorway and went into his best at ease he nodded at the men but no smile hey guys there was an awkward moment during which some glances were exchanged rigby evidently waiting for a signal that it was time to begin he cleared his throat about this beaumont thing abe and now the newspaper stories about this woman in jail glitsky nodded frannie her names frannie hardy yes of course it is frannie the chief looked over at pratt got some secret message cleared his throat and spoke again weve just about decided to put out an all points on ron the husband and we wanted to run it by you first to get your input we wanted to be sure we kept you in the loop abe pratt added glitsky did a quick take at batiste and the two conducted a milliseconds worth of nonverbal communication of their own then the lieutenant folded his arms and leaned his bulk against the door jamb i really appreciate your concern sharron thank you and this all points bulletin it would be in light of new evidence that investigator strulers come up with would that be it scott randall spoke up we want him for questioning thats all we want to talk to him you dont need me to talk to him glitsky couldnt have been more laid back you dont need me for an apb but im curious about what you plan to do if you find him after this all points manhunt he looked at struler then randall across the room batiste brought a hand up to his mouth and pulled on it to keep the corners down what do you mean struler asked we bring him in and you arrest him you mean cornered struler looked to randall then pratt he nodded sure with no evidence no chance to even get past a prelim and go to trial much less win you want a lawsuit for false arrest or what chief rigby cleared his throat again getting into the middle of it come on abe its not like theres no evidence glitsky turned to him it isnt i havent seen any if there is the mans disappeared randall said glitsky shrugged so whats new the murder was at his house pratt added theres no sign of anyone else she may have been having an affair and told him she was leaving process of elimination leaves ron glitsky withered her with a look of disbelief and wondered not for the first time if the city and countys top attorney had passed the bar or ever won a case in court it didnt seem possible you want to take that to a jury and get beyond reasonable doubt sharron youve got my sympathy rigby a political animal himself tried to smooth the waters the point is abe that in the real world weve got to move along on this but pratt couldnt keep herself out of it ive had calls from a lot of citizens plus were getting some very bad response to this woman being in jail pratt had made something of a career out of ignoring the rules of law now she seemed to be having a hard time reconciling herself to the fact that her political problems werent going to go away even if she broke more of them i got a call from the mayor this morning do you realize that again glitsky shrugged talk to judge braun about that the mayor has talked to her and although they wouldnt be here if glitsky didnt know the answer braun wasnt budging randall butted in with the crux of his theory if we get beaumont in custody abe he said we can shift public opinion away from frannie and on to ron hell be the bad guy for putting her in this position now glitsky had it all on the table these people were really from mars if memory serves he said it was you who put her in this position wasnt it scott but the young attorney waved that off i was perfectly justified and judge braun was also well within her rights its just that were starting to get a lot of political flack and want to sacrifice ron beaumont same as yesterday glitskys eyes raked the room this is not how it works guys a shake of his head he turned to rigby and asked the direct question chief what do you want me to do rigby was by now sitting on the front two inches of the couch he looked up balefully what have you got abe weve got griffins notes basically nothing ive got a better one for you he turned back to pratt sharron who specifically has been pressuring you to go get beaumont again some unspoken message seemed to pass among the airport staff struler pratt randall glitsky was getting a little tired of the secret handshake stupidity but experience had told him that if he let it run its course it might lead him somewhere pratt slid off the desk and went around it where she opened a drawer then closed it well naturally caloco would like to see the case closed theyre taking a lot of flack in the media as you may know and are they one of your contributors from pratts reaction glitsky could tell that the question had hit a mark he hadnt done twentyfive years of interrogations for nothing after all but pratt didnt blow her eyes narrowed slightly her game face appeared they contributed to my opponent as well sergeant and as long as whoever gets elected does them a favor whenever they ask they keep the money coming is that it so whats the favor here find a likely scapegoat and hang him out to dry sergeant youre out of line rigby barked but finally batiste took a few steps toward the group hed spent many years in homicide and suddenly had picked up a bad smell with all respect sir abes asked a good question if calocos trying to influence the investigation it increases the odds that they might somehow be involved thats ridiculous pratt exploded randall was up now supporting his boss completely ridiculous you cant make that kind of baseless charge captain calocos been the soul of cooperation i havent made any kind of charge batiste retorted im saying the lieutenant here has the right to ask the question do you have anything on caloco theres nothing on them they came to us and gave us a case of documents struler said hotly and we got ron implicated for a long moment nothing moved in the room finally scott randall whispered shit under his breath even rigby the politician there to steamroll glitsky into official compliance frowned into the well of silence batiste dropped a little echoing pebble what documents glitsky picked it up i havent seen any documents they werent any part of the original investigation pratt was hustling to put her finger in the dike but the water was spraying all around her caloco came to us voluntarily with what exactly and when glitsky suddenly was glad hed come in on this lovely saturday afternoon but he had to give it to pratt she didnt break boosting herself on to the desk again she gave a little apologetic smile ms beaumont had been a valued employee and a couple of weeks after she was killed when no suspect had turned up caloco called my office and offered all the files they had related to her and naturally glitsky said his voice thick with sarcasm because they related to a murder you informed my detail immediately so we could evaluate all the information youd already dumped the case randall said for another moment glitsky stood in the doorway he had straightened up from his slouch long ago this was not just petty politics but a serious breach of legal ethics formal obstruction of justice out of the das office glitsky was having trouble accepting it but he knew what he was going to do with it ill expect that box and all its contents on my desk within the hour glitsky hadnt received the box from the da by the time dismas hardy appeared at his office minutes after leaving his wife at the jail working on the sabbath he said from the doorway glitsky slumped over bunches of paper gave him the evil eye dont start really ok meanwhile while im not starting he tossed a bag on to the desk in front of him i figured i was here id see if you were and give you the leftovers todays my day for leftovers he pulled the bag over to him what is this glitskys face didnt exactly light up hardy thought that would be impossible but hardy was gratified by the expression is this lox tell me this is lox your favorite thered be more except the desk sergeant at the jail ate the first two pounds glitsky had ripped the bag open and was spreading out the contents on the brown paper you got this into the jail technically the answer to that would be no though they do love me down there i can tell but no food inside so they held it at the desk while i visited frannie can i come in since when do you ask hardy shrugged moving forward new policy ask first im trying it out he sat on the wooden chair across from glitskys desk while youre eating he said ive got to tell you about these three leprechauns glitsky rolled his eyes hardys jokes were a constant torture you ever wonder why its always three but his mouth was full and he was chewing happily so theyre all standing outside the guinness book of world records building and the first one says hes got the smallest hands in the world and hes going to show them to the guinness people and get in the book a couple of minutes later he comes out all thrilled ok glitsky was between bites second guys the feet third guys the dick whats the punch line hardy was used to this glitskys perennial cut to the chase third leprechaun comes out and he looks depressed and his friends ask him whats the matter does he have the smallest dick in the world or what i cant wait another bite of lox and bagel guy shakes his head looks at his friends and says who the hell is abe glitsky with the expected reaction that is none glitsky sat back i had a good time recently want to hear about it he outlined the events from his recent meeting with pratt and the rest of them and the withholding of calocos documents by the time hed finished hardy was sitting back in a kind of shock youre telling me dan rigby was in on this too do you realize you could have a good shot at taking down pratts office in fact i know a local lawyer whod be happy to help you get yourself promoted to chief glitsky made a face i dont want to be chief sometimes i dont even want to be head of homicide i just want to be a cop again catch bad guys you might be doing that here what do you thinks going to turn up in the box whatevers in there hed find out soon enough can you believe the arrogance though it never occurred to any of them that they didnt have every right to that evidence it came to their office so it was theirs and whatever they should legally do be damned you better watch out hardy said youre starting to sound like a lawyer he pushed back his chair a couple of inches so thats what brought you down here today glitsky nodded more or less and here i thought it might have been your two inspectors checking into carl griffins investigation as your best friend had suggested had stumbled on to something well since you mention it glitsky bunched the brown paper bag and tossed it into his wastebasket the papers hed been studying before hardys arrival didnt appear to be in any order but he started picking through them as though hed arranged them in some way heres copies of some notes from griffins notebook he was working the building where bree lived no sign hed gotten anywhere with witnesses but it was carl and he didnt write any followup he glanced up at hardy and shrugged so who knows glitsky picked up another stapled group of pages crime scene zip no glass anywhere to match what was in her scalp which was what a flip of a page the theory is that it was from a leaded crystal wine or champagne glass the beaumonts didnt have anything to match on hand hardy was into griffins notes heres jim pierce again damon kerry al valens howd griffin get these guys the grieving husband your friend ron wanted to help find whoever killed her and he thought one of these guys but glitsky was shaking his head he just gave carl a bunch of names diz people bree had hung out with a pause why did you say jim pierce again what you said heres jim pierce again hardy smiled that wasnt me it must have been somebody else then relenting itd be neat if the odd slip of the tongue got by you once in a while anyway i just visited him pierce and his wife a couple of hours ago youll be gratified to know that your inspectors had already been there a nod rattling his cage is all hes got a decent alibi just decent driving to work left home around eight at the embarcadero office forty minutes later forty minutes i just did it in fifteen this is saturday afternoon try it on a weekday morning rush hour coleman and batavia did it last night and it took em an hour and he was at his desk forty minutes later glitsky shrugged ok anythings possible as we know but nobodys put him anywhere near her place he told my guys he hadnt seen her in four months theyre checking but so far they hear the same thing no contact what about damon kerry this time glitskys mouth tightened hes running for governor diz i just dont think so i dont either but was he around at least glitsky nodded he was in town shooting tv spots seeing her sometimes often were they sleeping together this almost brought a true smile which for glitsky was a rarity what a quaint way to put it lets just say that for a married woman she spent a lot of time with him but its not like kerrys such a hot item that reporters are on him around the clock his people quote resent the implication she was a technical adviser on environmental matters thats the story on the payroll no another committed volunteer which is what makes this country great he held up a hand i know but griffin never got to him and here four days before the election without any physical evidence you dont just send two inspectors down to grill him why not i would glitsky liked that im sure you would which is why you dont work for the city anymore no what you do is what weve done ask him to come down and give a statement and of course hes promised full cooperation as soon as hes got a free minute which ought to be by christmas hes going to give it top priority a weary sigh you know diz you and i might have our good reasons for hoping it isnt ron but it still might be really he looks a lot better than kerry or pierce for that matter and thats even before whats in the mystery box hardy didnt want glitsky thinking this way he was shaking his head i dont think so i like it that kerrys in election mode hes stressed to the max and this lady hits him with something thatll derail his campaign hes got no time to think so he does the first thing that occurs to him and she winds up dead oops makes perfect sense to me hes at her house could have been do we know you find his prints prints please fingerprints were useful when they could be crosschecked against those of known criminals but if someone hadnt ever committed a crime their prints would not be in the database we got prints from the door to the balcony and some dishes in the sink rons prints and the kids which we didnt need to run cause we knew who they were then weve got a dozen fifteen more unidentified could be other kids family friends anybody but no known criminals maybe damon kerry though we may never know and even if he was so what it puts him at the scene glitsky rolled his eyes his patience with amateur detective work growing thin why wouldnt he be at the scene at some point in the last few months he knew her so he went to her house so what listen he continued ill tell you what you get to kerry borrow his shoes and find some lead crystal residue on them then find somebody who can put him at brees place or better yet can prove they were doing each other or stopped doing each other or anything his voice wore down his eyes came up the more i think about it diz and i hate to say it hardy held up a hand then dont the pulgas water temple sits in a peaceful and picturesque location among low rolling hills about twenty miles south of san francisco a semicircle of high white ionian columns rises behind a reflecting pool and forms an elegant structure that commemorates the completion of one of the most famous or infamous engineering feats in california history the hetchhetchy project this marvel of architecture and city planning captured the plentiful water and snowmelt of the sierra nevada mountain range at yosemite and delivered it mostly underground over nearly two hundred miles into a shallow valley that had once been an indian prayer grounds this onceholy spot is now the crystal springs reservoir the source of san franciscos drinking water and in fact one of the principle reasons that naturally dry san francisco is a major metropolitan center and not a quaint tourist destination with nice views and bad weather the sculpted grounds of the temple is a popular picnic destination and this bright warm afternoon held a typical indian summer scene family blankets with food and drink spread on the grass boats in the reflecting pool dogs and kids and couples and a handful of bicyclists and solitary readers occasionally a sheriffs patrol car from san mateo county would cruise the lot but there was no regular security presence at the site there had never been any need of one the parking lot was nearly filled and the nondescript chevy camaro that pulled off the main road and into it had to park at the far northern end nearly three hundred yards from the temple the two middleaged men got out of the front seat and the two women from the rear all of the eventual witnesses agreed that the group was dressed too warmly for the day the women with scarves over their heads the men with hats pulled low but as they got out of the car they attracted no attention without exchanging a word they congregated at the trunk then two men and one of the women began walking toward the temple with a large picnic basket the other woman got back into the car in the drivers seat and rolled down the window from where they had parked the three carriers hadnt been able to hear a thing except the twittering of the birds and the casual noise of the picnickers but as they got closer a low roar gradually became audible then undeniable either of you guys ever jump in here when you were a kid the first man asked he didnt want an answer was babbling out of nervousness and neither of his two companions said a word in any case his story was drowned out in the sound of the water pouring out of the input pipes into the temple but he kept right on talking when i was growing up this was the thing to prove your manhood let me tell you i knew a guy broke a leg and almost drowned but i rode it halfway down to the lake he was referring to what had once been a popular rite of passage for teenagers on san franciscos peninsula for years males with testosterone poisoning would come down here with other guys or their girlfriends mostly at dusk and jump over the low wall of the temple down fifteen feet into the churning icecold water which surged at thousands of gallons per second into a circular tiled pool the flow would pick these kids up or occasionally push them down and not let go and shoot them out a fiftyfoot submerged tunnel then to the canal that led to the reservoir now in response to the occasional drowning the state had installed a widemeshed steel grate to cover the pool and jumping in was no longer an option as the three conspirators got to the low wall the woman she was by all accounts the leader looked back and made sure that their car had pulled out of its space and was now idling ready to take them out of here there was a young couple on the platform with them the boys arm around his girl both of them mesmerized by the rushing water unlikely to move away in the next five minutes a solo man midfifties in shorts and hiking boots was climbing the low steps to the temple even as she waited and behind him a family of four were getting up from their blanket looking like they were walking this way the shorts and boots man caught her eyes for an instant and she too quickly stupidly looked away guilt guilt guilt he kept looking at her shed caught his attention a critical mistake he seemed to notice the picnic basket on the ground at her feet his brow darkened perhaps at the baskets unlikely presence there perhaps at the somewhat odd trio in scarves and pulleddown hats jackets and heavy pants she cast another quick glance to the family behind them yes they were coming here too up to the temple their car was in place now waiting she couldnt wait any longer even if it had to get a little ugly theyd planned for this contingency they were ready she nodded to her two partners jerked her head indicating the middleaged solo hiker in their planning meetings they had decided that if fate handed them a situation like this they would take full advantage of it this would increase the profile of what they were doing the public outcry was always vastly more satisfying if people got hurt or dead that possibility made the game that much more meaningful it also gave it a greater edge of excitement one of her men lifted the picnic basket to the edge of the railing while the other strolled casually over behind the man who was now apparently transfixed by the show beneath them the crashing water and noise and simple power of the spectacle but then he looked up again and saw the picnic basket in its even more unlikely place he started to raise a hand began to speak so she could hear hey whats it was time to move another nod and both men went into action her partner who had once jumped into this temple to prove his manhood caught the solo hiker from behind and flipped him over the edge as if he were a sack of flour at the same time her other partner had opened the top of the basket and taken out one of the fivegallon buckets dumping it whole on to the grate while she did the same with the other one and then they were running the basket left behind the teenage lovebirds left flatfooted unable to decide whether to help the older hiker or chase the bad guys they skirted the approaching family on a dead run piled into their waiting camaro and sped with squealing tires from the parking lot hardy heard about it on the radio on the way to his office after his talk with glitsky the emergency news report was warning citizens of san francisco to avoid using their tap water until the actual substance that had been dumped into crystal springs could be positively determined although the labeling on the buckets recovered at the pulgas water temple led authorities to suspect that it is the gasoline additive mtbe suddenly hardy reached forward and turned up the volume hed never heard of the stuff before this week and now suddenly it was everywhere the announcer was continuing a group identifying itself as the clean earth alliance has faxed a communiqué to this station and other local news media claiming responsibility for the poisoning damon kerry the candidate for governor who has been running on a platform to outlaw the use of mtbe as a gasoline additive in california is in san francisco today in a justconcluded press conference at the st francis hotel he responded to critics who have accused him of some kind of complicity in this attack he had this to say about this latest escalation in what has been called the gasoline additive wars hardy had arrived at the entrance to the parking lot underneath his building but he waited out in the street not wanting to lose any of the transmission an angrysounding voice came over his speakers the people who have tried to poison san franciscos water supply are terrorists they say that the purpose of this poisoning is to call the bluff of the oil companies who contend that mtbe is not a significant health hazard in drinking water they say that this vile act will dramatize their position but i say that what they have done is unconscionable and criminal no one associated with my campaign has anything but contempt for these people and their actions the emergency bulletin switched back to the stations dj again cautioning citizens about the hazards of drinking the water and giving some more details about the attack itself the man whod been pushed over into the temple and who was now in critical condition with a broken back and the spotty descriptions of the terrorists hardy heard it all in a kind of trance then looked at his watch slammed his car back into gear and pulled out on to sutter street whatever hed been planning to do in his office could wait he wasnt a dozen blocks from the st francis and thats where he was going al valens was in charge in the lobby he was short energetic well dressed and powerfully built hardy stood on the sidelines for a moment inside the revolving doors of the hotels famous clock lobby taking the lay of the land valens was smiling frowning slapping backs nodding sagely whatever the minute demanded reporters the curious and the usual press of clueless tourists were still milling about cameras and lighting equipment were being packed up and put away hey he heard the short man say to a small knot of reporters you heard mr kerry say it and now youre going to hear al valens say it we had nothing to do with this nothing this is awful these people are cretins valens threw a worried glance up the stairs to the compass rose bar hardy and frannie had met there a hundred times he knew where kerry was hiding there was of course still some security around him four uniformed hotel guards a plainclothed bodyguard and a man in a tuxedo whom hardy recognized as the rooms maitre d kerry himself was in an area cordoned off behind a velvet rope he sat forward alone on a low couch occasionally he would reach for the glass of water that rested next to an iced pitcher on the table in front of him the name and face of damon kerry had been familiar in san francisco for the better part of the past twenty years hed made his debut as a city supervisor there he served two fairly distinguished terms that gave the lie to the initial impression that he was a spoiled rich kid whose daddy had bought him the office as a toy kerry was always a greenpeace save the whales for jesus kind of guy in san francisco that always flew politically but he also actually put in time cleaning up oily bays and beaches serving in soup kitchens doing things when he moved up as an assemblyman in sacramento he continued with his activism especially in environmental areas and his san francisco constituency never abandoned him he was their boy liberal to the bone sincere and electable but always before in a lowkey way he was about to be forced to leave office under californias term limit laws and this some said more than any personal ambition for higher office got him rolling on the mtbe bandwagon and into statewide exposure also of course al valens got involved kerry was one of the perennially and effortlessly younglooking and hardy wanted to hate him for it he was in his midforties but he passed for less there wasnt a line marring the ruddy healthy skin of his face he was trim in a darkblue suit neither small nor overimposing sitting on the couch he was the boy next door grown up and made good an open face appealing without being too handsome clear blue eyes a strong nose one perfectly chipped tooth on looks alone on the vibe he projected you wanted to like the guy but it was a passive scene up the stairs here in the bar all the action was in the lobby below them hardy thought he could take some advantage walking confidently over he nodded easily at the bodyguard and put a bright tone to his voice a decent volume is that damon kerry the nearest hotel guard did his job moving into hardys way hey no interviews hes done that you missed it too bad it wasnt hardys intention to threaten or bluff he stepped a little to one side holding up a hand as though apologizing im not a reporter his voice went up another notch as he faced kerry behind the velvet rope im ron beaumonts attorney bree beaumonts husband i dont care if youre the queen of england i said no interviews and youre not but kerrys head had jerked up and now he was on his feet no no its all right the politicians smile hand outstretched its all right he repeated to the security troops ill talk to this man then to hardy up at the rope hi damon kerry what can i do for you i dont know for sure im trying to clear my client before they decide to arrest him when i heard you were down here i thought id take a chance see if youd talk to me maybe its my lucky day kerry threw a look over hardys shoulder perhaps expecting valens to come and take him away from all this but help wasnt on the way and he came back to hardy and offered another weak smile what did you want to talk to me about hardy was tempted to get sarcastic tell him hed seen him on television and wanted to know who did his hair there was only one topic that hardy could be here about and kerry had to know it which was the reason hed gotten this far he motioned to the rope separating them to the couch kerry had just left maybe back there reassuring his guards for the third time that it was ok kerry moved the rope aside and let hardy come through then followed him to the couch where they both sat kerry put on an interested face and they spent a minute on the familiar topic of hardys first name how dismas had been the good thief on calvary and was the patron saint of murderers but what im here for hardy concluded is maybe you can give me a better take on bree people say you two were close and i wondered if she ever mentioned any enemies or that she was afraid for her life kerry reached for his water glass and took a quick drink honestly no her death alone was a big enough shock but when i heard that someone had killed her he shook his head i thought it was impossible nobody could have hated her not personally she was the sweetest person alive so you think it was related to what this gas stuff another shake of the head i dont know a burglary maybe she was at the wrong place at the wrong time he lapsed into a short silence when he spoke again hardy had an impression of greater directness i cant imagine really although after what happened today i sometimes feel im at a loss to explain anything anymore i mean who would poison drinking water what twisted logic makes these people do anything if they could do that he trailed off how about her husband your client doesnt he have any thoughts on this didnt i read that hes disappeared he just knows it wasnt him i dont think it was either what do you think kerry looked out beyond his security perimeter then back to hardy i dont suppose hed be under suspicion if there wasnt some evidence would he it happens all the time do you know ron no weve never met not personally hardy frowned what nothing i guess id just assumed youd been to their place socially no bree was a consultant and friend a good friend even but she kept her family separate i never even met her children still you understand im not saying anything accusatory about her husband im sure hes devastated by this as well hardy leaned forward his elbows on his knees he really didnt kill her the intensity seemed to startle kerry all right but somebody did mr kerry please i have to get a take on who she was out in the real world not with her husband and family you say she had no enemies she was the sweetest person on earth but i know caloco wasnt happy with her for example maybe somebody else wasnt either somebody killed her ive got to see who she was can you help me at all here kerrys reaction was surprising notably he didnt look up for the saving arrival of the cavalry instead his eyes turned inward for a beat and then he sat back on the couch hardy thinking manohman heres another one he didnt come up with it immediately hardy had obviously caught him off guard by moving away from specific questions kerry had probably been expecting the kinds of questions hardy had been expecting to ask about motives and opportunities but now it was clear that whatever kerry said he wanted to get it right at length he came back forward hands clasped in front of him but easily this time far more relaxed than hed been he met hardys eyes for the first time she was the ugly duckling this seemed to contradict everything hardy had heard about bree to this moment her beauty charm brains persuasiveness his face must have showed his confusion because kerry jumped in to explain what i mean by that is if you want to know who she was youve got to start with that with what exactly kerry drew in a breath thought for a moment the fact that while she was growing up she was a nerd a brain at a time when you didnt want to be smart if you were a girl well she was a really smart girl with glasses and goofy hair and no style at all and this kind of absentminded whats going on around me feeling he trailed off you knew her as a child hardy asked a really genuine smile no no i dont mean that i only met her knew her for a few months but we got to know each other pretty well a pause that hardy elected not to interrupt kerry was talking which was what he wanted hed start again and after a sigh he did anyway thats where she came from she wasnt very popular she had no friends no social interests just studying and chemistry but she was so pretty she must have had dates in high school no kerry said guys didnt think she was pretty if you can believe that she told me she didnt have one date she went to school dances with her brother it was that bad he wanted hardy to understand you know those movies where this really plain girl takes off her glasses at the end and suddenly shes the prettiest girl in town well that was bree except that her movie didnt end until she was in her midtwenties and by then she was so used to being plain and ignored by men that she just couldnt accept any other view of herself plus her brains still made her threatening as hell to a lot of guys plus hardy was thinking she was married which meant she wasnt in the market or did it but kerry obviously still in thrall to her memory was going on the thing about her and maybe it seems funny or contradictory or something because she was so smart but the selfimage stuff i think really slowed her down in how fast she grew up im trying to think of the right word she was just very naive id say insulated almost unaware of anything in life anything except her studies which translated into her job i mean until now kerry really was at a loss until you hardy prompted kerry lifted his shoulders an admission it was starting to happen before we met she was ready for it for what the change the conversion well it wasnt really that ok what was it hardy became fleetingly aware of a buzz out in the room a rush of convivial laughter from a gaggle of young couples pulling tables together afternoon drinks after shopping in a different world than that inhabited by hardy and frannie he came back to the candidate for governor with whom he seemed to be having a genuine communication it was almost surreal but he was going to keep it going if he could what was the big conversion all about then it was her whole life really he fixed hardy with a thoughtful expression this may sound presumptuous again he stopped and hardy waited it wasnt so much that she grew up all at once as the fact that she realized she had grown up she was a beautiful swan she could fly ok this didnt make all the sense in the world to hardy but hed sort it out later but this conversion was public right on some radio show and had to do with you a shrug i dont know how much of it had to do with me but the debate we had seemed to mark a shift she realized we had the same goals and wed been set up to be on different sides actually shed been set up she got bitter about her employers and i cant say i blame her jim pierce it was a guess but from kerrys reaction a good one kerry nodded he was the one who first recognized her for what she could do i mean politically he groomed her into a mouthpiece but as i say she was naive she bought his line because she bought him he was big oil but he cared about the world just like she did ha but he was her father figure at the same time he loved her when she was still the ugly duckling and that carried a lot of emotional weight he loved her you just said he loved her i dont know about that what he did do was keep her nose to the grindstone reward her handsomely for doing what he wanted pat her on the head when she did good and tell her not to worry about other things she might be hearing or thinking she wanted to please him and she didnt look up he hesitated i was really just the catalyst i think it would have happened without me eventually she was ripe for it shed grown up and started seeing you this suddenly brought kerry back to where he was what he was in fact doing which was talking to a lawyer about a murder case his public persona always open and charming was especially unnerving to hardy as it fell like a shroud between them not the way i think you mean mr hardy she was married after all but youre not kerry favored him with the candidate smile went back to his watch and decided that if reinforcements werent going to come and rescue him hed go to them well no never been married never found the right girl he slapped his knees and stood up its been very nice talking to you but ive got to get my campaign manager back out on the trail this water poisoning today he scowled terrible just terrible then the smile was back the hand outstretched again dont forget to vote now take care he walked over to his security retinue and hardy sat back down on the couch watching the party coalesce around kerry as it began to drift down into the main lobby when they were good and gone hardy reached over and using the cocktail napkin that the hotel had thoughtfully provided lifted the water glass kerry had been using he poured the remaining water back into the pitcher and slipped the glass into the pocket of his nylon windbreaker take care yourself he thought but feeling smug about the glass with fingerprints he suddenly realized hed forgotten the main question hed wanted to ask the kerry camp he nearly jumped up from the couch and caught up the candidate and his entourage as they arrived at where al valens had just finished up with a reporter excuse me mr kerry the security detail moved to keep hardy at his distance but kerry again told them it was ok he was a candidate it was election time you talked to people i had one last question this time for mr valens if you dont mind it wont take a minute kerry broke a seemingly genuine smile ok colombo sure weve always got a minute al this is mr hardy hes ron beaumonts attorney valens cast a quick glance between hardy and kerry then thrust his hand out nice to meet you whats your question i was wondering why you called ron beaumont last week something about brees files the smile flickered briefly i dont think that was me he said he looked at kerry did we call ron not that i remember you didnt call ron beaumont and leave a message last wednesday thursday something like that valens made a little show of thinking about it for a moment looked again at kerry then shook his head i think you must be mistaken isnt he out of town i heard he was out of town hardy was sincerely contrite im sorry i must have been misinformed a broad smile mr kerry thanks again kerry waved him off dont worry about it any time shit valens voice was unnaturally shrill in the telephone he knows something this guy hardy who is he whats that about baxter thorne spoke to valens in his calmest tones al its always better to tell the truth especially in front of damon tell him you forgot youve been consumed with these terrorist accusations against him today your head was spinning and you couldnt recall for a minute in fact you remember now that you did call ron here this is good to see about some memorial words he wanted to include about bree if no when damon gets elected in his acceptance speech that is if ron wouldnt object if it wouldnt be too painful thats why you called but how did this guy hardy know thorne was sweet reason you left a message he must have heard the message but how well he must have been there then mustnt he at brees place looking for the report i dont know perhaps certainly looking for something but you said he was rons attorney right it might not have had anything to do with our problem dont worry ill look into it youve got a campaign to run all right all right but it worries me dont worry about it al its nothing and if its not nothing ill take care of it the evening remained clear and warm with no fog and hardy felt hed picked up a scent people were evading and lying and this juiced him up he wished he had a set of al valens fingerprints as well as damon kerrys he had no explanation for why valens would lie about calling ron still he did have damon kerrys cleverly purloined water glass and he dropped it off on abe glitskys desk with a cryptic note that it contained crucial evidence in the bree beaumont case and should be dusted and checked against prints that had been found in the penthouse hardy added that if glitsky didnt do this hed be sorry a statement abe would enjoy the note also mentioned that kerry had denied ever having been there and this was a new development it was still early hardy had time before his scheduled seven oclock meeting with canetta at his office he could zip down to see ron and his wellbehaved children deliver his update and make everybody feel better hed also filled a page of legal pad with questions that ron would be able to answer for him mostly to do with the names canetta had copied from rons answering machine who was marie kogee sasaka tilton what did all these people want what about valens and kerry and pierce how well had ron known them or had bree known them then the harder questions did ron think or know that bree was having an affair if so with whom what about the baby shed been carrying had she and ron planned it what had her last morning been like what if anything had she been worried about how involved if at all had ron been with her professional life did he know what she was working on now and most importantly what was rons explanation for the fact that of all the men hardy had talked to pierce kerry even canetta why was it that her own husband seemed the least affected by her death driving south on the freeway heading for the hotel where ron and his children had holed up hardy almost let himself believe he was beginning to make some progress he would get answers from ron and maybe learn more about mtbe and ethanol and todays reservoir poisoning which he reasoned had to be related to brees murder he was really getting somewhere mr brewster has checked out checked out hardy repeated it as though it were a foreign phrase he didnt understand the concierge was a pleasantlooking young woman with a brisk and efficient manner yes sir she punched a few keys at her computer early this morning youre sure an apologetic smile im sorry its just that i thought we had an appointment and im a little surprised she punched a few more keyboard buttons and noticing his obvious concern softened visibly maybe you got the day wrong hardy nodded must have he said so it was still early and he had noplace to be for a couple of hours ron beaumont was beginning to remind him of several clients hed had in the past they tended to lie and when not held in custody to disappear it made him mad and crazy but at the same time this behavior was so predictable among suspects that it didnt necessarily force him to believe they were guilty of anything they were just scared confused misguided except for those who were in fact guilty and on the run as he drove by candlestick point hardy was trying his hardest to stick with the rationalization that ron had his children to protect there was the further point that if hardy had been able to locate him at his hotel others with less benign intents the das investigators for example might be just as successful and ron hadnt promised hardy that hed stick around for continued consultation nothing had changed he kept telling himself he had until tuesday to find who had killed bree and frannie would remain locked up until then anyway by the time he took the th street offramp by the hall of justice downtown though his pique had progressed into a fine fury ron beaumont the son of a bitch had a million answers at his fingertips and now hardy was going to have to find them on his own if he could and meanwhile the clock kept ticking he didnt have the heart anymore for this catandmouse nonsense and especially not from someone whod put frannie where she was force of habit almost led him to park across from the jail where he would visit frannie and check back in with abes office at this time late on a saturday afternoon there was actually a spot at the curb but he kept driving he wasnt going to leave any messages now with glitsky to accompany his note on damon kerrys fingerprints the way he felt about ron would spill over somehow and muddy the waters he didnt want glitsky even glancing in rons direction as a viable suspect if he could help it and frannie she was the reason he was doing any of this in the first place and sure he could go hold her hand again but it would use up two more precious hours frannie wanted him to save ron and his kids and the price of that for her was going to be that her husband couldnt come and console her every time he was in the neighborhood truth be told rons disappearance had kicked up a renewed dust storm of anger at frannie too and a smaller zephyr at his own gullibility his continuing efforts in a cause in which he had at best a manufactured faith he was doing all this for his wife at her urging hed let her deal with the consequences see how she liked them apples but he had to admit that there were developments in this case that didnt depend on ron beaumont that had piqued his interest on their own the three men canetta pierce and kerry who were in mourning over brees death todays mtbe poisoning al valens lying and always three billion dollars hardy was on automatic some nonrational process having determined that he should go to his office he still had two hours until canetta was due to show up to trade information the odds were in favor of david freeman being around working on saturday hardy could bounce his discoveries and hunches off his landlord a practice that was nearly always instructive if freeman wasnt there hed pore over the copies of griffins notes that glitsky had given him and see if some new detail caught his attention it was a backup plan but at least it was some plan and then suddenly the open curb at th near mission called to him one legal parking space downtown on a weekday qualified as a miracle but seeing an entire side of th street nearly empty was nearly the beatific vision fresh snow or a morning beach without footprints you just ached to walk on it he pulled over and came to a stop directly across from the chronicle building it was a sign jeff elliot was the chronicle columnist who wrote the citytalk column on the political life of the city when hardy had first met him hed been a young personable freshfaced kid from the midwest who walked with the aid of crutches due to his ongoing battle with multiple sclerosis now although still technically young hardy doubted if jeff had yet turned thirtyfive the babyfaced boy sported a graying welltrimmed beard his chest had thickened and his eyes had grown perennially tired here in his office just off the city room the old crutches rested by the door almost never used anymore now jeff got around in a wheelchair but he was still personable at least to hardy who over the years had been the conduit of a lot of good information and the subject of one or two columns he and his wife had even been to parties at hardys house jeff had undoubtedly come downtown today after the water poisoning barring an assassination of the president or an eightpoint earthquake this was going to be tomorrows headline and there were political elements all over it but now that hardy had stuck his head in his door first things first jeff swung away from his computer and motioned him in big d he said que pasa then he remembered and grew suddenly serious hows frannie holding up hardy made a face what could he say jeff shook his head in disgust id sue braun pratt randall the whole lot of em or kill them maybe both no options are out of the question so you got my call at home no ive been out all day this surprised jeff well the message was that i was going to give this frannie thing a couple of graphs on monday maybe get somebodys attention i thought you could give me a good quote hardy smiled thinly nothing you could print in a family newspaper jeff looked a question so you didnt get the message and yet youre here i saw a free parking place at the curb hell the whole street what could i do i said to myself self i said why dont you have a little offtherecord chat with your good friend jeff elliot this brought a smile long ago hardy had neglected to preface some remarks to jeff that they were off the record it hadnt worked out too well and since then hardy had made it a point to include the words off the record in every discussion he ever had with jeff even purely social ones jeff smiled i was waiting for that plus hardy continued i thought it was possible you might know something i dont probably im good on the middle ages and victorian england dang hardy snapped his fingers neither of those i was thinking more about frannie bree or ron beaumont this mtbe business hardy thought a minute damon kerry al valens jeff cracked a grin you done i think you left out my wife and a couple of senators hardy spread his palms in a frustrated gesture i cant seem to get much of it to hang together the columnist swung his wheelchair around to face hardy in return for which i get the exclusive of the big secret frannies gone to jail about nope but you might get brees killer before anybody else are you close to that everybodys saying its the husband ron is it a shake of the head abe glitsky whom you may remember is head of homicide is definitely not saying it and abe be the man on this stuff hes not on ron pause its not ron hed almost said that glitsky was affirmatively saying it wasnt ron which wasnt true but if thats what jeff elliot heard he wouldnt correct the impression so whos your guess you got one in his chair hardy drew a deep breath hed gathered a lot of information but in spite of feeling as though hed gotten somewhere in his investigation he realized that he couldnt precisely define where that was when he asked elliot to tell him about damon kerry it surprised him almost as much as it did jeff where had that question come from jeff was shaking his head thats got to be a big negatory diz maybe but id sure like to know more than i do about the two of them bree and the good candidate for a response jeff sat all the way back in his wheelchair behind his desk he pulled at his mustache scratched his beard and brushed at the front of his shirt no hurry hardy prodded shooting jeff a hopeful grin its only frannie doing hard time for keeping a promise finally the reporter sighed you know the connections he said you dont put them together but jeff wasnt quite ready to spill anything not yet the impish smile from his youth fleetingly appeared as he came forward his hands together on the desk you know that offtherecord thing we do this is one of those private and personal done understood hardy was beginning to feel a little like a catholic priest in a confessional a couple more days like the last few and hed know every secret in the world and wouldnt be able to tell any of them but if that was the price for knowledge he had to pay it eves bad trade he could only hope it wouldnt turn out as badly for him as it had for her jeff underscored it so this is personal your ears only if it doesnt directly help frannie it stays here deal hardy got up and they shook hands over the desk so what connections he asked what you just said frannie in jail kerry in another file in the brainpan the election the water poisoning today all that i didnt put them together his eyes shone with interest but they are together arent they theyre all bree thats my guess jeff fidgeted in his chair came to his decision and nodded have i mentioned the offtherecord thing hardy was dying to learn what jeff knew but it never helped to show it he broke an easy smile once or twice he waited the thing about kerry is that hes really a good guy especially for a politician ive been with him more than a few times in press rooms after the odd banquet off the record much like you and me right now and hes decent plus he plays straight with us us reporters media like that ok and ok so a guy like that sometimes a guy like me finds out a fact and kind of unofficially decides it doesnt have to be in the public interest hardys eyebrows went up excuse me i thought i just heard you say that the media could show some restraint jeff acknowledged the point with a wry face im talking personal here me its not something i brag about but it happens sometimes at hardys skeptical look he spread his palms wide ok rarely but the point is kerrys not married he can date anybody he wants as our president has pointed out its his private life its not news but bree was married and maybe they didnt do anything lets say carnal maybe she just hung around a lot and it was purely the campaign and business hardy leaned forward but you know otherwise did i catch them inflagrante no but i know my opinion is they were in love with each other this took a minute to digest although hardy had come to suspect it but jeff was going on she only lived a halfdozen blocks from him both of em up on broadway you know no i didnt know about him i knew she did well kerry too his place is that little thirtyroom shack just up from baker youd remember it if you saw it and you have jeff seemed almost relieved to be able to let his secret out if hed promised not to print it telling somebody who in turn couldnt tell was next best anyway couple of months ago i was pushing damon for an interview as i said we go back a ways too and he said meet him at his place after hours hed dig up something for me he was coming in from chico or someplace and was going to be alone which meant without valens except when i got there who opens the door but bree beaumont dressed jeff chuckled youve got a dirty mind lets go with casually attired casually and very very attractively he paused remembering then blew out a rush of air very low green silk blouse linen pants barefoot i distinctly remember she forgot her underwear on top believe me it was the kind of thing you noticed especially on her even if you werent a trained reporter like me alive to every detail hardy wanted to keep him going i keep hearing how pretty she was a couple of miles beyond pretty diz in any event he continued heres a bottle of champagne in a bucket on the coffee table and otherwise the house is empty so ask me do i feel like im intruding moi so what was it evidently she was planning to surprise him with a little welcome homecoming after the road trip so he shows about ten minutes after i arrive opens the door and its like uh hi bree fancy you being here now how bout them gas additives call me a genius but i saw right through it youre a genius jeff nodded somebody has to be so anyway they were together and i knew it and they knew i knew it and i told them id keep a lid on it im just curious but why would you do that he shook his head as though mystified himself i dont know diz i like the guy i like his politics it meant a lot to them he met hardys eyes bottom line is i just decided it shames me to say it but i might even do the same for you you dont have to hardy replied i wasnt sleeping with bree but after she was killed werent you tempted to talk to the police why nobodys saying damons a suspect hardy looked a question at the least jeff shes murdered and you know hes her lover thats got to be relevant to the homicide investigation maybe even crucial its also relevant to damons campaign maybe even crucial he didnt kill her diz there is no way plus i want to see him get elected and i sure as hell dont have to tell the cops what i know maybe if some inspector had come and made some connection asked me directly i dont know i might have been tempted but nobody did nobody has but as you say jeff it is all connected its got to be for emphasis hardy patted the desk between them so todays bonus question is who did the water whats the clean earth alliance jeff shifted again in his wheelchair brought a hand to his tired eyes and rubbed them glancing at his watch he looked up suddenly to see that outside a sepia dusk had settled when am i going to learn not to work on weekends why did i come in here on a saturday hardy leaned forward jeff knew something else and was wrestling with how much to reveal hardy kept it low affect you were going to write some graphs on frannie which brought it all back home jeff sat still a moment then wheeled himself around to a low file cabinet back at the desk he laid open the thick file folder and began turning pages the yosemite militia the valdez avengers earth now he looked up and todays clean air alliance get the picture theyre all related lets say id bet their headquarters is some cabin in montana so who runs them well this is a matter of some debate jeff pulled pages and ran down a synopsis of damage these groups had done most of it in the realm of nuisance vandalisms and graffiti but in two cases something much more serious the valdez avengers had claimed responsibility for a pipe bomb explosion at an exxon gas station in tacoma washington that had killed four people and injured twelve jeff looked up from the page they didnt want people to invest in exxon that daring raid killed a little girl six years old boy that showed her more recently at the huge refinery in richmond just across the bay three guards had been severely beaten in a thusfar unclaimed attack the refinerys statement was that nothing had been taken and that the rest of their security team had driven off the five assailants although theyd been unable to capture them but you want my opinion jeff concluded thats when these clowns got their hands on the mtbe but couldnt they just as well have gone to the gas station and pumped it out at a buck twentynine a gallon sure but whats the fun in that diz these people are thugs they get their rocks off shaking things up making the big statement like today hardy leaned back crossed a leg and youve got all this stuff in one folder right like bree and frannie and damon its all connected somehow and now this stuff he motioned down to his pile of paper its part of that too so whos behind it i had a caloco guy today tell me that sko funded this kind of activity but this didnt fit jeffs world view no id be surprised at that skos big these independent bozos seem to hate big hardy pointed at the folders you got any stories about attacks on ethanol producers or distributors jeff didnt have to look no now that you mention it and thats a good point maybe these groups dont know whos bankrolling them maybe skos got a front jeff nodded but that means he stopped the idea germinating why would they ive been using this mantra all day hardy said you ought to try it whats that three billion dollars say it a few times itll grow on you david freeman was not asleep and he wasnt reading anything but he was completely still his feet propped up on the table in his solarium which was the nickname for the conference room just off the main lobby in his building he wasnt wearing shoes and one of his argyle socks had a hole in the toe his cigar spiked the room with its rich odor and left the air with a blue tint although there was no sign that freeman was drawing on it or even was aware of it stuck there in the front of his face hardy tapped once on the open door not a muscle moved freeman sighed i was just thinking about you how you doing ive been better hardy pulled a chair and dropped himself into it for a long moment neither man said anything eventually hardy started i just called home for my messages did you know its halloween what is tonight its halloween for the first time freeman favored him with a glance went back to his cigar and blew a long plume you forgot your kids are upset it sounded like a chortle but there wasnt any humor in it none at all what the hell am i he laid a hand on the table with exaggerated calm drumming his fingertips dadadum dadadum ive got a meeting here in ten minutes david its possibly even an important meeting having to do with my wife being in jail trying to get her out maybe im wrong but this seems like something i ought to spend some of my time on another moment freeman had nothing to say which was just as well hardy needed to vent so we got a killer im trying to find without any help from the police we got the citys water supply on hold for a couple of weeks we got their mother rotting over downtown have i mentioned that and all these are somehow related and ive got no idea how and do you know what the real problem is i mean the really big god damn most important thing wrong with the world right now tonight the drumming had picked up in tempo you want to know humoring him freeman nodded imperceptibly sure all right ill tell you its that i am such a shitty father and care so little about my children that i forgot the most important holiday in their young and precious lives it never hit my radar all day can you imagine what else could i possibly have been thinking about freeman nodded again its the nineties guy like you you cant not be an insensitive cretin nothing to do but ignore it freeman was right there wasnt any point bitching about hardys priorities they were what they were he was that nineties pariah the linear logical factburdened classically trained human even worse some wiring flaw had predestined him to be more oriented toward justice than mercy the rest of his san francisco world was sensitive and childcentered and politically correct and of course the childrens fun on halloween was much more important than any work hardy might ever have to do he would just have to get over it in some countries say kosovo or rwanda hardy was pretty sure many fathers didnt take time out every day to play with their children their goal and he felt the same about his own was simple survival he wondered if kids in these countries considered their fathers insensitive the soulwrenching truth of it was that hardy cared more about his wife and children than about any job than about anything for that matter but this today what he was doing was not some job this was real life his and frannies and the kids real lives in a real crisis just like ron beaumonts kids and their lives and yet somehow both of his kids had assumed hed zip on back to the avenues and take them out trick or treating it frustrated him beyond his ability to articulate young they might be but could they really be unaware of the gravity of this situation of how much he treasured them of the reason behind every breath he took could they be that blind if they were where had he failed them the old man swung his legs down to the ground put his elbows on the table what did you mean you know theyre related but dont know how this water poisoning and frannie is that what youre saying hardy was accustomed to freemans brain it tended to take leaps in any direction that looked promising but even so it took him a second and the segue though abrupt was just as well it put him back on his work on what he had to do and the feeling part of it be damned when hed made everything safe and secure again it would have been worth it and they could either understand why hed done it and the way hed done it or not but either way it would be done he nodded at freeman and while were on it possibly the election this tuesday out in the lobby they heard a harsh buzzing sound that would be canetta he said my appointment you want to stick around i wont kick you out are you kidding me you couldnt if you tried bill tilton was in fact listed they had gotten settled back in the smoky dim room introductions made freeman brought up to speed the landlords presence hardy sensed only grudgingly accepted by canetta but the sergeant had information and he wanted to show off what hed found this isnt so tough the sergeant said i could do this sounds like you already did phil hardy would give canetta all the strokes he needed to keep him pumped up but canetta seemed to be motivated on his own hes an agent with farmers fund life insurance i called from the station so when he called back hed know i was legitimately the police smart hardy said he raised his eyes to freeman silently telling him to shut up and he did call back wasnt even an hour so i asked him direct told him this was a murder investigation and we needed his cooperation whatd he call ron about he said the company was a little sticky with the payout on bree her being murdered and all on the side tilton tells me the claims guy doesnt want to send a check were talking two big ones until its pretty damn clear ron didnt kill her so i kept him yakking and he said its the first time hes had this situation and its made things ugly around his office now this next youre going to like this hardy waited then realized canetta needed some response i give up another second of suspense then a smile his secretary quit over it marie couldnt believe tilton could be such a shit to ron who was the nicest marie suddenly hardy heard it canetta smiled thats what i said and tilton goes yeah marie dempsey the marie from the phone messages as it turns out canetta was almost beaming with childlike pride marie is was his tiltons secretary hardy nodded in satisfaction this was good two names to cross off insurance business you know phil you really can do this you want ill put in a plug to glitsky naw fuck glitsky and the suits i dont want to join em but i wouldnt mind beating em suddenly canetta pointed to freeman whod been uncharacteristically silent to his cigar by any chance you got another one of those things freeman nodded said sure got up and disappeared back into the dark lobby you sure hes cool canetta asked cool was about the last word hardy would ever use to describe freeman but he knew what canetta meant hes the smartest guy youll ever meet phil canetta threw a glance over his shoulder maybe the ugliest too hardy keeping his voice low had to grin well all of us cant have everything but you can trust him that i guarantee you dont have to kiss him a shudder traveled the whole length of canettas body ill try to restrain myself i bet i can can what another of freemans many talents was his ability to appear out of nowhere he had a handful of cigars a bottle of red wine and glasses all of which he kept a supply of in his office he laid the cigars on the table help yourself sergeant i should have offered sooner what did i miss he put down the glasses and started to pour all around but hardy had a hand out none for me david im working and canetta took the same road freeman shrugged he was working too but it was saturday night he could have a glass of wine hell a bottle of wine and his brain would still hum along nicely thank you maybe even a little better than it was now so would hardys and canettas but david had learned long ago that you couldnt tell anything to baby boomers they were working working was serious they couldnt mix any fun in or they might what die christ no wonder they all burned out but he sipped his wine and listened as canetta went back to what hed found at least hed lit his cigar freeman was thinking although that too of course would kill him the sergeant was reading from his spiral notebook kogee sasaka has a massage place hands on thats the name i checked with some guys at the station legitimate no busts no complaints she gives massages if you can believe it anyway that was the appointment she called ron about canetta flicked at his pages that was it tilton marie and kogee wasnt it and you did pierce right and valens as it turned out hardy filled him in on the hotel interviews ending with valens interesting fib about having called ron but valens did call him hardy agreed unless someone was doing a pretty damn fine impersonation so whyd he lie about it the question hung while freeman swallowed his wine finally he spoke up thats where you push he said simply was the call about anything or did he just leave his name no some report hardy said brees copy of something she was working on that she was working on and that ron knew about canetta said i still think thats part of this he realized it was important or valuable and he came back and got it hardy didnt want the sergeant going off with a hardon for ron beaumont i think rons going to be hard to find phil he said if he came back canetta countered then hes still close by am i right if he came back thats all im saying if and if i find him youll let me know first before you do anything a nod absolutely canetta was gone he told freeman and hardy that he thought he might see if valens could be found tonight and get this lie hed told hardy straightened out canetta knew the citys hotels like the back of his hand saturday night like this three days before the election kerry probably had five different appearances in various banquet rooms downtown shouldnt be too hard to catch up with the candidate and his campaign manager would be with him easy to talk to this homicide stuff a child could do it meanwhile the two attorneys had written down the names of every person in the investigation and now they had a bunch of yellow pages from legal pads strewn around the table with the bynow familiar names valens and kerry pierce ron beaumont even frannie and carl griffin the plan freemans with his love of context as he called it was to fill in connections under each name and see if they could connect the dots ok hardy said you dont know anything about this where do you start freeman didnt hesitate griffin a smile flitted at the edges of hardys mouth whats funny only that it never fails i would have picked him last freeman chomped on his cigar long since extinguished he was the first horse at the trough n estcepas that alone this hardy thought was why freeman was so valuable his input always triangulated the evidence bringing different targets into sharper focus ok but glitsky tells me he wasnt working beaumont the morning he got killed it wasnt his case or he wasnt working it no he drew the case but he had some others too he was in the field on one of them how did glitsky know that griffin told him before he went out the morning he got it he told him freeman snorted the word why would he lie the old man squinted across the table because you have been working all day and youre tired and stressed out ill just pretend you didnt ask that now do we know what the other cases were it continued like that around the daisy chain details about griffins death time location that might not jibe with the other cases hed been assigned valens lie about brees report hardy felt a little uneasy as freeman on his own put bree together with damon kerry also with jim pierce assume the worst diz life wont disappoint you so much bree slept around maybe a lot with different guys it gives us more to work with hardy wanted to avoid assuming the worst about women and their secret affairs it was too close forcing his attention back hardy listened as freeman asked about jim pierce assuming he was sleeping with bree too but having met the stunning carrie pierce during the day this was difficult terrain for hardy to negotiate his wife is a worldclass beauty david i cant see it freeman took the soggy cigar from his lips you know diz jackie kennedy wasnt exactly chopped liver you know the basic difference between men and women around sex equipment no wise guy men want as many women as they can get women want the best man they can get a fundamental truth hardy nodded ill write it down when i get home but theres one other name weve left out here that i thought youd enjoy whos that canetta hardy succeeded in surprising freeman so rarely that when he did so as now he derived a disproportionate pleasure from it now the old mans eyes narrowed with interest so how are you playing him im thinking he might tell me a lie im thinking hes too involved too soon a satisfied nod you know just when i think youre getting soft its a long shot hardy admitted but he walked a beat near her place he provided security at some functions for both pierce and bree he let her off on a dui freemans bushy eyebrows shot up thats real real enough they also had several curbside conversations severala beat all of them curbside thats what he says but he wants me to believe he was truly infatuated with her and maybe he was i dont know and so you put him to work to find her killer or to lead me away from looking at him freeman leaned back pulled the cigar from his mouth looked it over critically and popped it back in sweet he said you need me here you know im in hardy nodded i appreciate it david but lets remember that whoever this is the guys serious a dismissive wave serious schmerious ive told you a thousand times im bulletproof ive told you a thousand times i hate when you say that freeman grunted doesnt mean it isnt true she was out again jim pierce couldnt face another society event this one with adults wearing masks and other madness he didnt even want to consider halloween hed begged off as he had nine times out of ten for the past halfdozen years fed up to the teeth with these cock and tail parties whose function was to make sure that his friends knew he was their friend and they would tell by the size of the check friends he was too rich he trusted no one he hadnt a friend in the world the last one of these parties hed attended it had been a year before had pretty much sealed his decision that he wouldnt be part of that scene anymore this one even for san francisco had been revolting the financial and political elite of the city were in a big open warehouse in the south of market area there was often some artsyfartsy performance supposedly related to the fundraising entity at these affairs and that night after everyone had had a few the main event began a naked couple appeared suddenly on a blacklit stage awful drumpounding noise made conversation impossible the woman began carving some kind of devil worship symbols into the man s back pierce had been twenty feet away trying to talk to the district attorney and the mayor before the drums took over what they were witnessing wasnt being done with mirrors the blood flowed and that was a mere preamble the woman had a bottle of jack daniels bourbon from which she drank then she poured it over the mans new cuts and he screamed and screamed writhing but to the obscene beat in real pain the strobe lighting went red the drums increased the man spread his legs and leaned over and pierce had trouble believing it still though he had seen it with his own eyes the woman shoved the neck of the jack daniels bottle thank god carrie hadnt gone to that one it might have given her a heart attack but hed gone and that was enough he was through the television droned in the small room under the stairwell espn sports center twentyfour hours coverage weekends hed catch a good percentage of it though it mostly repeated every half hour the same stuff and the occasional update but it kept him up on sports something he needed for his image a regular guy at work well not a regular guy one of the bosses actually but at least one of the accessible ones he hit the mute button and stood up unsteady on his feet hed promised carrie hed get himself something to eat shed be home in less than an hour now and all hed done was drink couple of scotches and a bottle of pinot grigio hed better eat if he didnt want to endure another round of the third degree carrie had been going on and on lately why wasnt he eating he ought to take better care of himself this drinking every night wasnt doing him any good either what the heck was the matter with him maybe he should see a therapist how come he wasnt working out anymore how about a back rub he wanted to say a lewinsky maybe ha never not even when theyd first started out and every single time had been such a precious meaningful gift of her beautiful self back when she at least pretended she liked it not often but if everything was perfect and he was romantic whatever that meant then he might get lucky lucky with his wife somehow the concept seemed a little skewed in the bathroom there he was in the mirror hed aged ten years in five weeks he thought although nobody else seemed to have noticed he moved closer slapped hard at his cheeks but couldnt feel them tugged a few times halfheartedly at his penis nothing they each had their own private boxes carries jewelry safe in the floor of her upstairs closet and jims business safe in his office where carrie never went he went to it now behind the desk he lifted the corner of the persian rug and pushed down on the two parquet tiles while he simultaneously held the button under the top right drawer this freed the other six tiles so that he could pull them up in another minute he was sitting in his big chair at the big desk he held the gun butt and barrel in both of his hands after a minute he turned the cylinder to make it click once then spun it he brought it up to his face oil and cordite and something else the potential to bring instant death could you actually smell that closing his eyes he was just going to feel it there with his senses smelling the cold metal the power of it a wave of dizziness then he leaned into it with exaggerated slowness he brought it up and around until no part of the weapon touched him except the end of the barrel tight up against the center of his forehead abe glitsky was not having his best evening of all holidays halloween was his least favorite but beyond that as a cop he sensed in his bones that this halloween tonight was shaping up to be a disaster it had the big triple whammy going against it a beautiful almost balmy night a saturday and as an extra added bonus a full moon scientists might debate whether a full moon had an effect on human behavior but no policeman ever wondered about it at all it was an immutable fact and when the moon was full and the night happened to be halloween watch out glitsky had listened to all the news reports about the pulgas water poisoning and still was more than half convinced that it had simply been a halloween trick thats the way halloween was goofy little pranks involving razor blades and exlax and strychnine and now in an exciting wrinkle for the new millenium gasoline poisoning of the water supply so although he would never be truly prepared for what the night might bring glitsky was in ready mode he knew that every lunatic in the city was going to be in the streets tonight before morning he was going to be called on a couple of deaths it put him on edge that and his son orel being out among the crazies and rita having gone for the weekend and his judgmental and right father snoring on the livingroom couch and the irregular staccato of firecrackers sometimes sounding enough like gunfire to fool even a veteran lieutenant of homicide as soon as orel had gone into the night without a costume which made glitsky wonder why he was going out at all but you picked your fights hed blown out the candle in the front windows jackolantern also in the front of the house he had turned out all the lights as well as unscrewed the bulb on the stairs to the front door of their duplex he didnt want little streams of kids in horror outfits ringing his doorbell all evening now he sat at the kitchen table with a large bag of frosted cookies a cooling pot of tea and the box of documents that sharron pratt had finally delivered up to his office his mood was not improving as he read and got positively ugly when the doorbell as he knew it would rang hed let it go theyd get the message no candy here and go away they didnt the bell rang again they were going to wake up his father thats what all this ringing was going to do if it hadnt already he pushed away from the table so violently that his chair crashed to the ground behind him uncharacteristically he swore aloud between the chair falling and the swearing one of them succeeded in waking his father abraham all right in there just getting the door so much noise tell me about it abe thought striding to the blasted door whoever it was he was going to give them an earful he almost hoped whoever it was would try some cute stuff break an egg against the door leave a burning bag of dogdoo for him to stomp out or any one of the everpopular halloween standbys so hed have an excuse to chase them down and haul them in downtown god he hated this night he flicked on the lights inside the entryway and jerked open the door dismas hardy was standing there trick or treat he said i think your porch light must be out so i thought since nobodys home at my house theres no reason to go there and its well known youre the saddest most pathetic bachelor slash widower on the planet you had to be home right i mean where else could you be hardy was rummaging in glitskys cupboard pulling out the occasional food item giving it the once over either replacing it on the shelf or putting it on the counter next to the sink anyway i figure the two of us could hang out here solve bree beaumont eat some canned food drink too much just have ourselves a good oldfashioned guys night out except wed be in sound good nat glitsky had gone back to sleep on the frontroom couch and his snores carried into the kitchen abe had pulled one of the chairs around and straddled it backwards i dont have any alcohol in the house hardy pointed a finger jumped all over him see thats exactly what i mean sad pathetic negative yeah well i dont drink as you may have noticed over the past twenty years hardy was still rummaging he noticed several california lottery tickets stuck to the front of the refrigerator with magnets he pulled them off and held them up you realize that the lottery is the tax for people who arent good at math dont you did you win probably glitsky said i usually do couple of grand or so every week ill check tomorrows paper and let you know hardy shook his head and went back to the cupboards ok but while were on this let me just say that i am appalled to find spam in your larder this finally got a rise out of abe i love spam its the great unsung food of our time and ps you like canned corned beef hash thats because hash has flavor spam does too in fact it has more yeah but its a bad flavor glitsky shrugged its the numberone snack food in hawaii theres a strong recommendation youre talking the same hawaii where they actually eat poi you ever eat poi i wonder how they feel about spam in alaska where they eat blubber but glitsky wasnt to be denied they make it with seaweed and rice its a sushi dish called spam musabi or something hardy turned around in his best announcers voice ladies and gentlemen in tonights entry on bad food ideas were hearing that perennial favorite spam and are you ready for this seaweed linked as a gourmet treat were waiting for your calls to vote on whether this is as it appears to be a bad food idea he focused on glitsky are you out of your mind i didnt make it up he got off his chair though and crossed the small room in a couple of steps come to think of it though i could eat something what did you pull down hardy had selected two large spaghettios with franks an extralarge chef boyardee ravioli he was going to mix them and was opening the cans you got anything green in the refrigerator thats supposed to be glitsky went to check but now the dishes were in the sink and there wasnt much goodnatured anything going down in the kitchen hardy had gotten the short version of the immensely relevant caloco document from glitsky and now was leafing through it on his own it was a separated employees audited statement and it did not make pretty reading while bree worked for caloco it seemed she had a platinumplus company visa card with a credit limit of a hundred thousand dollars when she quit the company they had of course closed that account but an auditors review of brees records routine after a certain level employees termination or resignation had subsequently revealed the existence of a second name authorized to sign on the account ron beaumont ron didnt work for caloco and so this was unusual but if it had stopped there that would have probably been the end of it according to the audit ron had never used the card and so the presence of his name on the account made no obvious financial difference to caloco hardy couldnt help but recall the object lesson in calocos corporate culture that hed learned earlier in the day when jim pierce straightfaced told him that some clerk in some department might notice a missing three billion dollars but the corporate entity would never miss it if three billion was a drop in calocos bucket a mere hundred grand was a molecule invisible to the naked eye but the audit had turned up something else that was very disturbing the electronic superhighway created its own version of a paper trail and bree beaumonts card was linked going forward as the security instrument to another mellon bank visa account that account with a credit limit of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars did show a regular history of purchases in san francisco all of them paid every month the monthly accounts were sent to a ronald brewster at a postoffice box and nobody at caloco had ever heard of ron brewster hardy got to here and his stomach went hollow he looked up didnt caloco try to close the second account the brewster account glitsky had been sitting quietly arms crossed waiting for this he shook his head thats page three the mellon account had only used the caloco account for security to open it far as mellon was concerned ron brewster was a great client with a fiveyear history of regular payments no way are they closing the account plus the mellon account its not using any of calocos money so rons got himself a hundredandfiftythousanddollar line of credit glitsky leaned forward elbows on the table youll also notice that the mellon account doesnt include bree as a signatory only ron and guess what ron brewsters signature looks a whole lot like ron beaumonts writing were dealing with a whitecollar whiz kid here diz on the run with a phony id even for hardy familiar with the purported excuse for rons duplicity it was difficult to remain neutral in the face of this and he figured it would be impossible for glitsky which proved to be true im going to throw coleman and batavia on to him first thing in the morning they working sunday they are now a look are you telling me this doesnt make you sit up around ron no hardy agreed ill admit it makes him look a little weak if glitsky had a smile he was wearing it now a little weak thats good weaker than a signed murder confession at any rate but not by much and thats not all check out page five hardy turned the pages quickly glancing over the information and as he scanned glitsky kept up the color commentary that electronic linkage caloco can access finds four other accounts connected to the mellon visa hardy read the names ron black ron blake ron burns ron blanda guys got a million dollars in credit five phony identities you gotta believe hes got passports for all five no argument there it wouldnt surprise me at all and you know how i hate to say this but now glitsky was smiling but that doesnt make him a murderer but ill tell you something it doesnt make him a boy scout either hardy had to agree no but why would any of this make him want to kill his wife you got a theory on that clearly this was still unsettled water for glitsky the scar through his lips went white as he thought about it she must have been ignorant of the accounts when she found out he was using them on her collateral from caloco she busted him for it they fought and it got out of hand so it was just a fight hardy wasnt grinding any ax but he did have a point to make thats not murder one its not usually murder anything at the most its manslaughter maybe even selfdefense which is no crime at all i dont care what the lawyers call it it gets me the guy who killed bree maybe in the longish silence hardy was aware of abes fathers regular breathing in the living room maybe he repeated but what about the guy who killed carl griffin this brought glitsky up short what guy is that youre homicide you tell me are you telling me theyre related bree and carl lowkey hardy shrugged are you telling me theyre not seems likely they could be unless youve got a suspect with carl it was a question glitsky took a moment before answering weve got nothing on carl ive told you this he was going out to the western addition to talk to one of his snitches who apparently got some kind of drop on him and what hardy ladled on the sarcasm he asked the snitch to hold his gun a minute while they talked and it went off accidentally is that what happened must have been glitsky replied sardonically but hardy had something and glitsky perhaps for the first time was seeing it he was sitting in his car diz even carl wasnt that dumb ok so what do you think happened you remember where the car was found a nod a little culdesac called raycliff terrace just off divisadero well hardy was thinking strike that idea divisadero ran right through the heart of the western addition so griffin was where he was supposed to have been but being thorough he asked his next question anyway whats the cross street glitsky didnt know offhand and in a minute they had a map spread out on the table between them a loud silence ensued raycliff terrace was off divisadero all right and on the map it looked close enough to the ghetto but to anyone who knew the city at all it was so far economically from the lowincome housing units of the western addition that it may as well have been in beverly hills the cross street was pacific the eponymous artery of pacific heights one of san franciscos most aristocratic neighborhoods and more tellingly one block from broadway hardy spent an instant leaning over making sure with a kind of pang about his own incompetence he realized that this had been david freemans idea his comment that griffin had been the first horse at the trough was the old fart ever wrong hardy straightened up and walked over to the refrigerator where he pulled a magnetized pen off the door back at the map he marked an x then another one after a moments reflection a final thought struck him and he scratched out a third one bree beaumont he said putting the tip of the pen on the first mark two blocks from raycliff terrace broadway and steiner damon kerry broadway and baker three blocks west of bree one block from raycliff he put the pen on the third x jim pierce divisadero and north point eleven blocks north griffin had been killed surrounded by the players in the beaumont case which to hardy argued that he wasnt killed in a drug sting gone wrong his death was related to brees frowning glitsky was silent finally he put a finger on hardys first mark ron beaumont too hardy had to admit this unwelcome fact but it wasnt his point and in a minute he was fairly sure it wouldnt be glitskys can you see griffin coming up here with his snitch abe i cant you see the snitch letting himself get driven this far out of the hood glitsky shook his head youre right it didnt happen not up here hardy ran with it it was somebody griffin wasnt afraid of maybe even trusted enough to let him hold his piece its hard to imagine he had his fist balled over the xs and he lifted it an inch then brought it down with a great deal of force damn he said he slammed the fist down again god damn it carl from glitsky this was a violent explosion he raised his eyes the whites shot now with red anybody else id say no chance carl ive got to say maybe he ran his palm over the entire top of his head lord diz how is it nobody saw this but that wasnt what glitsky really wanted to know so hardy thought hed spare him hardy had his own problems with this new information there was another x hardy knew that he hadnt put on the map phil canetta had his own weapon griffin wouldnt have had to voluntarily pass over his gun the situation that glitsky had found so untenable canetta could have simply hopped into the passenger seat of griffins car pulled his own piece and moved things along right smartly from there relieved carl of his gun and had him drive to a secluded and quiet deadend street made him dead but then the more he thought about it if any of his other suspects owned a weapon they could just as easily have done the same thing the good news was that he had gotten glitsky thinking and not exclusively about ron it wasnt a certainty of course and nowhere near proven but suddenly now to hardy the overwhelming probability was that griffins murder was in fact linked to brees when was he killed hardy asked carl glitsky was still getting used to it and hardy couldnt blame him if this was what had happened the proximity of griffins murder scene to the homes of the suspects in brees murder was an egregious oversight for homicide to have missed glitsky was back sitting down at the table he cupped his hands in front of his mouth and blew on them it was a monday somebody reported the body midafternoon say two thirty forensics had him dead an hour an hour and a half so lunchtime glitsky made a face he hadnt eaten except some chocolate abes son orel was just getting back from trick or treating if thats what hed been doing as hardy was at the door on his way out glitsky had been on the phone for the past twenty minutes leaving messages with his inspectors to make it to the hall the next day and with the crime scene unit to make sure that griffins car got another careful goingover in light of what might be these new developments if hardy knew abe and he did all of this was going to go on awhile with the coroner the various labs and so on he didnt feel any great need to hang around it was after ten by now and he was exhausted but he couldnt go home yet he really had to go by erins and at least kiss the kids goodnight so now he was in the cochrans living room and his own son vincent was asleep with his head on hardys lap rebecca was curled up on his other side still awake hardy was going to do an experiment someday and see how many days his daughter could go without any sleep but for now he was contented enough with her quiet form snuggled next to him at least shed know hed come by on halloween after all both the kids had gone out in erins sheets as ghosts the elaborate costumes frannie had made for both of them cinderella for the beck and piglet for vincent were lost to the insanity of the past couple of days but at least theyd had their holiday night their respective caches of candy were already sorted in piles on the rug the wonderful erin had made it all work and for this hardy was more than grateful shed also mixed a shaker of manhattans it had been a long day for everybody and theyd spent the last twenty minutes having a nightcap and catching up on hardys progress ending with the potentially blockbusting discovery about carl griffins death but erin had a clear focus on her priorities this might be a fascinating turn of events but if it wasnt about frannie and getting everyones life back to normal she wasnt interested this policeman was before anything happened that involved frannie wasnt it dismas by a couple of weeks well then how can they keep her a glance at the beck who was hanging on every word how can they keep her where she is hardy saw her point but it wasnt any help shes in for fighting with a judge erin thats all it comes down to my guess is whatever happens with the investigation theyll let her go tuesday morning he said it easily but harbored an uneasy fear that it might turn out not to be true with rons disappearance all bets might be off shes ok though isnt she daddy see the beck might be quiet but she never sleeps arm around her he patted his girl shes fine beck in fact maybe i can see do you want to talk to her oh daddy so much gently he moved vincents head off him on to the couch the long shot had just occurred to him but the idea might work lets give it a try he got the jails number and called the desk gently reminding the deputy about the deli lunch hed provided for them that day sure the guy had heard about it what could he do for mr hardy he could let his wife in adseg use the phone and call out to talk for a minute to her kids and after a brief hesitation the deputy said hed see what he could do five minutes later the phone rang at the cochrans hardy was nervous as he picked it up frannie hearing her voice he realized he should have gone to see her again tonight when hed passed right by on the way to jeff elliots twenty times a day wouldnt be too much he should forget all this faux police work glitsky was on it now and it would move along on its own how are you holding up he heard her take in a breath and knew she was summoning her strength to answer pretty good she said with a cheer so false it made him sick the beck was unable to restrain herself in her excitement pulling at his leg the cord whatever was near by he figured it wouldnt be a good time to reprimand her for it listen ive got somebody here who wants to talk to you ok but come back please hardy handed the phone to the beck and stood there listening to the details of the past two days the questions shed had to endure at school when was mom coming home what were they doing to her down at the jail all his precious daughters thoughts and worries that hardy hadnt been able to take time for vincent woke up and was groggily leaning against him sucking his thumb although hed stopped doing that six months before is that mommy i need to talk to mommy too sleepy to cry but leaning in that direction so the kids both got to talk then erin was there anything frannie needed her to do tomorrow for school on monday she shouldnt worry grandma was on the job there wasnt any criticism of hardy stated or implied but he knew he knew he was good at some things and at others hopeless and now he felt keenly that the father role the one that perplexed and frustrated him so often if not always lately had become a victim to his need to figure things out to keep busy to win the priority was wrong he felt it in every bone but what else could he do he could give lip service to david freemans input to glitskys machine but he knew and cared more about this investigation than freeman and glitsky combined like it or not he was the prime mover lives and not just his familys now depended upon him and what he did next finally his turn came again as erin corraled both of the kids back to bedrooms to bedtime he told frannie that he loved her but he couldnt leave it at that he might hate himself for it but he had to find out more ive got to ask you have you heard from ron today no how could i theyd dont let anybody call me here no i know that well then hardy told her ron had disappeared from his hotel he listened to her breathing for a minute why would he do that i thought didnt you say he asked you to help him what does this mean i dont know i was hoping maybe you could tell me no unless he just got scared for the kids again but why wouldnt he have left some message with me i dont know that either maybe he will maybe hardy said flatly i hope so a silence hummed on the line dismas im here ive told you everything i know really i dont know where he is what hes doing if he didnt completely believe it he felt at least he had to accept it ok another silence preceded the tremulous voice tell me you believe me dismas please i need you to believe me of course he said with deliberate ambiguity ill see you tomorrow ok bright and early that would be good she said then dismas yes he waited i love you she said his knuckles were white on the phone he knew he was being imprecise me too he finished two solid manhattans with erin and ed and they talked about the water poisoning and the poor middleaged hiker from the water temple who had finally died from his injuries erin got hardy a blanket and a pillow and told him he should stay here on the couch and have breakfast with his children in the morning they were missing him if he couldnt tell he was asleep in ten seconds valens had left damon kerry up at his mansion an hour ago and back at his hotel he paced as though he were caged his suite at the clift was bigger than some apartments hed lived in and the wraparound view of san francisco was expansive but none of that mattered it was now near midnight of what had been the longest and one of the most difficult days of his life the only thing that made it even remotely worthwhile was todays latest poll that put damon essentially dead even for tuesdays election technically he was still two points back but with the pollsters margin for error the campaign was neck and neck finally the buzz came and he walked over looked through the peephole and pulled open the door thorne cast a last quick look behind him at the hallway then stepped into the room this is just not smart al he said in his softest tone as he pushed the door closed twisted the deadbolt and connected the chain turning he faced valens his expression betraying nothing a bland smile rheumy eyes this isnt a good idea we must not be seen together valens barely noticed the rebuke he was too wound up its midnight baxter nobodys looking trust me its just this he spread his arms the enormity of it today thorne nodded understandingly the elections in three days this always happens its nothing unusual it might even get worse im not talking about the election christ the election is the good news im talking about a dead man at the bottom of the pulgas water temple and this attorney hardy going to brees place and wait wait thorne held up a palm why dont we sit down do you have anything to drink you could use a cocktail in fact a cocktail might be just the thing he crossed the room to the bar motioning for valens to sit on one of the suites brocaded sofas this is really a remarkable room he admired the view for a moment then turned asking as if it were an afterthought what does the dead man at the water temple have to do with us the question was an instruction and a threat and it caught valens flatfooted no doubt as thorne had intended he went back to pulling softdrink and singleserving liquor bottles from the bar area but speaking of cocktails in the light of all the frenzy around this unfortunate mtbe poisoning it occurred to me that the candidate could make an extremely dramatic presentation in the next day or two that might put him over the top to stay hed arranged the bottles and some glasses on a little tray and brought it over to valens placing it on the coffee table then sitting on the couch kittycorner he reached for his inside pocket and extracted a flask whats in that valens asked thorne loved a surprise for an answer he smiled and unscrewed the cap then poured a half inch of the clear liquid into one of the glasses picking it up he smelled it then passed it across the table you tell me a sniff its alcohol another smile this one beaming yes it is absolutely right its ethanol straight up thorne popped the top on a bottle of orange soda and reached over pouring it into the glass bottoms up al really you want me to drink this i think thats the idea go on it wont hurt you but valens couldnt seem to force himself to move after a second or two thorne said oh for heavens sake took the glass and drained it in a couple of swallows since when have you been so timid al did you think i was going to poison you no of course not i just he met his employers eyes i dont know baxter im just fucking worn down thorne gave him an avuncular pat on the knee a couple more days and its over you hang in there and it will all have been worth it now back to business what do you think about my idea im not sure exactly what it is make ethanol cocktails suddenly thornes face showed some animation actually that might be even better thats just an inspired idea al really reporters will always take a free drink wont they valens felt some of his own tension break thats been my experience exactly you see i was thinking of having damon drink some ethanol as i just did at a press briefing think of the contrast thorne was getting wound up although his voice never changed its inflection a few gallons of mtbe finds its way into the water supply and the whole city is shut down the poisoned water smelling and tasting like turpentine he paused briefly and held up his flask while the other additive the natural additive ethanol is so safe you can drink it in fact people have been drinking it for ever i love it he said this could be very strong but valens wasnt so sure if damon will go for it thornes face clouded why wouldnt he because hes careful baxter hes not an idiot hes never specifically endorsed ethanol hes just opposed to mtbe which if my logic hasnt failed me leaves only ethanol true valens hated thornes attempts to micromanage hed done a damn fine job with the campaign and controlling the candidate to date he turned to reason but our strategy you remember has always been to let the voters make that leap which theyre doing by themselves this other is a little overt dont you think sometimes you need overt the voice was eider down the tone was cold steel here was thornes defensiveness which hed seen often enough before it was a signal to valens that hed better walk softly because the truth was that thorne frightened him badly he wasnt fooling valens that he wasnt behind this water poisoning sometimes though such as today people died i agree valens said sometimes overt is good so how about i ask damon and get his take on it if hell go we go all right thorne said mildly since thats our only option anyway he was pouring a couple of the airline portions of vodka into his glass he added an ice cube topped it off with more orange soda slid back more comfortably in his chair and took a long drink now about this hardy fellow ive done some research it turns out he may be a bit of a problem this was not what valens needed just now he came forward to the first two inches of the couch hows that in his lowkey way thorne outlined what hed discovered about frannie the grand jury ron beaumont a little of hardys history and that he was a meddling lawyer who wasnt always loath to get his hands dirty we can only assume he concluded since he buttonholed kerry that hes made the leap no pun from brees death to gasoline additives which is not good news for us i do wish we could locate ron a sigh we should have acted more quickly im afraid i blame myself really i should have just hacked into her system and deleted the damn thing instead of but valens was shaking his head he didnt want to get into another discussion with thorne about the instead of no he interrupted she would still have had the hard copy and probably a backup disk thats what i was trying to get her to give me to hold her off until after the election come on in al thanks for coming by he took in the incredible penthouse at a glance as he came through the door he d never been here before and the grandness of it surprised him although maybe it shouldn t have everything about bree beaumont made an impression he was he believed largely immune to the attractive power of her physical presence but he wasnt fool enough to deny its existence she was damons girlfriend and as such a campaign factor to control so he tried not to think of her as a woman he didnt care that she was a woman she was butting into his campaign and his business and he didnt like her period but this was the first time hed ever been alone with her as she led him through the ornate living room and back to the sitting area near the balcony he was subliminally aware of the tasteful decorating the fancy art the panorama out the windows there was a better view close up however he couldnt keep his eyes off brees perfect ass which shed poured into a pair of designer jeans hed never before seen her in jeans or in a tshirt with nothing under it or barefoot her blond hair cascaded halfway down her back he thought he could encircle her waist with both his hands somehow all of this made him vibrate with a dull anger that she could walk around like this around him and that the vastness between them was so great that it was literally unthinkable for him to have any reaction to her she was so far above him that he did not exist this did more than simply piss him off she was making small talk as she led him back sorry im such a mess she said ive been working all afternoon on the computer and lost track of the time he was half listening and all the way still looking when she suddenly turned did she catch where his eyes were and motioned to one of the low upholstered chairs anyway just to thank you again for coming i wouldnt have bothered you but i dont know what to do i wanted your advice before i burden damon with anything else ill do what i can valens said lamely he was a few inches under six feet about brees height and weighed in at near two hundred pounds brown hair heavy shadow understarched white shirt and rack suit his tongue wouldnt work i appreciate your thinking of me perhaps sensing his reaction to her she stood a moment awkwardly then motioned to one of the chairs do you want to have a seat can i get you something to drink ive got anything really yeah ill take a beer thanks he watched her again then forced himself to look out over the balcony to the city beyond in a heartbeat she was back with a bottle of some foreign beer a chilled pilsner glass and a plastic bottle of evian valens thanked her politely this is a nice place he said pouring she was unscrewing the cap on the water bottle and she stopped her face turning wistful yes though im afraid it looks like were going to have to let it go pretty soon but i shouldnt complain its been very nice more than we ever thought wed she stopped the upkeep s just too much and anyway ron and i my husband well you know hes not around is he she shook her head no he and the kids went well it doesn t matter theyre out now valens took a deep draught then tried to ask it gently it wouldnt do him any good to show anything so is this about him the question seemed to surprise her no nothing about that really he waited she looked out over his shoulder absently bringing the water bottle to her lips ive been doing a lot of soulsearching lately al and also a lot of research ok she brushed some hair away from her face you know ever since damon got me to start questioning my assumptions on my work on the petroleum side looking in different directions as hed say its realty been i guess youd say an education valens nodded which is funny given that im considered an expert on all of these issues a shrug and an attempt to smile well you saw the light thats all but she shook her head i dont know what i saw really i think other than just being so hurt that id been misled by people i trusted and mad at myself for being so stupid i mean al i am not stupid anything else ok just not stupid no valens said trying to keep it light we could go with not stupid but the levity went by her impatiently she brushed her hair away again but even more other than that damon got me back to why i started doing all this my work i mean in the first place which was she stopped this will sound stupid valens shook his head no weve agreed were not going with stupid so whyd you start working in the first place i wanted to do good she let out a breath in a whoosh ok there ive said it ok big deal he thought so you wanted to do good and i did too i did what i set out to do with mtbe do you know how great that stuff works cleaning up the air al it cuts toxic emissions down to almost nothing you go out to pasadena now in august and you can see the mountains or even out there she pointed to the window you can see it it has made the world cleaner do you realize that do you see what an incredible achievement that was now she was all wound up and had to stand to walk off some of it over to the balcony doors pulling them open letting in a blast of cool air it seemed to calm her after a moment and she turned around to face him again anyway in spite of its bad press now the point is that it really worked and i was part of it a big part of it the epa loved it everybody loved it can you understand how invested i was in it how when the complaints started to appear i didnt want to look i couldnt look anybody could understand that al said although he wasnt sure that he could that was natural it was she agreed it was so natural sighing she came back to the chair across from him and sat in it their knees almost touching anyway she said then i saw it what i was doing because of damon and you did right well as far as it went valens cocked his head what do you mean i mean i guess i was angry id been made to look like a fool and i didnt want it to happen again i realized that damon was starting to look like he was pushing for ethanol even if he wasnt really doing it directly and i wasnt positive he wanted to go in that direction either for valens this was the worst possible news his candidate wasnt a scientist he didnt need to know the details all he needed to know was that mtbe polluted the groundwater and ethanol didnt therefore ethanol was better but he couldnt show his concern instead he stalled for a minute with his beer then smiled well bree as you say hes never made ethanol part of his platform except its there you know it is al and is that so bad well its not a great fuel its expensive to make its not as efficient he had to cut her off but its no danger in groundwater and does make gas burn cleaner right bree grimaced hesitated what tell me we dont need either of them the whole additive industry is basically just one giant greedy scam the oil companies as we know are making billions on mtbe but thats not all have you ever heard of sko the farming conglomerate valens felt his head go light of course well its making zillions too in subsidies for ethanol they cant make the stuff profitably but somehow theyve convinced the government that its in the national interest that we keep making it maybe it is maybe but she cut him off no no its not al listen to this did you know that it takes more energy to produce ethanol than the stuff generates as a fuel i dont think so bree how is that possible tractor fuel cost of shipment storage refining like that well well nothing and since it has less fuel energy than gas it guarantees worse gas mileage which affects everybody who drives plus she continued having worked herself into a high dudgeon do you realize that every dollar of skos ethanol profits costs the american taxpayer thirty dollars and im leaving out all the science here this is just the crappy business stuff its just awful valens had no response to any of this he didnt know if any of it was true or not and didnt care but it was clear that she had come to believe it and might take her message to damon that was the issue that s what he had to deflect he kept his voice under control but bree almost all businesses but damon isnt involved with almost all businesses hes involved with this one and this ethanol thing isnt even the worst of it he waited hardly daring to breathe what could be worse than what shed already come to so what is he asked she leaned forward and her zealots eyes locked into his we dont need either of them either of what either mtbe or ethanol or any other gas additives for that matter the epa has mandated them but the whole thing is a scam the whole thing do you realize that her voice went up several decibels with her outrage i im afraid i dont understand he managed to stammer no no i know you dont how could you nobody does wait a minute suddenly she was up nearly running disappearing into a hallway across the kitchen area in another moment she reappeared carrying a large handful of papers look she began without preamble i dont expect you to understand the science she said but let me try to explain some of this he listened for what seemed an eternity as she went over the salient points of the report shed been working on for the past month or six weeks it contained a great deal of data graphs equations analyses of comparisons in burn rates emissions efficiencies of gasoline and gradually even al valens began to see what bree had assembled culled from patent applications lawsuit transcripts internal memos executive summaries and expert testimony of dozens of combustion engineers bree s report detailed a startling truth that the oil companies had discovered a way to formulate gasoline so that it burned cleanly without the addition of oxygenates without any additives at all so you see al its what i was telling you the whole additive question is a scam damons got to be made aware of this ive got to tell him when she finished valens gathered his thoughts it wouldnt do to alienate bree now if she did go running to damon with this if she convinced him to start talking about it it would be a disaster he sighed histrionically this is terrible he said just awful i wonder why it hasnt made the news in a big way but bree knew the answer to that one its a bunch of individual papers experiments opinions thats how we scientists work on small problems little tweaks here and there which are fascinating and challenging in themselves like with me and mtbe at the beginning in laymans terms my job was to prove it made for cleaner air and every way i tested it it worked and then somehow my job changed and gradually i wasnt really a scientist anymore i was a spokesperson defending what id done what caloco believed in what i believed in so i wasnt interested in groundwater in cleanup even in this reformulated gas my job my life was mtbe the rest of it wasnt my problem she looked at him hopefully do you understand at all he nodded of course of course i do she squared the pages of her report and sat back with it in her lap but i was wrong no i dont think so i think you trusted your employers valens reached across and touched her knee with his fingertips quickly even through the jeans it burned bree you did the right thing calling me about this i want you to know that she let out a long breath i didnt know what else to do part of me feels like i should tell damon but he has so much on his mind already exactly but if i dont valens interrupted with the answer she needed if you dont hell understand in fact after the election hell thank you for it the issue at this point in any campaign much less a squeaker like this one bree is focus if he loses focus the voters get confused he s dead and this stuff youve got to admit its a little complicated she broke a small smile a little i suppose dont suppose believe me on this one now they were more than allies they were really pals it was time to make his pitch bree that report you got it on your computer too yes you know its pretty volatile stuff it gets in the wrong hands maybe your husbands what he could delete it maybe shred the hard copy and then wheres all your hard work if he connects it with you and damon no she said ron would never do anything like that she hesitated ron accepts the situation he shrugged it wouldnt do to push well its your decision but i could take all that stuff your disks everything keep them someplace safe till after the election but she was firm its safe here i dont want damon to see it until i tell him until we have time and i can explain it and also why we decided not to tell him sooner after the election valens wanted it nailed down although what he really wanted was all copies of the report or better yet for bree to disappear along with it i think so she said as weve decided but as the door closed behind him al knew he hadnt pushed hard enough he stood in the landing by the elevators wondering whether he should knock again while she was still alone and go in and take what he needed personally and professionally because if he knew bree at all and he did shed never be able to keep this to herself shed get cozy with damon one night and just have to tell him and then damon would decide that the right thing to do would be to share it with the public and while it was one thing to be a white knight crusading against an evil corporate polluter it was quite another to be a paranoid leftwing fanatic who believed that the environmental protection agency was part of the great government gasoline conspiracy that while possibly true would not fly and valens knew it it would cost damon the election it would cost al his potentially lucrative future relationship with sko it would infuriate the volatile and unpredictable baxter thorne no it wouldn t do from his endless bag of tricks baxter thorne had produced dismas hardys telephone number and suggested that valens call with an amendment to his earlier lie about not having called ron when hardy wasnt home valens left a message then came over to the couches again where thorne was on his fourth little bottle of liquor after his opening shot of pure ethanol that ought to help thorne remarked his voice firmly under control but i dont like him meddling in our affairs he really doesnt belong in this picture does he i dont know where hes come from valens found that he was afraid to reply there was a glaze in thornes eyes maybe not all from the alcohol that scared him thorne leaned back crossed one leg over the other and took another long pull at his glass hes got you telling a fib he may know something of the report if hes been to brees a silence settled which valens took to be ominous and if thats the case he may decide to share it with damon or the press a long moment passed suddenly thorne put his glass down slapped his knees and stood up well al thanks for the cocktails he headed for the door it seems to me mr hardy has a little too much free time on his hands i think perhaps a distraction would be good for him just at this time you say he isnt home right now he wasnt when i called yes thats right thats right thorne checked the peephole opened the door an inch turned to face valens apparently came to some decision then pulled the door all the way open and left without another word part three in san francisco there is summer which is windy harsh and damp although it rarely rains and then there is indian summer from late august into midoctober when the days are warm the skies cloudless the breezes kind for the rest of the year its all fog and low clouds near the coast clearing inland by afternoon highs in the low sixties and winds from the west at fifteen to twenty when hardy woke up on the cochrans couch at a little after six it was obvious that indian summer was over and the rest of the year had kicked in he sat up stiffly and took a minute getting his bearings it had been a while since hed slept on a couch in somebody elses living room the dim outlines of morning bled through the venetian blinds but he somehow knew at once from the quality of the light that the fog had come in involuntarily he sighed ten minutes later he was on the road lights on in the soup it was going to be another long day and he needed some fresh clothes and a shower erin of course had already been up too making coffee in the kitchen and he told her he thought hed go home check his messages clean up and try to be back with them on taraval before the kids awoke when he turned off geary on to his block though he was struck immediately with a sense of foreboding hed lived on this street for most of three decades and there was a familiarity to it that was deeper than anything rational something this morning was out of the ordinary in the fog he couldnt see down to the end where his house was but it definitely felt wrong there was a blinking red glow up ahead he slowed down even further on alert equally reluctant and compelled to keep going forward then gradually emerging from the murk the definable shapes images from some horrible dream three fire trucks were still parked in the street hoses trailing from them in the gutters like bloated serpents a couple of black and white police cruisers the source of the red strobes their bubbles on a halfdozen men in uniform were standing on the sidewalk on his lawn milling in the wet morning street in a daze trying to keep the rising sense of panic at bay he parked carefully pulling straight into the curb getting out he was aware of the crackling sounds of radio static and perhaps of smoldering wood he moved forward without any awareness of it transfixed by the stillsmoking ruin that had been his home for over twenty years the white picket fence had been trampled to bits by the firemen and their equipment what had been a small carefully maintained lawn was a mess of mud and charred wood the front porch wasnt there at all and the ruined living room behind it yawned obscenely open in the gray dawn his chair the mantel over the fireplace their beautiful cherry dining set destroyed he was on the property now sir a man in a white helmet was suddenly in the path cutting him off im sorry but you cant i live here hardy said this is my house miraculously much of the house had been saved some late halloween revelers on their way home had seen the flames within minutes after the blaze had begun around four am and called the fire department on their cell phone as a result the back half of hardys home kitchen bedrooms and baths had remained relatively unscathed although the cleanup was going to take weeks and the burned smell might never go away the incident commander the man in the white helmet had given him permission to survey the damage but he was to be accompanied at all times by captain flores they were talking about evidence and preservation of the scene and it struck hardy that he was at least for now an arson suspect flores and hardy stood in the center of the kitchen and hardy was trying to answer the captains questions but his mind kept jumping he noticed his black castiron frying pan on the stove where hed left it looking down the nowgaping open hallway he noticed that his front door was still on its hinges perhaps salvagable he would plane it and paint it again their footfalls crunched over the glass and debris no there couldnt have been any fire left burning in the fireplace hardy was telling flores i hadnt been home since yesterday morning we havent lit a fire in there in months well pretty obviously thats where it started up front you got any gas pipes in there do you smoke no and no captain flores was a sweetfaced young man with a drooping mustache he followed hardy back into the burnedout front area of the house and they stood in what used to be the dining room the dusty rose drywall now mostly gone the roof was open above them and water still dripped randomly hardy let out some air what do you do with this he asked flores saw similar scenes every day but that didnt make it any easier do you have insurance yeah but thats not what i meant i know hardy turned to him somebody did this didnt they the captain shrugged he might have some suspicions but he wasnt going to share them with a civilian thats always a thought its why weve got arson investigators he indicated a couple of guys poking around by what used to be the porch at this point its a little early to make that determination but if you know something i dont ill pass it along hardy had his hands deep in his pockets i dont know anything he said referring to a lot more than the fire flores scraped a toe along the burned hardwood floor and sighed youre not going to want to hear this but this might be somebodys idea of a halloween prank he paused its happened before hardy gave it a moment shook his head i dont think so if anything the morning fog had grown heavier one of the first things hardy did after the incident commander stopped him was ask if he could get a patch through to glitskys home on the patrol car radio next was his brotherinlaw moses mcguire now the lieutenant sat on the hood of his car feet resting on the front bumper leaning forward with his elbows on his knees his head down even with all his years in homicides at terrible crime scenes here glitsky almost couldnt bear to look hardy had been silent withdrawn with shock and rage when abe had arrived gradually glitsky had gotten him away from the arson people from the house itself where the effects of the fire werent so pervasive now he was coming out of it beginning to pace ill tell you one thing they think theyre warning me off they think im going away now they should have killed me instead whos that whoever did this abe somebody did this to get at you hardy nodded its a warning it has to be this beaumont thing hardy stopped in front of him you think its not glitsky was silent hardy raised his voice well what the hell do you think this was abe spontaneous combustion glitsky met hardys eyes i dont think its a great time to get in an argument with you how about that he slid off the car and put a hand on his friends shoulder hardy could only manage a nod glitsky gave his shoulder a last squeeze moved off a few steps then turned and with an almost visible effort forced himself to look at the house if you need me ill be downtown im going to work flores was at his elbow and hardy was back in the house in the little enclosed area behind the kitchen where he kept his safe flores didnt want to let him back in they might trample over more evidence the captain made it very clear that until they were done with their investigation this was the fire departments house no longer his but the arrival of glitsky a highly ranked city cop who was obviously a personal friend had given hardy some credibility and flores cut him a little slack they could go up through the back door and hardy could get what he needed although he had to show flores his license to carry and even then when flores saw what he wanted he could tell he was pushing it but this time he felt no twinge of the reluctance hed felt the last time hed gone for his guns there was also an old badge from his days as an assistant da he didnt think too hard before grabbing it then tucking his police special into his belt he pulled his jacket down over it and walked back into the desolation in the frontyard area moses had finally arrived a few minutes after glitskys departure and now was standing at the front side of the house by the chimney which was still standing moses had picked up something and held it out as hardy and flores mushed through the mud start your new collection moses said somberly it was one of the exquisitely fragile venetian glass elephants that had grazed cavorted and trumpeted on their mantel over the past decade which moses had rearranged with nearly every visit until last night there had been fifteen of them hardy had just recently acquired the latest one for their anniversary and now against impossible odds at least one had survived perhaps blasted out into the yard by the force of water hardy took it and turned it in his hand then handed it back to moses asking his brotherinlaw to hold on to it for him after ten more minutes of surveying damage he excused himself moses didnt have to open the shamrock for another four hours he agreed that hardy needed to go down to the jail and break the news to frannie then to the kids moses would stay here with flores and take care of the first round of details he was glad to be able to help but hardy wasnt going to the jail he pulled over at the first gas station he came to and called phil canettas home number a tired worried womans voice answered hello phil hardy told mrs canetta who he was that he was working with her husband could he get in touch with him this morning it was important i dont know where phil is he went out after dinner and never came home he always calls she said if you do talk to him hardy promised that hed have phil call her then hung up frowning this was unexpected and unpleasant canetta had left freemans office gone somewhere presumably on this investigation and hadnt come home the wind gusted around the phone booth and he hunched himself further into his jacket he dropped another quarter and punched some buttons this better be good jeff its dismas hardy sorry to wake you but i need to know where al valens stays when hes in town you need that huh how about i need some more sleep what time is it anyway early but ive got a hot item for you swing by my house sometime this morning after i get up fine thatll be good enough valens though jeff thought a moment i think the clift what do you got is this about beaumont good guess hardy said though what isnt lately youre right everything the reporter sounded truly exhausted what time is it he asked for a second time i dont know jeff whats the matter you get home late last night as a matter of fact after you left i hung for a while talked to a colleague about this very stuff finally went home and had dinner couldnt sleep and decided i had to pay a call on damon at his home im a sympathetic reporter remember hes a night owl hed see me he has before so when was this late a little after midnight i felt like id never get any sleep if i didnt get an answer or two on all this stuff and and he wasnt home until when i left at one and he still hadnt come in and yet you got to sleep after all not enough ill catch him today after jeff sighed this thing with you you ought to be able to tell me about it now over the phone dont you think but hardy didnt want to do that knowing there was a lot more power in the physical reality come by the house he said youll be intrigued i promise it was against the rules but the clerk was persuaded by the badge to give mr hardy of the das office the room number of mr valens he took the elevator to the fifteenth floor and walked the long hallway back to the suite at the end hardy heard some muttering all right all right just a second and prepared himself to move it took all of his restraint not to draw the gun when valens cracked the door he put his shoulder against it and kept coming what the valens was wearing slacks and shoes but still was wrapped in one of the hotels white bathrobes and now he clutched it in front of him hardy quickly closed the door behind them sorry to be so pushy but we have to talk who the hell dismas hardy maybe you remember we met briefly yesterday with mr kerry you said youd never called ron beaumont is any of this coming back to you valens was backing away but got stopped by a chair he nearly fell then righted himself sure mr hardy i remember he grabbed at the robe which had fallen open he was getting his bearings back tying the sash but still obviously wary of the crazy man whod crashed his door i called you just last night at your home to correct that i had forgotten that i did in fact call ron with the press of yesterdays events it temporarily slipped my mind didnt you get that message no i didnt you know why because my answering machine went up in flames this morning with the rest of my house the fiddling with the robe stopped are you saying your house caught fire not all by itself somebody helped it valens drew a deep breath and spoke very carefully still clearly unnerved by hardys entrance his continued presence im very sorry to hear that yeah well im in a little bit of a bad mood about it myself valens sat against the back of the chair he stole a glance at his watch at the door are you expecting somebody a nervous shrug damons got a breakfast meeting in an hour im scheduled to pick him up but hardy shook his head not until we clear up a few things between us bree beaumont the fire like that valens straightened up put on a face but i really dont understand what do those things have to do with me suddenly hardys adrenalin seemed to kick itself up another notch he pulled the gun from his belt took a step toward valens and pointed it at him what do they have to do with you ill tell you im investigating bree beaumont and you lied to me yesterday im getting close the fire was somebody warning me to stay away and the only person i can think of whos got any reason is you how about that is that clearer valens spread his hands patent terror i didnt set your house on fire mr hardy i was in this room all night im in the last days of a political campaign that ive been waging for nearly a year bree beaumont is not in my life damon kerry is i didnt lie to you another empty gesture you dont need that gun what youre calling a lie was a simple mistake i forgot something that was all but hardys blood was way up his voice dripping sarcasm oh yes you forgot you called the husband of a murdered woman whod worked on your campaign and it clean slipped your mind he snapped at him raised the gun you forgot that i dont believe you it was only for an instant by the time i realized id made a mistake you were gone so i called you last night you called me last night although your focus as you say isnt on bree beaumont youre telling me that in the final hours of this campaign you called me at home at night to correct this insignificant detail valens swallowed which in any event you know you cant prove because my answering machine is a pile of ashes is that what youre telling me valens shrugged no but i and while were at it here mr valens maybe you can tell me how you got my home number which is unlisted and here hardy realized that one of the roundhouses he was throwing had finally scored valens cast his eyes around the room as though hoping to find an answer none was forthcoming and hardy pressed at him was it one of your campaign workers maybe the same guys who came by my house no no what was it different guys no youre twisting what im saying i dont have any guys i didnt do any of this you didnt call me thats your new story no i did do that i admitted that he had moved up to within a foot of valens sweat had broken on the mans face it was all hardy could do to not push him backwards over the chair and physically beat the truth out of him hardy was in a genuine rage he actually trembled with anger if you dont say something i want to hear in the next five seconds im going to shoot you in the face he cocked the gun give me one reason right now what do you want i want why you called ron and why you didnt tell me valens didnt waste any time making something up backing away he blurted it out brees got some files that could hurt damons campaign some reports changing her position again back to mtbe no still against that then what was the change she got religion shed decided that all additives were unnecessary ethanol too and that hurts damon kerry it could if it got out if damon went that way valens held up a hand look i cant that gun it wont go off by itself but hardy uncocked it bree hurting damon kerry he said getting back to where they were valens drew a shaky breath damon gets a lot of lift from talk radio because his message is so clear bree didnt understand that most people arent scientists so youre saying bree didnt tell him this earlier hardy lowered the gun slightly why not i thought she was his consultant on this stuff she thought it might adversely affect the campaign as i just told you lowered or not valens couldnt take his eyes off the weapon then when she died was killed ok was killed well frankly after that i wanted to get my hands on that report so i could get rid of it so kerry wouldnt ever see it valens hesitated thats right because you didnt want kerry to know what bree thought a nod she was turning into a zealot she was dangerous and had to be eliminated valens didnt approve of the word she had to be managed and you did that how by convincing her to wait until after the election before she told damon he wouldnt do anybody any good if he didnt first get elected and i made her understand that she agreed to wait it was only after she was killed that i realized ron might inadvertently let the report leak not knowing what it was not seeing its importance so i called him to ask if hed give it to me he pointed at the gun you know you dont need that thing im telling the truth the call to ron was straightforward really hardys shoulders sagged the rush of adrenalin had worn him out and he realized that valens was right he stuffed the gun back into his belt and backed up to the desk sitting on the corner of it it couldnt have been that straightforward he said you lied to me about it if you remember kerry was there with us i wanted to keep it from him until after the election hardy shook his head you werent ever going to show it to him were you maybe not valens replied maybe someday but brees conclusions werent really the issue it was that she was the source of them and she had such an influence on damon i mean everybody in the industry knows you can formulate gas with low emissions you dont need additives so what except if bree gets messianic and kerry makes it his new war cry then he looks like a fool or a pawn for having supported ethanol for so long valens nodded thats the simple answer but its close enough if he sees the report and knows its from bree he moves on it now he makes it a campaign issue thats who damon is so he confuses his voters he looks like hes waffling all of the above i couldnt let it happen how about if i say that sounds like a reason to kill her how about if she changed her mind and was going to tell him and you had to stop her valens had a good answer to that then i wouldnt have had to call ron to get my hands on the report last week would i i would have searched the house and just taken it after i killed her he glanced furtively at his watch spoke now as if asking permission look i do have this breakfast with damon and i really did leave a message last night that id made a mistake it wasnt a lie and i did call ron as to why i remembered to call you it was what you said i knew it wasnt insignificant at all a call to a murdered womans husband you were an attorney it wasnt brain surgery figuring you wouldnt go away if you thought i was lying hardy hated that it had gotten to here to some sort of belief in the basic truth of what valens was telling him but there was one last question so howd you get my phone number a nervous smile i called the office and asked if somebody could find it when i got back here i had a message just like that valens shrugged i say i want something somebody usually finds out a way to make sure i get it i dont ask how thats how politics works or doesnt hardy said shes checked out to the jails uniformed desk sergeant squinted at the log glitsky homicide next door hardy wondered about this new development as he walked in the bitter fog around the corner to the main entrance of the hall frannie was signed out to glitsky how did that happen and what did it mean hed stowed the gun in the trunk of his car so he wouldnt have to confront the halls metal detector it remained a miserable morning hardy checked the time surprised at how early it still was for all that had gone on he wasnt entirely certain hed done the right thing by letting valens go about his campaign business but he couldnt imagine that the man was going to disappear at least not until the election if some real evidence of wrongdoing by valens turned up before then hardy would bring it to abes attention but in the meanwhile he had more important things on his mind his house his wife his life the halls familiar lobby on weekdays a perennial throbbing and vulgar mass of disgruntled humanity was empty this early and his footfalls echoed knowing hed have no patience with the elevator he took the inside stairway to the fourth floor then walked down the long hall to the homicide detail an open room with fifteen backtoback desks and several square columns poking about floor to ceiling seemingly at random there wasnt a body to be seen in homicide itself although through the grimy wiredglass windows he could look across through the fog to the jail where spectral shapes moved in the outer corridors the door to the lieutenants office was open no one was inside but hardy noticed that kerrys water glass that he picked up yesterday was gone a good sign he knocked anyway anybody here yo glitsky appeared in the doorway of one of the interrogation rooms before he could say anything frannie appeared behind him they met in an embrace in the middle of the room i had to tell her he heard abe say i didnt know how long youd be hung up back there and she had to know the words barely registered he was lost in holding her but glitsky was still talking explaining im on my way driving down here i realize we bring witnesses over from the jail every day to talk to them so i just went and signed her out into my custody its sunday nobodys here to question why i got her it seemed like a good idea its a great idea frannie said plus erins bringing the kids down and im going out for some food glitsky said he was already putting on his jacket itll be a party he pointed a finger at hardy while im gone im leaving you in charge dont let her escape they were alone together in the homicide details interrogation room kittycorner at the table the fog was pressing tight up against the windows the wind gusting audibly it wasnt exactly warm inside either first was the house hardys assessment of how bad it was what they were going to have to do about living in the next weeks the somber details it hit frannie especially hard that even after her expected release from jail on tuesday morning she wouldnt be able to go back to her old life this is all because of me isnt it it was difficult for hardy to tell her it wasnt he couldnt imagine that anything relating to bree beaumonts death would have had any effect on their lives if frannie had not become involved with ron hadnt promised to keep his secrets you did what you had to do he told her equivocally but at least ive got somebody scared and thats always instructive its more than just that maybe he admitted do you think something else could happen to you in truth hardy thought if he kept pushing which he fully intended to do that something else surely would happen thats even what he wanted without an act there couldnt be a mistake upon which he could capitalize and this of course was not without risk even serious risk but answering her he simply shook his head if i get any closer ill give it to abe let the pros run with it frannie tightened her grip on his arm you can do that now dismas no he said pointedly not if i want to protect saint rons kids i wish youd stop calling him that hardy figured hed earned the right to call ron beaumont anything he wanted he waved the objection off the point is if i want to protect his kids thats why im doing all this isnt it thats what im supposed to believe what do you mean supposed to believe he tried to control it but he heard his voice take on a harder edge i find who killed bree by tuesday and everybodys life goes back to normal right except ours now now ours is a mess hed gotten her to tears and he didnt care and you want to know the real laugh riot here frannie im not even sure ron didnt do this to us thats crazy she said he would have had no reason to do that he firmly grabbed his wife by the shoulders and turned her to him listen to me how about if he thought i was there alone sleeping the house burns down with me in it then hes got you did that ever occur to you no thats not it so where is the son of a bitch i dont know dismas i dont know she took his hands and held them in front of her but ron and i theres nothing like that hardy hesitated although he was well into it mention of ron beaumont was still personally fraught with peril for him still he had to go ahead you know fran ive really been trying to keep abe from looking at him officially but its beginning to look as if whoever killed bree also killed abes inspector half a mile from rons house that doesnt mean he squeezed her hand and just so you know ron apparently had a few different identities what do you mean identities hardy outlined glitskys discovery of the previous night which now seemed about a year and half ago when he was through frannie took a while to answer he must have thought he might have to run again someday to save the kids im sure thats what hed like everybody to believe and maybe its true but hes getting a hell of a lot of play out of saving his kids thats because thats what hes doing dismas i believe that you did too when you met him remember that he didnt start any of this any more than i did hardy clucked i know hes just a poor victim god you can be mean she snapped sometimes its useful he replied id just like you to consider the possibility that this guy is the great pretender no for two or three different reasons insurance credit cards you name it he kills bree and sets you up as his alibi when the cops start to get close to him he cons me into muddying the waters digging up other suspects giving himself a few more days to disappear i dont see much wrong with that picture but she was shaking her head its not him listen to yourself dismas he didnt give himself more time to disappear and also stick around to burn down our house so he could have me you cant have it both ways you think he had something going on with me dont you thats what this is all about isnt it the real one you dont believe is me youve never denied it goddam it how about that you never asked hardy spun around and walked to the window the fog an eternity passed before he sensed any movement he was afraid to turn she came up and hugged him from behind hes just a dad from the kids school we got to be friends this happened thats all she continued talking quietly into his back i know you hate the whole victim mentality dismas i dont like it either but sometimes people are in situations they didnt create like us now too weve just got to keep trying to do whats right dont you think i dont know what right is anymore yes you do all i know is i want to hurt whoever did this no you want to hurt anybody right now it doesnt have to be who did all this maybe youre so hurt and what if its ron after all if weve both been conned is that the worst that can happen that somebody took advantage of your good heart i dont have a good heart yes you do and youre risking it here and afraid somebodys going to smash it and make you look like a fool in the bargain but either way its over on tuesday isnt it if you dont find whoever really did it hardy turned around to her and ive helped him escape except if hes run away then he didnt burn our house and vice versa think about it dismas its not him she brought a hand up to his face and rubbed it against his cheek more than anything i just dont want you to be hurt or us to be hurt her eyes pleaded with him do you think you could stand to kiss me please frannie erin ed and the kids were finishing their lunch chinese takeout was all glitsky had been able to forage on a sunday morning the opening minutes had been brutal the kids emotions over finally seeing their mother again then the doublewhammy as they heard the news of the fire by the time they were an hour into it though hardy realized that it was as normal a family meal as you could have in a homicide interrogation room vincent was sitting on frannies lap rebecca was nonstop chatter about school stuff they were all making plans about logistics moving ahead solving problems eventually hardy got up and wandered out over to glitskys office over the course of the morning hed been tangentially aware of activity in the main room the odd homicide inspector moseying on in for sunday duty maybe to write up some reports hardy stopped in glitskys doorway the lieutenant was at his desk hunched over paperwork he knocked and glitsky looked up and waved him in budgets he said and threw his pencil down on the desk utilization percentage field efficiency ratios unit integration coefficient ive been filling out these things for five years and i still dont know what a unit integration coefficient is give it an eightyseven hardy said thats usually good for a coefficient he sat down across from the desk i wanted to thank you for bringing her up here he said glitsky nodded im sorry i couldnt have done it sooner but with the crowds passing through here every other day of the week somebodyd leak it to sharron pratt who tells marian braun who goes ballistic and takes it to rigby then im fired and i hate it when that happens well you did it today hardy said sincerely and i wanted to thank you thanks accepted glitsky leaned back hooking his hands behind his head in other news youll be delighted to hear that ive put batavia and coleman on alibis for the time of griffins death a short pause also for early this morning maybe eliminate somebody maybe find somebody maybe that too also i put in some calls if ron beaumont used one of his credit cards we know where he is or was close enough anyway last thing is i took your glass to the lab but nobody was on it might be a day or two utilization coefficient difficulties hardy asked glitsky shook his head in mock disgust i cant teach you anything its not utilization coefficient its unit integration coefficient but yeah thats probably it anyway meanwhile i thought it was time i got a look at the crime scene myself when the partys over in there i thought you might like to come along he looked at his watch made a gesture of apology and lowered his voice speaking of which he still had the key to the penthouse but hardy couldnt very well pull it out with glitsky next to him so they had to ring the building superintendent david glenn glenn was in his early forties handsome in a nononsense way he wore a tonsure of buzzcut blond hair around a lot of clean scalp his body was trim and well defined in shorts and a golds gym tshirt and he projected an easy and friendly cando competence you guys getting any closer he inquired as the elevator brought them up any day now glitsky replied this seemed to satisfy glenn somehow so its not ron after all i didnt say that glitsky replied yeah i read it was but if youre still looking glitsky was firm thats where it is mr glenn were still looking it might be ron when we stop no i dont think so i hope not why not hardy put in glenn shook his head ah you know nope hardy said playing cop why dont you tell us well most tenants here i couldnt pick em out of a lineup they park down below underneath ride the elevator to their places i never see em ron i got to know a little thats all the elevator door opened and they were on the small landing in front of the beaumonts door although the view today through the one window was a gray blanket glenn stepped out with them pulled a key from the ring he was carrying and fitted it to the door you get a take on people thats all and ron the key worked but glenn just stood there a minute thinking about the question the guys a miracle with his kids i suppose thats it a miracle glitsky asked hardy didnt ask because he knew what was coming glenn shrugged you guys got kids hardy answered a handful between us all right then you know im divorced myself but i got a couple and even the good ones try the patience of a saint am i right he waited then answered himself im right but ron every day out to school every day pick em up weekends with soccer and horses and who knows what else and ive never seen him lose his patience with them i mean me i get mine twice a month and im biting their heads off couple of times me and ron would take all of them to the park or something and im pulling my hair a smile acknowledging the baldness rons just cool always what about with his wife glitsky asked the word is they were having problems a nod maybe maybe disagreeing who doesnt but i dont see ron fighting hed walk away did bree walk all over him mr glenn hardy asked the superintendent hesitated i didnt know her so well she worked long hours id almost never see her sometimes in the elevator he stopped again glitsky what glenn shrugged i got the impression she was like an absentminded genius you know what i mean real inside herself with all this brilliant stuff and then like shed forget what floor she lived on sometimes shed be just sitting in the lobby like she was trying to decide what floor to get off on he shook his head too smart really unconnected hardy had a hunch to the kids too i dont know i dont know i ever saw her go out with them she kind of had a life of her own i think glitsky pushed it and yet you got the impression that she and ron were happy together i dont know happy but times youd see them together they were comfortable i guess he shrugged a family you know comfortable phil canetta glitskys face betrayed no trace of recognition cant say it rings a bell the guy you sent over from central station the first time i came here hardy explained but glitsky was still shaking his head perplexed i called the desk that was all said they might want to dispatch a body to make sure you didnt hurt yourself or more likely that you didnt hurt ron beaumont if he turned out to be home did this guy canetta say hed talked to me hardy hesitated even though glitsky was his friend this was not a casual moment not really i just assumed it and you were both inside here glitsky didnt like this one bit how did that special moment come about the door was open open hardy made a face picky picky youre too literal sometimes anybody ever tell you that if hardy thought this was going to sidetrack glitsky he was mistaken was the door open a shrug it wasnt locked i knocked tried the knob it turned i walked in you walked in had canetta arrived yet no that was later but if youre wondering i had plenty of time to plant evidence or steal anything i wanted neither of which i did youre just going to have to believe me now how about if we talk about something else glitsky sighed heavily someday you pull stuff like this im not going to be able to help you you know that hardy kept a straight face its a constant worry but you wanted to come here today and here we are inside legally and all with your warrant what did you want to see theyd already looked out over the balcony and now stood in the middle of the open kitchen where glitsky had been casually opening drawers the cupboards the refrigerator the usual he said distractedly everything they began in the back in the childrens bedroom the room was just as hardy had last seen it across the hall they moved to the master bedroom two steps in glitsky stopped so abruptly that hardy nearly walked into him what he asked you tell me hardy cast his gaze around the room it was nearly a perfect square and quite large perhaps twenty feet on a side to his left a door was open to a bluetiled bathroom next along the wall were three paneled sliding doors a long closet on the back wall a couple of high windows presided over a king bed neatly made up with blankets no comforter or bedspread with a reading table on hardys right side a darkwood chest of drawers with several pictures of ron ron with the kids bree with the kids none of ron and bree along the right wall some hunting prints hung over an exercise area a stationary bike and some barbells then another doorway leading to another bathroom was slightly ajar finally coming back around to where they stood there was a comfortablelooking stuffed leather chair with matching ottoman another reading lamp and a bombay company lions claw table which seemed to double as a writing desk with its brass lamp large green blotter and ship in a bottle i like it hardy said i could use a room like this you dont feel it hardy took another second or two i dont feel anything abe except that this is a great room i want a room like this thats my point glitsky said every guy wants a room like this you know why this is a guys room he crossed to the closet and pulled aside one of the paneled doors hardy was a step behind him and found himself looking at several suits coats shirts a tie rack on the floor were a dozen or more pairs of shoes neatly arranged dress tennis sandals slippers glitsky nodded as though hed found what he expected he walked to the other end of the closet and slid that door back it was far less crowded glitsky started flicking the few hanging items aside two dresses three skirts and four sweaters he said then went into a squat reached around on the floor arranging three and a half pairs of womens shoes not to mention three more dresses on the floor how in the world did even carl miss this maybe he found something else that caught his attention and got him killed first glitsky stood slowly grimacing a hand on his back how do you get this old stubbornly refuse to die glitsky broke a small smile words to live by bathroom no thanks i just went the smile vanished as mysteriously as it had come hopeless abe said and pushed open the bathroom door compared to the spaciousness of the master bedroom it wasnt much more than a utilitarian closet six by eight feet with a doublehung window over a blue tiled sink a towel rack with one orange towel a toilet with the seat up significantly hardy thought there was no tub only a glassedin shower hardy reached around and opened the medicine cabinet which was nearly empty bottles of tylenol nyquil some bandaids razor blades lots of couples have different bathrooms happy ones dont have different bedrooms though glitsky replied ive done research its a true fact glitsky was moving again and hardy tagged along they passed back through rons room and stopped at the dresser which glitsky opened with the same basic results a few articles of womens underclothes in two of the drawers but four of the drawers out of six were packed even overpacked with rons clothes jeans junk polo shirts and tshirts sweaters socks and underwear when glitsky closed the last drawer he straightened up you know he said you could take a million pictures of this room and i bet the scene guys did and you wouldnt see any evidence of a crime i dont either so they lived in different rooms so what this to you isnt some evidence of marital conflict hardy shrugged it doesnt mean he killed her besides frannie said they were having troubles dont remind me it does make me wonder though he said just how she got pregnant immersed in paper at the desk in brees office glitsky was going through the hard copy file folder by folder propaganda by the armload on what hardy thought must be every imaginable side of the additive issue legislative reports news clippings executive summaries from various think tanks media alerts mtbe ethanol reformulated gasoline it ran the gamut from copies of faxed pages to fourcolor advertising pieces from page fragments to small booklets fascinating stuff glitsky said he was going fast to hardys eye ignoring everything that wasnt personal in brees personal files laying a slush pile of brees professional work on the desk to his right behind him hardy made some noise that might have sounded like asking for permission got a grunt in reply so grabbed a handful and walked out into the hallway where he folded it all up and tucked it inside his jacket he then returned to brees room further evidence that ron and bree had lived separate lives all right her bed was smaller a double it had a bright floral comforter and flounced pillows that matched even now a month after her death a womans scent of perfume and powder hung subtly in the air her bathroom was done in light salmon tones and was three times the size of rons with an oversized tub and makeup table as much a womans bathroom as rons was a mans back in the bedroom hardy stood at the bookshelves floortoceiling builtins that covered half the back wall possibly it shouldnt have surprised him after what hed heard about bree the ugly duckling from damon kerry but the entire bottom shelf was filled with paperback romance novels next up was a half shelf of paperback commercial fiction then a couple of shelves of hardbound literary fiction almost entirely by modern women writers toni morrison joyce carol gates barbara kingsolver laurie colwin amy tan a scientist with good literary taste hardy thought then a surprise what looked to be a full set of tony hillerman so chee and leaphorn had been in her consciousness too maybe helping to spark the idealism that had driven her so strongly in her last months on the top shelf though at the end of the large section on travel books next to a new copy of what to expect when you re expecting was the one hardy thought he recognized and knew he wanted he took the oversized book down and brought it over to the small reading chair next to the bed her high school yearbook passages from lincoln high in evanston illinois there were the usual autographs to the smartest girl in the world chemistry would have beat me without you who needs boys when youve got brains lab rats rule and then from one of her teachers the one hardy needed to bree brunetta my best student ever he quickly turned through the seniors and found her bree brunetta without the maiden name he never would have been able to find much less recognize the ravishing bree beaumont from the uninspired and formal capandgown photograph bree brunetta at seventeen had been slightly overweight with dark unkempt hair bangs down over her eyes braces clunky glasses the ugly duckling indeed hardy thought there was a recent picture of bree with the kids next to the bed and he looked at the smiling face with the shining blond hair the cheekbones the perfect mouth it was hard to reconcile the two images he flipped through the rest of the book quickly bree had been an active and seemingly wellrounded student a member of the debating society the science club the chess club she played clarinet in the band and was the features editor of the student newspaper she was voted the smartest girl hardy happened to notice one other detail one of those cruel highschool moments that scar a kid for life bree was voted least likely to get a date with scott lepine the most popular guy bestlooking guy and most likely to succeed whichever kids dreamed up that category must have thought it was hysterical hardy guessed bree wouldnt have thought so there were some letters on threering binder paper folded over in the back and he was just opening one when he heard glitskys steps coming quickly down the hallway he folded the letters back and put them with the literature into his inside pocket as well then he closed the book as glitsky appeared at the door to brees room his eyes had a haunted look i just got beeped ive got to go he said you mind if i stay behind a few minutes hardy asked sure no sweat just lock up when you leave glitsky shook his head get real diz were out of here were not arguing about it either ok or making one of our clever remarks he let out a long breath somebody just shot another cop the twoman arson team was still at his house when hardy drove up he parked semilegally and came up on to where the lawn had been before stopping to get their attention they were huddled over an area near what had been the front bay window how you guys doing they both looked over at him with no interest then held a quiet conference before one of them straightened up and jumped down on to the porchs foundation your friend said to tell you he went to work otherwise were going to be here a while you got any idea what a while is a flat glare hours not minutes this was pulling teeth but hardy needed to get some information you finding anything at this the arson investigator spread his hands in a futile gesture and hardy cut him off you cant tell me anything can you i might have done it right set fire to my own house people do it all the time hardy knew this was true the man was doing his job actually protecting hardys interests ok he managed to say mildly i was wondering though if i could go into the back and get a few things clothes toiletries like that check my phone messages in spite of what hed told valens hardy didnt think the answering machine in the kitchen had been destroyed driving over here it had occurred to him that it might be instructive to see what the tape held but to this inspector whether or not hardy had friends on the police force he was a righteous suspect he remained all business no sir im afraid not theres no electricity in any case i dont know if the captain made it clear to you but this house is fire department property until we clear it to you there was nothing to be gained from antagonizing the man although maintaining his demeanor took a serious coefficient of his resources he forced a patient smile no i understand that but id like to be able to make some plans can you give me any estimate how long that will be maybe hardy had worn the inspector down but it seemed for an instant as if there was a tiny thaw safest guess will be tomorrow morning sometime he paused maybe about the time your reporter friend runs his column no hardy realized it wasnt a thaw after all it was a way to tell him that jeff elliot had been by another unwelcome interruption to their task jeff had probably bothered them to distraction if we get done by dark well get it boarded up for the night somebodyll be here tomorrow to let you back in if were ready it was a dismissal there wasnt anything he could do on his private stool right up by the front window behind the bar at the little shamrock moses mcguire was nursing his sunday macallan on his private stool he allowed none of the other bartenders either to drink or to sit even for an instant when they were working his belief was that professional bartenders got paid to stand while they waited on customers it showed respect if they wanted to sit he invited them to come around to the bar side and take a short break at some risk to their job security but if they were behind the rail they stood and on either side of it during their hours of employ they were dry mcguire himself though as the owner could do any damn thing he wanted when he and hardy argued about the unfairness of how he applied his rules he would explode im a noble publican not some goddammed wageslave bartender and since mcguire owned threequarters of the place his word was the law hed carefully drawn hardy a tap guinness and brought it to the bar after the foam had settled out to a perfect head now hardy was down an inch or two into it the time was a bit after two and the fog wasnt going to burn off not today maybe not until christmas the trees at the edge of golden gate park no more than a hundred feet away directly across lincoln boulevard were barely visible three other customers quietly took up space in the oldest bar in san francisco on a couch in the dark far back an obviously smitten young couple was possibly engaging in some kind of discreet sex they had ordered old fashioneds the most froufrou drink that the purist mcguire allowed at the shamrock in the tiny side alcove a lone silent midthirties dart player with a shaved head and a camouflage jacket was working on his game drinking bushmills irish bass ale and a raw egg for protein out of a pint glass a year before moses had picked up some recently released recordings done in the thirties stephanie grappelli on violin and django reinhardt on guitar just swinging their brains out with the quintet of the hot club de france and whenever things were slow as they were today hed run them on the juke box mcguire twirled his glass around on the condensation ring that had formed on the bar youre welcome to come stay with us you know the lot of you thanks mose but erins already got the kids shes got a bigger place he twirled his glass some more and when is frannie out this was treacherous territory hardy couldnt tell moses that ron had released frannie from her promise without revealing that hed talked to him and that would in turn lead to the minefield of secrets none of which hardy could disclose and some of which he still after everything didnt know if he believed so he sipped guinness taking a minute my bet is that sharron pratt lets her go tuesday morning shes taking too much political flack why tuesday hardy explained a little about the difference between the judges contempt ruling and the grand jury contempt citation two different animals with similar names fortunately this seemed to satisfy moses but he twirled his glass a few more times and hardy knew him well enough he might have bought the latest explanation but there was more he needed to talk about so what are you thinking hardy prompted how to say it just say it thats all moses drank scotch put the glass down and looked his brotherinlaw in the eye ok hows it all turn to shit so fast hardy found some humor in the felicitous phrase that mcguire had been struggling to conjure the pickins were so slim in the rest of his life that he actually chuckled mcguires countenance took on a familiar dark tone the irish temper had always flared with the slightest friction it wasnt a joke hardy realized he must be on his third macallan after all not his second well he thought it had been stressful couple of days for him too i didnt think it was a joke mose its so true i wanted to cry so i laughed you hear what im saying moses sipped nodded an apology i mean one day shes taking the kids to school and baking cookies and next day bam he slapped the bar with his palm all of a sudden next day shes in jail and her house is burned down how does shit like this happen what could hardy say that frannie had taken a series of little steps secret steps that it wasnt really anything at all like all of a sudden and it wasnt only frannie either hardy had taken them too the tiny incremental steps away from intimacy more hed felt the shift in the bedrock of their marriage the first cracks in the faultline theyd allowed things to change with the pressures of raising the children the communication eroded their respective daily lives on different planets this is where it had gone wrong what had led them to here but he wasnt going to air all that now he lifted his glass and killed another inch of guinness i dont know mose i dont know mcguire leaned over the bar whispered tell me she isnt sleeping with him she says no hardy made eye contact she wouldnt do that she wouldnt he agreed quickly but the relief showed her brother at least believed it shed tell you first before anything happened even if she was only thinking about it thats who she is ok talking about it wasnt going to make it better or worse it was just going to invite other people to participate in the discussion and hardy wasnt doing that even with moses he and frannie might have their serious differences but they were as one in a way that made them aliens in the modern world they believed that their private lives were private but your house moses asked this morning you were saying it was part of this too part of who killed bree mose not part of me and frannie and youre close to finding that who did that if i am i dont know it but somebody must think so ive got to believe hitting my house was a warning to back off moses sipped his scotch then put it down carefully unless whoever it was thought you were home in which case it wasnt just a warning hardy considered for a beat no i doubt that im not that much of a threat he shook his head the idea rattling around i dont think so he repeated more to himself than to moses well you dont have to think it for it to be true if i were you id put it in the mix what exactly that somebodys trying to kill you on that cheery note the front door banged open and a mixed sixpack of humanity flowed in talking football calling for beer moses shrugged at hardy gave them a welcome and headed down the rail for the taps it was a signal for hardy that he didnt want to waste any more time philosophizing with his brotherinlaw moses was right there was far too much he didnt know he was vulnerable and couldnt allow himself the luxury of letting his guard down so with neither plan nor destination hardy left twothirds of his guinness hed parked around the corner on th avenue and pushed himself through the fog hunched against the wind getting in behind the wheel he hesitated before turning the key then broke a thin smile as the engine turned over see no bomb flicking the heater up to high he pulled out got to the corner and turned right he had no idea where he was going all he knew was that the little shamrock wasnt anywhere he needed to be just now he needed to work time was running out he couldnt go back to his house the fire department owned it there were still his children and frannie but hed already seen them today that would have to be enough where the hell was ron beaumont or phil canetta what did he have what could he work with the only thing that came remotely to mind was his paperwork the lawyers constant companion and last refuge at his office he had his copies of pages from carl griffins file the notes hed taken last night with canetta the propaganda hed liberated from brees office and the letters from her high school yearbook at some point he reasoned some part of all of that might intersect david freeman believed that lawyers should work around the clock he had had full bathrooms installed on each of the three floors of his building so that his associates would not be able to use the lame excuse after an allnighter that they had to go home to freshen up and get ready for court in twentyfive minutes hardy was in his office showered shaved and changed into the shirt that hed stashed in his file cabinet a couple of months before when he got seated at his desk he retrieved the four messages hed received since last night hoping against hope that one of them would turn out to be from canetta or even ron beaumont if al valens had left a message hardy hadnt been able to get back at his home then maybe either or both of the men he wanted to talk to had tried as well or called here at his office afterwards but no such luck three of the calls were from clients in various stages of feeling abandoned and the last was jeff elliot when hardy called him back he was himself on fire over the blaze at hardys house although he did pay a fleeting moments lip service to sympathy for hardys loss is there anything i can do to help you diz you got a place to stay yeah were covered jeff thanks though but back to the scoop and you think it was arson id bet a lot on it in fact i wouldnt rule out that its the mtbe people the valdez avengers all those jerks if thats true jeff said his enthusiasm overflowing its a giant break in that story thats my goal hardy said drily sacrifice my home for a good story maybe youll win the pulitzer and ill be happy for you we can have a party in my new house elliot apologized i didnt mean it like that diz he paused but dont you want to get whoever did this take em down you dont know i bet i do all im saying is here maybe weve got a real connection between who thats what i think i have diz do you want to hear it talk hardy said ok after you left yesterday i went with what you said the guy from caloco jim pierce yeah all right pierce hed told you that sko funded these cretins right right well what if that were true where was the connection so i started poking through among all the crap i showed you yesterday that thick file of paper and realized that a lot of the proethanol stuff comes from this organization named the fuels management consortium fmc for short its here in town familiar no but this stuff wasnt my major until a couple of days ago i thought fmc made tanks and stuff big equipment same letters different company ok go on well fmc produces proethanol antimtbe press releases tons of them sometimes the source of them is a little hard like impossible to recognize because they get picked up by intermediaries syndicated as hard news stories in the dailies also in industry publications the health industry newsletter environmental health monthly like that so i never put it together that it might be one source and then you did right plus every time some more mtbe leaks into another well we get the update before the inks dry on the epa report im listening ok so a few months ago we the chronicle we decided to do a big spread on the dangers of mtbe i mean this was a fourday frontpage feature lots of scary stuff cancer clusters birth defects the usual even a lay person such as yourself might remember it vaguely well kerry had just taken the primary and suddenly this was news and we ran it anyway the reporter who wrote the article as it happens is a friend of mine named sherry weir she shows up in the office last night on this water temple poisoning as im thinking about our discussion yours and mine she tells me that fmc was the prime source for her feature its an impressive propaganda factory so yesterday when sherry hears about the pulgas temple her first stop on the way to the office is the fmc offices in the embarcadero buildings ok she knows its saturday afternoon theyre probably closed up but its a shot and what does she find an armed nuclear weapon she finds that nobodys there all right but out in the hallway for pickup is the days press releases bound and labeled for distribution all about the water poisoning doomsday in san francisco sidebars on the dangers of mtbe pollution like that anyway she pulls a few off the top of the pile and brings them back for her article a beat get it im not sure jeffs voice went down to an excited whisper but it rang with triumph they had to be written and printed up before it happened hardy took a moment to let it sink in if this were true it appeared to link some of the ecoterrorist activity with fmc but not necessarily to sko and certainly not to valens or kerry how could it help him but jeff thought he had the answer to that too because fmc is run by this joker named baxter thorne who works for sko hardy guessed youre too smart except not so fast red rider back when she interviewed him sherry couldnt get thorne to admit who paid him he calls himself a public affairs consultant according to him he represents all kinds of environmental groups and other clients but says his contracts demand confidentiality she asks him specifically about some of these activist groups and he admits hes given them some advice advice thats a nice word i thought so too but even nicer is this i call this buddy of mine a colleague in cincinnati at the sentinel youve been a busy boy jeff this could in fact be my pulitzer diz youd be busy too turns out that baxter thorne is not unknown in cincinnati it wasnt exactly common knowledge but my buddy knew for years thorne was the dirty tricks guy for ellis jackson who is youre going to love this jackson is the ceo of spader krutch ohio hardy felt a little tingle along the back of his neck and knew it wasnt the cold outside leaking through his office window jeff was going on so weve possibly got sko paying for dirty tricks in san francisco weve got somebody who might put mtbe in the water might kill bree beaumont might burn my house down hardy added evenly that too jeff agreed but what we dont have and we do need is how if were on the right track baxter thorne came to be worried about you somebody told him im with you but who hardy wracked his brain trying to keep himself from the kneejerk reaction for the second time today that it had to be valens but it might go higher hardy couldnt rule out that a directive could have come from damon kerry himself although jeff elliot wasnt going to accept that but why stop with kerry the connection between sko and him might even be phil canetta cops who worked freelance security at conventions had also been known to provide muscle to help with dirty tricks had canetta ever done that kind of work with sko he wondered or with baxter thorne i really dont have any ideas jeff he said other than id like a few private moments with this thorne fellow did you talk to al valens this morning by the way jeff asked at the clift since you woke me up for it didnt i tell you all about that he heard jeff sigh no i think you left it out and suddenly the mornings information clicked with what he had just learned from jeff brees report she had changed her mind about ethanol and valens had tried successfully he said to keep her from talking to kerry about it who would this silence benefit even more than kerry himself sko and skos operative in san francisco baxter thorne what if valens efforts to keep bree quiet hadnt worked after all what if someone needed to shut her up valens again once removed maybe but hardy didnt want to lead jeff elliot there he had his own agenda and he figured hed sure as hell earned the right to pursue it now i thought hed told me a lie hardy said mildly and i wanted to talk to him about it and had he it was more a misunderstanding it got straightened out deflection time you ever catch up with kerry todays agenda jeff promised if i get to it what would stop you one of the problems doing a daily column jeff said is youve got to write it kerrys going to be impossible until tuesday tomorrow im going for thorne how are you going to get to him hardy would bet jeffs eyes werent tired now he was on a scent a little classic bait and switch ive put in a call to fmc that id like an interview on the pulgas story which hell want to talk about once im in the door ill ask different questions he changed his tone i think were very close diz really i hope so hardy said but do me one favor would you whats that dont go alone after they hung up hardy immediately put in a call to glitskys pager jeff elliot might hate him for it but from hardys perspective this was now a police matter and thats where it was going in fact even without bree beaumont the case could be made that the arson at hardys house if it had been started by the same people who dumped the mtbe was related to a san francisco homicide and therefore in glitskys domain even though the pulgas water temple was in san mateo county it was city property and glitsky could assert at least dual jurisdiction he had authority to investigate the death of the middleaged hiker whod been killed there yesterday and now with the new information hardy could supply from his talk with jeff elliot that investigation might lead him to baxter thorne and perhaps all the way back to bree waiting for glitskys call he got up from the desk stretched and came around front to throw a round of darts but he didnt retrieve any of them instead he walked to the window and looked down on to sutter street then returned to his chair and pulled his collections of paper up closer to him now that he knew he was looking for something specific evidence of any relationship between fmc and bree he thought he might have a better chance of seeing it but the telephone rang yo get a earphone some kind of beeper something would you ive been calling all over town trying to run you down ive been here at my office and i called you remember yeah well i couldnt imagine youd be working on a sunday so i didnt think of there hardy ignored the bad attitude abe had gone to a murder scene and had spent the last several hours there it was understandable that he was in a surly mood ok so now were talking you interested in what i called about you will be not as much as why i want to talk to you glitskys tone wasnt getting any better what hardy asked the cop who got shot it suddenly hit him if glitsky needed to reach him on that matter there could only be one reason his stomach went hollow in a rash phil canetta his friends voice was grim you heard it here first where are you glitsky told him hardy was in the muir loop just inside the presidio hed driven through the urban forest many times before and in his memory it was serene and lovely a twolane road overhung with boughs winding through an expansive eucalyptus glade but today in the late afternoon it seemed that menace dripped from every branch with the dense fog visibility was no greater than fifty feet he crept along at fifteen miles per hour squinting into the nothingness there were no curbs on the street here no street lights and twice he felt his tires leave the asphalt at last hardy got a glimpse of some parked vehicles and slowed down even more with the fog the scene was etched in stark relief the outlines of three squad cars a couple of vans some news trucks by now the unmarked cars of inspectors he pulled in behind the line of them zipped up his jacket and tried to pick glitsky out of the milling group of spectral figures the lieutenant was at the back door of one of the vans and as he got closer hardy recognized glitskys companion john strout the lanky drawling coroner for the city and county he was nearly on them before glitsky noticed john you know dismas hardy sure do strout had worked with hardy before and testified at several of his trials that hardy was now a defense attorney made it odd that he was at this crime scene at this stage but strout had been around the block many times and very little surprised him how you doin diz he extended his hand and hardy took it ive been better hardy admitted its been a long day strout was his usual laconic self wish i could say the same for our victim here his day only lasted a couple of hours i reckon given the choice id go for long yeah well glitsky jerked a thumb hardys house caught fire this morning not by itself hardy said sharply strout caught something between the two men there some connection with that and this glitsky gave hardy a shutup look and said he wouldnt rule it out there was some possibility but they had a ways to go on this one first on phil canetta he didnt want to jump to conclusions hardy got glitskys message the relationship between canettas murder and brees to say nothing of hardys house wasnt going to be part of the public debate not yet it was not even immediately clear that glitsky was overtly officially pursuing the griffin parallels so what did go down here hardy asked strout took his boot off the vans bumper looked across the street said reckon theyre close enough and headed out hardy and glitsky followed the car had all four of its doors open strout walked around off the fringe of the road to the drivers door but glitsky touched hardys arm and the two of them stayed in the street on the passenger side they could see inside clearly enough in any event and just as clearly glitsky wanted a private ear but the first sight of canetta was more bad news he was dressed as hed been at freemans last night the last time hardy had seen him there was no way now that hardy could pretend that his relationship to canetta wasnt relevant to glitskys investigation and that in turn was going to have to lead to further revelations none of them even remotely pleasant the body was slumped against the back of the seat canted slightly to its left strout spoke in the professorial drawl he adopted when reciting undisputed facts on the witness stand today though hardy found the impersonal tone unsettling you can see if you lift that right arm he was doing it rigors let up enough now that the second bullet the second bullet hardy asked quietly glitsky nodded grimly he wasnt shot here first one was in the chest he was facing the shooter hardy heard strout over their conversation probably fragmented into some ribs and ripped the heart into pieces he shut that out and went back to abe so youre saying he was carried into the car and driven here and pushed over to make it look like he drove out on his own im not just saying it thats what happened but why would somebody because this is what griffin looked like and they got away with that turned out id say it was a bad idea hardy agreed it connects them a nod not only that my guess is canetta was shot with griffins gun strout continued time of death but hes loosened up enough it had to be ten hours ago maybe longer so who found him couple of joggers and strouts saying you just heard late night early morning the second shots in a closed car pea soup outside nobody heard a thing before hardy could ask glitsky expanded on it i know what youre going to say but dont this damn sure couldve been ron well get to that he held up a hand stopping hardys reply but because i like to be thorough i also put batavia and coleman out on alibis for all of your own personal heroes pierce valens even kerry were talking between two and six am but guess what they werent all home in bed glitskys mouth turned up but it wasnt a smile insight like that is what keeps us friends maybe they were but we havent been able to reach any of them pierce wasnt around today his wife said he was out on his boat from early this morning also weve got kerrys schedule but hes not sticking to it he and valens didnt make his first banquet two days from the election hes in flex mode i guess valens hardy had to cut in valens was at kerrys until nearly midnight after that kerry left home how do you know that jeff elliot where did he go only the shadow knows but he lives like five blocks from here and while were on it pierce isnt much further and all of its downhill glitsky was silent for a couple of seconds i see youve done your homework how do you know all this hell any of it im motivated i talked to valens this morning when was that i was with you half the morning must have been the other half he knew glitsky wouldnt let it go so he continued it had to do with my house valens had something to do with your house strout finished his monologue and straightened up looking over the cars roof this boys been sittin here in the cold long enough abe you needin anything else here glitsky shifted his attention to the coroner not me john he replied if crime scenes done you can tag him and bag him strout took a last look into the car at the body of phil canetta and clucked sympathetically again he straightened up scene calls i hate em yknow that they aint medicine out here are they it aint just a stripped body with something to tell you there wasnt anything to say to that everybody there felt the same thing to a greater or lesser degree glitsky gave strout a gentle slap on the shoulders as he passed then he walked a few paces back to where the head of his crime scene unit was huddling with a couple of his team hardy heard him say if theres enough lead left get ballistics to check it against the slug that went through griffin im betting its the same gun a short discussion ensued after which glitsky returned to hardy valens this morning jeff elliot bet you thought id get sidetracked didnt you never crossed my mind hardy said i know weve got to talk but maybe someplace else hands in his pockets the lieutenant took in the gloom around them the body was on the coroners gurney and the tow truck started its mechanical cranking getting ready to lift canettas car and take it to the police lot hunching his shoulders glitsky gave a last shudder against the cold good call he said in one of his brothers old rooms down the hall that led off the back of the kitchen orel glitsky was sprawled on the floor watching television and doing homework rita was with him reading her spanish radio station playing softly on the end table next to where she sat on the sofa hardy at his heels glitsky checked in with his household letting them know that he was home now sorry hed been out most of the day glad to see everybody was doing fine rita looked up from her book and told him shed heated up some tortilla pie for a snack and it was probably still warm in the oven glitsky got orels attention finally and asked his son how his day had gone he got a nod though his boys eyes never left the tv ok what time did your grandfather go home a shrug i dont know a little after twelve rita said when i got here no one was trying to hide any displeasure about glitskys working on a sunday after having dumped orel on his grandfather the day before so anything neat happen today you guys do anything fun rita just looked at him orel the boy shrugged not much glitsky stood a moment longer in the doorway then sighed heavily and headed back down the hallway so glad i asked he muttered it was only a few steps to the kitchen where they closed the door behind them against the competing sounds glitsky pulled around a chair and straddled it backwards they think i want to be gone working all weekend they think going to murder scenes is my idea of a good time hardy let him stew since there was no answer anyway sometimes people had to work a bitch but there it was his kids hadnt understood that he couldnt go trick or treating last night now it was abes turn to deal with it he grabbed a kitchen towel opened the oven and pulled out the flat pan that held the remains of the pie hardy grabbed plates from a cupboard put them down on the table and started serving himself what i dont understand he said is how they can sit there and read and study and listen to music and watch tv all at once i cant think with all that other noise going on glitsky turned his chair around the normal way and pulled the pan over thats because youre over forty nowadays they teach that stuff in school multitasking makes you a better person more productive he spooned out some food on to his plate and pushed it around a little its just one of the reasons the world is so much better now than it was when we were kids he forked a bite and popped it so you want to just start or would you prefer that i ask questions dark slammed down like a trap door an hour later hardy was in the trampeddown mud behind his house out here closer to the ocean a fine drizzle had started to condense out of the fog in the brisk chill wind he was impressed by how much the moisture added to the already substantial pleasures of the evening up the backyard stairway still outside he turned his key in the back door and somewhat to his surprise it opened he fully expected that the fire departments security team would have provided their own locks for the various entrances but though theyd tightly boarded up the front and posted the property with no trespassing signs that seemed to be the extent of it so he was inside from the lower shelf on his workbench he grabbed a flashlight and passed on into his kitchen he didnt need the flashlight yet the distances and angles were all second nature he checked around there was no dial tone on the wall telephone no light in the refrigerator when he pulled it open the neatly folded heavy brownpaper shopping bags were where they always were in the drawer at the bottom of the pantry he grabbed one off the top in his bedroom he risked a short beam his tropical fish seventeen of them a collection that hed nurtured through various permutations over twenty years were all belly up on the surface of his aquarium a muscle worked in his jaw he turned off the flashlight and crossed the room the answering machine was on a small reading table he unplugged it from the wall disconnected the telephone jack and placed it in the bottom of the paper bag on a corner of the bed next was his dresser he threw in underwear and a couple of sweaters on top of the answering machine in his closet he gathered up a heavy jacket a business suit and some shirts all of them smelling of smoke a complete change of clothes for his wife too for when he got her out something in him wished he didnt need to do it but he knew he had to leaving everything on the bed he walked back up through the kitchen into the burntout front of the house and stood in the middle of what used to be his dining room hed once represented a plaintiff who had suffered severe burns in an industrial accident he remembered preparing the expert he was going to put on whod defined the various degrees of burn first a sunburn second a blister or the worst thirddegree burns causing irreparable loss of skin and terrible disfigurement any serious percentage of thirddegree burns over the body was most often fatal but what he felt now seemed even worse a fourthdegree burn to the core of him one that charred the edges of his soul after a time he moved again back through the kitchen to the bedroom for the things hed left there he picked up the bag by its paper handles the clothes by their hangers at his workbench he carefully replaced the flashlight then let himself back out into the awful awful night hardy left his bag of clothes in the car but brought the answering machine up to his office where he plugged it in and found that al valens was at least not lying all the time he was the first message just what hed said the second one stunned him no name but immediately recognizable im sorry to have moved out of the hotel i hope i havent caused you too much inconvenience hardy almost laughed out loud not too much inconvenience indeed the only answer is that ive got to be very cautious i know you will understand if you could get to me so easily so could the police they might have been following you the next time you came down i dont know the point is i felt like i had to relocate but i wanted you to know im still near by and appreciate what youre doing but very nervous about you coming to me i hope youre having some luck thanks sure no problem hardy said then punched at the answering machines button sat back in his chair and tried to gather some thoughts but it was all a jumble just today his house had been burned canetta had been killed hed been running since first light and had one day left to discover any useful truth he glanced up at his dart board on the wall around his desk he didnt remember throwing them but his three custommade darts were stuck haphazardly around the board he forced himself up around the desk and flicked on the bright room overheads the darts were his worry beads and he pulled them from the board walked back to the tape line hed marked on the floor at eight feet turned and threw the first one triple twenty a good start he threw the second dart then the third walked to the board pulled them down and returned to his mark if ron hadnt left town what did that mean the kind reading was to take him at his word he was cautious nervous paranoid all of these things certainly understandable he wanted to be near by in case as did not appear very likely now hardy succeeded in exposing brees killer if that happened he and his children could return to their lives and from what had already happened to the other principles in this drama ron was right to be worried but as hardy threw his darts a more sinister interpretation kept wanting to surface and he had a difficult time keeping it down ron was still near by close enough to set fire to hardys house close enough to kill canetta if hed only left a phone number on hardys machine surely there was no danger in that then he could answer some of the questions that were fogging hardys consciousness what was the truth for example about ron and brees marriage the separate bedrooms the infidelity ron might be a miracle of a father but he wasnt the same as a husband this was not the happy couple they pretended to be at the very least bree was having an affair with damon kerry and she had become pregnant apparently by him although hardy felt he couldnt rule out canetta or even pierce and if the father was anyone but ron this was a motive for murder for ron to kill beyond that if bree were habitually unfaithful might that mean with ron hardy tried to shut out the thought but finally it couldnt be dismissed any longer of course it could mean frannie although finally today she had told him no it hadnt been like that or had she like what exactly he hadnt crossexamined her he hadnt had the heart and why would he be fool enough to believe her in any event freemans words from last nights conversation echoed and picked at him hardy and glitsky believing that carl griffin had gone to interview a snitch because he had said so when in fact thats not what hed done in fact griffin had lied to his boss and for a lot less reason than frannie had nothing but the truth was a noble courtroom concept but hardy knew from a lifetime of trials that even there it was systematically abused and in life it was much worse but he stopped himself before going too far down this road frannie wasnt just another random person she was the mother of his children the wife hed promised to love honor and respect and if those three did not include trust a basic belief not only in her honesty but in who she was he was lost anyway frannie had told him clearly she had been attracted to ron but had remained faithful to him ron was a good friend but thats all shed let it be hardy really had no choice but to believe her to take it on faith she was telling him the truth and that was the only truth he could let himself act on to do less would betray both of them itwas sunday night and glitsky hadnt spent enough time at home this weekend he had a feeling he wasnt going to anytime soon either in his job once in a very great while he called in a favor three years before glitsky had spoken up in defense of paul ghattas on one of the dozens of eeo lawsuits that were forever being filed among and between workers in the hall of justice ghattas a lab tech whose first language was tagalog had made a comment to one of his female coworkers that she had interpreted as sexual harassment the two had been discussing the location of a stab wound and ghattas had fumbled with language for a moment then used the word tit rather than breast glitsky had been in the lab at the time waiting for results on another case and had been the only witness hearing the whole thing including ghattas abject apology afterward the woman had screamed dont you piss on my leg and tell me its raining and run out of the room before ghattas comment the lab setting had been professional and neutral but the woman had been offended to the point of being unable to continue coming to work for the following ten days then shed filed her suit which it turned out had not been her first she wanted paul ghattas a tenyear veteran and father of four dismissed she wanted full pay for days missed she wanted disability for the six months she estimated it would take her to get over the emotional trauma shed had to endure glitsky had worked with ghattas many times the mans english was poor but he was a competent workhorse in the lab so realizing even at the time that he was wading into troubled waters glitsky had stood up for him at the hearing where against all odds in an environment where to be accused was to be guilty ghattas was exonerated so paul was happy to accompany abe to the hall at seven this sunday night glitsky left him downstairs at the lab then went up to his office checking damon kerrys fingerprints against all the others found at brees apartment was going to take ghattas some time and glitsky had a slew of his own work now to move on the litany of information that hardy had recited earlier in the evening had been deeply disturbing mostly because glitsky hadnt known any of it and as head of homicide to say nothing of being hardys best friend he should have batavia and coleman werent brain dead by any means and yet somehow between them theyd missed getting any kind of a toehold in this case he was half tempted to arrest hardy for what hed withheld from him just on general principles for not mentioning diddly squat about what hed found what he had been doing like he had been working with canetta hed made the connection to griffin hed talked with valens this morning when neither of glitskys inspectors could locate the campaign manager now he had baxter thorne who had possibly been at least the brains behind dumping the mtbe into the crystal springs reservoir and more relevantly had killed a man in glitskys jurisdiction in the process but for all hardy did know glitsky realized he had a blind spot and that was ron beaumont it was a common truth in homicide that the spouse did it and in spite of all the activity surrounding brees oil interests ron still looked pretty good to glitsky he had fled the scene using multiple identities judging from the bedrooms in the penthouse he and bree hadnt been intimate recently and since she was pregnant this provided a pretty solid motive glitsky hated to give the da the satisfaction but he could no longer ignore ron as a suspect in fact from his perspective the best suspect abruptly he sat up in his chair coming to the unpleasant realization that his friend was still holding out on him otherwise ron would be on hardys own short list too he would have to be therefore hardy knew something more and he wasnt telling he hadnt told glitsky even as he had pretended to bare his soul a couple of hours before when theyd planned to meet again down here when hardy got his belongings together now glitsky was in a slow burn thinking that by god friend or no friend he should arrest the duplicitous bastard when he got back down here after all he started punching hardys office number into his desk phone give him an earful if he was still there but he heard footsteps out in the hallway and stopped replacing the receiver a minute later inspector leon timms the crime scene specialist from canettas murder was in his doorway you asked me to put a rush on the ballistics check abe can you believe it theres somebody in at the lab paul ghattas abe replied i dragged him down from his house fingerprints fingerprints in spite of their exalted presence in books and movies timms knew that in real life fingerprints were rarely a factor in police work but he merely shrugged if the lieutenant wanted to check prints he was welcome to he ran the ballistics for me the guys a oneman shop down there this was good to hear about a man whose job he had saved but glitsky had his sights elsewhere so what did he find timms nodded same shooter griffins gun for sure when hardy arrived he was happy but not surprised to learn that glitskys surmise about griffins gun was correct he wasnt as happy when his friend got up closed the door to his office and asked him what he knew about ron beaumont that he wasnt telling what do you mean but that effort at deflection went about as far as hardy had imagined it would nowhere glitsky was propped on the corner of his own desk hovering a foot or two over where hardy sat in his hard chair pressed back against the office wall as glitsky intended this posture made hardy uncomfortable what do i mean he repeated with an edge lets see if i can explain it you know the whereabouts and most of the life history of everybody whos even remotely involved in the death of bree beaumont you discover that carl griffins death is probably connected too and today canetta makes that pretty much a certainty weve got four or five suspects and no righteous alibis for any of them but you dont appear to have any suspicion at all about the one i feel the best about if youre keeping score here that would be ron glitsky had his arms folded his game face on and it wasnt any kind of an act the eyes were unyielding he wasnt going to be breaking out the peanuts in his desk drawer for a little philosophical chat hardy sucked air and held it in then let it out in a rush you wont like it i didnt expect i would glitsky waited through another pause im in this for his kids the eyes so lately flat narrowed glitskys nose flared and the scar in his lips went white he took a breath or two and when he finally spoke it was in a terrifyingly controlled voice youve seen him youre representing him hardy knew that any attempt to finesse this would only infuriate abe more ive seen him once friday night before things had gotten anywhere near here so where was this the airport hilton so he was leaving town has he left no neither he was ready to if he had to that was all that was all thats nice and then somehow you decided it wasnt important to let me know about any of this no i never made that decision you were specifically not looking for ron at that point well i am now where is he i dont know my ass hardy shrugged im not lying to you i havent ever lied to you abe ive omitted what you didnt need to know well thank you so much glitsky made a face of disgust his voice now rising in indignation how about if thats not your decision to make how about if its my job to do this not some hobby i can pick up and lay down when the mood strikes me that ever occur to you diz you ever think about any of this but hardy wasnt about to go begging for mercy or forgiveness hed done what he felt hed had to do he believed it was defensible look ron called me last night the answering machine is still in my office with the message on it you can come listen to it anytime you want i dont know where he is or how to reach him and it pisses me off just a bit myself but its not your job diz dont kid yourself abe its a hell of a lot more than my job first its my wife then my house next its maybe me my life if i had even the smallest suspicion any of this was ron you think id gamble all of that you dont think id give him up to you hell id lead the parade not if he was your client hardy lowered his own voice hes not it abe youve known that all along you go after him youre barking up the wrong tree yeah but thats what i do bark up trees things fall out i pick em up and maybe it points me to another one maybe it doesnt hardy came forward in his chair there isnt time abe glitsky glared very little of the fury gone after a couple of seconds he stood up walked back to the door opened it and left the room he was standing at the back windows of the homicide detail arms folded looking out through the black fog to the jail across the way hardy came out of abes office and walked up behind his friend ill tell you everything i can he said to his back but theres some things i cant glitsky didnt turn ron has a situation that makes it awkward for him to get formally involved with the law or the courts if he gets in the system his kids suffer thats why frannie couldnt give him up its what she couldnt talk about you heard what the supe in his building said abe the guys a good father like you and me right still no answer but hardy noticed that glitskys shoulders rose and fell he was listening i know i know why didnt i tell you sooner whyd i do things with canetta i dont know i didnt know i was trying to figure it out if its any help i paid my dues around it wouldnt you say and the bottom line is ron didnt kill bree finally the lieutenant half turned except if he did he said he didnt glitsky was a statue they both became aware of footfalls in the hallway moving fast hardy turned just as an excited asian man appeared in the doorway he was slightly out of breath and tried to compose himself in the few steps over to them one of last ones i try abe sorry but it match up you got a match yeah same as on glass whoever that was from the prints in the penthouse ghattas nodded and nodded definite sure hardy spoke up kerry ghattas looked at him then to glitsky for permission the lieutenant nodded looks like what is that ghattas asked the damon kerry glitsky nodded if youre sure about the glass he was at bree beaumonts and said he wasnt oh definite sure then it was kerry well shit ghattas responded very shit my thought exactly paul good work and thanks for coming down tonight it was a big help you need a lift home no i call my wife ten minutes shes here he nodded and was gone silence reigned again and hardy waited glitsky chewed the inside of his cheek youre probably remembering right now that it was me who picked up that glass hardy said jim pierce sat in the pilots seat on the flying bridge of his yacht bundled against the weather he was drinking rum neat from a metal cup and sucking on the butt of a partagas cigar the craft was plugged into the marinas power source and he had the small television going although he wasnt faced toward it it was background noise that was all laugh track a brisk sea wind carried a load of wetness in through the open windshield he felt a movement in the boat but didnt turn do you know what time it is his wife was a vision as usual even more so now as she was flushed from the cold and the slight exertion to get out to the boat her hair had gathered the fine drizzle and backlit turned it into a halo i would guess around nine oclock he said evenly what were you waiting for out here you to come and get me and look now you have the police have been around again well when it rains it pours what did they want this time theres been another murder apparently a policeman and they came to see me apparently he was related somehow to bree finally he met his wifes eyes well im not related to bree he took a pull of his liquor dont get hostile with me jim please where have you been he kept looking at her right here he said i told you waiting for you to come and get me and you came down here last night he nodded you werent home from your party i got stir crazy what did they want she threw a glance behind her as if worried that someone would hear then back to him they wanted to know where you were i told them didnt they come by here he pointed with his cigar in the direction of the water i was out in this fog he shrugged living dangerously what difference does it make so what did you do all day i was home until noon waiting for you to get back then i had lunch with my mother and brother then there was the library do the sponsors dinner jim pierce slapped at his forehead in mock consternation that was tonight and i missed it he tossed her a dismissive look see he said you had a fine time without me everyone wondered where you were they said they missed you im sure they did and i them she had her arms crossed and now leaned back against the railing i dont know why youre so cruel jim i dont know when that started he took a beat carefully lifted his metal cup and took a slow sip oh i think you can figure it out you get rejected enough it makes you bitter some people they get bitter they take it out by being cruel i never rejected you a stab of staccato laughter no he thought you just made it impossible to ask anymore but he said thats right it was me a long dead silence one of the channel buoys at the mouth of the marina chimed deeply followed almost immediately by the forlorn moan of a foghorn jim pierce tossed his cigar butt into the bay and reached over to flick off the television his wife looked as though she were waiting for him to say something so he obliged her it doesnt matter he said nothing matters you cant do this valens was actually near to screaming he had pulled damon kerry out on to the roof of whatever goddam hotel they were in after his talk to whatever goddam group it was you cant do this with two days to go youre alienating people dont you understand and you cant do that and win im being myself kerry said ive never lost an election and ive been myself in each one yeah but damon youve never run for governor before this is not a city supervisor job this is high office and thats why im on board remember i do this i keep candidates from being themselves especially with fortyeight hours to go ill tell you what you want to be yourself be yourself on wednesday he paced off a few steps and swore succinctly kerry came up behind him i am not alienating my electorate im trying to reach people to tell the truth people respond to that to me no valens said he turned around despising the law of politics that the tall guy always wins kerry had him by half a foot and this close valens had to look up at him but he was going to say his piece uphill downhill sideways and kerry was going to have to hear no no no listen to me carefully you are not trying to reach people or tell the truth or be yourself or any of that you are trying to get yourself elected thats all youre trying to do right now and were running behind all day missing meetings youre deviating from the script theres no script theres no damon the script is all thats left at this point repeat repeat repeat smile smile smile and keep moving keep moving dont miss an opportunity to repeat repeat repeat except we missed a few this morning didnt we al and why was that because you were late picking me up you overslept damon i depend on you al i was exhausted and im getting sick and what about you the job of the campaign manager is get the candidate where he needs to be thats what he does he doesnt keep the candidate from being himself he put a couple of fingers up to his forehead i really am getting sick he said ive been sick for weeks valens was at the edge of the roof below him he was aware of the gauzy glow of the citys lights through the fog hed been in similar situations in nearly every election with which hed been involved the schoolgirl squabbling during the last leg of a campaign damon kerry undoubtedly was feeling sick and valens didnt really blame him the pace was grueling the pressures unrelenting valens might be frustrated and worried in his own right but for the sake of the election it was time to calm the waters damon he said gently weve got one more day and tomorrow starts early why dont we get you back home to get a good nights rest if you can were close now we can still pull this out its not just the election kerry was shaking his head you dont know al yes i do damon i really do and what i know is that it is just the election but kerry wasnt on that page all i know is that if i hadnt started down this path bree would still be alive if she hadnt he trailed off but they had covered this ground a hundred times most often late at night when kerrys defenses were down valens laid an avuncular hand up on his candidates shoulder she did though he patted the shoulder gently to demonstrate his commiseration lets get you home get some rest he said itll look better in the morning thorne was at the kitchen table in his apartment halfway up nob hill putting the finishing touches on a memorandum hed print up tomorrow regarding the oil companies ten point eight million dollars in contributions to the countrys political campaigns this year in the memo he noted that damon kerry had not accepted one dime from this source thorne thought that if he got the news release distributed early enough in the day it would certainly get into some of tuesdays papers perhaps before many people had gone to the polls and might even make a few latebreaking news shows looking for a filler by tomorrow night every little bit helped he believed especially in light of the continuing mtbe poisoning story which was gratifyingly ubiquitous kerrys opposition to big oil was going to play very well possibly right up through election day he proofread his final copy then placed the papers in his briefcase opened a cold beer and poured it into a chilled pilsner glass then he went into his living room and turned on the television the late evening news didnt let him down it led off with the continuing followup on the pulgas water temple story the water district had taken samples in the citys drinking water and found levels of mtbe that were lower than the epa standards and so technically safe but the levels were still deemed detectable and residents were advised to use caution thorne smiled at the language and at the hysterical reaction of the public that the media play nearly guaranteed mtbe was bad stuff all right an aspirins worth in an olympicsized swimming pool was toxic but ten or fifteen gallons in a reservoir the size of crystal springs wasnt going to make anybody sick not immediately anyway nevertheless over thirty people had sought medical attention in emergency rooms all over the city after drinking the water yesterday and this morning onthestreet interviews indicated that nearly everyone tasted something funny in the water a turpentine taste thorne had made a point of drinking a few glasses in the course of the day and had tasted nothing there was a nice clip of several dozen dead trout floating near the dump spot the location of this school of fish where the concentration of mtbe was several million times greater than it was at the pumping station for the citys water supply was simple luck but thorne found it particularly pleasing it gave the impression that the whole lake had been polluted kerry got a couple of great sound bites calling for an immediate moratorium on mtbe use and this was echoed by one of the states senators and the mayor god bless him who had even gone further there is no reason to tolerate even for one more moment this dangerous and insoluble toxin in our gasoline where there is an environmentally safe and effective substitute so readily available and by this i mean ethanol kerrys opponent by contrast spoke from a location in orange county and sounded to thorne like an idiot it is not mtbe that has caused this terrible crisis any more than it is guns that kill people people kill people and people criminals have poisoned the san francisco water supply gasoline without any additives would have produced the same effect and no one is talking about making gasoline illegal police had no clues as to the identity of the individuals or the location of the headquarters of the clean earth alliance who claimed responsibility for the act although when found they would be charged with the murder of yearold thorne hit the mute button sat back and enjoyed a sip of his beer all in all he had to consider this a resounding triumph there was of course no clean earth alliance his operatives had scattered to the four winds life was good but his smile faded with the new image on the screen the house and he reached again for the remote bringing up the sound determined that the cause of the fire was arson the serious male anchor nodded sagely what makes this so interesting karen is that this house was the home of frannie hardy wasnt it the woman who is still in jail for refusing to testify regarding the husband of bree beaumont the expert on gasoline additives who was murdered nearly a month ago thats right bill the camera closed in on karen its hard to believe that there is no connection whatever between bree beaumonts murder the mtbe poisoning at the pulgas temple and the arson this morning thorne hit the mute again his frown pronounced by now last night he had been both wired and a little drunk hed had perfect cover in the thick fog he was also feeling godlike after the pulgas thing had gone so well when would he learn you might want it and love every minute of it but you didnt do things yourself you hired experts to take care of operations that was the safe way otherwise it was you who got interrupted who had to improvise who perhaps left physical evidence at the scene he sat scowling ruminating over the possibility that he had personally exposed himself now perhaps even gotten himself implicated with bree beaumont and that had never been his intention he tried to remember if hed known that hardys wife was the blasted woman in jail he just couldnt dredge it up not that it mattered now and the last problem maybe the biggest problem with screwing things up yourself was then sometimes you had to fix them yourself sunday night and glitsky sprung frannie again for a couple of hours it was going to be the last chance to get away with that before the work week began and she considered any single second outside of her cell well worth the trouble they were all still pretending that frannie was going to be free on tuesday but hardy at least knew it might not be so simple if scott randall didnt cooperate if sharron pratt didnt relent under the mounting criticism in the press if frannie discovered another reason why she couldnt reveal what ron had told her for example if ron simply reneged on releasing her from her promise any of these could and would prolong the nightmare and in any event hardy was going to have to get a hearing scheduled to vacate the contempt charge he was all but certain that this would not be a cake walk for two hours glitsky fielded calls from the dispatcher trying to get a fix on damon kerrys location provided information on the days events to the police beat reporter and organized his utilization coefficients hardy and frannie were together alone in the interrogation room off the homicide detail the shades drawn and the door locked by a chair propped up under the doorknob hardy made up an excuse so he could stop by his car and pick up the gun he had no plans to go unarmed until this had passed he knew glitsky would disapprove he might get himself in big trouble hurt someone and wind up on trial himself but he took solace in the old saying better tried by twelve than carried by six then they took glitskys car and parked across the street from kerrys house the plan was to wait until the limo pulled away so theyd get the candidate alone but the limo had barely stopped when a short stocky form emerged and began crossing the street toward them thats valens hardy said glitsky moved opening the drivers door gun drawn stop right there he ordered right now police police jesus christ what are you doing here hardy opened his own door and got out but let the car remain between him and the others he felt for his gun riding in the small of his back hidden under his jacket hey valens held his hands out in front of him the fog had finally lifted somewhat and the voices seemed to carry like the ping of crystal im coming over to see who you are ok two guys dark car middle of the night get it glitsky was advancing toward the man we get it are you al valens is that damon kerrys car valens nodded yeah and hes in it trying to sleep hes the governor of california in about two days ok sure glitsky responded but right now today im lieutenant abe glitsky and im the head of homicide id like to have a few words with mr kerry not possible valens shook his head emphatically the man has been running all day hes got twenty appearances tomorrow hes not available glitsky allowed himself a tight smile he spoke in a conversational tone im not asking he started for the limo but valens wasnt giving up that easily he sidestepped into the lieutenants path you got a warrant i want to see a warrant hardy was amazed he had never seen glitsky this patient taking the time to politely answer someone who refused to get out of his way i dont need a warrant to talk to him on the street which is what im hoping to do glitsky stopped and tried another tack mr valens are you trying to tell me that mr kerry doesnt want to cooperate with a police investigation into the murder of one of his consultants you might want to ask him about that valens thrust out his chin hey dont pull that crap on me we have already cooperated with you guys every time somebody came around to ask weve answered questions til were blue in the face now its late at night and this is pure straightup harassment i want to know what republican money is behind you on this please move to one side glitsky said valens pointed a finger this is a mistake lieutenant im telling you in two days damon gets elected and i get your badge you hear me glitsky stopped walking glanced around to hardy and came back to the campaign manager here are kerrys options he can talk to me or refuse to glitsky paused listen to me valens the reason im here in the middle of the night is to save him embarrassment nobody knows i dont want to make it public but i will if i need to do you understand me this finally broke some of valens bluster so does he need a lawyer present whats this about really glitsky brought his hand up and rubbed his eyes hes always welcome to have a lawyer but hes not under arrest at this time if he decides to call his lawyer well wait if he doesnt want to talk to us at all i wouldnt be at all surprised to read about it in the paper tomorrow but that of course would be his decision you son of a bitch who is behind this glitsky moved up a step closer thats a very illadvised choice of words and i wouldnt continue in that vein if i were you now as to who is behind this im doing it alone its police work there is no political motive im investigating a murder that murder is almost a month old whats the hurry tonight the hurry tonight is that there was another murder last night a policeman valens narrowed his eyes connected to bree thats one of the things id like to find out you have to understand mr valens that when police officers get killed other cops get a little testy and im there now so dont push me i really am trying to maintain a low profile around this if that werent the case i could have pulled together a pretty good crowd by now dont you think glitsky let the simple truth of that sink in for a moment now is mr kerry going to consent to an interview or not valens hesitated for a number of seconds then with a last furious glare he turned and walked back to the limo there was another lengthy outburst after they got inside the house when valens recognized hardy he wasnt a policeman so what the hell was he doing here this was a man who had broken into valens hotel room that morning and had threatened him with a gun did you file a report with the hotel with the police do you now want to press charges glitsky asked the questions mildly but they put an end to that ill be recording this conversation by the way glitsky said it as casually as possible allowing no opportunity for debate he was positioning his portable recorder on the table and holding up a hand forestalling any and all of valens continuing objections he gave the standard introduction identified those present and had kerry acknowledge that he was speaking of his own free will that he was not under arrest and that he did not want to have a lawyer with him but why is this man here valens asked indicating hardy not wanting to let that issue go hell facilitate the discussion glitsky responded and mr valens you are here as a courtesy dont interrupt again valens had a legitimate gripe there was no legal reason for hardy to be there but the campaign manager held no cards what was he going to do notify the media and let the public know that his candidate was a murder suspect no he and kerry had to cooperate and as long as glitsky allowed it they had no choice but to tolerate hardys presence but glitsky did have a reason and it became apparent immediately mr kerry he asked im sure you remember talking to mr hardy yesterday in the lobby of the st francis a rather lengthy discussion about bree beaumont wasnt it i believe it was the bar but yes the candidate had a damp washcloth on his forehead he was nearly reclining on the couch his stockinged feet up on the coffee table in front of him although it was anything but warm either out in the night or here in the house his skin had a sheen as though he were sweating slightly glitsky thought he might have a fever and if so that would be to the good well the reason i brought mr hardy along and the reason that were here talking to you at all frankly has to do with that conversation kerry might be tired and feverish but he shifted slightly summoning some reserves of energy all right he said glitsky nodded do you remember telling him that you had never been to bree beaumonts apartment that was mevalens exploded interrupting pointing at hardy again thats what i called this guy about last night i already told him all about that i forgot thats all and still thats why he broke into my hotel mr valens please glitsky stilled him with a glare mr kerry kerry had by now straightened up to a sitting position he mopped his brow with the washcloth yes i said that and you stand by that now that youve never been inside brees place kerry crossed one leg over the other and sighed deeply i suppose youve got somebody who saw me there took my picture perhaps mr hardy here damon hold it valens again but kerry seemed almost amused a wry expression crossed his face its all right al its all right the lieutenant says hell keep this low profile isnt that true lieutenant so long as i didnt kill bree we have your word on that on this tape if i can glitsky responded yes i went there glitsky and hardy exchanged glances why did you tell mr hardy you hadnt what difference does that make lieutenant is that a crime he might have been a reporter trying to get some dirt on me and bree he might have been with my opponent trying to smear me make it look like i was having an affair with a married mother of two he shrugged he said he was rons attorney and its my belief that ron killed her he was building a case so i lied to him the easiest thing was to lie you believe that ron killed her yes why a shrug she was his major source of support financially she was going to change that arrangement when he found out he lost it how do you know that she told me the first two the last i surmise by now kerry had come forward on the couch the signs of fatigue had vanished hunched over slightly his elbows on his knees the washcloth now bunched in his right hand he struck hardy as a man engaged in watching the last seconds of an extremely close football game frankly im amazed its taken you the police this long to get to him judging from this interview youre still not there are you he has an alibi for the time of the murder glitsky replied calmly his patented nonsmile making a minor appearance were still laboring under the law of physics that you cant be in two places at once but while were on the topic where were you on the morning she was killed kerry actually chuckled this is ridiculous its a simple question yes it is which doesnt make it any less ridiculous youre implying that i am a suspect in this womans murder but glitsky knew how to interrogate and the first rule is you dont answer questions you ask them im asking where you were when she was killed again a simple question all right heres the simple answer i couldnt even tell you exactly the day bree was killed lieutenant im in the middle of a thirtymilliondollar campaign for governor of the most populous state in the nation ive had between ten and thirty appearances a day for the past six months or more glitsky nodded youre on the record saying you were home here that morning alone do you remember that i said it valens put in i told your inspectors hell ive told them halfadozen times damon needs to sleep once in a while hed been out late the night before wed been shooting commercials that had to air the next week the day she died he had to fly to san diego at noon so he slept in look kerrys color had come up now it was a horrible tragedy that bree was killed and it is my most fervent wish that it hadnt happened beyond that i hope you find her killer but i do wish that this city had a more competent police force so that i would not have to be bothered with this graspingatstraws stupidity on the penultimate day of my campaign valens took his cue and stood up thats it im calling the mayor hell put a stop to this he faced glitsky directly you wont have to wait for the election lieutenant you can lose your badge tonight hardy reached over to the tape recorder snapped it off and spoke before glitsky could reply good idea valens you go ahead then ill call jeff elliot and we can see where that goes you know jeff this was kerry all attention were buds hardy said he was here last night and you werent how about that glitsky raised his voice thats enough he lifted the tape recorder and turned it on again then whispered into the resulting silence this is my interrogation i will ask the questions mr kerry i need five more minutes of your time and then i will walk out the door with mr hardy youve admitted you were at bree beaumonts penthouse what were you doing there a disgusted shake of the head visiting her she was one of my consultants and beyond that we were friends were you alone with her there yes is that sinister glitsky abruptly changed his tack what did you do after midnight last night kerry collapsed back on to the couch he mopped his brow again with the washcloth last night what does last night have to do with anything a policeman was killed about five blocks from here last night kerry cast a glance over at valens theyll stop at nothing he said then back to glitsky and i killed him too i suppose im not busy enough running for governor ive got to premeditate several murders as well among them a cop i must have a low tolerance for boredom he sighed last night i took a walk you took a walk thats right al left at around when al eleven thirty and i was wound up the mtbe poisoning bree even mr hardy here i decided to walk off some of the tension do you own a gun mr kerry sure he said ive got a basement full of uzis and semiautomatics aks are my favorites when im not killing women and policemen i like to dress up like a postal employee and spray up some mcdonalds someplace he forced himself to his feet this was a voluntary interview as you noted i would appreciate a copy of the transcript of that tape in my headquarters by tomorrow and i assure you that i am going to speak to the mayor and you can do any goddam thing you want about it both of you he was halfway across the room when glitsky a dog with a bone spoke up after him do you own a gun mr kerry you didnt answer me the candidate stopped and turned slowly in measured tones he answered i have a glock nine millimeter in my bedroom for protection i did not shoot your colleague with it you have my word glitsky smiled and pounced softly how did you know he was shot kerry stood stock still his eyes for an instant stained with fear darted to valens then recovering he came back to glitsky from your questions about guns thats a perfectly reasonable assumption now good night lieutenant driving back downtown for the first several blocks neither man said a word at a red light on geary they stopped and hardy half turned in the passengers seat offhand he said i wouldnt say that went too well glitsky looked over at him i dont know he has no alibi he owns a gun you notice he said several murders when wait glitsky fiddled with his tape recorder rewound a minute got to the spot and here was kerrys voice again im not busy enough running for governor ive got to premeditate several murders as well among them a cop he flicked it off several he said is not two two is a couple bree and canetta no one knows about griffin being part of this but he didnt say among them some cops or a couple of cops no he didnt abe admitted i know he was being sarcastic but still itll be instructive if he does call the mayor a pause hes a lot quicker on his feet than id given him credit for i might even vote for him assuming he didnt kill anybody even then glitsky seemed amused you never want to underestimate the value of brains in your elected officials i dont know hardy said our presidents got brains yeah but theyre all south of his head the light changed and they moved ill tell you one thing hardy commented kerrys got brass balls if he did any of this i think we just got a glimpse of them abe said the guy is no pansy you get the impression he hasnt talked to any cops before that its all been valens up to now a hundred per cent and heres a last bit of fivecent psychology to my mind kerrys exactly the kind of guy that griffin could have wound up handing his gun to i could see him asking carl for a ride in the cruiser wow this is what its like being a cop you mind if i just hold your gun for a minute and its all loaded and everything or hardy countered he packed along his glock and forced him or that too griffin just drops by his house knocks at the door i dont know its hard to see that do we know where he was when griffin got it it was the day of brees funeral he was in town valens says he was sick over brees death canceled his appointments but made the funeral another silence descended after a few blocks hardy looked over at glitsky again lord he said its interesting the lieutenant admitted the two cars were parked next to one another in the cavernous city garage under the hall of justice there was a guard trying to keep warm in a small booth by the back doorway which was the main entrance but otherwise except for glitsky and hardy the place was empty which was not surprising after eleven oclock on a sunday night glitsky asked the guard to bring up the lights and in a moment the dark and grimy garage was lit up like a showroom yellow crimescene tape hung from traffic cones and this segregated the immediate area where griffins and canettas cars had been parked from the contiguous body shop and parking spaces for the cityissue vehicles all doors and the trunks of both cars were open under the car on the right a dark blue lumina someone in the crime scene unit had written block letters in chalk canetta the car over griffin was a gray midsized chevrolet with minor body damage and a lot of years behind it but for the moment their steps echoing as they navigated the garage they were still on kerry so you think your badge is really in trouble for interrogating a righteous suspect theyre going to claim its political glitsky snorted they dont support much of what i do but ive got to believe they wont step on me for this theres probable cause here in spades in fact im going to put somebody on a warrant for the glock tomorrow see if its where he said it was what it might tell us he indicated the cars before them maybe that glock has spent some time in one of these and picked up something for its troubles theyd come up to canettas car on their left glitsky pulled some latex gloves from his jacket pocket handed a couple to hardy pulled his on and stood over the yawning trunk what are we looking for hardy came up beside him there shouldnt be anything glitsky responded the theory is its all bagged and labeled at the lab or if theyre done boxed up in the locker and in fact the trunk looked pretty well cleaned out still they checked the wheel wells under the rug under the speakers everywhere hardy went up the passenger side glitsky the drivers the front seat had been removed although there was still fresh evidence of the blood canetta had spilled on the rug the visors had nothing stuck under or in them the glove compartment was empty in the back it was the same story glitsky wasnt saying a word and though hardy still wasnt sure why they were doing this he was along for the duration over at griffins car as with canettas they started at the trunk there was a little more evidence that carl had lived and worked in his vehicle beverage stains tobacco burns but it had evidently been sanitized by a team of professionals at least until they came to the back doors the back seat and the rug in front of it contained the usual by now stains and odors and hardy was about to stand up when glitsky made a sign last one he said and they lifted the back seat up hardy whistled glitsky looked for a moment his expression fixed dont touch he said lets go they crossed back to the guards booth and glitsky picked up the telephone and punched in some numbers get me operations he told the dispatcher is leon timms on call good page him yes maam right now have him call me glitsky gave his number and they waited two minutes or less the phone rang leon abe im down here at the garage and just had occasion to lift the back seat of carl griffins car yeah uh huh well they missed this uh huh i know i am too he rolled his eyes at hardy well listen the point is that were behind the curve on this investigation you might have noticed right leon listen up just so were clear i expect all that waste paper kleenex french fries sugar cones condoms coins bullets shoelaces boxtops coupons lottery tickets everything to be checked out bagged and catalogued and up at the lab by the morning starting now uh huh thats right it is i know i dont care hardy had no confidence that hed be able to stay awake on the ride across town to erins freemans building was closer and there were still things to do there now on his couch back in his office he fought to keep his eyes open he had his legal pad beside him and had drafted the motion hed submit to the court to marian braun in fact on vacating frannies contempt citation he checked his watch nearly one oclock he read another line nearly dozed and started awake there on the low table in front of him weighted down by his gun was every scrap of paper hed accumulated over the past four days he was going to read them thoroughly when he finished his motion he started to fade again the gun hed berated himself recently for allowing himself to fall asleep with the gun in plain view next to him and this time he wasnt going to do that his legs didnt want to answer him his shoulder throbbed and his mouth was dust but he made himself walk to his desk open the drawer put the gun in and lock it it seemed a long uphill mile all the way over to the light switch by the door and then back to the couch but he finally made it pulled his jacket over him and fell to the side asleep before he knew what had hit him it was nominally a breakfast meeting in the mayors private suite at city hall but none of the participants except one seemed to have much of an appetite the plate of sweet rolls sat unmolested in the center of the long rectangular table by ten minutes past seven the mayor himself richard washington hadnt made his appearance but everyone else had assembled and gotten their coffee poured by seven am the hour his honor had appointed for this emergency session it was the first time scott randall had ever been inside the mayors offices and typically although by a wide margin the youngest person in the room he was unimpressed someday he thought it was entirely possible he might wind up here himself hed do the walls a different color something that said power a little more distinctly though still subtly maroon perhaps he stood off by himself beside the vast sideboard under an ornately framed mirror at the far end of the room he was on his second danish hed wolfed the first and now sipped at his coffee as he surveyed the other guests sharron pratt his boss was in an intense discussion with dan rigby the chief of police and peter struler randalls own da investigator the attendance of marian braun was a surprise to randall superior court judges often liked to pretend they were above the political fray but she had obviously come at the mayors bidding although she was fastidiously ignoring everyone and obviously unhappy pencil in hand ostentatiously making notes on some thick document in a threering black binder shed already been sitting at the table when randall had arrived the mayors major domo was unfortunately named richard too scott randall suppressed a smile recalling that the common name led to the inevitable sobriquets of big dick and little dick for the mayor and his assistant little dick was chatting with a couple of staff members that randall recognized although their names escaped him finally randall checked his watch seven thirteen mayor washington burst into the room purposeful overworked impatient he was talking at high volume to a middleaged woman who trailed behind him scribbling nonstop in a steno pad washington wore a camels hair coat over his suit he was reasonably tall and nearly burly broken nose veins in the face a lot of unkempt gray hair walking fast as he came through the door he kept coming until he got to his seat at the head of the table when he stopped almost as though surprised at where hed come to rest all right he nearly bellowed eyes all over the room everybody here lets get going little dick had appeared behind him and helped him out of the overcoat an automatic operation the mayor did not acknowledge in any way by the time washington was down in his chair the woman had poured and flavored his coffee three sugars and cream randall noticed and had disappeared the mayor slurped from the cup swallowed and waited an instant for one of the staffers to stop fidgeting in her seat after another moment marian braun looked up put her pencil down and closed her binder washington nodded at her and looked around the table coming to rest on the young man near the far end youre randall he said pointing a thick finger yes sir how old are you son randall bridled slightly at the condescension but what could he do thirtythree sir you married children no neither washington had him on the hot seat and seemed content to let him cook a minute he slurped some more coffee somebody pass those rolls down here will you thanks he randomly grabbed from the pile took a bite and chewed you know why were all here he wasnt asking randall swallowed drily the frannie hardy matter i believe thats correct at this formal corroboration of the reason that this meeting had been called marian braun spoke up excuse me richard but that being the case i cant be here i cant discuss a case thats before my court she was already starting to get up but the mayor wasnt impressed why dont you stick around anyway marian in case the second half of this conversation concerns the court budget for next year maybe that will be worthy of your attention he directed a fierce glare at her and eventually she yielded to it and settled herself back in her chair richard washington took another deep draught of coffee and carefully replaced the cup in its china saucer the silence was perfect the rage came from nowhere which made it all the more effective suddenly the mayor slapped the flat of his palm on the table with enormous force china rattled and some coffee spilled everyone jumped do you have any idea the amount of trouble youve caused with this mr randall he exploded any idea it took a split second even for the quickwitted randall to recover it was part of my investigation into washington interrupted again you think were all operating in a vacuum well let me help you out pratt interrupted with respect sir the mayor didnt seem any too happy with the da either he faced her and snapped what sharron the issue isnt that its caused some political trouble the issue is legal mr randall did the right thing washington conjured with that for a moment his voice with its normal inflection was almost more frightening i absolutely reject that he said what he did what marian did too for that matter might not be illegal but i wouldnt go so far as to say it was right pratt retained the serenity that only knowing that you are right can provide the woman refused to cooperate with the grand jury richard she was belligerent and disrespectful she was a housewife worried about picking up her children thats what the media seems to have settled on thats what jeff elliot wrote about yesterday and now her house has been burned did any of you happen to notice that thats irrelevant pratt responded whats your point richard my point is that im taking a tremendous amount of flack for allowing this travesty to continue in my city mr randall in his inexperience overreacted folks i want the woman released today a collective gasp then silence fell around the table i cant do that richard braun was firm the first contempt citation expires tonight and she has to serve that out mr randall here can call her before the grand jury first thing tomorrow morning at which point her continued incarceration will be up to her if she decides to talk or mr randall if she decides not to the mayor made no effort to hide his sarcasm thank you your honor but i want it clear that holding innocent citizens in jail out of personal pique doesnt sit well with me randall finally found his voice again the woman is not innocent your honor she knows something she knows something washington nodded his mouth twitching at the corners im glad you brought that up mr randall chief rigby he whirled has anyone been charged or indicted in the murder of bree beaumont to date no sir so this hardy woman knows something about somebody but we dont know what and we dont know if its got anything to do with that murder no one answered washington glared around the table and yet she sits in jail he shook his mane of hair in disgust i called this meeting to acquaint all of you with my very strong feelings about this matter im going to air those feelings at this mornings press conference and i wanted to do all of you the courtesy of a heads up no one has more respect than i do marian and you too sharron for the judicial process but im hard pressed to believe that this woman knowingly holds the key to a murder so this is mere pettiness he pointed again at randall and son for you this is what we call overweening ambition its not an admirable quality if you hadnt tried to endrun the police department we wouldnt be here now chief rigby yes sir from his expression he knew what was coming the chief of police was the pawn of the mayor appointed by him accountable to him and rigby had just found himself on the wrong side of the fence apparently youve been trying to make kissyface with ms pratt so that her fear and loathing of the police would not too greatly interfere with the daytoday workings of the department i even applaud your intentions but weve got a homicide department and its not run by mr struler here or by ms pratt if you dont like glitsky get a new head of homicide but the police department investigates murders and you back up your people clear it was to rigby but washington wasnt through yet sharron marian youre both elected officials im just a layman in matters of the law but this comes across as serious arrogance and the public seems to have a bad reaction to that particular trait you might want to think about that hardy opened his eyes and for the second time in as many days had to take a minute to figure out where he was down a floor in the lobby of the freeman building he put on a pot of coffee then went in for a shower in ten minutes he was back in his office dressed in his smoky clothes and drinking coffee from an oversized mug the fog remained he put in a call to erin told her where he was and spoke to the kids who were polite and even solicitous was he all right they missed him he and mom were coming to stay with them so theyd all be together at grandma and grandpas in two days right they really really really missed him and frannie he believed them after he hung up he went back to the couch and sat his brief from the night before was ready to submit for typing downstairs and he left it with the early morning staff at word processing then took the stairs two at a time back to the work that waited for him the xeroxed pages of griffins notebook griffin had been working on a number of homicides at the time of his death snatches from each of them were scattered on each page names dates addresses arrows for connections exclamation points phone numbers in his previous passes through the pages whenever hardy had run across a name that didnt appear elsewhere in some other file on bree beaumont hed assumed it was from one of the other cases it was tedious and inexact but he had to eliminate on some criterion and this had seemed as reasonable as any this morning though he resolved to read it all through again things had changed and if damon kerry had a connection to baxter thorne that griffin had been aware of he wanted to know about it hardy hadnt even heard of thorne or fmc the last time hed read the pages nor a lot else carl had been shot on monday october bree had died on the previous tuesday september so he started there at least carl tended to enter dates with some regularity it appeared that on day three of his investigation hed slogged through the usual opening gambit of talking to people who lived in the deceased building suddenly the name o or d chinn or something in a smeared scrawl very much like it popped up at him hardy had assumed this was an asian witness from one of griffins other cases and hadnt considered it at all but now suddenly he remembered the superintendent in brees building and consulted his own notes on his yellow pad david glenn d chinn close enough but there wasnt much hardy recognized written under it there was either a b or an r then a time ncd then a new line herit tth and a phone number those damn three exclamation points they clearly meant something significant but hardy for the life of him couldnt figure out what ncd was tth could only mean tuesday thursday but what in turn was that about hardy checked his watch still too early before eight oclock but he went to his desk and called the number next to herit tth anyway it was a womans voice in a heavy asian accent and hardy nearly hung up frustrated for even wasting this much time this note must have referred to one of griffins other cases after all but hardy heard out the recording many thank you for calling heritage cleaning office hours are monday to friday eight thirty to six please leave message and call back and the case breaks wide open hardy muttered to himself as he hung up now we know where griffin did his laundry he went back to the couch to the notebook still on the inspector evidently spent part of the day talking to the crime scene and forensics people downtown there were scribblings hardy took to be about strout timms glitsky then further down another maddening three exclamation points fab wash r stains he shook his head nearly getting all the way to amused at the prosaic truth more laundry by friday griffin was checking alibis apparently he had spoken to pierce jp and perhaps his wife cp time checks evidently referring to pierces alibi the weekend intervened then on monday more alibi checking this time with kerry and here hardy consulted his own notes for corroboration swa sd southwest airlines to san diego around noon that checked but what had kerry done before being picked up to go to the airport griffins notes didnt give a clue a few lines down the page and apparently still under kerry there was another number if it were a date it was over a month out of synch so hardy assumed it must be a time and if it were a time it would comport very closely with the hour of brees death so what had griffin discovered about kerrys whereabouts at nine oclock and why so precisely it had to be a phone call hardy reasoned but where were the phone records he flipped quickly through the few pages but was sure he would have noticed them sooner if theyd been there and sure enough they werent he chewed on possibilities for a couple of minutes then got up again went to his desk and picked up the phone glitsky homicide hardy bon vivant scholar champion of the oppresse what glitsky growled im guessing kerry called bree or vice versa on the morning she was killed great minds what do you mean kerrys got both a residence and a cell phone i checked already i got a rush call in on both phone records this morning to see if maybe he didnt sleep in late like he said he did im waiting for the fax so what about griffin did any phone records turn up under that back seat not yet i stopped by the garage again coming in theyd barely got it cleaned out much less catalogued but griffin must have gotten the phone records right dont you guys do that i would hope so glitsky said though i wouldnt bet the ranch on it so where are they theyd be with the stuff you have if hed filed them uh huh see if you can guess whether they are glitsky sighed his desk is cleaned out diz its all somewhere stuff related to his cases supposedly got forwarded to the new teams maybe they were in one of the bags in the trunk tagged already then theyd be downstairs in the evidence lockup another sigh you think theres some possible phone connection to kerry itd be sweet if there was hardy hesitated im really starting to like the good candidate i told you last night i might even vote for him thats not how i meant like no glitsky said i know what you meant after he hung up hardy went back to his couch and his notes he had come now to the last full day of griffins life and under sunday found what hed been hoping for box t embarc burn or bwn he had earlier assumed that this might be a reference to a postoffice box in one of the highrises along the embarcadero now he saw it in a different light it wasnt box t it was bax t baxter thorne as he read it now hardy realized that the note referred to an eight thirty am meeting at thornes embarcadero office hardy stared at the cryptic note here finally was thorne connected to bree in griffins investigation had the inspector in fact gone to question thorne on the morning of his death had they then taken a little drive suddenly a detail kicked in he bolted upright and checked his watch it had at last gotten to eight oclock a little after jeff elliot had told him he was setting a meeting with thorne first thing this morning and at it he planned to bait and switch him into a corner half joking hardy had warned jeff to make sure he didnt go alone now there was no joke about it he called jeffs home and got no response at the reporters personal number at the chronicle he left a message then checked the general switchboard no mr elliot hadnt come in yet would he care to leave a message in a flash hardy was grabbing his jacket at the office door he stopped still then turned and went back to his desk in thirty seconds armed he was flying down the stairs pausing for a second at the reception desk is david in yet phyllis replied in her usual icy fashion not as yet i havent heard from him at all this morning is he at court the gimlet eyes fixed on him i wouldnt know mr hardy i havent heard from him oh thats right hardy thought it was kind of sad that someday he knew he was going to kill phyllis i think you said that twice right he couldnt help himself so i guess hes not in although it was fifteen or twenty blocks from his office to the embarcadero there was no point in trying to drive between the morning traffic and parking when he arrived it would take longer than walking so hardy was breathing hard from the forced march in spite of that he was also chilled from the fog and painfully aware of a gnawing in his stomach he hadnt eaten since midafternoon yesterday those tasty few bites of lukewarm tortilla pie at glitskys the directory listed the fuels management consortium on the twentysecond floor and the elevator had him there in seconds the office was anything but threatening lots of glass they were floating in the clouds up here modern furniture partitioned workstations piped newage music the hum and bustle of a busy workplace can i help youthe receptionist was a very young woman perhaps even a teenager with a warm smile hardy returned it fantasizing briefly about what it would be like to have a cheerful presence to greet people in place of phyllis is mr thorne available im sorry hes in a meeting right now i can take your name though did you have an appointment no no appointment can you tell me is he by any chance with jeff elliot a chronicle reporter she looked down biting her lip clearly wanting to do the right thing not knowing if she should give out this information hardy smiled at her told her his name and spelled it out im a friend of mr elliots im sure hed like to know im here the streets on the walk over had been cold with the fogladen wind but baxter thornes large corner office was positively arctic the executive director of fmc wasnt a big man by any means and seemed a shrunken pugnacious malevolent gnome behind the cluttered expanse of his desk in his wheelchair jeff elliot simply turned his head when hardy was announced thorne nodded at the nice receptionist and she withdrew silently closing the door behind her no pleasantries of any kind were exchanged from the feel of things the bait had been taken and the switch had just begun as a courtesy mr elliot although im beginning to wonder why i would want to extend one ive admitted your acquaintance now what you dont know mr hardy thorne threw a glance hardys way than came back to elliot ive never seen him in my life hardy was taken aback by the voice deep quiet cultured elliot was shaking his head thats not what i asked i asked if you knew mr hardy should i you seem unable to answer the question mr thorne i wonder why that is hardy believing in his heart that thorne was in some way behind the arson of his home had to fight the urge to withdraw his weapon and end the cat and mouse right here but he thought hed let jeff play the hand a while first at the very least he already seemed to have gotten under thornes skin the gnome cast a gaze out toward the side window where the fog was swirling past to hardy it felt for a moment as though they were in an airplane the wind moaned keened really just at the threshold of sound thorne looked back at elliot i dont know mr hardy are you familiar with the name i dont know its common enough i may have heard it elliot seemed to be watching for some giveaway reaction but if there was one hardy didnt see it his wife is in jail now for refusing to testify before the grand jury about the death of bree beaumont have you heard of her bree beaumont thornes face put his impatience on display what is this twenty questions who do i know youve asked me about press releases on the pulgas water poisoning ive told you that you may check with my staff the releases were not ours they were not prepared here one of my colleagues found them outside in the hallway on saturday bound for distribution thorne shrugged so what i didnt write them i didnt put them there obviously someone is trying to make us look bad connected to these people as they tried with mr kerry over the weekend theres a pattern here all right but its not of my making disappointed in humanity he shook his head if this is your smoking gun mr elliot well theres no story here spreading his hands he assayed a cold smile my clients are good people mr elliot theyre not terrorists theyre concerned with exposing the endless lies that the oil companies have foisted upon an ignorant public lies that polluted our air for years and now threaten how about ellis jackson whats your relationship with him having established what he thought was a plausible deniability thorne softened slightly the voice become nearly avuncular what about him is he your client a sad shake of the head ive told you im not at liberty to disclose the identities of my clients i of course knew ellis jackson when i worked for sko another reasonable smile the last time i checked there was no crime in that hes a great man now if youre not quite hardy spoke up for the first time you never answered jeffs question about knowing bree beaumont did you talk with a sergeant griffin about her death yes i believe that was his name then how could you not have heard of her i never said i hadnt heard of her of course i know who she was shes been one of the most vocal and recognizable names in the field over the last decade she was extremely courageous to change sides and go up against goliath as she did he paused for emphasis adding matter of factly and of course they killed her for it the oil companies can you doubt it hardy snorted in exasperation i dont think so but thorne remained infuriatingly unruffled i cant really tell you what to think mr hardy but if you think people individuals dont die over big oil dont get killed i recommend that you catch up on your research have you been following events in nigeria recently there are literally millions of other examples and thats leaving out most of our wars from kuwait going all the way back to world war two oil and market share the small quiet powerful man stood behind his desk now really im afraid thats all i have time for i think youll be able to find your way out oh and mr elliot a rictus smile the libel laws in this state are quite severe as im sure you know its one way my clients can combat an unscrupulous enemy they have been quite aggressive in pursuing legal redress for unsubstantiated news stories on the way out hardy pushing jeffs wheelchair the sweet young thing at the reception desk wished them a good morning and gave hardy a little wave frannie sat on the table in the attorneys room at the jail swinging her legs she looked like a schoolgirl the impression reinforced by the fact that shed put her hair into pigtails to hardy the jails jumpsuit was still jarring to see on her but after yesterdays two visits up in the homicide detail he found the jail garb easier to accept soon he told himself it would all be behind them today was the last day he prayed as soon as they got rons note out of the way but like everything else this wasnt going smoothly what do you mean he asked youre not sure youre going to be ok with this with telling about ron her face took on a stubborn set that hardy didnt like to see he forced himself to speak in a calm tone frannie listen by the time it gets to the grand jury again if it does it wont matter hell be gone if he isnt already no she shook her head i dont think so he doesnt want to move the kids start over someplace else hell wait just like he said he would but either way hes released you from the confidence hardy didnt want to push too hard trying to convince her but he felt he had to nail this down if it came to it tomorrow frannie would have to disclose rons secret it wasnt sitting at all well with her but she nodded i hate to give that creep scott randall the satisfaction besides from all youve told me it sounds like ron isnt anywhere near the best suspect anymore no i dont think he is hardy admitted but until they have another one dumped in their laps theyre going to pretend but really it still comes down to me doesnt it what do you mean i mean youre close abes close maybe itll only be another day the legs had stopped swinging her hands were folded in front of her now her eyes cast downward what im saying is that if i still dont tell maybe ron gets some more breathing room hardy was sitting casually on one of the wooden chairs that surrounded the table it was all he could do to remain in that posture he felt the blood racing in his temples and willed himself to keep his voice even ron doesnt want to you do that frannie i cant imagine why youd want to do that she raised her agonized eyes its not a matter of wanting dismas its the last thing in the world i want to do but i know what max and cassandra have already gone through and as soon as i open my mouth their world is over dont you see that if i can give you or abe more time to save them but hardy was shaking his head thats not whats going to happen frannie whats going to happen is even if you dont talk on tuesday your friend mr randall is going to get his indictment on ron but why theres still no evidence is there more than there was last week hardy agreed very little but that doesnt matter theres probably enough for a grand jury rons flight alone if it comes to it phony credit cards fake ids consciousness of guilt and as soon as ron is indicted its over for him and the kids hell be in the system and from there thats what will take over the system regardless of what you do thats the good news frannie its out of your hands so youre saying i have to tell im saying it wouldnt do any good not to suddenly his temper flared jesus christ frannie it gets you out of here what do you want what i want she yelled back at him is to go to our home which isnt there anymore she angrily shook away the beginning of tears and be able to hug our children hardy longed to reach for her to tell her it was ok that they were still all right but he wasnt sure they were all right he didnt miss the omission of himself as among those she wanted to hug you can do that frannie he said evenly at erins we can all be there rebuild he added hesitantly the house and us she shook her head no his stomach clutched at him but he had to ask no what you say it but i dont know if you really want to do that what it might take and what is that now frannie paused took a deep breath and let it out being each others lives again but we are holding up a hand she stopped him dismas remember when we were first together remember that you were working just as hard then you had your trials and your cases and your career but mostly you had us remember and youd come home as early as you could every day and id be on the front stoop with the beck and vincent all of us waiting for you and theyd come running to greet you hugging your legs so happy to have daddy home again and you so happy to see them too remember that and then you and i would go in and feed them and put them to bed and then go talk and laugh and wind up making love more often than not didnt that used to happen im not making that up in my memory am i no he said quietly no thats how it was so what happened he had come around on the chair now hunched over elbows on his knees his hands together his shoulders slumped i dont know frannie everybody got too busy certainly nobody cared what time i came home nobody even says hi anymore when i walk in the house youre doing so many kid things youre always exhausted and if its not about kids youre not interested we dont have date night anymore wheres any of our life together he looked up at her take your pick frannie and ok it was a lot me all the things you say but it was a twoway street and you say you really want to go back to that he thought for a beat no maybe not to what we had a week ago he said something better than that closer to what we used to have but still with you and the kids after a long silent moment she slid off the table and walked over to the door where the guard waited for a second hardy was afraid she was simply going to ask to be escorted out but she turned to face him the best thing she said would be if i didnt have to tell then she knocked for the guard glitsky wasnt in his office nobody was in homicide at all which seemed a bit strange at ten oclock on a monday morning hardy sat himself at one of the inspectors desks and opened his briefcase he thought hed done pretty well with griffins notes this morning and now he was going to pull out his own notes and take a minute to go over what hed written about canettas findings he stopped before hed really begun he knew marie dempsey canetta had told him that hed discovered she had been the secretary of the insurance guy tilton that shed actually been laid off in the wake of the claims adjusters decision to hold off payment on brees life insurance until ron had been cleared of any implication in the death so here was this woman without a job with the insurance company calling ron beaumont twice or was it three times in a twoday period she wasnt calling him to walk him through processing his claim it seemed weeks ago now though in fact it was days and hardy had been concentrating on frannie when he had heard those calls at the penthouse but he remembered coming away with the impression that marie was personal not business he reached for the telephone on the desk and punched for information this is letitia what city please yes in san francisco the phone number please of a marie dempsey how would you spell that sir he spelled it out his patience all but eroded dempsey after all wasnt exactly albuquerque spellingwise but letitia eventually got it i dont show any marie dempsey sir do you know what street she lives on no how about just the initial m hardy ground his teeth that would be the one yes i show ten no eleven m dempseys ok hardy said ill take them all im sorry sir im only allowed to give out two numbers at a time please letitia this is important there may be lives at stake im not kidding could you please just give me the numbers im sorry sir im really not allowed to give out that information would you like to speak to a supervisor can your supervisor read me the eleven numbers no sir i dont believe so if you have access to a telephone directory they should all be listed in there though yes well you see i dont have a phone book handy which is kind of why i called you well letitia said brightly cheerfully let me give you the first number its hardy wrote quickly then found himself listening to a mechanical voice telling him that after he got his number the phone company could dial his call direct for a charge of thirtyfive cents press one if he slammed the receiver down glitsky was in the doorway pointing at the telephone thats city property he said you break it you buy it you got a phone book around here hardy asked i doubt it glitsky said theyre harder to find than a cop when you need one you want to guess how many homicides we got this weekend halloween including canetta sure lets include him three more two hundred and sixteen seven average is one point five a week and we get seven in two days ive got no inspectors left hardy nodded looking around and this would also explain your mysterious absence from your office all morning i thought you might have gotten tired and decided to take some time off nope glitsky was terse the first parts right but that wasnt it in his office though glitsky did find a threeyearold phone book and it had seven m dempseys listed the first one had the same number hardy had written down from letitia and he took that as a good sign he was copying and glitsky was talking shuffling through a pile of paper from his inbox so if kerry ever called the mayor as he said he would i havent heard about it although as youve noticed i havent exactly been waiting by the phone hardy looked up hes not going to call the mayor that would only raise the profile around him he just wants this and by this i mean you to go away you think i gave him the impression last night that i was going away that he scared me off if you did it was real subtle what glitsky had stopped at a faxed page he tsked a couple of times mr kerry mr kerry he held the page out to hardy at t wireless for the morning of september heres a conversation beginning at seven ten am duration twentytwo minutes somebody called him the day he slept in thats what he said maybe he only meant he slept in until seven and we just assumed he meant it was later thats probably it glitsky replied sarcastically he was shoving paper around on his desk again you got brees number anywhere on you as it happened hardy still had it in his briefcase it was the number from which kerry had received his call maybe i wont vote for him after all glitsky said hardy sat back crossed his arms so they have a fight first thing in the morning glitsky sat up straight snapped his fingers truly excited now hes the father she told him she was pregnant she was going to blackmail him all right hardy thought with relief he never had to break his vow of silence to jeff elliot glitsky had come to it on his own thats a reasonable guess he said mildly he waited till he knew ron had taken the kids to school strolled over but hardy was shaking his head why not glitsky asked no not himself he called thorne thorne called one of his operatives glitsky glanced back down at the faxed page not from his cell phone anyway damn hardy said why is it never easy its just one of the general rules but why would kerry calling thorne make it easy this is one slick bastard abe hardy explained about the leaflets that had been printed up before the mtbe dumping and about thornes explanation for it glitsky was enjoying the recitation he was paying attention sitting back in his chair his fingers templed at his lips when hardy finished he spoke so these terrorists who were trying to lay the blame on thorne they somehow assumed that jeff elliots colleague would just happen to drop by on saturday afternoon and find the flyers in the hallway glitsky was almost smiling call me cynical but thats a stretch we thought so too jeff and i hardy moved forward put his hands on the desk between them and spoke urgently abe you connect thorne to the mtbe gang and you win a prize really gee that never occurred to me i bet it did but look it gets better thorne wrote these leaflets probably by himself at his apartment so you get a warrant and have somebody search the place you find a piece of paper a computer file and you solve a murder maybe two or three glitsky cocked his head to one side all interest im listening whats two or three he talked to griffin the morning he got killed griffin who did thorne a nod are you sure of this hardy explained his reading of griffins notes that the meeting with thorne had been one of the last entries october eight thirty am it was that day abe count on it and youll love this elliot thinks thorne is bankrolling the good governor damon kerry through sko somehow how nobody knows but if theres anything to it at all it connects dirty tricks to damon kerry who we liked so much last night and maybe even more this morning glitsky was still sitting back contemplating thorne has erased any computer work diz if not immediately then for sure by now after talking with you and elliot ok still there might be hard copy in the garbage cans some dumpster behind the building i know i know glitsky had come forward and was shuffling more pages on his desk he spoke almost to himself but ive got no inspectors finally he opened his desk and withdrew what hardy recognized as a blank warrant form he grabbed a pen from the middle drawer of his desk ok he said beginning to write weve got the leaflets weve got griffin on his last day so help me here what else are we looking for hardy considered for a moment the smoking gun connection to kerry valens receipts thornes phone records anything im going to need some very serious physical evidence to get anywhere near kerry its going to take more than a phone call he forgot maybe get some dna on him and check it against brees baby thatll take six weeks if hes not elected for ever if he is and then even if he is the father nobody puts him at brees place that morning the scar between abes lips stood out he shook his head in frustration even on a normal mortal much less our popular politician nothing remotely convictable not even indictable hardy agreed ok then glitsky the strategist was back at it we go for thorne and squeeze from that direction you talked to him can you think of anything else on him my house the lieutenant met hardys gaze and nodded somberly as a salve to his friend he made a pretense of writing that down ill check with the fire department what else hardy wracked his brain but after nearly a minute still came up empty nothing abe he sighed oh except i did discover where carl griffin did his laundry are you kidding glitsky frowned carl never went to a laundry in his whole life after glitsky left to go try and get his warrant signed hardy copied down the remaining numbers for m dempsey then sat back pensively glitsky had closed the door when hed gone and now in the tiny cubicle hardy could work without distractions and he needed to concentrate it seemed that every answer he got raised another question how wonderful hed thought that glitsky had found brees lengthy call to kerry on the morning of her murder but something about the information had nagged at him and now here it was again on his copied pages of griffins notes the time or that had been his assumption and it had led directly to kerrys phone records and his lie but the phone call hadnt been at it had begun at seven ten so what was then there was heritage cleaners griffins laundry hardy pulled the phone on glitskys desk around and reached a woman who spoke english so poorly that he settled for what he hoped was the address of the place and politely thanked her then hung up he had no more strength this morning for disjointed conversations over that miracle of modern communication the telephone he would try to get time to stop by heritage later in the day when when and maybe see what they did why griffin had put them in his notes it was all a mess he checked his watch after eleven oclock already and today was his last day to get it done frannie had told him that the best thing would be if she didnt have to tell and the only way that would happen was if hardy provided some answers before they questioned frannie tomorrow again in front of the grand jury suddenly out of nowhere with his mind vacant and receptive he came to understand precisely what frannie had meant by her last cryptic challenging remark hardy had been telling her hed listen to her theyd work things out hed try to care more about what she did what she cared about so shed heard him out and turned at the door telling him ok this is what is truly important to me fish or cut bait your honor if i may j marian braun looked up from her desk in her chambers she wore wirerimmed halfglasses under a barely controlled riot of gray hair and made no effort at all to conceal her displeasure at the interruption or at the identity of the caller you may not im at lunch ill be back at my bench in fortyfive minutes counsellor talk to my clerk hardy didnt budge he was taking a chance but felt he had no choice your honor please time is short her scowl deepened the mayors outrageous effrontery and reprimand the das arrogance and political posturing all of this before shed finished her morning coffee still galled her deeply to say nothing of the potential legal ramifications to which shed exposed herself by allowing the mayor to bully her into staying for the duration of his meeting shed committed a serious ethical breach in this frannie hardy matter and could only hope it wouldnt come back to bite her and now here was the damn womans own husband no doubt wanting more ex parte communication well at least here was someone far beneath her on the pecking order she could chew him up and spit him out with impunity and probably feel a little better after she did if they were all trying to doubleteam her to subvert her ruling she would pick them off one by one starting with this meddling lawyer time is short mr hardy youre damn right what do you want and id better not hear one word of whining about the situation your wife put herself in she ostentatiously consulted her wristwatch you have three minutes and im counting hardy wanted to strangle marian braun where she sat at the very least he longed to try to make her understand the staggering difficulties to which she had subjected his entire family but neither of those served his purpose here this morning this would remain impersonal a legal matter nothing more he moved forward rapidly placed his briefcase on the chair before her desk and opened it i have here he said a writ for a habeas hearing on my wife id like you to grant an alternative writ for tomorrow morning the frown remained but braun laughed harshly through it are you joking what are you doing here with that if youve got grounds to vacate the contempt submit your motion in the normal fashion your honor the judge wasnt listening and assuming you had grounds for this writ at all do you expect the das office to answer by tomorrow morning what do you hope to accomplish by this quash the contempt charge before the grand jury the judge drummed her pencil against the desktop she observed him over the tops of her glasses i admire your nerve mr hardy although i cant say the same for your wifes hardy nearly had to bite his tongue off but he wasnt going to get drawn into a discussion about frannie i am specifically not addressing the judicial contempt your honor no one is arguing that only the grand jury citation well theres a rare and welcome display of good judgment she drew hardys piece of paper over to her scanned it quickly and repeated her initial response you dont say shell talk and you dont say why she doesnt have to all you say is it would be nice to let her go this belongs with the da they make this decision not me she pushed the paper back over to him he was dismissed but he didnt move braun glared up at him and pushed the document another time im going to lose my temper if you dont i dont trust the da hardy said i cant take it there brauns eyes narrowed hardy pressed on its been my experience that this particular administration will take a convenient position in their offices and when its on the record suddenly it changes in this case theyve abused the grand jury process thats a strong charge how have they done that your honor with all respect you know as well as i do the grand jury is a prosecutors tool but its not supposed to be a blunt instrument and that means it means scott randalls trying to make a highprofile case out of whole cloth and hes using my wife to do it how many times did you see his name in the paper this weekend not flatteringly what does he care in six months its all forgotten except the name recognition hardy was surprised braun had let him argue even this much he must have struck a chord with her she knew that this das administration had mostly a political not a legal agenda as a judge shed no doubt run across her own examples of dishonesty and sleaze hardy played another variation on this theme your honor wed all like to believe the da is going to do the right thing but even if they were convinced this wasnt going anywhere with ron beaumont there are folks down the hall who would leave my wife in jail just to prove that they can except my understanding is that ron beaumont is likely to be indicted if he is there wont be enough evidence to bring him to trial braun had just about reached her limit well thats the system mr hardy get used to it the systems broken your honor if theyre going to keep my wife in jail at least make them do it out in the open braun put her elbows on her desk you know mr hardy this morning i had the mayor himself try to circumvent the judicial process im tired of people who want to keep making this stuff up as they go along she straightened up pushing the paper away from her a last time you got your pitch take it to the da your three minutes are up hardy had one last shot and he hadnt wanted to take it unless there was no alternative but now hed gotten to that still it was a tremendous gamble if it didnt succeed the consequences would be devastating to his credibility to his entire career what if i can produce beaumont at the hearing braun stared at him id understood hed fled hardy elected not to answer directly scott randall doesnt have anything your honor he jailed my wife to save his own face if hes got a case let him make it in open court if he can youre telling me ron beaumont will testify at this habeas hearing tomorrow hardy nodded his heart was stuck in his throat if hes not in the courtroom theres no hearing he saw her wrestling with it braun had a temper and he was personally enraged at what shed done to frannie but like most superior court judges she prided herself on her basic sense of fairness hardy counted on that now it was no secret that this particular da administration systematically abused the grand jury process finally because of scott randalls arrogance and grandstanding braun herself had just been squeezed and humiliatingly dressed down by the mayor she peered over her glasses her mouth a grim pencil stroke i want you to understand that if i wasnt so pissed off at your wife i wouldnt give you this hearing but im not supposed to let my personal feelings get in the way and if i dont give you this hearing im not going to be sure it wasnt personal she pulled the writ over and scratched an angry signature at the bottom as hardy reached for it she held it back one last second if i take the bench tomorrow and ron beaumont isnt in the courtroom you dont even get three minutes lou the greeks had a kind of chinese version of paella as the special chunks of octopus perhaps tire sausage maybe chicken it was hard to tell and some red stuff all mixed into the rice with soy sauce since every day the special was the only item on the menu hardy ordered it a wave of hunger had hit him in glitskys office and he would gladly have ordered even some variant of spam musabi if it had been offered it probably would have been better than the paella which he had to admit didnt quite sing but he ate most of it sitting in one of the window booths which at the underground lous began at the level of the alley outside as it was he could have been eating tires for all he cared about the food something far more compelling commanded his attention the love letters of jim pierce to bree beaumont the ones shed saved in the back of her highschool yearbook there were a dozen of them all of them relatively short half a page or a little more and painfully adolescently passionate hallmark poetry that made him wince never havei touched or feltnevereven knewoh the cravingtouchingwanting only you three were on caloco stationery none were dated although all of the paper had grown brittle leading hardy to conclude that the last of them had been written several years before so david freeman had been right again hardy thought with awe when he put down the last letter and why should that have been a surprise pierce might be married to a worldclass beauty as president kennedy had been but this was no guarantee that he wouldnt have affairs human nature freeman had said men want a lot women want the best one just as hardy felt they were finally closing in on some kind of kerrythorne connection to brees death he didnt need this complication he could understand pierces denials especially in the presence of his wife and judging from the age of these letters the relationship might have ended years before possibly before either of them were even married but the discovery was unwelcome he was trying to narrow his list of suspects not expand it and if pierce and bree had ever been lovers now a foregone conclusion it put the oilman back in the picture at least tangentially how was it today diz lou the greek himself hovered over the table breaking hardy out of his reverie he smiled indicating his nearly cleaned plate maybe the best ever lou the proprietor showed a lot of teeth under his thick gray mustache people been saying that all morning im thinking we might go regular with it he slid into the booth across the way the dark eyes were not smiling anymore hey i hear some things you your wife the house you ok hardy shrugged getting by lou getting by you need anything you let me know he brushed at his mustache embarrassed lou hesitated another moment then nodded ok then he extended his hand and hardy took it good luck he said and todays on me hardy thanked lou and struck by the unexpected kindness watched him as he began to schmooze another table it was one of the few personal interactions hed ever had with the man in twentysome years and he wasnt at all sure where it had come from their common humanity the thought brought him up short unexpectedly the urge to goodness was still in the world it wasnt him alone or frannie alone he came back to ron beaumont if he was innocent and hardy was now willing to believe he was he was living a nightmare as hellish as hardys own or frannies and his wife was right the best thing shed said the options were endless but the best thing was if she didnt have to tell and for that to happen they were all depending on him on his judgment and skill yes but more than those really at the base of it on his humanity turning back to pierces letters he realized with surprise that he wasnt going to go anywhere with them at least not today there was no time for the moment he knew all he needed about pierce hed lied under duress he had loved bree maybe hed even killed her out of jealousy rejection his own despair but the trail to the truth did not lead through pierce from where hardy sat now he had to choose his best course and that led him back to carl griffin who had died pursuing the same thing heritage cleaners ran its business out of an upstairs office overlooking a grimy wet and today windswept alley in chinatown hardy turned off grant and into the narrow passageway a thin trickle of some kind of effluent flowed down a narrow and shallow concrete trough that bisected the way he passed several dumpsters rich with the odors of cabbage rotten meat and urine the body of a small brown puppy lay pitiably against one of the buildings hardy couldnt help himself he bent over closer to be sure it couldnt be saved then he gathered some newspaper wrapped up the bundle and placed it in one of the smelly dumpsters checking the address hardy ascended the dark flight of stairs if he were going to take his shirts to the cleaners he thought this would be his last choice but once inside the office was a surprise though still a far cry from the modern antiseptic bustle of fmcs headquarters heritage was well lit apparently organized a couple of computers at some workstations and the big surprise it wasnt a laundry a fraillooking elderly chinese man sporting bifocals and a starched white collarless shirt looked up and rose from one of the fours desks when the door opened he spoke good if accented english i am mr lee how may we help you hardy handed him a business card i am helping to investigate the death of a police officer and i wonder if i could have few minutes of your time mr lee checked the card again are you with the police no at the mans frown hardy pressed ahead but i believe the officer may have come here and spoken to someone about a womans death the man did the math in his head two deaths now actually three or more he paused to let the fact sink in im working with the police this wasnt precisely true and hardy was about to tell mr lee he could call abe to smooth things over but saw that he was nodding accepting the inspector was carl griffin again a frown deeper this time a big gentleman wasnt he not too clean hes dead hardy felt a spark of hope yes he was killed a few weeks ago i was hoping to find out what he questioned you about the nodding continued then mr lee motioned for hardy to follow and led him over to the desk hed lately abandoned the old man worked with the keyboard nodded and pointed at the screen twelve oh six broadway he said our customers do you clean the whole building no there are i believe twentythree or four units all individually owned we contract through the superintendent for the public areas and many residents are happy with our service and bree beaumont was one of them yes mr lee shot a glance at hardy and ventured a personal comment it was very sad about her yes it was he said sadness was all over this case he gave the sentiment a moment so what is your schedule there for cleaning i gather you go on tuesday and thursday is that correct yes so you do each place twice a week no generally we clean once half the units on one day the other half on the other and which was bree thursday every thursday hardy saw the reason for griffins earlier visit if heritage had come on tuesday possibly within an hour or two of brees death and before the crime scene unit had arrived then trace evidence might be found among the cleaning supplies in the vacuum cleaner bags and so on but evidently this had not happened still he wanted to be certain so you didnt go to her apartment on the day of her death no thats what sergeant griffin asked us did he ask if any of your staff saw anybody unusual in the hallways anything strange that they noticed yes of course mr lee was still seated and now sat back folding his arms patiently but have you been there yes then you know its really not that type of apartment building theres only two units on each floor except for the penthouse where there is one hardy remembered at brees twelfth floor there was simply a landing with a window and a door residents werent exactly out wandering in the halls loitering about in the locked lobby so there was really nothing to be found in any of your supplies the crime scene had already been there by the time you came on thursday mr lee shook his head i dont know that but inspector griffin just one minute pulling open the drawer again lee pushed junk around for a minute found that he wanted extracted it and handed it up to hardy it was a crinkled piece of paper hardys pulse quickened as he realized what it probably was a sheet torn from griffins notebook in the by now familiar scrawl hardy read received from heritage cleaners one gold and platinum movado mens watch serial number evidcase c griffin sfpd badge where did you get this hardy asked where is the watch mr lee shrugged eloquently when the inspector came here he said he still needed the watch i should hold the receipt if no one claimed it eventually it might come to us but how did you get the receipt in the first place the inspector gave it to my supervisor in the building they found the watch when cleaning and this was when your people found the watch on the thursday lee considered a moment yes the date on the receipt is october first see a thursday and no one has claimed it since reported it missing no lee said not to my people hardy wasnt surprised to hear this if the watch inadvertently got left behind say snapping off during a struggle at the crime scene it would be the height of folly to go back and try to get it but stranger things had happened of course hardy realized it might also be rons watch with the upheaval in his life since brees death he simply might not have missed it but griffin would have just asked ron about that wouldnt he instead hed taken it as evidence logged to the beaumont case number the problem was that by this time hardy knew the file backwards and forwards and there wasnt any watch in the evidence lockup or anywhere else hardy asked if he might have a copy of the receipt when mr lee returned from making one he handed hardy the copy then clucked sympathetically im sorry i cant help more but i havent even heard about sergeant griffins death until just now mr lee wasnt rushing him but clearly he felt this investigation had little to do with him or his staff it had taken enough of his time on a work day hardy couldnt shake the feeling that there was more here there had to be hed referred again to the notes before coming and griffin had included his maddening exclamation points but now they were moving toward the exit the words fabric wash came to him so he stopped at the door mr lee one last question do you do any clothes cleaning at all laundry work say one of your clients leaves a pile of clothes by a washing machine would you dump it in for them or dry them the proprietor considered this then shook his head we remove window drapery occasionally or upholstery fabric but no generally we dont clean clothes and what about brees drapes or furniture did you remove either of those for dry cleaning were there any stains you needed to remove no that would have been a special order and i checked into that with sergeant griffin when he came here and again i am so sorry to hear about him scott randall heard the rumor from one of the other assistant das who in turn had heard it from one of the forensic guys whod worked with sergeant leon timms unhappily cleaning and cataloguing through the night under the back seat of griffins car although glitsky had cautioned timms and his staff not to discuss any possible relationship between the murders of bree beaumont carl griffin and phil canetta by some inexplicable mystery of nature the word had leaked out now randall was at a hastily called late lunchtime strategy session with his boss and his investigator peter struler they had just taken their seats at boulevard an incredibly fine restaurant that was well off the beaten track of the rank and file of workers at the hall of justice pratt still smarting from her dressing down by the mayor was inclined to dismiss the rumor but randall needed her support to move ahead and he wasnt going to let it go i think we have to assume its true sharron it sounds right it feels true doesnt it peter struler was a fifteenyear nononsense investigator and he spoke with a veterans confidence its true he volunteered everybody assumed griffin got hit on some dope sting but he was doing beaumont ballistics confirms the same gun whacked canetta pratts mouth hung open for a moment is that a fact you know that for sure struler nodded as soon as scott told me what hed heard i moseyed on down to the lab checked it out with some of the good guys same gun the same gun pratt was trying to fit this information into her world view the same gun that killed griffin randall explained again but what was canettas connection to beaumont well isnt that funny you should ask randall tried to control an arrogant smirk and wasnt entirely successful he leaned over the small table you know the frannie hardy we took such grief about this morning poor little innocent thing pratts eyes narrowed yes well our old friend her husband the lawyer hes up to his ears in this canetta was freelancing for him for him what do you mean struler butt in harshly hardy was using canettas badge to get information he couldnt get on his own on what randall gestured expansively all of this anything he could but why hed probably tell you he wants to help his wife get out of jail but that doesnt hold up despite the mayor she doesnt get out until we let her go and im not too inclined to go there randall tossed a conspiratorial glance at struler ive got a theory on the real reason hardys involved and peter here doesnt think its too bad pratt took a sip of her sparkling water nodded attentively go on hardy is glitskys best friend right you heard our good lieutenant in your office the other day about what a true friend of his this frannie is what a great person she took care of his kids when his wife died blah blah blah well ask marian braun what a sweetheart mrs hardy is pratt waved that away so whats your theory scott all right listen we all agree ron did this right struler if anything was more certain than randall absolutely he turned to pratt and gave it to her one more time so she would be clear on it straight insurance scam maam bree was heavily insured she was also rons support and had decided to throw him out on the street why pratt asked struler continued he had another girl on the woman pratt quickly corrected him they were talking about multiple murder but some things just couldnt be tolerated even for an instant the inspector made a quick face fixed it and moved on another woman on the side not frannie hardy no maam we dont believe so anyway ive got four witnesses from the building saying theyd seen ron with another woman same one during the day when bree was out working theyd just walk out through the lobby holding hands maybe sit on the bench out front so who is she that we dont know yet well find her anyway the point is bree found out about this how do you know that its a reasonable conjecture randall interjected but maybe she didnt either way it doesnt matter but youll see it fits he nodded back at struler to continue so what finally happened was bree got herself another boyfriend got knocked up and was going to marry him scott randall whispered were hearing it was damon kerry he exulted in his bosss stunned expression there was nothing he thought like a good surprise and he was going to have a couple more for frannie hardy tomorrow damon kerry pratts eyes shone with excitement thats the word on the street struler said its really pretty smart the way theyve figured it all scott said what who hardy and glitsky knowing kerry would have to get involved pratt held up a hand im afraid youre getting ahead of me how is kerry why do you think the mayor wants us to pull back on this just at this time democratic mayor democratic now front runner for governor yes all right but damon scott randall bulled on ahead kerry was having an affair with a married woman sharron during his campaign he got her pregnant out of wedlock he shook his head no no no it just cant come out the da still didnt see it all right but what about lieutenant glitsky where does he fit this to scott randall was the easy part hardy he explained is ron beaumonts attorney right ron comes to him with this problem he knows brees going to dump him so if that happens hes out two million dollars two million the number was new to pratt randall smiled its a nice round motive isnt it struler interjected again and hardys not exactly hauling big coin he hasnt had a worthwhile trial in a couple of years hes doing scratch defense work meanwhile the wife has no job hes got kids in private school moneys an issue count on it you want to go along that road a little further sharron randall added the smart bet says he set fire to his own house yesterday to get some cash in so youre saying pratt was getting into the idea now that hardy and ron beaumont conspired to kill his wife randall nodded beaming with hardys wife as the alibi so where does glitsky fit in struler and randall exchanged glances and the inspector took it what does glitsky make seventy seventyfive hes the head of homicide and hardys pal so they cut him in and its a dead lock rons never arrested glitsky never moves on it period end of story randall picked it up then they run a little squeeze on kerry about the affair with bree which makes him go to the mayor who in turn tells us to release frannie for political reasons yada yada just make the whole thing go away that son of a bitch pratt exclaimed exactly randalls martini arrived and he lifted the olive out of it and chewed contentedly every part of this fits sharron and meanwhile beaumonts killed two other people both cops who were getting the picture pratt liked the scenario but she had to raise an objection except if canetta was working with hardy but scott had an answer for that too canetta was supposed to be digging up dirt on kerry and pierce the caloco guy classic muddythewaters lawyer shit pardon the french some other dude did it then canetta ran across something got wise and tried to cut himself in and ron had to kill him too struler sipped his beer and last but not least randall said then glitsky lays down orders that nobody talks about canetta or griffin or anything else hes quote pursuing his own investigation and ps ron beaumont seems to have dropped off his radar jesus christ pratt enthused if this is true its the case of the decade randall concluded its true struler repeated it all fits a silence descended briefly while the waiter brought their salads pratt played with hers for a moment then put her fork down ok another objection if this was so well planned why did this hardy woman let herself get thrown in jail anytime you want struler answered id do four days for a million dollars but randall answered seriously that was just a dumb mistake like criminals make every day she was nervous and got pissy with braun that wasnt good enough for pratt but what about this secret she couldnt tell theres no secret randall said matteroffactly she got overconfident and was extemporizing she got too cute and talked herself into a corner saying she knew ron and bree had problems but didnt know what they were it seemed an innocent enough question at the time she didnt see where i wanted to go with it and when she found out it was too late so she my prediction is shell back off on the secret tomorrow or make one up struler she does that it locks up this theory randall chewed happily thats my plan he said and meanwhile the man glitskys protecting has become a multiple copkiller pratt was firm gentlemen she said weve got to take these people down from a freezing phone booth on grant checking back at his office for messages hardy learned that the fire departments arson team had called and more or less urgently wanted to chat with him so had three of his clients finally he was surprised at the relief that washed over him when he heard that david freeman had at last come in back on foot from chinatown he made it to sutler street the freeman building where he worked in under ten minutes his old crusty and still apparently bulletproof landlord was scribbling intently on a yellow legal pad at his desk when hardy opened his door i need a moment of your valuable time he said he had scandalized phyllis by overriding her he doesnt want to be disturbed by saying oh ok ill leave him alone then he never glanced back walking directly past her station over to freemans closed door knocking and pushing it open the old mans eyes betrayed him he wasnt really as annoyed as he sounded although he did pull an hourly billing form over make a note on it and growl valuable doesnt begin to describe it and i am on billable time here diz you want input right now its going to cost you everything does sooner or later hardy closed the door freemans hair was doing its einstein impression and the rest of him was decked in his usual sartorial splendor dead cigar in his mouth tie askew wrinkled shirt unbuttoned the coat of his shiny brown suit draped over his shoulders phil canettas been killed hardy said soberly you hear about that the old man put his pencil down i saw something in the paper this morning hardy was a couple of steps into the large corner office when the door opened again behind him phyllis im sorry mr freeman i told mr hardy you didnt want to be he brushed right past me and freeman held up a hand its ok dear emergency she spent another instant perfecting her expression of displeasure though hardy didnt think it needed much work at all then she made an appropriate noise of pique and backed back out dear hardy said you call her dear she is a dear freeman said controls the riffraff element i couldnt survive without her hardy shook his head youve got to get out more hed made it to freemans desk pulled around a chair plopped his briefcase and opened it he picked up as though theyd been talking all morning you were right about griffin that we ought to start with him i thought we were on canetta both freemans eyebrows went up another question and hardy sat down telling him about the ballistics confirmation both men shot with the same gun the rest of what he knew it looks like it wasnt more than a couple of hours after he left here he concluded where was he just inside the presidio i didnt read anything in the article about griffin or bree beaumont either glitsky wants it quiet for now damon kerry is definitely involved so there are as they say political ramifications freeman didnt respond in any way so hardy went on reciting the facts as he knew them by the time he finished freeman was sitting back in his chair his hands linked over his comfortable middle his neck rucked down into his ratty tie his eyes closed his chest rose and fell a couple of times slowly he raised his head and squinted across the desk so where are you now hardy reached forward and lifted the stapled and markedup copy of griffins notes from his briefcase griffin found something im convinced its right here he passed the pages over the desk the yellow highlights the bassett eyes came up baleful humor i guessed that after a moments perusal he flipped back a few pages nodded came back to where he was and looked up again so griffin eliminated ron hardy leaned forward himself where do you see that patiently freeman went over it this first entry r at eight oh five ncd with the exclamation marks r has got to be ron dont you think eight oh five is when he left for school with the kids too early to have done it ncd is no can do you got all this already right sure hardy said feeling like a fool ncd he thought no can do just like wcb meant will call back but hed never before run across the former sure he repeated ron was out ok freeman nodded i suppose the timing was right for him now whats this herit i just came from there its the cleaning service that did brees place he leaned across the desk tuesday and thursday as it indicates they do brees on thursday so it was after the crime scene had two days there by the way its not there but griffin found a watch at the scene and tagged it into evidence when on thursday heritage found it and gave it to griffin and crime scene didnt on tuesday i dont know hardy said i guess not glitsky would say theyre overworked and underpaid its gone now in any event freeman was nodding distractedly his eyes never leaving the page never mind never mind here it is again this fabric wash r stains did ron what was this semen i dont know i dont think she and ron were sleeping together now freeman did look up they had separate bedrooms hardy went on definitely bree and maybe ron too were involved with other people sexually charming freeman replied the modern couple so you read the autopsy was there any evidence of rape that morning intercourse no hmm rug stains hardy shook his head crime scene would have them oh yes those competent crime scene analysts freeman thought another moment then pointed to the briefcase do you have a copy of the police report in there hardy handed him another folder and sat while freeman leafed through to the page he wanted she was wearing a darkblue cottonblend skirt and pullover powderblue sweater panty hose black shoes halfinch heels ah here we go what weve got what youd expect blood and dirt but theres also a rust stain on the left hip and on the hem of the sweater rust when she went over the balcony hardy said its an iron grillwork railing well there you go freeman pleased with himself leaned back in his chair again so why does it say fab wash thats got to mean forensics didnt find anything on the fabric right but they did find blood dirt rust maybe its some kind of detergent maybe it just means there was nothing on the drapes or the rug or the upholstery all of which was true those fabrics were a wash maybe it still troubled hardy griffins damned exclamation points were all over the place with the cleaners and this note and he couldnt make them mean anything but freeman on his billable time wasnt wasting any of it to his satisfaction hed solved the mystery of what the r stood for so he was moving on now down to the phone call so hardy brought him up to date about brees call to kerry when he finished freeman looked perplexed but you say the call wasnt at nine oh two no it was earlier it began at ten after seven so whats this nine oh two i dont know thats what i mean david about griffin having it here but i cant see it i figured it was a time that would lead us to kerry and it did but then the time was wrong so its not a time no look back thats how he writes his times everything eight oh five eleven fortyfive now nine oh two freeman gave it another minute then waved a hand all right lets pass on that and go on whats bax t the last person we know of to see griffin alive maybe the very last hardy went on to explain about thorne and elliot and glitskys probable warrant to look for printed materials if abe finds evidence on any of about four fronts i think we can stop looking freeman drummed his fingers a couple of times so why are we doing this you and me before hardy could respond the drumming stopped did canetta by any chance work for this thorne guy not that i know of sometimes jim pierce in what capacity security at hotel conventions like that but not thorne i dont know i hadnt connected thorne to any of this before yesterday so i never asked freeman pressed it well think about it wouldnt the ethanol producers have conventions here too i mean this is convention city usa and all of them need security right if canetta was in that loop one of a hundred cops doing freelance a shrug it was obvious and you know for a fact that thorne is involved with kerry too through sko yeah close enough the old man cleaned an ear with his finger ok so whats this last thing burn or brown and then a dollar sign hardy sat back this old master is why i have come to you although wait a minute let me see that he studied the scrawl for the tenth time brees maiden name was brunetta this might say brun hows that he passed the pages back not impossible freeman said maybe thorne was blackmailing her about something in her past when she was brunetta in any event it looks like griffin found some kind of money connection and maybe called thorne on it hardy recalled the box of caloco documents in glitskys kitchen rons or had it in fact been brees talent for creating wealth or at least substantial lines of credit had thorne tried to get bree under his control and by extension under valens and kerrys control by threatening to expose her financial shenanigans or even better ruin her credibility and reputation with kerry in the same way hardy finally sat back freeman regarded him intently you think thorne did your house too dont you it was freemans first mention of that incident and perhaps as hed intended it caught hardy slightly off guard as youd say i dont think its impossible freeman nodded sagely and when you went to see him this morning were you packing then too i know the expression is lawyers guns and money but guns dont really belong a sheepish grin flitted for a moment over hardys face david was truly terrifying he saw everything i thought i might need some protection but freeman wasnt laughing i dont think so i think if he had given you an excuse hed have a bullet in him right now now unbidden the grin flickered again the old man pointed a finger listen to me diz youve got every right to hate the man but its up to the law to punish him not you youve already put this where it belongs in glitskys corner dont get yourself killed over it too many people have already two of them carried guns and knew how to use them does that tell you anything hardy nodded they didnt shoot fast enough again there wasnt any sign that freeman thought this was funny he checked his watch looked down and wrote something thirty minutes at two hundred an hour comes to a hundred bucks ill add it to the rent upstairs in his office hardy called the tollfree movado number and gave the serial number of the watch to a helpful operator all she could tell from the number was that the watch had been sold within the past five years in san francisco at the jewelry exchange there was no record of the buyers name the administrative offices of the main fire station on golden gate avenue did not bear much resemblance to the hall of justice here the expansive lobby was open to the public without the benefit of metal detectors and police guards in the doorways the milling crowds of discontented lowlifes that were a common feature in and for blocks around the hall were nowhere to be seen instead the marble walls inscribed with the names of the heroic dead of the department seemed to shine with pride wellappointed business persons came into the building and walked purposefully to the elevators in which they were whisked to their destinations so hardy had no premonition of dread as he walked through the fifthfloor office labeled arson investigations after leaving freeman hed gone upstairs to his own office and returned phone calls for the better part of a half hour he called bill tilton the insurance agent and pretended he was a potential employer of marie dempsey shed faxed him a resumé he said but he couldnt make out the phone number or address too clearly tilton inadvertently breaking every confidentiality law in the book gave him what he needed in the next call a secretary with the arson unit told him that they wanted to talk to him at his very earliest convenience if he would give them a time he could drop by the main offices this afternoon the investigators would be there for him hed made an appointment for one thirty assuming that the urgency was that they wanted to assign liability back to him his first sense that things were not right came as the secretary directed him not to one of the investigators offices behind her but to a small empty office with a scarred metal table in the middle of it and four wooden chairs along one wall hed been in enough of these and immediately recognized this for what it was an interrogation room he didnt have to wait long to find out he hadnt even taken a seat walking to the one window he looked down and out to the west visibility was a couple of blocks and suddenly hardy felt a chill of apprehension he turned quickly intending to walk out and invite whoever wanted to talk to him down to his turf to the solarium freeman had counseled him to leave the police work to glitsky and it was good advice but he knew more than glitsky and he had a deadline there was much he still had to do he couldnt afford to be detained here but as soon as he looked he knew he wasnt going anywhere soon three men were standing in the doorway in a pack mr hardy how you doing have a seat friendly as undertakers the last one in closed the door recognition kicked in this was not the amiable captain flores but the man whod been so uncooperative and surly yesterday afternoon he identified himself as sergeant wilkes no first name and folder under his arm he was running the show this is my partner sergeant lopez and this he said indicating a wiry young cowboy in a denim jacket is sergeant predeaux predeaux leaning one shoulder against the wall opposite them broke an icy smile over the toothpick he was chewing rhymes with pladough he said sergeant predeaux wilkes added is with the arson unit too hes one of our police members sergeant lopez and i were with the fire department good the antagonism was already thick in the room hardy determined not to add to it if it could be helped put on a face so what did you find wilkes made a show of opening his folder from hardys perspective as a lawyer there wasnt much in it a schematic of the house a couple of pages of notes and perhaps a formal report still wilkes took his time going over it silently while everyone else waited finally he decided the moment was right weve got clear indications of accelerant petroleumbased probably gasoline on the front porch there is a lot of technical detail supporting our conclusion but basically we have determined that this was in fact an arson occurrence both from the rate of burn and the initial call reporting the fire we can pretty closely pinpoint the start of the blaze to about three thirty am sunday morning this wasnt any surprise to hardy but the next line of inquiry though no less surprising given the circumstances here was unpleasant lopez shifted next to wilkes as though hed been restraining himself he spoke up we understand you werent sleeping in the house that night is that correct hardy shifted his eyes from one man to the other he made it a point to nod and answer in even tones thats right did i mention that to captain flores i was with my children at my inlaws and why was that why was what why were you at your inlaws because my children were there it was halloween night hardy said they were staying with their grandparents and i wanted to be with them youre married arent you was your wife there yes im married he said evenly and no she wasnt there you having marital problems lopez asked mr hardys wife is in jail predeaux said although it didnt seem to come as a shock to either of his colleagues hardy paused thats a long story weve got time wilkes smiled insincerely hardy returned it im happy for you but as it turns out i dont predeaux moved a step forward did you make it a habit of staying with your inlaws this finally was enough of a press that hardy straightened up in his chair sat back and crossed his arms i dont believe this he almost barked out a laugh but stopped himself you guys talk to my inlaws theyll tell you i was there i didnt burn down my own house for christs sake were they awake at three thirty yeah hardy replied crisply we were all sitting up telling yarns around the campfire theres an interesting choice of words wilkes said oh yeah hardy replied very telling he came forward in his seat look guys i thought i was coming down here to get the lowdown on your progress and maybe get my house turned back over to me so i could get to work rebuilding it you got insurance wilkes asked he sighed wearily yes sir ive got insurance thank god predeaux piped in replacement value or loss value another aborted chuckle you know you may be surprised to learn that i havent checked the policy lately i dont have any idea he shook his head this is ridiculous if were going to continue in this vein i suggest we make another appointment and ill bring a lawyer you think you need a lawyer lopez asked hardy assayed a cold smile heres a tip sergeant everybody needs a lawyer he pushed his chair back and stood up and squared off at predeaux am i under arrest are you seriously thinking of charging me with this cause if you are i could use the money the false arrest lawsuit will bring in funny you should bring that up predeaux pulled a chair around and straddled it backward he transferred his toothpick to the other side of his mouth you a little short on money who isnt hardy shot back whats the matter with you people im the one who got his house burned down ive got at least two reliable witnesses wholl swear i wasnt anywhere near the place and guess what i wasnt were looking into it as you say predeaux responded well good luck with that or with finding any evidence which by the way guys is generally one of the traditional steps in a criminal investigation hes pretty confident isnt he lopez asked confident enough hardy had had all he could take of this they had no grounds and no evidence and he had other places to be so sergeant predeaux am i under arrest or not the other three men started holding a silent conversation hardy butted into it sergeant wilkes when do i get my house back that hasnt been determined well hardy snapped when you get finished wasting your time and do determine it you know where to reach me sergeant predeaux he repeated am i under arrest or not he stood by the door for a moment waiting im taking your silence as a not that makes this your lucky day by the time he parked again in the western mission he had gotten his anger under control to some degree although considering the purpose of this visit he didnt think hed be able to squelch it entirely he did however derive some pleasure from david freemans latest wisdom regarding his weapon hardy after some real consideration decided to leave the police special in the trunk of his car for his visit to the fire department this he realized turned out to have been a good idea driving out to the mission he imagined a scenario where predeaux had in fact decided to place him under arrest if hardy had had his gun with him he would have been sorely tempted to pull it out get the drop on these three clowns and lock them in the room while he attempted to locate ron beaumont this of course would have ended his legal career and maybe killed him in the bargain it certainly would have curtailed his mobility in the next twentyfour hours what with the manhunt and all but because of freemans little lecture he hadnt brought the gun in hed have to remember to thank the old man marie dempseys place was on church street about a block from hans spreckmans an authentic bierstube which hardy considered to be on a par with schroeders downtown which in turn had a reputation as the best german restaurant in the city the neighborhood had a certain friendly charm in spite of the overwhelming preponderance of pavement and stucco and the lack of trees lawns and shrubbery maybe it was the scale of the buildings or the trolley that passed on church street every half hour or so today though a wet and heavy cloud still hugged the earth and hardy felt at one with it the address was the upper unit of a duplex in a square gray twostory building with an internal stairway from his experience at the airport hilton hardy thought there was little to no chance that ron would open the door to a knock or a ring this was the reason hed finally opted not to try and call the various numbers hed collected on the m dempseys of the city but rather to discover the address on his own he didnt want to give ron any warning of his visit so he walked up the stairs and stood by the door and listened a mans voice singing quietly to himself was barely discernible inside there was definite movement footsteps he pushed the doorbell gave it very little time then pushed it again the footsteps had stopped so had the concert whoever was in there was alone hed be very surprised if there were children after another short wait he knocked desultorily walking back down a few of the steps making his footfalls as heavy as he could he then crept back up to the landing and waited about two minutes later the doorknob turned and hardy hit the door hard leading with his shoulder there was a satisfying bit of resistance and then he was inside hovering over the man hed knocked to the ground hi ron howve you been struggling to get up mr hardy dismas please after all weve been through together i think were on first names by now ron was on his feet again and broke a nervous smile all right dismas he let out a long breath you may not believe this but its good to see you hardy was brusque its better to see you where are the kids they just went to the store for a minute with marie after a beat ron offered a resigned shrug another attempt at an ingratiating smile youre pretty good he conceded i have my days hardy admitted closing the door behind him when he turned back again to ron this time he was glad he had it hed taken his gun out from his waistband holding it so ron could see you dont need anything like that maybe not hardy said but then again maybe i do so i figured id be prepared either way the gun had rons attention no doubt about it he couldnt take his eyes off it so what are you going to do now not me us they were in a small foyer hardy motioned over to the living room visible behind them now were going to wait for a little while and youd better hope your kids come back with marie in a reasonable amount of time or else you and i are going to take a ride downtown and do what and tell a da named scott randall anything he wants to know ron took a seat on a low leather couch hardy still pumped up remained standing my understanding ron said was that you were going to wait until tomorrow then frannie was free to tell anything everything and the children and i would be gone he clipped out the words yep that was it but but now shes not sure she can do it why not ive hardy raised his voice its not you god damn it its not anything you forbid or allow its her he shook his head reining in the emotion and got his voice under control the way she sees it as soon as she tells them your situation your kids suffer theyve got to move and start over but thats not frannies doing it still galled hardy to hear this man refer to his wife so familiarly but there was nothing he could do about that now he bore some of the responsibility for that himself no he said and as soon as they indict you which is tomorrow its going to happen anyway so whats her problem with it hardy suddenly felt stupid holding the gun tucking it back into his belt now invisible again under his jacket he stepped across to a wingback chair and sat on the edge of it across from ron she doesnt see it as a problem he said shes willing to trade a few more hours in jail to give me a few more hours he stopped to find who killed bree hardy leaned forward and eyed him coldly yes he said to find who killed your sister ron didnt give it up right away he put on a quizzical expression as though he really didnt understand what hardy had just said you mean my wife bree i mean bree all right hardy replied but she wasnt your wife she was your sister for the third time since theyd arrived a cable car rattled by outside on mason shaking the floorboards of the apartment the conductor had a heavy hand with the famous bells too ding ding ding ding ding glitsky had always been under the impression that sounds were muffled by heavy fog but this clanging certainly was an exception to it he decided it must affect only the lower register the shaking under him increased and for an instant the lieutenant thought it might be a real earthquake thornes work area was a desk in his living room up against the front window overlooking the street glitsky had been going through a stack of computer printouts and now pushed the ergonomic chair back a couple of inches ready to bolt for a doorway if things began to fall around him its hard to believe that people pay real money to live with this experience on the couch behind him jorge batavia patiently lifted another page of printed matter from a suitcase hed placed on the coffee table he scanned it quickly and set it on the pile of rejected paper next to him its newage therapy he said every fifteen minutes you get to wonder if your building is going to fall down the sergeant put aside another page you think youre going to die four times an hour you squeeze what you can out of every minute your life experience is enriched the shaking had stopped punctuated by a last burst of clanging good theory glitsky pulled forward again and went back to his stack of paper there was also a computer on the table but glitsky didnt dare even turn the thing on he thought there was a reasonable likelihood that the thing was boobytrapped so he had placed a call back to the hall to have one of the cyberspecialists come down and unplug it then bring it downtown for examination it wasnt as if he didnt have enough to look at thorne put out a prodigious amount of paper and glitsky and batavia had been at his hardcopy files for almost an hour batavia and coleman had been checking in at homicide after glitsky had returned to the office with his newly signed warrant he had asked batavia to accompany him on the search of thornes place while coleman went to talk to jim pierce again about his activities on saturday night while glitsky and hardy thought they might be closing in on damon kerry perhaps through some agent of baxter thorne coleman and batavia had moved pierce up a notch or two on their possible suspect list this was mostly because a review of the business calendar hed provided for them had revealed another questionable alibi a twohour gap after brees funeral during which hed had lunch alone at a crowded chinese counter restaurant this was when someone had killed griffin and made it three out of three for pierces squishy alibis that in turn piqued the inspectors curiosity but glitsky had developed a personal hardon for thorne as hardy had pointed out even a tenuous connection to the weekends water poisoning at pulgas was going to make life very difficult for mr thorne if they found any tiein to bree beaumont it would even be worse between him and batavia theyd already done a thorough job on the kitchen the waste baskets and garbage cans in the bedroom there was nothing in or taped under any of the drawers of the dresser or night table nothing tucked between the box spring and the mattress glitsky went to the computer table while batavia checked the bedroom closet and found shoes and hanging clothes and the suitcase filled with propaganda batavia brought the suitcase into the living room but thus far theyd found nothing at all no longhand drafts or fragments of the damning press release no final or proof copies no printing or copying bills the rest of his records were similarly disappointing his bills and check register revealed nothing unusual phone electric rent credit card payments if he hired operatives he kept no records of them here there werent any random keys apparently he didnt own a gun when glitsky could free up another inspector or two by christmas he intended to do a similar search on the offices of fmc although hed believed that his best hope on thorne was an unexpected search of his apartment but maybe he was wrong after another few minutes he heard batavia move behind him well that was a slice glitsky turned around and saw the sergeant returning the large stack of pamphlets letters and other reading material back into the suitcase all of these are older weeks even months nothing on pulgas he closed the suitcase and stood up ill keep looking glitsky heard a key in the front door he pushed the chair back and stood up as a short welldressed man appeared in the alcove he wore a hat with a small feather in it gloves and a tweed overcoat behind him stood the building manager whod let abe into the apartment and then apparently called thorne at his work the dapper man stared at glitsky with a dead expression then transferred it to batavia as he entered the living room from wherever hed been his tone was completed uninflected what is the meaning of this outrageous intrusion youre mr thorne i presume glitsky had his search warrant in his pocket he extracted it and held it out to the man who glanced at it contemptuously making no move to examine it glitsky shrugged and in a few words introduced himself and explained the basic situation im afraid he concluded that im going to have to ask you to leave the premises while we continue here thorne didnt even blink no sir i refuse to do that ive called my attorney and hell be here shortly and put an end to this he was taking off his overcoat hanging it on a peg in the alcove planning to stay he wont be able to do that sir glitsky held all the cards here and he knew it this is a legal search conducted pursuant to a murder investigation baxter the manager interrupted shifting from foot to foot in the stillopen doorway if everythings all right here ive sure daniel thorne thanked him courteously and he backed out on to the porch closing the door behind him but the suspect hadnt lost the thread he came back to glitsky asking quietly whose murder james allen browning of pescadero ive never heard of him he was the victim of the clean earth alliance attack on the pulgas water temple the other day that again this time he allowed a tone of suppressed anger he rolled his eyes again glitsky asked thorne ignored the question and you think i had something to do with that on what grounds justifiable grounds mr thorne glitsky replied a judge signed the warrant thats all you need to know now im not letting you into this apartment until were finished here as a courtesy well bring a chair over and ill let you remain in that alcove with your lawyer when he shows up but nobodys touching anything here until were done do you understand the men were standing two feet apart thorne huffed replying perfectly glitsky crossed the room said a few words to batavia and went back to the desk the cable car went by again as batavia brought two chairs from around the kitchen table through the living room and into the alcove then he lifted thornes overcoat from its peg as glitsky had instructed him hey what do you think for the first time thornes voice rose glitsky was up as if shot out of his chair his own voice harsh with authority you stay right where you are jorge make sure he does while youre at it have him give you his wallet and check his identification i wont you damn well will batavia said glitsky took the overcoat from his sergeant and now held it up to his face hed smelled a strong odor as thorne had removed the coat and hung it up it hadnt been there when glitsky and jorge had entered the apartment and then suddenly with thornes arrival there it was gasoline reaching into the pockets one by one his hand closed around what felt like some kind of charm extracting it carefully he instantly placed the piece it was at least an exact replica but glitsky would bet it was an original of one of the handblown venetian glass elephants that hed last seen dancing across the mantel over hardys livingroom fireplace sergeant coleman was having trouble getting through to jim pierce whose patience had all but run out colemans had as well hed been kept waiting for nearly a half hour and now as hed finally been admitted into the vice presidents office had been told by pierces secretary that the next meeting started in ten minutes pierce was behind his desk distracted no hand shake papers to be signed decisions to make he looked up at coleman the inspector he said could talk but hed better talk fast these continual interruptions were far beyond reasonable getting near to the point of official harassment if they continued there were likely to be consequences the power play had its effect on the young inspector the corner office was vast ornate intimidating windows and views high enough to be over the fog coleman squirmed in the ultramodern wooden chair really more a stool with sides than anything a body would choose to sit in or on it crossed colemans mind that this might in fact be a special chair positioned in front of pierces desk for unwelcome visitors to keep them from getting too comfortable to make sure they wanted to leave soon homicide inspectors are not a particularly reverent bunch most of them had seen everything at least twice and coleman was no exception but sitting in pierces office he found it next to impossible to imagine that the man who presided here would ever need to have recourse to murder coleman didnt really believe it but he did at least want to nail down the facts if for no other reason than that he wouldnt have to be in this position again i realize you have cooperated up to now sir and were grateful for that cooperation well this is a fine way to show it what more could you possibly have to ask me that you havent asked already we tried to reach you yesterday sir about saturday night i know he reached for a fountain pen signed something put the pen back blew on the signature and moved the paper to one side then immediately he started reading the next one he didnt look up my wife told me you had come by again about a police officer this time sergeant canetta yes sir i do know that name where do i know he had worked security for caloco at several events finally pierce stopped fidgeting thats it he was the man who was killed yes sir this seemed to affect pierce somewhat he sighed deeply and his mouth grew compressed his brow furrowed im sorry inspector im sorry for my rudeness earlier im under some pressure here but thats every day and its no excuse i can understand how you feel when your colleagues are he straightened in his chair all right go on what do you need to know id like to know where you were on saturday night in spite of the apology impatience thrummed under the surface may i ask why that would be important what did my wife tell you coleman said nothing and pierce got the message although it didnt make him any happier he sighed again i was home until early morning perhaps dawn then i went down to my boat in the marina but you were home during the night i just said that yes alone pierce nodded is that so strange sergeant my wife had gone out to a party that i didnt want to attend did your wife see you when she got home a short laugh what did she tell you then ruefully i doubt it i spent the night in my study he met pierces eyes we fought about the party that i wasnt going when it was over i heard her come home but wanted to see if shed come to me and apologize when she didnt well i got my back up so you slept in your study not much i was pretty mad and couldnt sleep most of the night i watched some television do you remember what i dont know really some payperview sports i guess mindless junk whatever was on i dozed on and off do you know offhand the company that provides your television service coleman asked no pierce said no idea sorry do you know yours do you mind if i check i dont know i but then pierce brightened slightly although the smile didnt exactly light up the room oh i see sure of course whatever you need to do coleman with relief pushed himself out of the chair from hell thank you for your time sir i hope we wont have to bother you again pierce sat still for a long beat then shook his head in disbelief before you go inspector maybe you can answer me one question if i can all right is there any reason on gods earth why i might have wanted to kill sergeant canetta since thats what i presume this has been all about he did some security work for caloco ok where what type of security work and then what i didnt even know the man i doubt if i could pick him out of a crowd he paused and spread his hands appealing to reason i just dont understand is he related to me in some other way coleman heard him out he really couldnt blame him for being angry and frustrated but he wasnt going to give away anything that his boss had told him to withhold its a routine investigation he said thats all it is thanks for your time that is a coincidence baxter thorne was telling glitsky but these little elephants are widely available you can buy one at any quality gift store its my lucky charm ive carried it with me for years another question another simple answer as i have already told you dismas hardy was i believe the name of the gentleman who came by my office this morning and made some threatening remarks glitsky still hadnt let thorne enter the apartment proper he sat on one of the chairs in the alcove and the lieutenant hovered above him beyond that i cant say i know anything about him thorne was completely unruffled going on again answering glitskys next question in his maddeningly even voice he even produced a reasonable facsimile of a heartfelt chuckle i filled my tank lieutenant then im afraid i committed the cardinal sin of topping off it got on my coat glitsky was coming around to a profound appreciation of just how slick this bastard might be when the telephone rang behind him batavia picked it up listened for a moment then held it out to glitsky its for you vince glitsky told thorne to stay where he was and crossed to the desk pierce is clean at last coleman began and went on to explain what hed learned at caloco then he lowered his voice to a whisper can you still hear me barely thatll have to be good enough we got people here ok ok so im writing up this pierce thing at my desk and guess who drops by he just left like five ago ranzetti glitsky frowned jerry ranzetti was with the office of management and control a department which used to go by the name of internal affairs if ranzetti had come to homicide he was on the scent of a bad cop and this wasnt good news for glitsky the homicide unit was small thirteen men and one woman and abe felt he could personally vouch for the integrity of each one of them i gather it wasnt a social call well he pretends i pretend back then he says oh yeah maybe there is something maybe i heard something about it maybe i could tell him something maybe glitsky said about who coleman paused and the voice when it picked up again was nearly inaudible thats why i called abe the guy hes sniffing around it was you when did you know ron asked i had a pretty good idea by the time i saw your bedrooms but i really didnt put it all together until i realized you must be having a sexual relationship with marie brees having an affair youre having an affair but somehow you were a happy couple comfortable together contented it didnt make sense the only thing i dont understand is why you went to all the trouble why couldnt she just have remained aunt bree at the time that option just seemed to leave us with a lot more to explain to everybody we met nobody questions a man and his children and his new wife but a man his sister and the mans kids thats different its a weird setup with a way better chance of striking somebody as funny and we couldnt have that youve got to understand im wanted for kidnapping maybe child pornography this is serious shit they are on me we had to look exactly like a normal couple not mostly exactly and for a long time we did except for the affairs ron shook his head ok we had to keep the affairs secret but since thats generally the nature of affairs with people who are really married its worked out all right so you and marie how long has that been going on a couple of years and shes ok with that she didnt push you to get married he sat back on the couch crossing one leg over the other no to get divorced from bree weve had a few discussions about that let me tell you but that was before bree died since then i think shes waiting for an appropriate time to pass my mourning period he added uncomfortably so marriage hasnt come up yet are you telling me she didnt know about bree she still doesnt nobody does hardy sat back himself giving that a minute to sink in the kids ron beaumont shook his head no they were two and three when we moved out here maybe theyd heard of bree as their aunt but they didnt remember so after awhile she was just bree their stepmom a far better life than what they were used to so what about dawn this brought rons defenses up suddenly he was all the way forward on the couch by his body language ready to spring at this threat to his children even if it was at a man with a gun what about her thats my question he stayed forward tensed his hands clenched in front of him hardy waited him out gradually the words started to come i had never met anyone like her even remotely like her i was a junior at wisconsin i met her in the library of all places she was working on her masters thesis sociology so she was an academic too ron laughed no although she was smart i suppose no i know very smart too smart what does that mean he drew in a breath and blew it out heavily she didnt feel anything or no thats not precisely it more like she decided what feelings were rationally defensible and the others she just didnt acknowledge she wasnt going to live a pawn to her weaker emotions which ones were those oh you know the conventional ones that hold us all back but especially women at least according to dawn love need compassion anything that stood in the way of her getting what she wanted which was a shrug pretty simple really the usual money power excitement hardy almost laughed at the absurdity he was hearing and she was getting all this as a sociology major ron shook his head no she started as a topless dancer by the time i met her he paused she called herself an actress he sighed when i think back on it what drew me to her was this sense of i guess id have to call it danger he fell silent again go on hardy prompted him do you mean physical danger another empty laugh yeah i suppose even that or at least it seemed that way to a sheltered kid from suburban illinois she was four years older than me and really nothing was offlimits physically at the time i thought id died and gone to heaven i mean heres this totally unconventional free spirit in an unbelievable body and shes in love with me and of course were both invincible immortal nothing can touch us we can mix and match with other couples do every drug known to man hang out in places i wouldnt go near today he stopped and seemed again almost to ask hardys permission to continue i look back on that now and it seems impossible like i was another person how long ago was all this hardy asked twenty years something like that a nod you were another person this seemed to soothe ron somewhat and he went on i think what i regret most is that both my parents died during this time in the first phase when dawn and i were together and how long was that that phase five years maybe a little more did they ever know what she did oh no she was a student like me but my dad especially saw through her saw what she was he tried to tell me but i wasnt ready to hear anything critical from my hopelessly unhip father i mean he sold insurance for a living he was in the rotary club the holy name society what in the world could he tell me only everything hardy said seriously the comment made a connection exactly but i was out on the sexual frontier and he didnt have a clue i even thought he was jealous of me again that distinctive hollow laugh so of course i gave up on them not her and then dad died and then two years later mom he looked down at his hands so you were married five years not yet we were free we didnt need the piece of paper so what did you do were you an actor too no he thought for a moment i still dont know why chicken maybe screwing on film was too far for me to go like some part of me knew id outgrow all of that someday i didnt want any record of it that wasnt dumb no but it wasnt something i planned either i cant take any credit for it that i was this virtuous guy it just happened so what did you do the question seemed to embarrass him not much to tell the truth dawn made sporadic but pretty decent money and i had majored in finance so i managed it we had enough to get by and the main thing was we didnt want to be tied down to jobs we had to live so what changed i guess i did hardy didnt want to admit it but there was a charming selfeffacing quality to ron beaumont as everyone else who knew him said he seemed to be a great guy it wasnt any increase in wisdom he admitted candidly just age maybe my conventional background started to catch up with me i dont know but i figured wed done the bohemian thing and it was time to move on frankly the scene was getting old not to mention us so she got pregnant we got pregnant then she decided to have an abortion we had a huge fight over it she was going to do it anyway and she did and i moved out he sighed then i think for the first time she couldnt handle the emotions she was thirtyone years old the biological clock was ticking pretty good the whole thing just tore her up she was shocked that she couldnt rationalize some way to handle it but she couldnt and you got back together he nodded we got married i started working as a teller in a bank we had cassandra a year later we had max she hated it what the whole thing babies crying puking diapers no sleep but mostly the boredom being with them all day she hated what i was doing my job she hated that we had no money but you know the funny thing whats that hardy recognized serenity in the mans face i loved it i loved them it was as though somebody just flicked a switch and suddenly i saw everything differently it made sense this was what we were here for certainly it was what i was here for this was an incredibly difficult thing to hear ron was describing hardys own feelings at the birth of his first son michael who had died in infancy that tragedy had plunged hardy into a cold and dark void from which he thought hed never escape but nearly a decade later the births of rebecca and vincent had rekindled a flame that had burned brightly for several years more recently though it had dimmed to where it now mostly felt to hardy as if there was no light or heat only ash covered by other stuff that didnt burn at all he wondered if under it all the last embers had truly died and if not if there was a way to coax a new flame to life when this was over he promised himself he was going to try so what happened next hardy asked about what youd expect up to a point ron replied fights more fights still more fights she wanted to go back to work and we fought about that doing what shed been doing he shrugged she said it was all she knew i told her to learn something else she was a mother now think of the kids did she want them growing up in that environment and what did she say she said there was nothing wrong with that environment it paid well and provided a valuable social service he rolled his eyes in frustration i was being inconsistent i was becoming too conservative i was a hypocrite you name it i was it so she went back to it not right away not for a while why not id like to believe that it was my strength of will a dry chuckle i didnt give in but she really couldnt stand being at home and i wasnt putting the kids in fulltime daycare so we switched big mistake on my part as it turned out why was that because she was then the good working mother and i was the nearly unemployable dad the courts like mothers best anyway for custody and when the dad doesnt have a real career he shrugged hes dead meat so she went to work hardy had to know what had happened ron nodded some office job which of course was incredibly boring and didnt pay anything like she was used to she wanted out but i kept wanting to make the family thing work he sighed anyway we made it a couple more years with me not working bad bad mistake but finally i had to get another job too rons eyes grew hard he was sitting on the front inch of the couch again his hands clenched so hard the knuckles were white which is when he said she started selling the kids marie and the children finally arrived back at the duplex which truth to tell was a great relief to hardy belief in ron beaumont and his idealistic overthetop melodramatic perhaps heroic story had grown in him over the past days to have it revealed now as false just when hed come to accept it as the truth would have seemed a joke almost too cruel to endure they spent a few moments explaining hardys presence and involvement to a skeptical marie but ron and the kids cassandra particularly convinced her that hardy was on their side he could be trusted absolutely he was cassandras hero clearly she was thrilled to see him again and so glad it was she whod finally convinced him to help them he told her hed made a lot of progress hed give her a final report tomorrow she loved that otherwise they were the wellmannered children theyd been at the hotel although hardy was delighted when ron had to tell them to stop bickering over whose turn it was to get to choose the video they were regular kids after all much like his own it continued to be a relief marie a handsome physically confident yet softspoken woman in her late twenties put on a brave front but rons situation with the children here was precarious enough without the added bonus of a stranger even if that stranger was presented as their savior and because life was never simple hardy got the strong impression picking up on the household banter that the near future of ron and marie as a couple was in doubt if it turned out that ron decided to relocate tomorrow with the children it wasnt at all clear to hardy that marie would be joining them or that she even knew this was a contingency plan but after the kids had retired to the television the two of them unpacked the bags with the practiced efficiency of a longterm couple when theyd finished marie broke out a beer for each of the men hardy stopped her oh marie excuse me have you all been here all weekend marie looked to ron except just now to go get groceries but yesterday the day before what is this ron asked hardy motioned for silence then backed him off gently with a palm marie were all of you here all weekend she met his gaze frankly yes ron got here midday saturday and we all got settled then sunday you remember was so bad the weather we just stayed inside and played games and watched videos what about saturday night what about it did we go out why would we go out i dont know im asking no she threw a quick glance at ron a small prideful smile definitely not the satisfied lover then last night max had night terrors we were up half the night she crossed her arms ron tells me tomorrow hell be able to go home weve kind of been making a game out of this is that what you wanted to know exactly hardy said marie nodded the worry back on her face she spoke to ron if you need anything just yell all right she closed the door to the kitchen on her way out telling hardy it was nice to have met him he didnt completely believe her although he did tend to believe what shed said about saturday night and if ron had been here with her he hadnt been out shooting phil canetta but the questions had ruffled rons feathers what was all that about hardy was matteroffact that was about proving you didnt kill bree which is an issue to more people than youd like to believe by the way do you now or have you ever owned a movado watch you know the museum timepiece little dot at twelve oclock ron was getting sick to death of all the questions by the way isnt this getting a bit much hardy didnt respond waiting him out wearing him down no he answered finally did inspector griffin ever ask you the same thing about a movado watch no why no reason hardy said now the day of brees funeral tell me about that jesus christ i dont see ron hardy was firm humor me frustration showed in his face but resolve must have shown more clearly in hardys what do you want to know i want to know what you did what the kids did where you were for hardy it was a fundamental recital at eight oclock ron and father bernardin had hosted a breakfast at the st catherines rectory for the pallbearers four of the other soccer dads and hed of course kept the children out of school so that they could be with him the funeral mass had been at ten at around eleven fifteen accompanied by marie the children the priest the pallbearers and a couple of other acquaintances from ron and brees limited social circle he drove down to colma where she was buried both kerry and pierce had been to the funeral neither had attended the burial there was a short graveside service after which ron took marie bernardin and the kids to lunch at the cliff house he dropped max and cassandra back at merryvale at around two about the time carl griffins body was discovered there could no longer be any doubt ron hadnt shot carl griffin which meant he hadnt used the same gun to eliminate canetta and finally at long last it was a near certainty he hadnt killed his sister as hed sworn all along as frannie had believed as hardy had hoped ron beaumont was innocent it was a huge load off it was galling for hardy to realize he could have known all this on friday night saturday evening at the latest if only ron hadnt felt the need to bolt but there was nowhere to go with that ron had in fact called him on saturday had tried to cooperate he hadnt known what hardy was going through the only thing for hardy to do now was get his remaining questions answered while he could he willed a neutral tone and began all right ron here we go again ok tell me about bree and damon kerry youve gotten to him huh im not surprised ron sat back and tipped up his beer do you think he killed her ron had given this question a lot of thought and he gave it some more now the problem ive always had is pure logistics how could he have done it thats not so hard he comes by your place after youve taken the kids to school they talked that morning you know kerry and bree i know this was a surprise do you know what they talked about no not specifically i think they just talked they did all the time but look the mans running for governor he doesnt just stroll down the street and kill somebody maybe he drove parked in the basement ron was shaking his head and what if somebody sees him down there or in the elevator and why she was pregnant no they loved each other they were talking about getting married thats what bree and i were having our problems about ron spun his bottle nervously on the formica table this wasnt my finest hour he said at last i was upset enough with her when she started hitting the newspapers in connection with kerry why was that though exactly because bree isnt the most common name on earth if dawn ran across it how would she do that isnt she back in wisconsin why wouldnt she she reads the paper california news plays everywhere i thought she hated the kids when they were babies after she saw how lucrative they could be he trailed off certainly she fought like hell for the custody judgment she thought they were her property and after she got the judgment after you hardy still had trouble with it took them id think bree would be the first place shed look thats right but it wasnt as though the courts judgment came as a surprise bree and i had months to prepare when we got out here to california i was ron beaumont recently widowed for over a year the kids and i lived in an apartment in oakland keeping a low profile what did you do for a living i mean what i do now computerbased financial work i work from home so you stayed in oakland until the investigators stopped coming around to bree right then we started dating and had a small private wedding and no one knew you not as brees brother no wed lived completely separate lives since i went away to college at that time bree was like fourteen then she came out here for grad school while i was living in racine none of her friends even knew of me not that she had that many he shrugged it was a perfect fit it was also a hell of a risk another shrug high risk high return it was the best option there was no way i was letting the kids go back to dawn he struggled to try and make it clear see she really believed there wasnt anything wrong with what she wanted to do what she did societys just too puritanical sex is natural if some people are uptight thats their problem not kids though nobody thinks its ok with kids ron appeared at a loss if hardy didnt know this well check it out somebodys taking ten million pictures a year a short silence fell both men reached for their bottles anyway ron continued back to it say dawn sees bree in the paper something clicks same name same field she checks into it even a little and finds out beaumont used to be brunetta my name im dead the kids are dead he sighed so yeah we had some words about it so what did she say bree it wasnt just saying ron said its hard to explain but it was like all of a sudden she just became an adult the ugly duckling hardy said right im not saying she hadnt been an unbelievably generous sister all for the sake of my kids she never told me anything about her other men though i knew she had them it was kind of tacitly understood between us that none of them could ever be serious because her first duty was he motioned to the back of the duplex to those guys in there thats what shed signed on for but why did she ever agree to do that i mean it was so unusual i think that was part of it if i thought id been raised conventional at least i broke out of that at about twenty bree was twentyeight she had her doctorate and her new job but shed really never experienced anything in the real world so suddenly this gave her a purpose she had no social life and she loved the kids she was saving their lives you know when youre young youve got all the time in the world you make lifetime decisions like its picking a pair of shoes another silence they both knew all about that so what happened hardy asked finally why did it start to unravel across the table real anguish spilled over into rons face the most natural thing in the world he said ruefully she fell in love she wanted her own life her own family he hesitated then went on and i didnt want her to have it i didnt want to have to change i was furious when i found out shed gotten pregnant by kerry he nodded she was going to tell him i dont know if she ever did it was another issue between us wait a minute you had your identity established so why didnt you just pretend to get a divorce then she marries kerry ron was shaking his head the next governor i dont think so anybody but him maybe but if shes the new first lady of california people are going to be pretty damn curious about her past it would have come out so what did you suggest what was your solution i dont know i thought we could split up now ok then wait a year or two put some distance between me and her if she would only have waited but she was already pregnant shed waited enough hadnt she to his credit ron wasnt proud of any of this she really blew up at me when was i going to let her live her life how could i be so selfish after all shed done for me and the kids he met hardys eyes and of course she was right they came at last to the nub rons initial reaction was a shocked disbelief that hardy would even ask surely he could see that it was impossible ron couldnt do it he got up crossed the kitchen went to the sink and threw some water on his face wiping it dry with a dish towel he stood for a moment leaning on his hands hardy spoke to his back im afraid this isnt a negotiable invitation ron youre going to be there he turned around how can you ask me to do this because its the only way it cant be theyll arrest me i cant let that happen this is precisely what ive gone to all these lengths to avoid ron listen to me hardy stood his jaw set this isnt the grand jury the deliberations arent going to be secret no prosecutor is going to be able to sandbag you and besides i need you to be there for frannie i dont understand why the simple answer is because there wont be a hearing if youre not sitting in the courtroom i promised the judge but that hardy held out a hand and snapped it out listen up ron the real answer and i really dont think its going to get to that but if it does is youve got to be there to tell her she can talk the conflict played in his face but i wrote her that note that she i know what you wrote her hardy snapped that wont play i told you that shes got her own ideas on the timing of this thing and nobody but you is going to change her mind he lowered his voice you owe her this ron you know you do hell you owe it to me ron walked away again the room was too small at the window end he stood staring out at the gray for nearly a minute which seemed a very long time finally he turned back do you know who killed bree i know it wasnt you i can prove it wasnt you ive always heard you couldnt prove a negative hardy had always heard that too but with glitskys corroboration he could make a convincing argument that the same person had killed griffin canetta and bree therefore that may be true he said but sometimes you get a good enough lawyer working on it you can create the impression but ron kept up the challenge and that would be you suddenly hardy had had enough marie and ron and the kids might be playing all of this as some game that would end tomorrow but it wasnt a game and hardy believed with all his heart that it wasnt going to end until he made it happen his mouth turned up though hed gotten beyond smiling thats right my friend that would be me ron stood by the window outside hardy could make out the little boxes on the hillside of twin peaks rising behind them he was surprised to note that it was still light out the fog had lifted to a low cover smudged and dirty ron another long moment i dont have any choice do i im afraid not he stared out the window in front of him then turned and walked back to the kitchen table he sat down heavily spun his beer bottle again and looked up at hardy ill be there hardy studied him for a beat youre sure ron bobbed his head distractedly there was no more hesitation hed made up his mind yes im sure he raised his eyes and offered a smile hardy had wedged him and then beaten him hed be there of course he had to be there was no other choice hardy exhaled in apparent relief ok then ill pick you up here at eight fifteen how does that sound all right ron repeated eight fifteen thats fine ill be ready great hardy again produced a victorious sigh he extended his hand over the table sorry this has been so difficult he said but its going to work out believe me and thanks for all the cooperation today their discussion was over ron shook hardys hand again keeping up the chatter when theyd gotten to the front door hardy paused oh he said one last small thing could i have a word alone with cassandra for just a sec rons visage clouded over but hardy expecting the negative reaction gave him a mantoman smile laying a hand on his arm shes my pal remember he said shes the one who got me into this with all of you its only right we let her in on the plan dont you think they went just outside on the landing by the front door ron and marie and the kids were treating it as a game and hardy made it just another part of the game for cassandra their own personal secret her father had told her she could trust mr hardy didnt he if she wanted to double check with him they could call him out here and ask but then there was a chance that max would hear the reason hardy wanted to talk to her by herself why they were alone out here on the landing was because her dad didnt want to have max get all upset that she was the only one he was letting go to the sleepover at rebecca hardys her eyes were bright with excitement rebeccas having a sleepover i love sleepovers and max would have been invited too except her dad had told hardy he needed a good nights rest after last nights terrors vincent was going to be disappointed but hed understand no she didnt have to go back in rebecca had extra toothbrushes she could borrow some of her pajamas it would be a blast but they had to hurry to get to mr hardys car ok they needed to get away before max found out otherwise shed have to stay here and miss the sleepover he stopped five blocks away and put in a gallon or two while cassandra waited in the car inside the station never taking his eyes off her he dropped a quarter into a pay phone maries voice was choked with tension but he allowed her no time to speak either ill be out front at eight fifteen as ron and i discussed cassandras fine erin cochran was as mad as hed ever seen her and hardy thought it likely that compared to her husband ed when he got home from work her anger would appear mild as the driven snow but his concern for peoples feelings werent in his mix anymore he was running on instinct and adrenalin and if the people he loved had a problem with that or with him theyd have to get over it he didnt have time i borrowed her he said just for one night its not funny dismas i dont think its funny i know its pretty damn serious she had all but taken hardy by the earlobe and dragged him inside from the backyard the children oblivious to any intrigue were engrossed with a contraption theyd made up of an oversized cardboard container ropes some plastic lawn chairs and a blanket erin threw an eye at them making sure the adults hadnt drawn their attention then back to hardy i cant believe youre asking me and ed to be part of this it was the only way erin i find that hard to believe and if the police ron wont call the police hardy replied cutting her off he was going to run again and i need him tomorrow to get frannie free now he looked out at the children cassandras my guarantee he shows up but you cant erin he put his hands not quite roughly on her shoulders the harshness he heard in his own voice surprised him but that too couldnt be helped erin listen to me i did it its done its one more night he brought his hands down erins mouth trembled as she fought for control couldnt speak ive got to go he said hunched over he sat on the low upholstered chair by the balcony in the penthouse the drapes were open and when he raised his head he could see off to his left the sunset bleeding a bruised orange into the purple sea suddenly visibility had returned between the cloud cover and the earth up at the north end of the bay he thought he could even make out individual cars on the richmond bridge what had he done what had he done the thought assailed him ron had agreed he was going to do it he would be at maries tomorrow morning so that hardy could pick him up and they could go to the hearing hardy had convinced him that this was what he had to do it was a done deal except hardy had no doubt at all the conversion had been too swift and too unencumbered ron had made a decision all right but it wasnt to show up in court instead hardy would arrive at the appointed hour in the morning and ron and his children would be gone with no trace he needed the leverage of his daughter there hadnt been any other choice but if he were wrong his insides churned and his skin felt clammy in front of him his hands were clenched the only way he could keep them from shaking pushing himself up from the chair he stood still trying yet again to envision the struggle that must have occurred here but nothing spoke to him he crossed over to the french doors unlocked them pulled them open and stepped outside it was all the same the planters with their meager shrubbery the small table and chairs exactly as theyd been when hed first come here three steps brought him across the slippery tiles of the balcony to the rough iron grillwork he tested its strength and found it solid he wasnt tempted to lean his body into it but again hands on the rail he was drawn to peer over and down to the enclosed rectangle of garden below the sensation the height itself was mesmerizing it held him there while seconds ticked until finally the vertigo straightened him up backing away he shuddered wondering at the primeval power of the urge to fall deaths easy frighteningly inviting availability with one instant of weakness or assent it was unnerving the railing was wet from thirty hours wrapped in fog and he went to wipe his hands on his jacket a foghorn boomed from down below and suddenly he stopped himself rust stains fabric wash he turned his palms up with the sun just down the dusk had rapidly advanced but there was still enough natural light to make out the faint striations for another long moment he stood without moving the switch for the light over the balcony was behind him and he turned around and flicked it the rust wasnt dark on his hands but it had come off the grillwork sufficiently to be easily identifiable again he crossed to the railing but this time he squatted so that the top of it was at his eye level where hed stood the condensation had of course been cleared but beyond that he thought he could make out where his hands had taken the rust swiping the arm of his jacket strongly over the area the smooth and rugged goretex caught in a couple of places and then when he pulled it away the railing had left a line of rust on it but far more importantly the metal itself reflected what hed done the top thin layer of rust had wiped away it was subtle but unmistakable and it led to a similarly unmistakable and startling conclusion if brees body had been dumped over this railing with sufficient friction to leave rust stains on her clothes two things should have been immediately apparent to even an inept and overworked crime scene investigator the first was there would have been a noticeable if not obvious spot on the railing where the rust had been disturbed and the second hardy thought would have even been more telling his own spaceage jacket had caught a couple of times when hed swiped at the railing bree had been wearing cotton and wool the threads of which would have snagged all along on the rough ironwork of the railing his brain was spinning as he stood again and looked down over the lights coming on in the city below he didnt have to go back and check any of his folders the contents of his briefcase hed memorized most of that long ago anyway one of the most perplexing aspects of the crime scene investigation into brees death had been its inability to produce even a shred of physical evidence to tie any suspect to events in this room on this balcony and now hardy understood why that had been fabric wash no trace of fabric on the railing david glenn the building superintendent remembered him and said he could come in but they had to keep it short glenn had to keep working his friends would be showing up any time for cards and monday night football and if the food wasnt laid out the shit hit the fan so they went to the clean brightly lit kitchen where glenn continued to arrange the cold cuts and cheeses the breads and pickles and condiments hardy who by now had pretty much given up on the idea that hed ever eat regularly again stood by the counter and tried not to notice the food i dont know exactly glenn was saying hardy had asked him how many people resided in the building and if glenn was familiar with all of them theres only a couple of places the beaumonts and then the mahmoutis on four that have kids then mostly couples three or four singles say forty give or take altogether fulltime tenants well glenn studied an olive and popped it into his mouth owners i told you before some of these people i never see never glenn considered almost some of them i could pass them on the street how can that be easy really the place is designed for privacy you got your parking space under the building you take the elevator to your room some units nobodys ever home you ask me nobody lives there but we get the checks couple of them are companies you know hold the places for their executives when theyre in town he must have seen hardy eyeing the food hey you hungry you want a bite thats ok thanks do you know who the companies are offhand sure theres just two of em standard warehousing i think theyre out of phoenix and some russians diamond merchants they say talk about never here so other than those how many units dont have regular tenants he chewed another olive its not something i give much thought to maybe two id say maybe three is one of them nine oh two he stopped chewing stopped fussing with the food and gave hardy his full attention is this still about bree hardy nodded would nine oh two have a balcony directly under hers a slow nod yeah all the twos are the back units rita browning and who is she do you know her not from eve he shook his head shes one of em the last person hardy wanted to see was abe glitsky and now carrying a brown paper bag here he was being shown into the solarium by one of freemans young associates aside from hardy and freeman two other associates labored at the table drawing up subpoenas for the hearing in brauns courtroom the next morning freeman whistled happily tonelessly annoyingly but none of the worker bees joined in this was not volunteer overtime freeman had knocked on office doors interrupting recruiting and theyd barely begun after the subpoenas were prepared they were going to serve them well into the night we need to talk the lieutenant said hardy gestured apologetically to the people working for him sorry he said five minutes glitsky wasnt so sure he faced down the impatient stares and responded calmly maybe a little more the frustrated comments of the young associates were not quite inaudible as theyd trudged up the stairs hardy closed his office door behind them and turned on the lights glitsky wasted no time were being set up as he explained it hardy went over and sat down heavily on the couch his papers and research materials were still spread all over the coffee table in front of him but they seemed somehow unimportant anymore old news irrelevant kind of like himself from what i can gather glitsky concluded the das new theory is that were running a coverup protecting ron beaumont youre his attorney im your friend were all going to make a lot of money on brees insurance thatll be fun hardy said grimly when that happens i think so too glitsky wasnt smiling either i hear youre pretty strapped for cash i wouldnt even put it past you to burn down your house how about that just as a stopgap measure before i collect on bree it was a small relief to understand the grilling hed taken with the fire inspectors that afternoon somebody had pointed in his direction as the arsonist and now he knew who it was this boy scott randall is a menace abe you put him with pratt and they start doing the tango together watch out im watching but they do have me thinking ive got to release the information about griffin and canetta being tied to bree beaumont why is that to prove that youre trying to find who killed them what do they have on you what could they have on you i havent arrested beaumont you know where he is no hardy almost laughed well there you go thats a pretty good reason yeah but theyre getting me on appearance they cast ron as the obvious suspect and im not looking for him im covering for him youre looking at the facts instead how about that thats how its supposed to work i know i know glitsky heaved a great sigh youre right not often enough hardy said but every once in a while and this is one of those times although this was pure bravado in fact the situation was worse than glitsky suspected would anyone randall or pratt or the internal affairs people believe that hardy had known of ron beaumonts whereabouts and hadnt told his friend the lieutenant it was unlikely further if hardy did tell glitsky where ron was now and he had no intention on that score what was his friend supposed to do become an accessory to the federal crime of kidnapping place hardy under arrest or even if hardy could somehow downplay what hed done with cassandra was glitsky supposed to put ron into the system the very result hardy had struggled to avoid at such great cost he couldnt tell him there was no way but by not telling him he was leaving glitsky vulnerable to the charges that randall and pratt were asserting against him and that could cost him his job his credibility his honor what glitsky asked nothing i dont know maybe an idea hardy pretended to search through the pages laid out on the table in front of him here he said right here brees funeral what about it smoothly deceptive hating himself for what he had to do he began to walk glitsky through it he said it had just occurred to him that maybe ron had an alibi for the time of griffins death after all maybe the priest at what church was it now st catherines maybe hed been with ron for most of the day or at least some reasonable portion of it the important times taking care of the myriad details abe remembered didnt he when his wife flo had died hed been at the synagogue from early morning until late in the day had anybody ever checked with ron what hed done it was after all his sisters funeral what do you mean sister hardy felt the blood drain out of his face did i say sister i meant his wife his wifes funeral the point is if rons got an alibi for griffin he didnt kill bree did he if you got that you rub it in randalls face that youre not covering up anything why doesnt he get out of your way and let you do your damn job sitting on the corner of hardys desk glitsky made a swift decision and pulled the phone over does it have the number there st catherines it did and when five minutes later he replaced the receiver the lieutenant was close to actually smiling the scar between his lips standing out white everything should be that easy he said ron was with the priest all day his kids a couple of other people thats what it sounded like hardy feigned satisfaction leaned back in the couch and broke his own smile thats great its at least good glitsky didnt skip a beat so that brings us he said back to baxter thorne who as you point out is one slick he was interrupted by a knock on the door hardy got up to answer it david freeman stood in the hallway hands in his pockets five minutes are up he said pointedly one more glitsky said freeman looked at him nodded and came back to hardy if nobodys left down there when you make it back dont blame me ill be right there promise freeman shrugged hed tried and started back down the stairs hardy turned back to abe you heard that he said ok glitsky handed the paper bag hed been carrying over to hardy more stuff for your private collection photos from griffins car the back seat and what theyd tagged earlier only the socalled significant stuff is inventoried but you can check the photos canetta couple of interview transcripts you might have missed also kerry does have a glock its where he said it was and hasnt been fired since it was last cleaned my guess is maybe a year maybe never of course he wouldnt have had to fire it if he pointed it convincingly enough finally i know youre wanted down below but heres the short version on thorne youre going to want to know trust me when he finished with the damning but completely unprovable information on the gasoline and one of hardys elephants in thornes coat pocket hardy asked if they had found any evidence of his connection to sko to the mtbe dump or any other terrorist acts the answer was no but glitsky was pulling another warrant tomorrow sending a couple of teams of search and cyber specialists back to the apartment and to the fmc offices it was going to be the full press with full phonerecord followups and data searches for palimpsest disks forensics teams where are you getting the staff hardy asked i thought you had seven new homicides no troops im reassigning people he said simply they started back toward the stairway its a new management tool im working on called do what your boss asks and see if it improves your life i like it hardy said me too i think its going to work and in case it doesnt he said theres always the fbi as it turned out in the solarium no one had gone home although hardys return to the conference room didnt occasion the warmest reception hed ever encountered still the guys finished the work and left the office spreading out to deliver the bad news to kerry valens pierce thorne david glenn everyone hardy could think of after much debate hardy and freeman decided to serve both randall and pratt with subpoenas as well they would have to appear in judge brauns court for hardys hearing and wouldnt that just fry them he wasnt sure he would call all of these people as witnesses or even most of them but he wanted to keep his options open and the turns in this case had surprised him often enough already he was damned if he was going to be taken unawares in court this strategy though wasnt without some peril the shotgun approach was an abuse of the subpoena power and might even earn hardy a reprimand from the state bar a contempt citation of his own but he was beyond those considerations anymore if his strategy failed contempt would be the least of his problems and then finally at a little after nine even freeman packed up and went home leaving him alone again up in his office his pages spread out before him his mind numbed by the gravity of his decisions the impossibility of what he was considering if rons got an alibi for griffin he didnt kill bree did he hardys own words to glitsky came back to torment him hed used them earlier to convince himself believing them absolutely it was so logical that it had to be true griffin was investigating brees death and griffin had been killed same with canetta therefore they were all somehow connected except if they werent except if carl griffin in the course of poking into lives as he did had discovered an unpleasant truth about the last documented man to have seen him alive baxter thorne and except if phil canetta stumbling upon the thornevalens arrangement after hed left hardy and freeman on saturday night had gone alone after the glory to deliver a cop killer to all the suits downtown in homicide and hed underestimated his man thorne a dangerous decisive quietly confident man of action already armed with griffins gun his adrenalin high from torching hardys house or had that been when he was feeling truly invincible after hed killed canetta and that of course left bree and another killer entirely david glenns friends had begun to arrive he said he wanted to help hardy with but he couldnt just let him in to a tenants apartment he could be fired for that why didnt hardy just come back with the lieutenant with a warrant as he had before but again agonizingly hardy couldnt come to glitsky and the reason was more personal more compelling than anything else he was likely to encounter it was frannie if rita browning the invisible rita browning was another of ron beaumonts credit card identities if griffin had discovered the movado watch in and not in brees apartment after all hardy could not let glitsky get to ron there could be no arrest no police interrogation because if ron continued to deny any involvement in the murder and there was little doubt that is what he would of then frannie would always believe him worse she would also believe that the system had betrayed ron her friend abe had betrayed her and her husband too so if ron had killed bree after all glitsky wouldnt be any help he couldnt be any part of it ron would have to say it himself in front of frannie in open court hardy had to leave here go see his children make sure cassandra was safe slumped nearly reclining on the couch he held his right hand over his eyes shielding them from the overheads his left hand fell on the photos glitsky had left with him extreme closeups of the items under the back seat of carl griffins car then there were the written forms canettas autopsy report his car interviews interrogations forcing himself up he carried all the stuff over to his desk and went down the hall to throw some water in his face when he returned he had a moment of indecision there was no chance that he could analyse any significant portion of all this material what was the point of even starting but this he knew was the devil so he began but after a quick scan knew that he wasnt equipped now to see anything in the photos of the junk food wrappers and french fries that had been under the back seat of griffins car hed try again in the morning but expected nothing instead he turned to the tapes putting one of the microcassettes into his handheld machine he listened to an understandably impatient but finally cooperative jim pierce talking in his office with vince coleman again next was glitsky hardy kerry and valens from last night hardy realized that this case these cases must have gotten inside glitsky as well hed put a rush on getting copies made of everything hed delivered to hardy and then sat on his people to make sure it all got done canettas autopsy especially the morgue was backed up with bodies but the coroner did his work on canetta first hardy realized grimly though that this might not have been glitskys influence after all but a final show of respect for a policeman killed in the line of duty hed been at it for over an hour and the effects of the coldwater splash had long since worn off and here before him now was the technical sheet from the autopsy of phil canetta entry wounds exit wounds a fresh wave of exhaustion rolled over him and he closed his eyes against it and against the other painful reality if he hadnt recruited canetta the man would still be alive the image floated up at him canetta enjoying the hell out of his mortadella sandwich just a couple of days before his cigar on saturday night at freemans the sergeant had been very much alive in tune with tastes buffeted by the storms of love hamstrung by his responsibilities so much like hardy and now in a day gone to dirt clothing powder burns next to the medicalchemical analysis of sugars starches and carbon compounds someone from the coroners office maybe under glitskys questioning had written down in the margin the laymans version of canettas stomach contents cop food his last fastfood burger with a coffee and a candy bar chocolate beef potato almond bread pickle hardy passed over it and went on to blood levels for alcohol nicotine he closed his eyes and saw canettas face again on the bench in washington square his eyes lit up with the memory of bree beaumont the simple joy in his deli sandwich enough enough enough he flipped desultorily through the rest of the pile which seemed to go on and on his office closed in around him and he shut his eyes again just for a second then starting awake realized that he must have dozed still he couldnt quit he didnt know yet frannie still in jail he turned another page trying to will himself to focus it was no use he could barely make out even the letters and those he saw formed words that had lost all meaning part four hardy tasted turpentine in the coffee at the kitchen table showered shaved and dressed he added more sugar and turned a page of the morning paper it was six am he had returned to the cochrans at a little after eleven all three of the children and both adults had still been awake there might have been giggling in the background but the atmosphere in the house was as carefree as an operating room by two after five increasingly firm visits from the adults the kids stopped making noise hardy on the couch in the living room heard the clock chime the hour at least twice after that now he rubbed at his eyes trying to get the salt out of them the sugar didnt improve the java and he set the mug down and massaged his right temple which throbbed dully it was election day the articles contained few surprises the mtbe poisoning and resultant scare as well as his opponents lamebrained response to it had given damon kerry a lastminute threepoint boost in the polls and he was now truly the frontrunner by a nose the chronicle recommended him hardy was gratified to see that baxter thornes libel threats didnt appear to hold much water with jeff elliot the reporters citytalk column didnt directly accuse thorne of anything but did manage to present a litany of facts in a way that led to some unflattering conclusions the column promised an ongoing investigation suddenly vincent materialized at his elbow his pajamas were a replica of mark mcgwires cardinals uniform his stepcut hair was a shade darker than his sisters but still in the general category of strawberry blond his ears stuck out and the face except for frannies nose was hardys exactly do you have a headache youre rubbing your head hardy drew him close mussed the hair hey guy what are you doing up so early its not early well its not late and you didnt get to sleep till almost two oclock that wasnt me vincent said that was the girls i went right to sleep after just a little whispering dad what ive got a question hardy longed for the day when vincent would simply ask a question without announcing his intention to ask one but he could only sigh now shoot he said how come max wasnt invited too how come its always the beck who gets her friends over and i get stuck with all the girls and then they dont want to play with me that was one question but hardy pushed his chair back and pulled vincent on to his lap the sleepy boysmell still clung to his son and hardy held him close for as long as he thought he could get away with it maybe two seconds ive been missing you you know that i miss you too vincent said perfunctorily but youre real busy lately he added parroting the excuse frannie had no doubt always supplied we know that but mom i really miss her and you said shes coming back today its today right hardy tried to ignore the stab that his sons answer had given him thats the plan he said then slipped and added i hope so vincents face immediately clouded but she might not i thought you said it was today it is today dont worry then whyd you say you hoped so shh lets not wake up anybody else ok but whyd you say that i dont know vin i guess because i want it so bad just like you do it was just a figure of speech shell be home today he almost promised but thought better of it a promise especially to his child was sacred the boys eyes brightened home you mean like our real home how can we do that if it was all burned up hardy rubbed his sons back and shook his head framing his reply carefully home isnt just a house vin its where were all together but so where are we going to live then i dont know for sure bud well find a place soon while we get our house fixed up again and we can stay here with grandma and papa ed in the meantime you dont have to worry about that ok ok promise vincent shrugged sure if dad said he didnt have to worry that was the end of it it was going to be all right please god hardy prayed dont let his trust in me be misplaced so why couldnt max come vincent was back on his original track you want to know the real reason he didnt sleep enough the night before so his dad thought it wouldnt be a good idea vincent considered this for a moment his dads nice he said simply hardy could only nod dumbly just what he needed another unsolicited testimonial on ron beaumont from his innocent goodhearted son thats what i hear he said how do you know him school he helps in class sometimes with yard duty hes nice he repeated is your head hurting it must be hardy said i keep rubbing it dont i hardy had gotten into the habit of leaving the house before the crazy rush of getting the kids ready for school kicked in hed given the alternative a try for several years but the routine made him nuts hed get cranky and take that with him to work it affected his performance his job and without that where would they be for the last couple of years hed wake up early have his coffee and read the paper hed go in and kiss frannie awake sometimes theyd talk logistics then hed shake the kids and be out the door so hed missed the rite of passage but sometime in the past few months vincent had learned how to make breakfast french toast pancakes just the mix though i dont do it from scratch scrambled eggs oatmeal you just tell me what and ill do it you dont need any help the look daad he watched his boy adjust the flame under the pan throw in some butter expertly crack five eggs into a bowl and whip them up hardy tried to remember when hed begun making his own breakfasts he must have been about vincents age but somehow hed never assumed his younger child could be that competent not yet not for a long time he was still a baby vincent lowered the heat a fraction i like them a little runny but i can take mine off first if you want them cooked dry thats how mom and the beck like em dry but you know that mom says you always used to cook breakfast so youd know wouldnt you yeah hardy said hoarsely sure at the stove vincent turned at the tone hey he said softly you ok dad as the house started to wake up vincent went back to torment the girls and hardy took his briefcase back to the dining room where he could spread out a bit he heard erin in the kitchen but she didnt come around the corner to wish him a good morning the photos were not so daunting this morning the items from griffins back seat in sharp color focus a juicy fruit gum wrapper two bullets a ziploc bag snack size crumbs inside parking stub downtown center garage dated three years ago assorted coins worth one dollar thirtytwo an almond joy which hardy bet would be pretty stale by now he forced himself to continue but was getting convinced that there wasnt going to be anything here it was a garbage can he flipped the photos and the rest werent any better more stuff from the body of the car proper gilt paper with traces of chocolate more candy several plastic lids from the tops of coffee cups and soft drinks sunflowerseed shells glitsky had also thoughtfully provided a copy of the autopsy report on griffin as well as a final inventory of the personal belongings he carried on his body a ring of keys a swiss army knife a half pack of life savers two ballpoint pens an empty ziploc bag it all looked like nothing to hardy beyond that he was reasonably confident that the lab had analysed every item listed here for fingerprints oils fluids and whatever other tests they ran to find or eliminate suspects the following pages contained the same relative information from phil canetta and his vehicle and aside from demonstrating that he was far more personally fastidious than carl griffin had been provided nothing that hardy could use rebecca stuck her head out of the kitchen door lit up in a smile oh there you are im so glad youre still here she crossed over and gave him a kiss on the cheek snuggled up against him he kissed her back im glad im still here too wheres cassandra she remained plastered against him she forgot to bring clothes you know but i told her she could borrow some of mine she wanted to make sure that was ok im sure that would be fine is she going to school cause shes missed the last few days you know rebecca lowered her voice shes a little nervous i think about what missing school she shook her head shes worried shes going to have to move she said you were helping them but shes still worried she told you about that dad rebecca said seriously we tell each other everything she is like my best friend she checked to see that they were still alone shes all worried about something else too do you know marie hardy nodded i met her yesterday she seems like a nice lady well whys her dad with her when her mom only died like a month ago maybe theyre just friends rebeccas expression was startlingly adult dad im sure cass thinks maybe her dad was already having an affair before her mom died she thinks that would be awful well she whispered urgently you and mom arent with other people too are you hardy pulled her close to him no hon were only with each other promise and were going to stay that way cross your heart he made an x on his chest hope to die he gave her a pat ok now youd better go tell her she can wear your clothes or youre all going to be late for school oh she all but ran to deliver the news hardys eyes followed her out of the room then he glanced down at the pages on the table in front of him casually he flipped through canettas autopsy all the technical minutiae of violent death as it had been with griffin state of rigor body temperature contents of stomach angle of bullet entry it was all too familiar and too ugly he picked up the pages and tossed them back into his briefcase and closed it over them he stood took a deep breath and went into the kitchen to face the chill they all got to merryvale a few minutes early and hardy went in out of cassandras presence to explain the situation to theresa wilson lying he told her that he expected and had been instructed to tell her that both beaumont children would be back in school tomorrow since she and hardy had last talked hed been retained by mr beaumont and theyd been watching cassandra while a few lastminute legal maneuvers were carried out max was staying with some other friends out of town and should be back in school by the next day hardy was sorry for any inconvenience grateful for her forebearance but ron had been afraid of the police jumping to the wrong conclusions as they had with hardys own wife and he hadnt wanted to subject his children to that trauma and upheaval i understand mrs wilson told him from behind the doors of her office i might have done the same thing myself how is frannie holding up by the way i read that she might be getting out of her situation today hardy going for the academy award for best actor conveyed that he wasnt happy about what had taken place with his wife but he was no longer worried everything was under control im going down to pick her up right now he said well then you mustnt let me keep you god speed hardy walked across the parking lot and stopped by the door to his car back toward the school cars were still pulling up and letting out other children the fog he realized had only made a token effort this morning and now there was even a hint of sunshine in the sky he made out a small knot of kids standing by a bicycle rack his daughter was among them and cassandra beaumont hidden in plain sight an objective observer would have concluded that the two men standing on the curb of church street were business associates working out some tedious details in their latest deal both were close to the same age in good physical shape and conservatively dressed in business suits one of them an italian doublebreasted with a deep olive tone the other a brooks brothers charcoal with a microscopic maroon pinstripe a closer look would uncover a different truth both of the strong perhaps even handsome faces were landscapes of strain and fatigue and the deal was not going well listen i want to see her not until after youve testified hows this i wont testify until i do pinstripe smiled coldly maybe youre forgetting that ive still got her its pretty straightforward you want to get your daughter back i want my wife we trade thats the deal thats the only deal you son of a bitch maybe but at least an honest son of a bitch what does that mean it means i havent lied to you as though i have do you think im an idiot are you telling me you wouldnt have packed them both up and been gone when i got here this morning a pause thats what i thought so dont shit me i did what i had to do your daughters safe except for the trauma youve not even that shes not even going to know any of this happened not unless you force me the italian suit walked off a few steps and the other followed im the only friend youve got dont you understand that by now nobodys going to touch you until you tell your story he whirled around and after that after that if youre telling the truth youve got nothing to worry about if im telling the truth i am telling the truth a long silence finally the man in pinstripes stepped off the curb around to the drivers side door of a late model honda get in the car with over an hour to kill before marian brauns courtroom was called into session hardy didnt want to push his luck by entering the hall of justice if he and his prisoner should run across scott randall or peter struler he considered it a dead certainty that somehow they would get ron into custody hardy would be powerless to stop them if they initiated the booking process under whatever guise lou the greeks was dark and private enough few if any of the morning drinkers were going to look up and recognize anybody most of them had personal more desperate agendas of their own for being there at that hour and one of them david freeman was working he was on the first stool at the end of the bar just as he and hardy had decided the night before a couple of steaming mugs of coffee rested untouched on the table between ron and hardy rita browning where did you get that ron was shaking his head apparently mystified he faced the back wall in the farthest booth from the front door no he said hardy was across from him where he could see anyone who entered youre asking me to believe she wasnt one of your credit card names i dont care what you believe but thats right rita browning there wasnt any humor in the moment but ron almost chuckled look i might not be the most masculine guy in the world but do you really think i could pass as a rita browning this hardy had to say was a reasonable point ron amplified it and what was i supposed to use it for to pay the mortgage on another apartment in your building an expression of apparently real perplexity which one nine oh two ron thought about it for second and finally reached for one of the coffee mugs and took a sip and why would i want to do that have another apartment in my own building it was a good question but hardy believed he had a good answer so if you had a problem just like the one youre experiencing now youd have a place to hide out for a while to take the kids until you could relocate well as you say im having this problem now youll notice i didnt take them there doesnt that tell you anything hardy hated to acknowledge it but it did this is gods truth ive never heard of rita browning in my life she owns nine oh two maybe thats the name on the mailbox on her checks david glenn your supe he says hes never seen her how long has she been there five years a couple of months longer than you have as a matter of fact david came on after us ron said helpfully a couple of years later i think its not impossible i suppose that he hasnt met her she makes her mortgage payments for the year every january for the year ron went quiet while he considered this you think ive been paying for two apartments in that building for five years lets say i dont think theres a rita browning all your akas have the initials rb yeah but ill tell you something about those accounts those lines of credit if you studied them at all you realized i never carried any balance in them they were in case things here went to hell a thirtyday parachute maybe fortyfive to give me time to start out someplace else thats all just out of curiosity though how in the world did you find out about those brees files from caloco somebody over there shipped them to the da to make it look like youd premeditated this and planned your escape hardy noted rons reaction unfeigned frightened i didnt see any rita browning in those records its true but i dont think anyones living in nine oh two can you find out have somebody check it sure eventually with a warrant they could take the place apart and might get lucky if thats where bree if thats where it happened but any of that will take time and hardy consulted his watch thats in short supply right about now were in court in fortyfive minutes ron swirled his mug a couple of times his eyes met hardys bree he said thats what im thinking she set up my accounts for me it would have been cake to do one for herself even if this one wasnt a credit card ron lifted his shoulders same thing basically bogus numbers false identity theres nothing simpler especially if your base account is a trilliondollar multinational like caloco banks are lining up to help you out but what would she have needed another apartment for the answer came to both of them as ron spoke love she met men there why not its perfect when i think about it discreet close by no hassles but for this for the mortgage there had to be real money somewhere did bree make enough ron was saying no before hardy finished up until this year she made a lot but not enough for that how much would it be in our building the onebedrooms go for like four fifty our place was seven and a half hardy whistled tell me about it but she got enough bonuses to just cover us he hesitated were still house poor to tell you the truth and after she left caloco he stopped and stalled with the coffee you might as well know maybe you do already we were going to have to move and did you fight about that ron sighed wearily ill tell you by the end we fought about everything it was terrible he hung his head for a long moment then looked up im just so tired his voice was almost gone so incredibly tired hardy leaned over the table did you kill her ron did you kill bree maybe by mistake ron raised his head his eyes reflecting the depth of his resignation and loss you know i didnt she was my sister i loved her the kids loved her she was their mother i never would have even hit her much less killed her i didnt kill her i really didnt even by mistake his hands imploringly crossed the table i wasnt even there i wasnt even there even with freeman making sure at the bar it made hardy nervous as hell to leave ron alone at the greeks he told him to have himself another cup of coffee or something and be at the back door to the hall by the entrance to the jail at nine twenty hardy was marginally confident that hed boxed him in adequately having come this far with cassandra held hostage ron wouldnt run now he hoped it was unusual but hardy had persuaded glitsky to use some juice with the bailiffs so that they would allow frannie to wear a respectable outfit for the hearing so he had to get it delivered to her in time for her to change from her jumpsuit protocol appearances details but he couldnt have it both ways she could take the time to change into pleasant civilian clothes that would subliminally humanize her to marian braun or they could take a last few tense private moments together in the attorneys visiting room there was no choice after she was free theyd have time to visit time for everything it left him with nearly a half hour and he was tempted to go back to lous and sit with ron but no hed worked that through ron would be at the back door at the appointed time he had no other option setting his heavy briefcase on the hard wooden bench just inside the entrance to the jail he once again unsnapped the clasps once again lifted his pages into his lap hed been through every scrap he carried at least once except the final pages that glitsky had delivered last night but now unexpectedly maybe he had just enough time to get through the rest of it not that he thought he would discover anything but if nothing else he prided himself on his thoroughness he wouldnt lose this thing out of sloppiness or fatigue he would be prepared for his hearing when he walked into the courtroom scott randall wasnt going to surprise him with something he should have read should have noticed should have figured out so he started where hed left off canettas autopsy and this time he saw it went back and reviewed griffin crossed the corridor to the coroners and made sure and then finally knowing where else to look went back and found it glitsky was in his office when hardy called upstairs he had sent his task forces out on thornes search warrant which left him free until after the hearing which he would be attending hardy didnt want to say anything over the phone hed see glitsky in five minutes and if they could get any privacy hed tell him then in the meanwhile theyd meet at the back door to the hall as hardy came out of the jail he gave a surreptitious nod to freeman now loitering in the corridor that led to the morgue and continued to the employees back door to the hall the plan was that ron and hardy were going to take the littleused rear stairway to the second floor and make a break for brauns courtroom department when they got out into the hallway glitsky opened the door for them when hardy introduced who they would be escorting however he could tell that it wasnt a pleasant surprise but the lieutenant seemed to accept the situation silently leading the way up the stairs until they reached the landing before the door into the main hallway when they got there though he turned and faced them both you guys just run into each other out front was that it not exactly unruffled hardy had guessed this moment was coming he was ready this time yesterday i had no idea where he was how about when i came to your office last night as a courtesy the last time we talked say was he a suspect then close enough and you by the time you left though honestly the scar was tight on glitskys face but hardy had him he kept pushing ok hes not a suspect had you ever seen him before now a minute ago talked to him you know i havent he growled right listen to me and you had no idea that i had had any communication with him ever did you so what so when our dear pal scott randall asks you maybe under oath whether you have colluded with me andor ron here in any way what are you going to be able to say a vein stood out on the side of glitskys forehead but gradually his expression relaxed though not quite into calm serenity for the record i still dont like it ok noted hardy responded crisply but also for the record youre going to thank me glitsky glared another second or two then turned and pulled open the door the three men stepped out into the open hallway together just as randall struler pratt and several of her minions rounded the corner from the elevator in a phalanx the two groups nearly ran into one another well well well randall made no effort to disguise his reaction in a voice dripping with disdain he adopted a theatrical tone lieutenant glitsky mr hardy the elusive mr beaumont how interesting that you should all be arriving together here at court he turned to pratt a portrait of smug satisfaction case study sharron he said exactly what we expected normally in the minutes before the ascension of the judge to the bench courtrooms pulse with a certain energy attorneys and clients are getting settled at their tables the clerks and bailiffs knot up talking shop and trading banter the court recorder warms up if there is a jury its members read the newspapers or study their notes in the gallery beyond the bar rail the spectators and media types if any jockey for space with potential witnesses with friends and relatives of victims or their alleged perpetrators there is a constant low hum of many unconnected conversations but generally above it all hovers some small but palpable sense of restraint outside in the public hallways hordes of unwashed and unruly animals often put on their raucous circuses but once inside the courtroom doors order often seems to impose itself over those assembled within not this morning though many of the witnesses hardy had summoned to this hearing had brought with them reinforcements and theyd all apparently had time to get to know each other a little to talk to vent finally to boil over as soon as glitsky pushed the door open scott randall and his team of prosecutors sniping behind them all the way a wave of boisterous anger seemed to break over them for the first time in his career hardy physically had to push his way through a mass of hostile humanity clogging the central aisle glitsky stayed with him holding ron beaumonts arm above the elbow moving them all forward hardy pressed his way through feeling no need to respond to any of the barbs he was hearing he was sure that this was a staged demonstration either from baxter thorne whom he recognized leaning against the side wall or from the kerry camp possibly both scott randall was a different story he wasnt anybodys paid actor and he was righteously angry for having to put up with this frivolous hearing for being jerked around by an arrogant defense attorney who was probably a criminal himself well hardy would deal with scott randall when the time came hed deal with all of them he wasnt being drawn into a shouting match with a bunch of enraged witnesses and their friends glitsky got them all through the bar rail and gave the high sign to the bailiffs who came forward to ensure that the inviolability of the courtroom proper remained intact david freeman had somehow already gotten himself seated at the defense table and was watching the proceedings behind him with an amused and tolerant expression the theatre of the law he loved it good morning dismas he intoned looks to me like you might just have hit a nerve and at that moment the blessed voice of the clerk rose above the clamorous din hear ye hear ye department twentyfour of the superior court of the city and county of san francisco state of california is now in session judge marian braun presiding all rise since most of the people assembled were already on their feet the judges entrance didnt do much except provide a break in the hubbub braun catching the tenor of what was transpiring below refrained from taking the bench instead preferring to remain standing she reached for her gavel and slammed it several times until the silence was achieved scowling down at her clerk she whispered sharply mr drummond the members of the gallery will find seating in precisely two minutes after which i shall return to the bench and mete out consequences to those who are unable to do so when she returned braun adjusted her robes and sat hardy was next to freeman at the defense table glitsky and ron beaumont had retired to directly behind them the first row of the gallery turning in his chair hardy recognized valens and kerry and they recognized him if looks could kill freeman whispered to hardy are all the players here except one whos that jim pierce hardy replied caloco you think hell show hardys face was set hed better when braun returned to the bench only one person remained standing sharron pratt was in the aisle in the center of the gallery area madame district attorney good morning braun intoned do you have business before this court yes your honor may i approach mr hardy has a hearing scheduled im may i approach to discuss that hearing your honor braun frowned at being interrupted all right mr hardy hardy knew exactly where this was going after the groundwork hed laid down which he believed would predispose braun to a favorable ruling he had gone a long way toward precipitating it himself by serving his papers on pratt and randall hardy was in fact so primed that he had to work to keep his face straight he stood up i have no objection your honor but i presume my client is in the holding cell behind your bailiff and i wonder if the court would call the case and allow her to enter the courtroom at this time before we take up ms pratts request at sidebar frannie wore a tailored pair of tan slacks and a dark brown vnecked sweater the deepgreen malachite necklace and tiny matching earrings heightened the beautiful shade of her eyes and she had pulled the long red hair back tied it at her neck and let the rest hang halfway down her back when the bailiff opened the door to the holding cell she stepped out and gave hardy a nervous embarrassed smile then let the bailiff escort her to the defense table where she sat next to him he kissed her on the cheek i love you dont worry everythings going to be all right then he stood and approached the bench scott randall got himself insinuated into the proceedings on pratts figurative coattails and the two of them now stood before the bench with hardy and freeman randall was doing the talking passionate and persuasive as always and hardy was content to let him dig a hole as deep as he wanted normally no one would be permitted to discuss the internal workings of the grand jury but today randall would have to put his cards on the table to justify continuing frannies contempt citation the grand jury is in session in this very building as we speak your honor considering evidence surrounding the death of bree beaumont as well as those of two policemen who were involved in the investigation into her murder two policemen braun of course had heard about the deaths of sergeants griffin and canetta but the news of their connection to this case was clearly a surprise yes your honor the state believes that there are three homicides related to the bree beaumont case currently before the grand jury because the homicide department under the direction of lieutenant glitsky has systematically refused to disclose evidence relevant your honor hardy was mild this is a habeas hearing whose only purpose is to vacate the contempt citation levied against my client the homicide departments handling of what might be other aspects of this case has no place in this proceeding but randall wasnt buying that with respect your honor no part of this case belongs in this courtroom this is a matter for the grand jury to decide we shouldnt even be discussing it outside of the grand jury room brauns eyes were taking on a telltale flash that hardy liked to see if you want me to keep someone in jail mr randall you have to give me a better reason than your sayso with all due respect your honor you need no more reason than the witness refusing to answer material questions next to hardy freemans elbow twitched against him and he cast a quick acknowledging glance at his old ally they had maneuvered randall into this spot and now he had just played into their hands belittling the jurisdiction of brauns courtroom to which she would surely take offense and she did her eyes burned down at the young prosecutor ill decide what issues and what cases get resolved in my courtroom mr randall do you understand that pratt decided to step in your honor perhaps we could adjourn to chambers the judge directed her displeasure toward the da weve only just gotten started here ms pratt she lowered her voice im sure you noticed that weve got several important people out there among them possibly our next governor and im not inclined to take any more of their time than is absolutely necessary anything we could say in chambers we can say right here but randall true to form couldnt seem to let it go and after a short nonverbal exchange with his boss he piped right up weve got a very unusual set of circumstances here your honor i am at this very moment preparing grand jury subpoenas for mr hardy and lieutenant glitsky to testify on matters related to his case they themselves may be open to criminal charges hardy shook his head derision all over his face but he remained silent additionally randall continued the das office has repeatedly requested an arrest warrant for mr beaumont who is seated behind us in the courtroom today even as we speak it ought to be easy to serve the warrant then braun said drily except that the warrant is not forthcoming your honor and why is that hardy finally had to say something because there hasnt been any evidence your honor thats ridiculous randall exploded we have more than enough evidence for an indictment so get one hardy snapped back braun cast a stern eye counsel will address the court not each other is that clear after accepting the nods of apology braun softened her tone now mr randall correct me if im wrong but mr hardys point seems to me to be well taken if you have the evidence to indict mr beaumont present it to the grand jury and it will order a warrant issued thats how its done you should know that pratt spoke up in her assistants defense he does know it your honor but our investigation has been hampered at every turn in this case indeed we believe that mr hardy has influenced lieutenant glitsky to use his position as head of the homicide department to engage in a systematic coverup of mr beaumonts activities hardy raised his hands theatrically your honor this is really beyond the pale but braun wanting to hear more pointed him quiet these are serious charges ms pratt randall took over again which is why your honor we wanted to explore them with the grand jury with the police departments office of management and control and with our own departments investigative staff in other words mr randall it sounds like you want to do all of this investigating except you either havent actually done it or you havent found anything blindsided randall stammered well no your honor of course not we have strong evidence hardy cut him off your honor they have nothing we are developing a case eyes on braun hardy nevertheless was arguing with randall and bringing accusations before there is anything to support them now he turned to look up at the judge if i may your honor i have a suggestion that relates specifically to the hearing you have granted today and will also address the very serious issues and charges raised by the district attorney he paused long enough to make the point and her staff braun was getting impatient she glanced over the lawyers heads to the restless gallery beyond this had already taken too much of the courts time of everyones time all right mr hardy lets hear it but make it fast hardy took a breath he was in the grip of high emotion but it would serve little to play to it when he finally spoke his was the voice of reason the gravamen of the contempt charge against my client the subject of this hearing is her refusal to disclose to the grand jury information relevant to a murder investigation i believe we are all in accord here no one objected both mr randall and ms pratt have been clear and unambiguous that the information my client refused to disclose bears upon the motive mr beaumont may or may not have had to kill his wife isnt that correct neither pratt nor randall nodded their defenses had by now come up so hardy decided to drive the point home more forcefully put another way if ron beaumont didnt kill bree whatever secret shared by my client and himself is not the proper concern of the grand jury or their investigation all right braun said thoughtfully where is this leading mr hardy it is leading your honor to this mr randall has made the point that the deaths of sergeants griffin and canetta were pursuant to their respective investigations into the murder of bree beaumont and i presume by extension that he concludes that all of these killings were committed by the same individual thats exactly our contention randall was glad to be able to get in a word and hardy was happy to let him do it and its a reasonable one to which for purposes of this hearing youd be prepared to stipulate he said pratt saw the trap closing and moved to stop it well i dont know your honor this is a theory weve not yet braun stopped her cold ms pratt ive just heard mr randall say that this is exactly his word what your office believes more importantly if memory serves this is the theory upon which you both have based and raised in open court your accusations against both lieutenant glitsky and mr hardy now which is it did one man commit these murders or not the two prosecutors exchanged glances pratt answered that is our belief yes your honor subject to contradictory evidence of which we may become aware at a later date i would think so braun declared go on mr hardy youve got my attention thank you your honor therefore it follows that if mr beaumont can be shown to be blameless in the deaths of either of the two police officers it may be assumed that he is likewise blameless in the death of his wife thats a nice syllogism mr hardy braun remained tolerant yet unconvinced but blameless is a tall order do you mean to say that you can prove hes absolutely innocent of one or more of these killings normally thats why we have jury trials but we dont get to jury trials your honor until there is a grand jury indictment or preliminary hearing to ensure a threshold of sufficient evidence to where a jury might convict in this case we dont have that and yet my clients continued incarceration is based upon mr beaumonts presumed guilt and not his presumed innocence as the law demands thats rather elegant mr hardy but your honor if new and damning evidence about bree beaumonts murder comes to light after this hearing then my client will have the opportunity to testify again before the grand jury about ron beaumont if at that time she declines to answer material questions she will of course be subject to contempt charges again just when he might have been about to win one on the legal merits to take the investigation back to the grand jury and hold frannie until she decided to talk randall opened his mouth again your honor with respect you cant put mr beaumont on trial for murder right now in your courtroom brauns visage was terrifyingly benign the pupils of her eyes were pinpoints skewering scott randall thats not what i was contemplating counsellor rather it seems to me that the question is whether when faced with what you yourself admit would be compelling evidence of mr beaumonts innocence of the murder of his wife you will seek to reinstate mrs hardys incarceration for contempt which is based upon his guilt do i have your argument correctly mr hardy perfectly so mr randall yes your honor what is your decision im not sure im clear on what mr hardy is proposing i presume he is proposing to call some witnesses at this hearing am i right mr hardy yes your honor sharron pratt was struggling for whatever face she could save and i presume that mr hardy proposes to show that ron beaumont is factually innocent of one or more of these murders is that the case hardy agreed that it was pratt was thinking fast on the one hand she didnt have to reveal what was going on in the grand jury since the judge couldnt know what evidence they had hardy could never prove here that ron beaumont was actually innocent only that it might be less likely that he was guilty she could point that out and terminate hardys end run right here on the other hand she knew that her office really had nothing she wanted badly to know what hardy knew and the public appearance of reasonableness was increasingly important as the mayor and the media bashed her office she decided to let hardy have his show and of course they could crossexamine whoever hardy intended to call we dont object your honor so long as it doesnt take too long all right braun said lets get this show on the road but hardy found himself in an unexpected bind convinced the judge and coerced the da into pushing ahead smartly with his unconventional game plan now be looked out into the gallery and realized that he had to stall he had been planning to start with the testimony of jim pierce and had assumed that like the other witnesses hed served who were now sitting in the gallery pierce would show up on time while hed argued with pratt and randall during sidebar hed expected to turn around when he was finished and see pierce seated in the gallery but now it was time to begin and pierce hadnt yet arrived having gotten to here he couldnt very well ask judge braun for short continuance or even so much as a recess he was going to have to juggle while doing a tap dance and could only hope he could keep the balls in the air until it was time for the main event my name is abraham glitsky i hold the rank of lieutenant in the san francisco police department and currently am the head of the homicide unit and how long have you held that position five years and before that your honor scott randall was on his feet we all know lieutenant glitsky is that an objection counsellor objections like so much else in a court of law were part of the orchestrated ballet of justice and had to be based on deviations from the evidence code telling the court that everyone knew abe glitsky didnt fall anywhere near that category but more brauns response reaffirmed hardys belief that scott randall no longer had any kind of friend on the bench but mr hardy she added lets move it along im trying to make the court aware of lieutenant glitskys credentials your honor all right but briefly please it took less than two minutes five years lieutenant of homicide twelve years a homicide inspector steady rise through the ranks from street cop through vice robbery white collar four departmental citations one medal for valor people could always turn bad of course but hardy wanted to show braun that if someone predicted the next one to do so would be glitsky it would be a pretty wild and bad guess braun had told him to keep it brief and that was his intention with glitsky put him on the stand establish him as a good and honest cop and then see if randall rose to the bait and tried to take him apart discrediting himself in the process thats all for this witness he said cross the young prosecutor couldnt wait yes id say so randall strode up to the witness box and positioned himself squarely in front of glitsky in your position as head of homicide lieutenant were you originally involved with the investigation into the murder of bree beaumont not in a handson way only in an administrative capacity comfortable after years of practice in the witness seat glitsky quickly took the opening randall had provided and outlined his job description he had a staff of inspectors who reported to him and who worked in coordination with a crime scene investigations unit forensic specialists lab technicians and the city and country coroner to gather and collate evidence on homicides in this jurisdiction none of this had anything to do with ron or bree beaumont and hardy could never have introduced a word of it during his direct question glitsky but hed counted on the fact that randall had an ax to grind the young prosecutor wanted to prove to braun that his unorthodox and even extralegal tactics had been justified all along because the head of homicide was corrupt hardy could have objected all day and been sustained but he was happy to let randall hang himself and when your staff assembles this evidence lieutenant and determines that there has in fact been a crime and theyve identified a suspect what do they do next we go to the da who decides if they want to charge the individual and what the exact charge will be firstdegree murder manslaughter that kind of thing and how long does it take roughly from the commission of a homicide until you make this submission to the da it varies widely a couple of days to a couple of years ok randall was covering ground familiar to every professional in the courtroom but obviously he felt he was making his case to braun now he became specific in the case of bree beaumont its been over a month can you tell the court why that is the original inspector assigned to the case carl griffin was shot to death five days after bree was killed that slowed things down somewhat a ripple of nervous laughter spread through the courtroom randall seemed oblivious to it and braun let it pass and at that point did you get personally involved in the investigation no i did not did you interrogate witnesses no did you have occasion to talk to the victims husband ron beaumont no but isnt it a fact lieutenant that this morning you escorted mr beaumont and mr hardy to this courtroom yes thats true but you say you had never before met or talked to mr beaumont no i remind you lieutenant you are under oath a small lifting of the mouth i understand that the answers still no the questions went on rapidly without interruption as randall walked glitsky through the steps of his eventual personal involvement in the case the proximity of griffins murder scene to the residences of bree and the other suspects and finally to canetta and the ballistics test proving that both men had been shot with the same gun hardy picked up no sense of impatience from the judge finally randall got to where hed been heading all along now lieutenant after you had determined that sergeants griffin and canetta had been killed with the same gun did you immediately turn this information over to the district attorney no i did not can you tell the court why that was glitsky turned up to face marian braun it is standard procedure to withhold information from the media so that potential suspects will not be privy to incriminating evidence we might have against them that way if they tell us something that hasnt been released i think this is probably pretty obvious isnt it but this wasnt the media lieutenant this was the district attorneys office with which you are supposed to cooperate why didnt you tell them two reasons one weve had a lot of trouble with leaks everyone in the building knew this was a constant problem although every department accused every other one of being the source of them second a little more prosaically i wasnt sure of any of this until last night if i didnt have this hearing this morning i might have brought the information to the da already hardy couldnt believe that randall still thought he was scoring points but evidently he did and now moved on to another area where glitsky had allegedly failed in his duties lieutenant do you know a sergeant timms yes hes a crime scene specialist did he work with you on the cars of sergeants griffin and canetta yes and did you tell him about your suspicions that the two deaths of these policemen might have been related of course im the one who asked him to check ballistics on the slugs and did you tell him not to mention this suspected connection to anyone yes why was that it was premature i didnt know if it was true you have one person killing two policemen it stirs up the force i thought maybe we could avoid that if it turned out not to be true randall threw his hands up theatrically but it did turn out to be true isnt that the case yes it did and both men were investigating the death of bree beaumont yes hardy was just thinking it was going to be too easy when randall finally hit a nerve lieutenant did sergeant canetta work in the homicide detail was he a homicide inspector glitsky threw a neutral look at the defense table and returned to the prosecutor no he worked out of central station central station perhaps you can tell the court how he came to be working on a murder case he was connected to the case through one of the witnesses wed interviewed who was that jim pierce a vice president for caloco oil mr pierce used to be bree beaumonts employer and hed also employed sergeant canetta for security at some conventions and so on and so on randall aped isnt it true that canetta was in fact working for mr hardy in what sense i mean the sense of working he was his employer on his payroll not to my knowledge no ask mr hardy randall had made the cardinal mistake asking a question in court for which he didnt already know the answer it left him speechless for a beat and into the silence marian braun finally spoke up where are you going with all this mr randall do you have any proof that mr hardy had hired sergeant canetta no your honor not yet then find another line of questioning establish this ones relevance or sit down this courtroom is not the old fishin hole it was a little after ten thirty and braun called for a tenminute recess jim pierce had not yet arrived but the way this freeform hearing was developing hardy thought that even without the oil company executives testimony there was still some chance that he could succeed in freeing frannie and keeping ron and his children out of the system randalls arrogance had played beautifully into his hands and now hardy believed that the judge was primed for his next revelation which should erode the das credibility to the point of extinction as soon as braun was out of the courtroom the familiar bedlam began again at this point all hardy wanted was a few minutes to talk to his wife and to get glitsky to one side but neither of those seemed likely the minute glitsky left the stand he paused at hardys desk opined that hed rarely had a better time in the witness box then said the vibrating buzzer had been going off on his belt for the past hour hed better go make a few callbacks he passed through the bar rail back up the center aisle and out the back doors of the courtroom meanwhile al valens apoplectic was making a racket demanding that the bailiff let him back to see the judge all right he and damon kerry good citizens respecting their subpoenas had shown up after voting but the candidate couldnt be expected to sit here all day he had meetings press conferences fundraising there were reporters out in the hallway already writing stories about his appearance here in a courtroom involved in a murder case baxter thorne sat in the pew under where he had been standing when they had come in he was talking to a welldressed young couple evidently giving them instructions of some kind and hardy was glad that the dapper slimebag chose to remain near the back of the room if he got too close to the man who he believed had set fire to his house he thought there was still a reasonable chance that he might assault him and that wouldnt further his case with braun a wronged ron beaumont wanted to know what hardy was doing what was all this witness stuff how long was this going to take hed thought that hardys idea was to argue for frannies release and ron would be there to make sure she no longer was bound by her promise to him then somehow he was going to get him out of here before randall or pratt could stop him but hed noticed the guards at the doors and now hed seen pratt talking to another one who had come down to the end of his pew what was he supposed to do now hardy calmed him as best he could explaining that he was laying groundwork for the judge glitskys testimony of course didnt legally prove that a bullet from the same gun had killed both griffin and canetta this proceeding wasnt about proof anymore although hardy still hoped that that might come later it was about the das judgment and tactics and brauns faith in them or lack thereof thats the only thing thats going to get you out of this courtroom a free man ron if braun decides that randall needs a stronger case to even consider you as a suspect and now at least ive got her listening ron still didnt like it but hardy had never promised him that he would david freeman kept frannie chatting at the defense table they didnt want her interacting with ron beaumont in any way and it was freemans role to keep her entertained by the time braun reentered the courtroom he had her laughing quietly at one of his stories during the recess hardy had barely had time to get a word in but as they rose for the judges entrance he took her hand and squeezed it she looked up at him and nodded confident in him committed hardy felt he had to establish a few more facts and introduced into evidence the autopsy and coroners reports on the two policemen pratt and randall had no objections to dr strouts findings as to the causes and times of the deaths hardy put it orally into the record according to the coroners report your honor sergeant griffin was shot between ten thirty and about noon on monday october ms pratt and mr randall both accept this timeframe for the courts information this was the same day of bree beaumonts funeral and burial all right mr hardy proceed id like to call father martin bernardin the priest was in his cassock and collar he came through the gallery and up to the stand somewhere between forty and fifty years old bernardin was a trim gray man with an ascetics face after the clerk had administered the oath hardy spent a minute identifying him as the pastor of st catherines parish the church where bree had been buried then father bernardin do you know ron beaumont yes i do and do you recognize him here in this courtroom yes he pointed hes the gentleman in the green suit in the first row over there several members of the gallery strained to look at this key player in all these events there was a low buzz of comment but braun rapped her gavel lightly and put an end to that now father bernardin on october fifth the day of bree beaumonts funeral did you have occasion to spend any time with mr beaumont yes sir i spent most of the whole day with him this brought the gallery to life again but this time braun let the noise die of its own accord bernardin had already said it but hardy walked the priest through the day the breakfast mass burial lunch at the cliff house in other words father he concluded it is your sworn testimony that you were continually in the presence of mr beaumont from before seven in the morning until at least two thirty in the afternoon on october fifth of this year thats correct every minute yes sir and were there other people who you believe could testify to this as well well yes his children some friends it was a long day as funerals often are hardy stood a minute to let the import of the priests words sink in then whirled and faced pratt and randall your witness he said what could they do here was an absolutely credible man of the cloth providing an unimpeachable alibi for their main suspect they conferred for a long moment at their table then pratt stood no questions your honor braun told bernardin that he could step down took off her glasses put them back on and looked from hardy in the center of the courtroom to pratt and randall at their table mr hardy she said your honor its clear from the testimony of father bernardin and there evidently are several other witnesses who can corroborate his statements that mr beaumont could not have killed sergeant griffin if that is the case it follows that he did not kill sergeant canetta and based on our earlier discussion it can then be assumed that for the purposes of this hearing he did not kill bree beaumont brauns face was set counsel approach the bench she said when they got there she turned a hard glare on to pratt and randall it seems to me counsellors that you have wasted a great deal of this courts time to say nothing of mrs hardys when any reasonably thorough investigation into sergeant griffins death should have turned up this rather obvious alibi your honor randall was ready with an excuse at the time i pursued the contempt charge against mrs hardy we were unaware of any connection between bree beaumont and sergeant griffins death hardy had to get it in he worked to keep the gloat out of his voice a connection provided by lieutenant glitsky i might add your honor but braun wasnt interested in excuses she was furious turn around and look at this courtroom mr randall i said turn around ms pratt you might too they both halfheartedly did so and hardy did too noticing that abe glitsky had returned to the courtroom there were other very welcome additions to the gallery as well mr lee from heritage cleaners even though hardy hadnt subpoenaed him had told hardy when hed called this morning that hed try to make it to the courtroom and now he had so too at last had jim pierce he was even now edging his way into one of the rows of seats accompanied by another of the citys wellknown attorneys jared wright and not a moment too soon hardy thought pratt and randall came back to facing the judge look at the number of people you have seriously inconvenienced by this irresponsible pursuit not apparently of a murderer but merely of one person whom the police had not yet seen fit to charge because they had not yet built a case and now it appears that we know why that was dont we she shook her head in disgust this is appallingly irresponsible behavior randall stood silent pratt mumbled something as the gallery hummed braun dismissed them all back to their desks then raised her voice mr hardy braun said i believe i am ready now to rule on your habeas motion hardy was rummaging in his briefcase arranging more papers in front of him on his table he looked up and spoke in measured tones if we can just take a few more minutes this brought a perplexed frown to the judges visage another rumbling in the gallery and do what mr hardy he came out from behind his table and stood in front of brauns podium we have been working on a limited assumption provisionally accepted by both the court and the district attorney that the killer of sergeants griffin and canetta is the person responsible for the death of bree beaumont yes that assumption however is not legal proof that mr beaumont did not in fact either commit the latter act or contract to accomplish the former any suspicion that may one day fall upon mr beaumont leaves my clients future liberty at grave risk i believe i can eliminate that risk with a few more minutes of the courts indulgence the courtroom was stonily silent behind him braun removed her glasses and brought one of the earpieces to her mouth finally she stole a glance at her wristwatch and made her decision and what do you propose id like to call one more witness your honor one more yes your honor id like to call james pierce this is ridiculous hardy heard pierces grumbled outburst from the back of the courtroom but as he turned he saw it was jared wright now on his feet objecting your honor mr pierce has spoken to the police and their representatives at least a halfdozen times he has cooperated with every investigation related to the bree beaumont case and he he was out of his pew into the aisle of the gallery coming forward braun gaveled him quiet mr wright if mr pierce has cooperated all that much before he surely wont mind doing it one more time this is pure harassment your honor and why would that be mr wright wright had made it up to the bar rail because mr pierces employer caloco oil has been a contributor to ms pratts campaigns and a supporter of her administration we have seen today the animosity between the police department and mr hardy here and the district attorneys office as a good citizen mr pierce responded to mr hardys highhanded lastminute subpoena but now to endure another round of questioning on these events will serve no purpose he is not implicated to imply such is reckless at best and criminal at worst braun heard him out then eyed pierce who was standing directly behind his lawyer mr pierce youve been properly subpoenaed to appear and now called as a witness come forward mr wright your objection is noted for the record your honor wright not giving up yes counsellor what now i would ask the courts permission to accompany my client to the witness stand he had endured several police interviews without the benefit of his attorney and i believe braun held up a hand interrupting him mr hardy do you object hardy didnt like it but he wasnt going to say so no objection your honor the oil man hesitated for another instant then angrily stood up and marched up the aisle past hardy to the witness stand wright met him at the rail and now stood at his side the clerk held the bible out for him state your name james pierce mr pierce do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god i do please be seated mr pierce have we spoken before the bailiff had pulled up a chair and now jared wright sat in it next to his client he wasted no time getting on the boards with an objection immaterial your honor braun gaveled him quiet overruled mr pierce the witness spoke you know we have hardy was all business your honor would you direct the witness to answer the question braun did so hardy repeated it and pierce growled out a yes and on that occasion when you and i spoke did you deny having a personal relationship with bree beaumont no of course not i had been her mentor and friend for several years mr pierce did you have an intimate relationship with bree beaumont sexually intimate jared wright spoke up again my client has answered that question a hundred times your honor hes bam mr wright legal objections please all right immaterial it was immaterial but hardy had already pulled a rabbit from his hat with bernardin and braun was inclined at this point to let him go for two overruled hardy bowed slightly thank you your honor mr pierce would you like me to repeat the question this time wright whispered something into his clients ear but pierce brushed him aside no i heard it and the answer as its been every time is still no no you did not have a sexual relationship with bree beaumont thats right arms crossed over his chest and sulking at the mistreatment hed suffered at the hands of the court and his client alike wright sat back in the hard chair hardy noted the change in affect and took it as a good sign he spun and walked back to his table fiddled with some papers and left them where they lay all right did you have a personal relationship with sergeant canetta no i did not but you did know him did you not pierce shifted in his seat answered impatiently i gather he helped to provide security at some caloco events i may have talked to him at those i really dont remember you dont remember hardy repeated and how about sergeant griffin did he interview you pierce hesitated throwing a quick glance toward his attorney this time no reaction was forthcoming so pierce answered yes i believe he did you believe he did dont you remember all right then yes he did and when was that another stutter id have to check my calender i dont know exactly but hardy was sure perhaps i can help you remember mr pierce wasnt it directly after brees funeral no i dont think so you dont think so do you remember what you did do after the funeral mr pierce your honor jared wrights short fuse had lit up again your honor i must protest what is mr hardys basis for any of these questions mr wright isnt on trial here he doesnt have to answer these questions braun pondered it for a moment in actual fact pierces attorney was right and while she admired hardys point he was treating this hearing the same way scott randall would conduct a grand jury proceeding she should not allow this interrogation to go forward the whole line of questioning was suspect but before she could even tell wright that he was correct and make some kind of ruling david freeman stood and came to hardys rescue your honor mr pierce can always take the fifth but things here were getting out of control she tapped her gavel and glared over her podium gentlemen sit down this is my courtroom and i will instruct in the law she turned to look down on the witness mr pierce if you feel that your answers will tend to incriminate you you may invoke the fifth amendment do you wish to do so sweat had broken on pierces forehead and seemed to surprise him as he wiped a couple of fingers across it if he took the fifth he knew that his troubles with the law would only be beginning the police investigation going forward would be relentless everyone had lost track of wrights objection that the original question was immaterial hardy felt he could almost see the thoughts playing in the mans head deciding to take his chances here and now to put an end to the accusations and suspicions it was a joy to watch successful arrogant insulated by money and position pierces world view simply didnt include the notion that mere mortals could best him in a fair fight this was because there could never be a fair fight pierce assumed a fighting pose a palm down on the railing to the witness box and spoke up to the judge i have nothing to hide your honor though i deeply resent these questions and braun had to admit that by permitting hardy to continue without any evidentiary base she was opening herself up to rebuke but lawyers can ask anything they want unless the other party objects and pierce was answering your resentment which is not a legal objection is noted braun turned her attention to pierces tormentor mr hardy she said sternly i will tolerate more questions only if you can provide the court with some kind of evidentiary framework otherwise im going to dismiss this witness hardy stood still for a moment of course your honor he returned to his desk and this time brought a small handful of pages back with him he first showed them to the judge then handed a copy of one of them to the witness mr pierce do you recognize this document pierce gingerly held the paper out in front of him his shoulders slumped visibly wright grabbed the paper from his client while hardy kept talking would you tell the court what this document is mr pierce pierce looked down set his lips looked back up couldnt find his voice nor apparently could his attorney hardy kept up his onslaught would you please identify this document mr pierce for the court pierce seemed not to hear eventually he sighed seemingly unable to take his eyes off the document reading the words silently over to himself hardy its a letter written by you to bree beaumont isnt it more silence would you characterize the document as a love letter pierce did not answer mr pierce would you like me to read the first couple of lines to the court contrary to your earlier testimony isnt it a fact you were having an affair with her by now wright was whispering furiously to his client who seemed not to hear hardy had to give it to him the gears shifted quickly and smoothly damning revelation went to damage control in the blink of an eye pierce flipped a hand trying and failing to make the gesture appear casual it was over long ago how long ago a year five years yes somewhere in there wright was beside himself with frustration and anger your honor let the record reflect that anything mr pierce says is against my advice but pierce had decided on his own approach he broke a cold smile it was unimportant a dalliance that i regret he turned again to the judge out of respect for my wife your honor i tried to keep this from coming out in public it was mistake but if he thought hed get some sympathy from braun he was barking up the wrong tree another mistake is perjury in my courtroom she said coldly hardy kept up the press mr pierce i ask you again when did this affair end perhaps unnerved by marian brauns negative reaction pierce took a moment to reply i said i didnt know actually thats not what you said hardy replied you said it was something like one or five years would you like the court recorder to read back your earlier answer no thats not necessary he appeared to be trying to recall to cooperate i dont know when we broke it off not exactly not exactly isnt it true mr pierce that your affair with bree beaumont ended only six months ago about the same time she quit her job with caloco no it was longer ago than that but you dont remember when he asked exactly no pierce was striving to hold his ground just because i wanted to keep an affair private does not mean i killed her no hardy agreed no it doesnt but i havent asked if you killed her did you kill bree beaumont mr pierce no of course not but you did lie under oath about your relationship with her isnt that so yes i suppose i did but i told you mr pierce did you also lie about your relationship with sergeant canetta a nerve started to twitch slightly to the side of pierces mouth tve told you i had no relationship with sergeant canetta did you not ask sergeant canetta to report to you on bree beaumonts comings and goings after she broke off her relationship with you no i didnt do that and did you not pay him for this service pierces eyes strafed the courtroom then settled back down no no hardy repeated mr pierce did sergeant canetta come by your house last saturday night the night he was killed again the twitch the recovery no and did he not attempt to get more money out of you for misdirecting the investigation into bree beaumonts death away from you no and did you not then invite him into your house to discuss this and then finally a true rise pierce came forward in the box his eyes ablaze now no no no i didnt do any of that youre making all this up to discredit me marian braun finally spoke up the witness has a point mr hardy youre making a lot of accusations without any show of proof hardy sucked in a lungful of air and let it out i have proof your honor he said coolly mr pierce is holding it in his hand pierce still held his letter to bree and now in the suddenly silent courtroom he held it up again but this betrayed the shaking in his hands and he quickly put them down on the railing braun pulled her glasses down on her nose and glared over them hes already acknowledged perjury regarding his affair with ms beaumont mr hardy but that is not murder no your honor it isnt but there is evidence in the letters mr pierce has identified that directly relate to bree beaumonts murder braun hesitated if pierce hadnt already perjured himself shed have stopped this right now but she found herself nodding she wanted to know but be careful mr hardy he nodded if i may your honor id like to read to the court a portion of one of these letters braun nodded i live longing only for you vast love eternal young again overcome with it all untamed hardy didnt wait for the treacly words to have any effect they werent his point nearly each of these letters has a similar poem in it your honor he handed the letter hed just read up to the podium as the court will note the first letter of each line of the poem spells another message in this case i love you as your honor will see this is consistent with every poem in these letters braun turned through a couple of the pages nodding all right the letter that mr pierce now holds in his hand contains another similar poem he came up to the witness lifting the paper from his hands may i he read breaking the lines never have i touched or felt never even knew oh the craving touching wanting only you again he didnt pause mr pierce can you tell the court the significance of the phrase nine oh two the sweat had broken heavily now on pierces face i dont know he said i dont remember you dont remember no this was what hardy wanted to get him in a rhythm saying no before hed considered sufficiently isnt it true mr pierce he continued that nine oh two was the number of the apartment in bree beaumonts building where you would conduct your trysts no i and isnt it true that you and bree bought this place together nearly six years ago pierce cast his eyes out to the gallery no she he stopped she what mr pierce she bought it herself no i dont know that your honor jared wright couldnt stand watching his client selfdestruct any longer this is an outrageous hardy raised his voice over the interruption but you do know dont you mr pierce that apartment nine oh two is two floors directly below her penthouse no i dont think its but hardy at high volume now couldnt stop are you saying that its not directly below her penthouse mr pierce when you know that to be false pierce was unable to answer hardy leaned in to pierce and all but shouted mr pierce dont you in fact know that nine oh two is the apartment from which she was thrown to her death your honor please bam bam mr wright sit down mr hardy fighting to slow his momentum to regain control hardy looked up at the judge his color was high his breathing ragged brauns voice was stern i have to stop this now mr hardy its gone on long enough youve shown the court no evidence that puts mr pierce in apartment nineohtwo no evidence for any of these accusations you said you had proof and presented these letters and this poetry but neither rises to the level of proof mr pierce hasnt admitted the truth of anything youve said related to bree beaumonts murder if you have nothing stronger ive got no choice but to let the witness step down hardy took a deep breath and let it out heavily i do have physical evidence that places mr pierce in apartment nineohtwo your honor the judge too had reached the end of her patience this was clear from her tone if thats true the court needs to see it now hardy walked briskly back to his table and reached into his briefcase and extracted the xerox copy of griffins note about the movado watch that hed picked up from heritage cleaners coming back before the bench he read it aloud and then handed it up to braun as she was looking it over he was talking your honor as you see this note refers to a specific movado watch which inspector griffin took as evidence in his investigation into the death of bree beaumont i am prepared to call a witness mr lee who is in this courtroom today mr lee is the manager of a company called heritage cleaners which cleans apartments in bree beaumonts building mr lee will testify that this watch was found by his staff in apartment nineohtwo of that building on the thursday following mrs beaumonts murder braun looked down at hardy across to wright and pierce then out over the courtroom all right but i dont see she paused but where is the watch itself mr hardy without the watch hardy nodded and pointed to the witness mr pierce is wearing it right now suddenly finally there was a deep silence in the room hardy spoke into it almost whispering mr pierce pierce could not wrangle free he knew that there was evidence of his presence all over that apartment and though this wasnt primafacie proof that hed killed bree he knew what the police would find there once they started looking glass of the type imbedded in brees hairline evidence of the struggle which had ripped pierces watch off he fixed hardy with an empty stare i didnt mean jared wrights voice boomed out in the courtroom for christs sake jim shut up dont say another word and brauns gavel pounded again and again over the resulting uproar glitsky was good about it the court bailiffs took pierce into custody over jared wrights heated objections then there was the bedlam of the courtroom and all of the wronged witnesses whod been forced to waste so much of their day finally the ron beaumont moment apologies and thanks some not altogether light banter about beaumonts daughter who had gone back to school waiting patiently glitsky accompanied hardy frannie and david freeman as they walked through the steps processing her out of the system david freeman left them to go back to work and finally they got five minutes alone in the waiting area of the jail as the female bailiff took frannie back to reclaim her personal effects but frannie wasnt three seconds out of sight when glitsky turned to hardy thats ok he said its not like murders are my job or anything hardy felt bad about the timing of it but there hadnt been anything he could do i only knew this morning abe and i planned to tell you all about it but you remember we had our little discussion about if youd known ron and then randall and pratt showed up in the hallway for their moment i figured youd survive the lieutenant worked it around for a beat still not thrilled but more curious than angry so what was it it wasnt the poems no that was after i already knew it wasnt even the watch at first it was almond roca hardy explained about the bowl of candy by the door to pierces home the stomach contents of both griffin and canetta and the square gold wrappers in both cars i didnt see it at first because of that damned almond joy in griffins car so i see almonds and chocolate and an almond joy i know where they came from right sure except there wasnt any coconut in griffins autopsy so he hadnt recently eaten the almond joy i checked with strout just almonds and chocolate also almonds and chocolate with canetta which made me think canetta came by pierces house to squeeze him grabbed a couple of candies by the door and ate them just before he got himself shot you think pierce hit him at his own home thats my guess they were alone youll find something if you look but im also guessing pierce is going to tell you once they start confessing but you know this glitsky did know it what he didnt understand was why canetta had waited so long to start blackmailing pierce why then why not earlier in truth hardy wasnt sure but my guess is that canetta originally and marginally i might add was willing to buy the idea that the killer had been ron when it became clear to him that it hadnt been from his perspective there was only one suspect left and he happened to have deep pockets he shook his head sadly canetta might have been crooked and confused but hardy had liked him he picked the wrong guy glitsky chewed his cheek for a while griffin had the watch when he went to talk to pierce he said he showed it to him hardy nodded right and pierce thought griffin himself and not the cleaning people had found the watch only griffin knew about nine oh two and the watch was the only evidence so pierce somehow got a hold of his gun and shot him and took the watch back and it almost worked except for the heritage note glitsky could have gone on and on about the note that hardy hadnt shown him but he realized that hed just be whining his friend had done what he thought he had to do and nothing glitsky said was going to change that or influence his future behavior for that matter but there was one last issue so frannie never had to tell rons big secret did she a sideways glance now that you mention it i guess not and theres no chance you know what it was is there what hardy pulled at his ear glitsky started to repeat the question but hardy held up a hand stopping him i cant hear you he said ive got a banana in my ear epilogue on friday march governor damon kerry signed into law a bill outlawing the use of mtbe in california the bill nicknamed brees law by the media was the culmination of the governors main legislative effort of his first three months in office and was popularly viewed as a political and moral victory against the powers of big oil and specialinterest lobbyists kerry was cleaning up the state house cleaning the states water supply there was already talk of a national campaign in his future al valens saw to it that the results of bree beaumonts report blasting ethanol and all other oxygenates never made it to the governors desk in fact the laws preamble praised the epa for mandating the use of oxygenates in reformulated gasoline the states air had improved under the oxygenated formulas and was now at its cleanest in decades oxygenates such as ethanol and mtbe had proven effective in reducing air pollutants unfortunately the petroleum additive mtbe had been shown to be carcinogenic other oxygenates notably ethanol were available in sufficient quantity to supply the states needs mtbes everincreasing presence in the groundwater of california constituted a considerable and ongoing health hazard and from this date forward its use would be aggressively phased out two weeks later at the spader krutch ohio shareholders meeting held in cincinnati ceo ellis jackson proudly read aloud from the annual report embellishing for his audience where it seemed appropriate regarding ethanol production i am delighted to report that the latest battle in the war between the middle east and the midwest has turned for the moment in our favor the increased demand for ethanol as a gasoline additive in many states but particularly in the huge california market has spurred the us government to continue its exemption of the federal fuel tax on ethanol in addition the government has guaranteed to buy every barrel of surplus cornethanol produced in this country well into the next millenium this brought a huge round of applause of course has not come without its costs the corporations state and federal lobbying and education efforts on behalf of the ethanol subsidies during the fiscal year amounted to eight point six million dollars of course last year was an election year we supported political campaigns in all twentythree states that held elections and it is a great pleasure to report that seventytwo per cent of our candidates succeeded to elective office as our political influence increases so inevitably will our lobbying costs but this figure pales in comparison to the fortyfive million dollars profit i repeat this is a profit figure generated by sales of ethanol last year in the united states with its recent banning of mtbe californias use of ethanol is expected to multiply exponentially in the short term and we are seeing similar campaigns in many other regions of the country jackson refrained from reading the next sentences aloud they read unfortunately the markets in california and other states remain undersupplied because of our continued inability to provide ethanol in sufficient quantity and without the government subsidy program at a profitable cost however research on this problem is ongoing currently without government assistance real costs of producing ethanol wages refinery costs tractor fuel to plant and harvest the corn average about one dollar per gallon or roughly twice as much as gasoline fortunately governmental tax credits keep us competitive but clearly this is an area that needs improvement but it was as though these lines had never been written jackson continued smoothly his voice ringing with confidence ethanol profits next year will be in the range of a hundred million dollars and if we can increase our production to meet the needs of the market in the nottoodistant future we can predict profits that may well reach half a billion dollars per year ellis jackson waited as applause rocked the room finally grinning broadly he held up his hands and the noise subsided the ceo leaned into the microphone ladies and gentlemen he crowed triumphantly its been one hell of a year on the following saturday april the hardy kids were spending one last day at their grandparents house now an hour before dusk dismas and frannie were working mostly in silence finishing up the last of the unpacking in their newly designed kitchen skylights white cabinets and fifty additional square feet theyd borrowed from the rooms at the back of the house gave the space an airy open feel they had finally come around to accepting the chinese position that disaster and opportunity derive from the same symbol and so retaining the original homes footprint theyd gone up over the first floor theyd added a new master bedroom and bath this freed up enough space to convert their old bedroom into a family room this meant no more television in the living room a longawaited goal now rational and uninterrupted conversation might have a chance to transpire there hardy had installed a new enlarged fish tank sixty gallons into the wall between the kitchen and the family room behind it so that it could be enjoyed from either side hed bolted an old marlin fishhook into the wall above the new stove and on it in easy reach hung his castiron pan which glistened black with reseasoning and a fresh rub with olive oil theyd stored as much as they could in the back rooms during the construction and over the past three days had done most of the heavy moving now the new furniture graced the living and dining rooms three new ones and the one surviving venetian glass elephant caravaned again on the mantel the new bed upstairs sported a weddingring quilt theyd discovered together in an antiques shop on a family trip to mendocino one weekend tapped out even with the insurance money they were broke as newlyweds after the honeymoon hardy finished stacking a load of dishes into one of the cupboards and turned around surprised to find himself suddenly alone he pushed open the door to the dining room and walked through it passing the sturdy and graceful shaker table and chairs a dozen coats of lemon oil still hadnt completely eradicated the smell of carbon from the old sideboard but the old piece was a comforting presence some connection to what had been before the sun was low and its light streamed through the shutters in the bay windows illuminating the living room frannie was sitting forward on the ottoman in front of what hardy thought might become his reading chair although it was still far from broken in too new to tell you ok she smiled politely quickly just taking a break standing in the opening between the two rooms he studied her face for a minute then pulled a chair from behind him and sat so that he was facing her its beautiful isnt it she said feet planted elbows on his knees hardy took it in the shining hardwood floors the navajo rug the blond leather couch a handful of tasteful new accessories some art with the addition over them theyd been able to raise the ceiling to over nine feet frannie was right it was a little eclectic vaguely santa fe but it all fit together well we do good work his phrasing struck her and the ambiguous smile returned flitted disappeared what he asked we do you know do good work together thats what i just said yes but the difference is that i mean it he looked levelly at her i do too frannie she hesitated then stood up and walked to the shutters where she stood for another minute before turning back to him real life is going to start again here on monday just the four of us i know that school kids all the household errands your work i dont want to get where we were before she gestured around their new home if i dont have you i dont want any of this i mean it id give it all away tomorrow if you start to feel now that you have to work every single minute to pay for it if its too great a burden his hands had gotten clenched it wasnt the work he blew out through his cheeks the work was escape from what the next he barely heard from me he lifted his shoulders then let them down heavily i dont know it was all of a piece i think i forgot we were doing this together this struck a chord and she broke a small laugh well at least we did that together but you know i never did lie to you i never have i know that do you really because its true he considered it then let out a long breath i never really believed it frannie it was just difficult to understand i know she said im so sorry for that she took a tentative step toward him so maybe we can start over new house new attitude ive been trying she came the rest of the way to him i know i have too these past few months with ed and erin theyve been good but it wasnt the routine like the four of us at home and i think the routine is what gets to you hardy eventually answered her you think right so its going to start again he tried to make light of it not till monday but she wasnt giving it up so what are we going to do another sigh how about if you need to confide in somebody you come to me i could try that if youd listen that sounds fair he met her eyes but how about also a little balance between kid things and adult things im not asking for the moon here say seventy thirty maybe a date every couple of weeks frannie had to acknowledge his point i know it got a little too much that was me she straightened him up and sat on his lap but im still going to have friends and some of them are possibly going to be men now hardy almost smiled i wouldnt want to stop you friends are good its possible ill have a few myself females i mean though its not as likely as you and men i dont know she said some women like that old rugged look i dont think it would be a looks thing and what do you mean old well not real old more like mature stately stately i like that he kissed her well and good when it stopped fifteen seconds later he pecked her again stately that he said i believe i will she said and standing taking his hand she led him back past the dining room through their kitchen up the stairs to their new bedroom the next day sunday a strong seascented breeze blew in off the ocean but the sky was a deep blue and the temperature was shirtsleeves all four of the hardys and most of their friends and relatives had gathered to celebrate the move glitsky his father nat and his son orel david freeman ed and erin cochran moses mcguire his wife susan weiss and their son pico and angela morales and two of their kids max cassandra and ron beaumont and his girlfriend marie the hardys backyard was a long and narrow strip of grass bordered by rose bushes the area was between two mediumrise apartment buildings that fortunately caught the afternoon sun it was a pot luck and everyone except freeman had brought a pot of something chili spaghetti cioppino irish stew all of it with salads and breads and the pony keg of beer was on the picnic table now after the house tour and the oohs and aahs the drinks and first plates of food glitsky gave hardy a look and the two of them went inside the house to admire the crown moulding or something in fact they went all the way through the house and out on to the new porch which was twice as wide as its earlier counterpart hardy sat on the new railing but hadnt gotten comfortable yet when the front door opened and david freeman appeared brandishing a cigar i thought id just step outside for a smoke you already were outside david hardy said in the back but the old man clucked at that children secondhand smoke hurts their young lungs if you fellows want privacy though hardy looked the question to glitsky who shrugged it didnt matter if you can keep a secret its my lifes calling freeman responded straightfaced what hardy was facing glitsky ive known about this for a couple of weeks now glitsky said but i wanted to wait until today to tell you something about the symmetry of it all notice how he strings it out hardy said to freeman i was just admiring that the old man responded glitsky rarely smiled but hardy decided that the expression he wore now would qualify as a decided smirk i will not beg he said soberly its about baxter thorne all right hardy conceded i might beg a little within a week of the election during which time glitskys search task force had been unable to unearth even a shred of evidence relating the pulgas water temple attack to thorne or to his company the fmc offices in the embarcadero had closed for good although police investigators had asked thorne to stay in touch two days after fmc shut its doors he was gone without a trace or forwarding address hardy didnt know what he had planned to do with thorne if he ever did catch up with him getting his wife and family resettled at the grandparents had kept him from seeking thorne out until it was too late by the time hardy tried to contact thorne again the man had fled glitsky though disappointed that he hadnt gotten another crack at him thought that all in all it probably was good news for hardy that thorne had left town it had never been one of glitskys goals to arrest his friend for homicide even justifiable homicide there was an attempted burglary glitsky said two weeks ago tomorrow at the georgetown home of a senator from the great agricultural state of new jersey who had recently announced his decision to lead the fight against the exemption on federal fuel taxes on ethanol no one was supposed to be home but the maid had stayed behind and was sleeping in her quarters upstairs when the breakin occurred she kept a loaded gun in the nightstand by her bed you might have read about it thorne hardy said glitsky nodded unidentified for a couple of days and by the time he was it wasnt news anymore it wasnt as if the senators wife shot him or something to give it a profile so it was just another badluck breakin but since id put him on the wire as wanted for questioning i got a call from georgetown pd your man mr thorne is no longer as they say among the quick hardy eased himself off the railing well there it is he said then after a pause how come im not happier about this its a sad thing thats why somebody dying freeman was lighting up his cigar its always sad when somebody dies the sun had gone down ron and marie and the two kids waved and shouted their goodbyes from the front gate on their way out and their laughter echoed back bouncing off the apartment buildings as they trekked to their car hardy stood with his arm around frannie on the porch she leaned into him and said that if she were him shed feel pretty good about the beaumonts they seem happy he admitted thats not what im saying no i know in fact he knew more than frannie did in the immediate aftermath of his investigation to satisfy his own curiosity hed followed up on ron beaumonts story about his first marriage the original custody hearing and eventual judgment had been big enough news in racine but the kidnapping itself had captivated most of the midwest for a couple of weeks it had been relatively easy to follow the story until it became by definition old news and disappeared from print not so simple had been following the trajectory of dawns life in all the newspaper reports on both the custody hearing and the kidnapping max and cassandras mother had been dawn brunetta no one by that name lived anywhere near racine any longer finally hardy had called ron and asked him if his exwife had used a professional name sure hed said amber dawn a sergeant in glitskys detail named paul thieu had come up through missing persons and still prided himself on being able to find anyone in the known world hardy keeping the reasons for his interest to himself some client bet thieu a case of good wine that he couldnt find a pornographic actress who in the last ten years had worked under the name amber dawn and even for a motivated and experienced paul thieu it had taken nearly a month amber dawn aka dawn brunetta born judy rosen had died of a speedball overdose in burbank in in the last five years of her life she had worked intermittently as an administrative assistant and actress with a nowdefunct company called bustin out productions which had done business out of a warehouse in van nuys her birth certificate and other personal effects had been in the apartment she shared with a thirtyyearold actor named dirk balling real name jon stanton she had been fortyfive years old five years older hardy realized than shed told ron thieu wanted to know if hardy wanted to get copies of any of her movies hed located seven of them in which shed had supporting roles he could probably find more for another case of wine although getting the actual copies might take a little digging hardy thanked thieu for his efforts gave him his case of mixed cabernets and told him hed take a pass he had what he needed now on his porch he tightened his arm around his wife he heard his own children playing some madeup game back in the house laughing running around getting crazy and loud it was going to get louder out of control any minute he kissed the top of her head and gave her a smile my turn he said john lescroart john lescroart the new york times bestselling author of such novels as the mercy rule the th juror nothing but the truth and the hearing lives with his family in northern california
