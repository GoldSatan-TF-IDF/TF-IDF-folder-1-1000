jonathan kellerman silent partner the fourth book in the alex delaware series this ones for bob elias if the rich could hire the poor to die for them the poor would make a very nice living yiddish saying special thanks to steve rubin beverly lewis stuart vener david aftergood and al katz ive always hated parties and under normal circumstances never would have attended the one on saturday but my life was a mess i relaxed my standards and stepped into a nightmare thursday morning i was the good doctor focusing on my patients determined not to let my own garbage get in the way of work i kept my eye on the boy he hadnt yet gotten to the part where he tore the heads off the dolls i watched him pick up the toy cars again and advance them toward each other in inevitable collision cah the ringing concussion of metal against metal blocked out the whine of the video camera before dying he tossed the cars aside as if they burned his fingers one of them flipped over and rocked on its roof like a trapped turtle he poked at it then looked up at me seeking permission i nodded and he snatched up the cars turning them over in his hands he examined the shiny undercarriages spun the wheels simulated the sounds of revving engines voom voom cah a little over two big and husky for his age with the kind of fluid coordination that foretold athletic heroism blond hair pug features raisincolored eyes that made me think of snowmen an amber splash of freckles across nose and chubby cheeks a norman rockwell kid the kind of son any redblooded american father would be proud of his fathers blood was a rusty stain on the central divider somewhere along the ventura freeway voom cah in six sessions it was as close as hed come to speaking i wondered about it wondered about a certain dullness in the eyes the second collision was sudden harder his concentration was intense the dolls would come soon his mother looked up from her seat in the corner for the past ten minutes shed read the same page of a paperback entitled will yourself successful any pretense of casualness was betrayed by her body language she sat high and stiff in the chair scratched her head stretched her long dark hair as if it were yarn and kept coiling and uncoiling it around her fingers one of her feet tapped out a nonstop fourfour beat sending ripples that coursed upward through the soft flesh of a pale unstockinged calf and disappeared under the hem of her sun dress the third crash made her wince she lowered the book and looked at me blinking hard just short of pretty the kind of looks that flower in high school and fade fast i smiled she snapped her head down and returned to her book cah the boy grunted took a car in each hand smashed them together like cymbals and let go upon impact they careened across the carpet in opposite directions breathing hard he toddled after them cah he picked them up and threw them down hard voom cah he went through the routine several more times then abruptly flung the cars aside and began scanning the room with hungry darting glances searching for the dolls though i always left them in the same place a memory problem or just denial at that age all you could do was infer which was what id told mal worthy when hed described the case and asked for the consult youre not going to get hard proof not even trying for it alex just give me something i can work with what about the mother as youd expect a mess whos working with her no one for the moment alex i tried to get her to see someone but she refused in the meantime just do your thing for darren and if a little therapy for mama takes place in the process i wont raise an objection god knows she needs it something like that happening to someone her age howd you get involved in an injury case anyway second marriage father was my handyman i handled the divorce as a favor she was the other woman and remembered me with fondness actually i used to do lots of pi in the beginning feels good to get back into it so tell me how do you feel about working with one this young ive had younger how verbal is he if he talks i havent heard it she claims before the accident he was putting a few words together but i dont get the impression they were saving up tuition for cal tech if you could prove iq loss alex i could translate it into dollars mal he laughed over the phone i know i know mr excuse me dr conservative far be it from me to good talking to you mal have the mother call me to set up an appointment attempt to unduly influence an expert witness however while youre analyzing the situation you might consider imagining what its going to be like for her raising a kid by herself no training no money living with those memories i just got pictures of the crash they almost made me lose my lunch there are some deep pockets here alex and they deserve being dipped into dah hed found the dolls three men a woman a little boy small soft plastic and pink with bland guileless faces anatomically correct bodies and detachable limbs next to them another pair of cars larger than the first two one red one blue a miniature childs car seat had been placed in the rear seat of the blue one i stood adjusted the video camera so that it was trained on the table then sat on the floor next to him he picked up the blue car and positioned the dolls using a familiar sequence one man driving another next to him the woman behind the driver the child in the car seat the red car was empty one male doll remained on the table he flapped his arms and tugged his nose holding the blue car at arms length he looked away from it i patted his shoulder its all right darren he inhaled blew out air picked up the red car and placed both vehicles on the floor two feet apart grille to grille taking another deep breath he puffed up his cheeks and let out a scream then smashed them together full force the male passenger and the woman flew out and landed on the carpet the boy doll slumped in its harness head down it was the driver doll that held his attention lying across the front seat its flight restrained by one foot caught in the steering wheel huffing the boy struggled to pull it loose tugged and twisted started to grunt with frustration but finally managed to free it he held it away from his body examined its plastic face and yanked its head off then he placed it next to the little boy i heard a gasp from across the room and turned denise burkhalter ducked back behind her book oblivious of her reaction the boy dropped the headless body picked up the female doll hugged it put it down then he returned to the male dolls the decapitated driver and the frontseat passenger raising them over his head he threw them against the wall watched them hit then fall he looked at the child slumped in the seat and picked up the head next to it after rolling it under his palm he tossed it aside he stepped toward the male doll that hadnt been moved the driver of the other car took another step froze then backed away the room was silent except for the hum of the camera a page turned he stood still for several moments then was overtaken by a burst of hyperactivity so fierce it electrified the room giggling he rocked back and forth wrung his hands and waved them in the air sputtering and spitting he ran from one side of the room to the other kicking bookshelves chairs the desk scuffing the baseboards clawing the walls and leaving little greasy smudges on the plaster his laughter rose in pitch before giving way to a croupy bark followed by a rush of tears throwing himself to the floor he thrashed for a while then curled fetally and lay there sucking his thumb his mother remained behind her book i went to him and scooped him up in my arms his body was tense and he was chewing hard on his thumb i held him in my lap told him everything was okay he was a good boy his eyes opened for an instant then closed milksweet breath mingled with the not unpleasant odor of child sweat do you want to go to mommy drowsy nod she still hadnt moved i said denise nothing i repeated her name she put the paperback in her purse strung the purse over one shoulder got up and took him we left the library and walked toward the front of the house by the time we reached the door he was sleeping i held the door open cool air blew in a gentle summer that kept threatening to heat up from the distance came the sound of a motorized lawnmower any questions you want to ask me denise nope howd he sleep this week the same six or seven nightmares about i didnt count do i still have to it would help to know whats going on no response the legal part of the evaluation is over denise i have enough information for mr worthy but darrens still struggling totally normal for what hes been through no response hes come a long way i said but he hasnt been able to act out the role of the other driver yet theres plenty of fear and anger still in him it would help him to express it id like to see him some more she looked at the ceiling those dolls she said i know its hard to watch she bit her lip but its helpful for darren denise we can try having you wait outside next time hes ready for it she said its far coming up here bad traffic the pits how long did it take you hour and three quarters tujunga to beverly glen a fortyminute freeway ride if you could handle freeways surface streets jammed uh huh and youve got some curvy roads up here i know sometimes when suddenly she was backing away why do you make yourself so hard to get to living up here if you want to help people why do you make it so damned hard i waited a moment before answering i know its been rough denise if youd rather meet in mr worthys oh forget it and she was out the door i watched her carry her son across the deck and down the stairs his weight caused her to waddle her ungainliness made me want to rush down and help her instead i stood there and watched her struggle she finally made it to the rental car worked hard at opening the rear door with one hand bending low she managed to get darrens limp body into the car seat slamming the door shut she walked around to the drivers side and threw open the front door putting her key in the ignition she lowered her head to the steering wheel and let it rest there she sat that way for a while before turning on the engine back in the library i turned off the video camera removed the cassette tagged it and began my report working slowly with even greater precision than usual trying to forestall the inevitable several hours later the damned thing was finished evicted from the helper role i was once again someone who needed help numbness rolled over me as inevitable as the tide i considered calling robin decided against it our last conversation had been anything but triumphant tonguebiting civility finally sabotaged by depth charges of hurt and anger freedom space i thought we were past that well i never got past freedom alex you know what i mean no i really dont im just trying to figure out what you want robin ive explained it over and over what more can i say if its space you want youve got two hundred miles of it between us feeling any more fulfilled fulfillments not the issue then what is stop it alex please stop what wanting to work this out stop crossexamining me you sound so hostile how am i supposed to sound a week stretched to a month wheres the end point i i wish i could answer that alex terrific the endless dangle and what was my big sin getting too involved okay i can change that believe me i can be cool as ice in training i learned how to detach but if i pull away ten to one ill be accused of male indifference stop it alex i was up all night with aaron i cant handle this right now handle what all your words theyre coming at me like bullets howre we supposed to work anything out without words were not going to work anything out right now so lets put it aside goodbye robin say goodbye alex please i dont want to hang up on you then dont silence goodbye robin goodbye alex i still love you the shoemakers children go barefoot the shrink chokes on his words the low mood gathered strength and hit me full force having someone to talk to would have helped my list of confidants was damned short robin at the top then milo he was off with rick on a fishing trip in the sierras but even if his shoulder had been available i wouldnt have cried on it over the years our friendship had taken on a certain rhythm we talked about murder and madness over beer and pretzels discussed the human condition with the aplomb of a pair of anthropologists observing a colony of savage baboons when the horrors piled up too high milo bitched and i listened when he went off the wagon i helped talk him back on it sadsack cop supportive shrink i wasnt ready to reverse the roles a weeks worth of mail had piled up on the dining room table id avoided opening it dreading the superficial caresses of comeons coupons and gethappyquick schemes but i needed at that very moment to keep my mind tethered to minutiae free from the perils of introspection i carried the stack into the bedroom pulled a wastebasket to the side of the bed sat down and began sorting at the bottom of the pile was a buffcolored envelope heavy linen stock a holmby hills return address embossed silver script on the back flap rich for my blood an upscale sales pitch i flipped the envelope over expecting a computerized label and saw my name and address printed in extravagant silver calligraphy someone had taken the time to do this one right i checked the postmark ten days old opened the envelope and pulled out a buffcolored invitation card silverbordered more calligraphy dear doctor delaware you are cordially invited to join distinguished alumni and members of the university community at a garden party and cocktail reception honoring doctor paul peter kruse blalock professor of psychology and human development upon his appointment as chairman the department of psychology saturday june four in the afternoon skylark la mar road los angeles california rsvp the psychology department kruse as chairman an endowed chair the ultimate reward for exceptional scholarship it made no sense the man was anything but a scholar and though it had been years since id had anything to do with him there was no reason to believe hed changed and become a decent human being back in those days hed been an advice columnist and a darling of the talkshow circuit armed with the requisite beverly hills practice and a repertoire of truisms couched in pseudoscientific jargon his column had appeared monthly in a supermarketrack womens magazine the kind of throwaway that prints articles on the latest miracle crash diet closely followed by recipes for chocolate fudge cake and combines exhortations to be yourself with sexual iq tests designed to make anyone taking them feel inadequate endowed professor hed made only the slimmest pretense of conducting research something to do with human sexuality that never produced a shred of data but he hadnt been expected to be academically productive because he hadnt been a member of the tenured faculty just a clinical associate one of scores of practitioners seeking academic cachet through association with the university associates gave occasional lectures on their specialties in kruses case that had been hypnosis and a manipulative form of psychotherapy he called communication dynamics and served as therapists and supervisors of the clinicalpsych graduate students a nifty symbiosis it freed up the real professors for their grant applications and committee meetings while earning the associates parking permits priority tickets to football games and admission to the faculty club from that to blalock professor incredible i thought of the last time id seen kruse about two years ago chance passersby on campus wed pretended not to notice each other hed been walking toward the psych building all custom tweeds elbow patches and fuming briar a female student at each elbow letting loose with some profundity while copping fast feels i looked down at all that silver writing cocktails at four hail to the chief probably something to do with a holmby hills connection but still the appointment defied comprehension i checked the date of the party two days from now then reread the address at the bottom of the invitation skylark the very rich christened their houses as if they were offspring la mar road no numbers translation we own all of it peasants i pictured the scene two days hence fat cars weak drinks and numbing banter wafting across moneygreen lawns not my idea of fun i tossed the invitation in the trash and forgot about kruse forgot about the old days but not for long i slept poorly and woke with the sun on friday with no patients scheduled i dived into busywork messengering the video of darren to mal finishing other reports paying and mailing bills feeding the koi and netting debris out of their pond cleaning the house until it sparkled that took until noon and left the rest of the day open for wallowing in misery i had no appetite tried running couldnt get the tightness out of my chest and gave up after a mile back home i gulped a beer so quickly it made my diaphragm ache followed it with another and took the sixpack into the bedroom i sat in my underwear and watched images float across the tv screen soap operas perfectlooking people suffering game shows reallooking people regressing my mind wandered i stared at the phone reached out for the receiver pulled back the shoemakers children at first id thought the problem had something to do with business with forsaking the world of high tech for the handcramping poorly compensated life of an artisan a tokyo music conglomerate had approached robin about adapting several of her guitars into prototypes for mass production she was to draw up the specifications an army of computerized robots would do the rest they flew her firstclass to tokyo put her up in a suite at the okura hotel sushied and saked her sent her home laden with exquisite gifts sheaves of contracts printed on rice paper and promises of a lucrative consultantship all that hard sell notwithstanding she turned them down never explaining why though i suspected it had something to do with her roots shed grown up the only child of a mercilessly perfectionistic cabinetmaker who worshipped handwork and an exshowgirl who grew bitter playing betty crocker and worshipped nothing a daddys girl she used her hands to make sense of the world endured college until her father died then eulogized him by dropping out and handcrafting furniture finally she found her perfect pitch as a luthier shaping carving and inlaying custom guitars and mandolins we were lovers for two years before she agreed to live with me even then she held on to her venice studio after returning from japan she began escaping there more and more when i asked her about it she said she had to catch up i accepted it wed never spent that much time together two headstrong people wed fought hard for independence moving in different worlds merging occasionally sometimes it seemed randomly in passionate collision but the collisions grew less and less frequent she started spending nights at the studio claiming fatigue turning down my offers to pick her up and drive her home i was keeping busy enough to avoid thinking about it id retired from child psychology at the age of thirtythree after overdosing on human misery had lived comfortably off investments made in southern california real estate eventually i began to miss clinical work but continued to resist the entanglement of longterm psychotherapy i dealt with it by limiting myself to forensic consultations referred by lawyers and judges custody evaluations trauma cases involving children one recent criminal case that had taught me something about the genesis of madness shortterm work with little or no followup the surgical side of psych but enough to make me feel like a healer a posteaster lull left me with time on my hands time spent alone i began to realize how far robin and i had drifted from each other wondered if id missed something hoping for spontaneous cure i waited for her to come around when she didnt i cornered her she shrugged off my concerns suddenly remembered something shed forgotten at the studio and was gone after that i saw her even less phone calls to venice triggered her answering machine dropins were maddeningly unsatisfying usually she was surrounded by sadeyed musicians cradling mangled instruments and singing one form of blues or the other when i caught her alone she used the roar of saws and lathes the hiss of the spray gun to blot out discourse i gritted my teeth backed off told myself to be patient adapted by creating a heavy workload of my own all during the spring i evaluated wrote reports and testified like a demon lunched with lawyers got stuck in traffic jams made lots of money and had no one to spend it on as summer neared robin and i had become polite strangers something had to give early in may it did a sunday morning rich with hope shed come home late saturday afternoon to retrieve some old sketches had ended up spending the night making love to me with a workmanlike determination that scared me but was better than nothing when i woke i reached across the bed to touch her felt only percale sounds filtered from the living room i jumped out of bed found her dressed handbag over one shoulder heading for the door morning babe morning alex leaving she nodded whats the rush lots of things to do on sunday sunday monday it doesnt matter she put her hand on the doorknob i made juice theres a pitcher in the fridge i walked over to her put my hand on her wrist stay just a little longer she eased away i really have to go come on take a breather i dont need a breather alex at least stay for a while and lets talk about what us theres nothing to talk about her apathy was forced but it pushed my button anyway months of frustration were compressed into a few moments of blazing soliloquy she was selfish selfobsessed how did she think it felt to live with a hermit what had i done to deserve this kind of treatment then a laundry list of my virtues of every lofty service id performed for her since the day wed met when i was through she put down her bag and took a seat on the couch youre right we do need to talk she stared out the window i said im listening im trying to collect my thoughts words are your business alex i cant compete with you on that level no one needs to compete with anyone just talk to me tell me whats on your mind she shook her head i dont know how to put this without being hurtful dont worry about that just let it out whatever you say doctor then sorry this is just very hard i waited she clenched her hands unflexed them and spread them out look around this room the furniture the artwork everything exactly the way it was the first time i saw it pictureperfectyour perfect taste for five years ive been a boarder how can you say that this is your home she started to reply shook her head and turned away i stepped into her line of vision pointed to the ashburl trestle table in the dining room the only furniture that means anything to me is that because you built it silence say the word and ill chop everything to matchsticks robin well start from scratch together she put her face in her hands sat that way for a while and finally looked up weteyed this isnt about interior decorating alex what is it about you the kind of person you are overwhelming overpowering its about the fact that youve never thought to ask if i wanted anything different if i had ideas of my own i never thought that kind of thing mattered to you i never hinted that it did its me too alex accepting going along fitting into your preconceived notions meanwhile ive been living a lie viewing myself as strong selfsufficient you are strong she laughed without joy that was daddys line you are strong girl beautiful strong girl he used to get mad at me when my confidence lagged yelled at me and told me over and over that i was different from the other girls stronger than them to him strong meant using your hands creating when the other girls were playing with barbies i was learning how to load a band saw sanding my knuckles to the bone constructing a perfect miter joint being strong for years i bought into it now here i am finally taking a good look in the mirror and all i see is another weak woman living off a man did the tokyo deal have anything to do with this the tokyo deal made me stop and think about what i wanted out of life made me realize how far i was from it how beholden ive always been to someone babe i never meant to hem you in thats the problem im a babe a damn baby helpless and ready to be fixed by doctor alex i dont view you as a patient i said i love you for gods sake love she said whatever the hell that means i know what it means to me then youre just a better person than i am okay which is the crux of the problem isnt it doctor perfect phd problemsolver looks brains charm money all those patients who think youre god she got up walked the floor dammit alex when i first met you you had problems the burnout all those selfdoubts you were a mortal and i could care for you i helped you through that alex i was one of the main reasons you pulled out of it i know i was you were and i still need you she smiled no now youre fixed my darling perfectly tuned and theres nothing left for me to do thats crazy ive been miserable not seeing you temporary reaction she said youll cope you must think im pretty shallow she walked some more shook her head god im listening to myself and realizing it all comes down to jealousy doesnt it stupid childish jealousy the same way i used to feel about the popular girls but i cant help it youve got it all together everything organized into a neat little routine run your three miles take a shower work a little cash your checks play your guitar read your journals fuck me until we both come then fall asleep grinning you buy tickets to hawaii we take a vacation show up with a picnic basket we take lunch its an assembly line alex with you pushing the buttons and one thing tokyo taught me was that i dont want an assembly line the crazy thing is its a great life if i let you youd take care of me forever make my life one perfect sugarcoated dream i know lots of women would kill for something like that but its not what i need our eyes met i felt stung turned away oh god she said im hurting you i just hate this im fine just go on thats all of it alex youre a wonderful man but living with you has started to scare me im in danger of disappearing youve been hinting about marriage if we married id lose even more of my self our children would come to see me as someone dull and unstimulating and bitter meanwhile daddy would be out in the wide world performing heroics i need time alex breathing space to sort things out she moved toward the door i have to go now please take all the time you need i said all the space just dont cut me off she stood trembling in the doorway ran to me kissed my forehead and was gone two days later i came home and found a note on the ashburl table dear alex gone up to san luis cousin terry had a baby going to help her be back in about a week dont hate me love r one of the cases id just finished working on involved a fiveyearold girl as the hostage in a vicious custody battle between a hollywood producer and his fourth wife for two years the parents encouraged to wage war by lawyers on retainer had been unable to reach a settlement finally the judge got disgusted and asked me to come up with recommendations i evaluated the girl and asked that another psychologist be appointed to examine the parents the consultant i recommended was a former classmate named larry daschoff a sharp diagnostician whose ethics i respected larry and i had remained amicable over the years trading referrals getting together occasionally for lunch or handball but as a friend he fell in the casual category and i was surprised when he called me at pm on friday dr d its dr d he shouted cheerful as usual a hurricane of noise roared in the background squealing tires and gunshots from a blaring tv competing with what sounded like a schoolyard during recess hi larry whats up whats up is brenda is at the law library cramming for her torts course and ive got all five monsters to myself the joys of parenthood oh yeah the noise level rose a small voice whined daddy daddy daddy one second alex he put his hand over the phone and i heard him say wait till im off the phone no not now wait if he bothers you just stay away from him not now jeremy i dont want to hear it im talking on the phone jeremy if you dont cool it its no cocoa puffs and twenty minutes off your bedtime he came back on the line ive become an instant fan of aversion therapy d fuck anna freud and bruno bettelheim both of them probably locked themselves in their studies to write their books while someone else raised their kids did old anna even have kids i think she stayed married to daddy anyway first thing monday im sending away for half a dozen cattle prods one for each of them and one to shove up my own ass for encouraging brenda to go back to school if robin ever comes up with a creative idea like that change the subject fast ill be sure to do that larry you okay d just a little tired he was too good a therapist not to know i was holding back too good also to pursue the issue anyway d i read your report on the featherbaugh mess and concur in every respect with parents like these what would really benefit the kid would be orphanhood barring that i agree that some halfassed joint custody arrangements probably the least terrible way to go want to take bets on the chances of its working out only if i can wager on the down side no way he excused himself again yelled for someone to turn down the tv no compliance followed people are really fucked up arent they d hows that for a major insight after thirteen years as a mind prober nobody wants to work at anything anymore god knows im no day at the beach and neither is brenda if we can stick it out all these years anyone should be able to i always thought of you two as the perfect couple one born every moment he chuckled were talking italian marriage mucho passione mucho screamo bottom line she puts up with me because of my erotic prowess that so that so he mimicked d that was pretty damn shrinky sounding not up to your usual level of sparkling repartee sure youre okay im fine really if you say so anyway on to my main reason for calling get the invite to kruses big bash its gracing the bottom of my wastebasket that sparkling enough not by a long shot not planning on going youve got to be kidding larry i dont know it could be fun in a mondo bizarro kind of way see how the other half lives stand on the sidelines making nasty analytic comments while suppressing our bourgeois envy i remembered something larry werent you kruses research assistant for a while not for a while d just one semester and yes im being defensive the guy was a sleaze my excuse is that i was broke just married slaving over the dissertation and my nimh stipend ran out midsemester cmon fess up larry it was a plum job you guys sat around all day watching dirty movies not fair delaware we were exploring the frontiers of human sexuality he laughed actually we sat around all day and watched undergraduates watch dirty movies oh for those licentious seventies could you see getting away with that today a tragic loss to science catastrophic truth be told d it was total bullshit kruse got away with it because hed brought in money a private grant to study the effects of pornography on sexual arousal did he come up with anything major data fuck films make college sophomores horny i knew that when i was a sophomore you were a late bloomer d did he publish where penthouse nah he used the results to go on talk shows and cheerlead for porn as a healthy sexual outlet et cetera et cetera then in the uptight eighties he made a complete aboutface supposedly hed reanalyzed his data started giving speeches about porn promoting violence against women lots of integrity our new department head oh yeah howd he climb this high larry he used to be parttime help parttime help with fulltime connections the name on the endowment blalock you got it old moolah steel railroads one of those families that gets a penny every time someone west of the mississippi breathes whats kruses connection way i hear it mrs blalock had a kid with problems kruse was the kids therapist must have made it all better because mommys been pouring money into the department for years on condition that kruse administer it hes been promoted given everything he wants his latest want is to be department head so voila party time tenure for sale i said i didnt know things had gotten that bad that bad and worse alex i still give those lectures in family therapy so im involved enough in the department to know that the financial situation sucks remember how they used to push pure research at us look down their noses at anything even remotely applied how ratman frazier used to keep telling us relevant was a dirty word it finally caught up with them nobody wants to fund grants to study the eyeblink reflex in decorticate lobsters on top of that undergraduate enrollments way down psychs not a hip major anymore nowadays everyone including my oldest wants to be a business major insidetrade their way to health and happiness which means budget cuts layoffs empty classrooms theyve had a hiring freeze for nineteen months even the full profs have got their noses to the floor kruse brings in blalock money he can eat tenure for breakfast in the words of my oldest money talks dad bullshit walks hell even fraziers jumped on the bandwagon last i heard he was into mailorder marketing stopsmoking tapes youre kidding i kid you not what does frazier know about how to quit smoking about anything human since when is that important anyway thats the situation now about saturday i managed to farm out all five cupcakes for three hours tomorrow i could use the time to pump iron watch the game or do something else comparably thrilling but the idea of getting all spiffed up and saturating myself with free drinks and hautecuisine munchies at some holmby hills pleasure dome didnt sound half bad the drinks are bound to be lousy larry better than what im drinking now diluted apple juice looks like piss its all thats left in the house i forgot to go shopping ive been shoveling sugared cereal into the kids for two days he sighed im a trapped man d were talking terminal cabin fever come to the damned party and trade cynical barbs with me for a couple of hours ill rsveep for both of us bring robin parade her around and let the rich farts know money cant buy everything robin cant make it out of town business yup pause listen d if youre tied up i understand i thought about it for a moment considered another lonely day and said no im free larry and set the gears in motion holmby hills is the highestpriced spread in la a tiny pocket of megaaffluence sandwiched between beverly hills and bel air financially lightyears from my neighborhood but only about a mile or so due south my map put la mar road in the heart of the district a winding bit of deadend filament terminating in the rolling hills that overlook the la country club not far from the playboy mansion but i didnt imagine hef had been invited to this bash at fourfifteen i put on a lightweight suit and set out on foot traffic was heavy on sunset surfers and sunworshippers returning from the beach gawkers headed east clutching maps to the stars homes fifty yards into holmby hills everything went hushed and pastoral the properties were immense the houses concealed behind high walls and security gates and backed by small forests only the merest outline of slate gable or spanish tile tower floating above the greenery suggested habitation that and the phlegmy rumble of unseen attack dogs la mar appeared around a bend an uphill strip of singlelane asphalt nicked into a wall of fiftyfoot eucalyptus in lieu of a city street sign a varnished slab of pine had been nailed to one of the trees above the emblems of three security companies and the redandwhite badge of the bel air patrol rustic lettering burned into the slab spelled out la mar private no outlet easy to miss at forty miles per though a blue rollsroyce corniche sped past me and hooked onto it without hesitation i followed the rollss exhaust trail twenty feet in twin fieldstone gateposts tacked with another private road warning fed into eightfoot stone walls topped with three feet of goldfinialed wrought iron the iron was laced with alternating twentyfoot sections of vines english ivy passion fruit honeysuckle wisteria controlled profusion masquerading as something natural beyond the walls was a graygreen canvas more fivestory eucalyptus a quartermile later the foliage got even thicker the road darker and cooler mounds of moss and lichen patched the fieldstone the air smelled wet and mentholclean a bird chirped timidly then abandoned its song the road curved straightened and revealed its end point a towering stone arch sealed by wroughtiron gates scores of cars were lined up a double file of chrome and lacquer as i got closer i could see that the division was purposeful sparkling luxury cars in one queue compacts station wagons and similar plebeian transport in the other heading the dreammobiles was a spotless white mercedes coupe one of those custom jobs with a soupedup engine bumper guards and spoilers goldplating and a vanity plate that said ppk phd redjacketed valets hopped around newly arrived vehicles like fleas on a summer pelt throwing open car doors and pocketing keys i made my way to the gate and found it locked off to one side was a speaker box on a post next to the speaker were a punchpad keyslot and phone one of the redjackets saw me held out his palm and said keys no keys i walked his eyes narrowed in his hand was an oversized iron key chained to a rectangle of varnished wood on the wood was burnt lettering fr gate we park he insisted he was dark thick roundfaced fuzzybearded and spoke in a mediterranean accent his palm wavered no car i said i walked when his face stayed blank i pantomimed walking with my fingers he turned to another valet a short skinny black kid and whispered something both of them stared at me i looked up at the top of the gate saw gold letters skylark this is mrs blalocks home right no response the university party dr kruse the bearded one shrugged and trotted over to a pearlgray cadillac the black kid stepped forward got an invitation sir no is one necessary weell he smiled seemed to be thinking hard youall got no car youall got no invitation i didnt know it was necessary to bring either he clucked his tongue is a car necessary for collateral i asked the smile disappeared youall walked thats right where dyouall live not far from here neighbor invited guest my name is alex delaware dr delaware one minute he walked to the box picked up the telephone and spoke replacing the receiver he said one minute again and ran to open the doors of a white stretch lincoln i waited looked around something brown and familiar caught my eye a truly pathetic vehicle pushed to the side of the road away from the others quarantined easy to see why a scabrous chevy station wagon of senile vintage rustpocked and clotted with lumpy patches of primer its tires needed air its rear compartment was crammed with rolled clothing shoes cardboard cartons fastfood containers and crumpled paper cups on the tailgate window was a yellow diamondshaped sticker mutants on board i smiled then noticed that the clunker had been positioned in a way that prevented exit a score of cars would have to be moved in order to free it a fashionably thin middleaged coupled climbed out of the white lincoln and were escorted to the gate by the bearded valet he put the oversized key in the slot punched a code and one iron door swung open slipping through i followed the couple onto a sloping drive paved with black bricks shaped like fish scales as i walked past him the valet said hey but without enthusiasm and made no effort to stop me when the gate had closed after him i pointed to the chevy and said that brown station wagon let me tell you something about it he came up next to the wrought iron yes what that car is owned by the richest guy at this party treat it well hes been known to give huge tips he swiveled his head and stared at the station wagon i began walking when i looked back he was playing musical cars creating a clearing around the chevy a hundred yards past the gate the eucalyptus gave way to open skies above a golf coursequality lawn trimmed to stubble the grass was flanked by ramrod columns of barbered italian cypress and beds of perennials the outer reaches of the grounds had been bulldozed into hillocks and valleys the highest of the mounds were at the farthest reaches of the property capped by solitary black pines and california junipers pruned to look windswept the fishscale drive humped from over the crest came the sound of music a string section playing something baroque as i neared the top i saw a tall old man dressed in butlers livery walking toward me dr delaware sir his accent fell somewhere between london and boston his features were soft generous and pouchy his loose skin was the color of canned salmon tufts of cornsilk circled a sunbrowned dome a white carnation graced his buttonhole jeeves out of central casting yes im ramey dr delaware just coming to get you sir please forgive the inconvenience sir no problem i guess the valets arent equipped to deal with pedestrians we stepped over the crest my eye was drawn toward the horizon toward a dozen peaks of green copper tile roof three stories of white stucco and green shutters columned porticoes balustered balconies and verandas arched doors and fanlight windows a monumental wedding cake surrounded by acres of green icing formal gardens fronted the mansion gravel paths more cypress a maze of boxwood hedges limestone fountains reflecting pools hundreds of beds of roses so bright they seemed fluorescent partygoers clutching longstemmed glasses strolled the paths and admired the plantings admired themselves in the mirrored water of the pools the butler and i walked in silence kicking up gravel the sun beat down thick and warm as melting butter in the shadow of the tallest fountain sat a philharmonicsized group of grim formally dressed musicians their conductor a young longhaired asian lifted his baton and the players broke into dutiful bach the strings were augmented by tinkling glass and a ground bass of conversation to the left of the gardens a huge flagstone patio was filled with round white tables shaded by yellow canvas umbrellas on each table was a centerpiece of tiger lilies purple irises and white carnations a yellowandwhitestriped tent large enough to house a circus sheltered a long whitelacquered bar manned by a dozen elbowgreased bartenders three hundred or so people sat at the tables and drank half that amount crowded the bar waiters circulated with trays of drinks and canapés yes sir can i get you a drink sir soda water would be fine excuse me sir ramey widened his stride walked ahead of me disappeared into the bar throng and emerged moments later with a frosty glass and a yellow linen napkin he handed them to me just as i reached the patio here you are sir sorry again for the inconvenience no problem thanks would you care for anything to eat sir nothing right now he gave a small bow and walked off i stood alone sipping my soda scanning the crowd for a friendly face the crowd it soon became obvious was divided into two discrete groups a sociologic split that echoed the doublefiled cars center stage was dominated by the big rich an assemblage of swans deeply tan and looselimbed in conservative haute couture they greeted each other with cheekpecks laughed softly and discreetly drank steadily and not so discreetly and made no notice of the ethnically diverse bunch sitting off to the side the university people were the magpies intense watchful brimming with nervous chatter theyd congregated reflexively into tight little cliques talking behind their hands while darting their eyes some were conspicuously sleekin offtherack suits and specialoccasion party dresses others had made a point of dressing down a few still gaped at their surroundings but most were content to observe the rituals of the swans with a mixture of raw hunger and analytic contempt id finished half my soda when a ripple spread through the patio through both camps paul kruse appeared in its wake weaving his way adroitly through town and gown a small lovelylooking silverblond woman in a strapless black dress and threeinch heels hung on his arm she was in her early thirties but wore her hair like a prom queen rulerstraight down to her waist the ends puffed and curled extravagantly the dress clung to her like a coat of pitch around her neck was a diamond choker she kept her eyes fastened on kruse as he grinned and worked his audience i took a good look at the new department chairman by now he had to be close to sixty fighting entropy with chemistry and good posture his hair was still long a dubious shade of cornyellow and cut newwave surferstyle with a flap over one eye once hed resembled a male model with the kind of coarse handsomeness that photographs well but loses something in the translation to reality and his good looks were still in evidence but his features had fallen the jawline seemed weaker the ruggedness dissolved into something mushy and vaguely dissolute his tan was so deep he looked overbaked it put him in sync with the moneyed crowd as did his customtailored suit the suit was featherweight but conspicuously tweedy and armpatched an almost snotty concession to academia i watched him flash a mouthful of white caps shake the hands of the men kiss the ladies and move on to the next set of wellwishers smooth huh said a voice at my back i turned around looked down on two hundred pounds of brokennosed bushymustached square meal packed into five feet five inches of round can wrapped in a brown plaid suit pink shirt black knit tie and scuffed brown penny loafers hello larry i started to extend my hand then saw that both of his were occupied a glass of beer in the left a plate of chicken wings egg rolls and partially gnawed rib bones in the right i was over by the roses said daschoff trying to figure out how they get them to flower like that probably fertilize them with old dollar bills he raised his eyebrows and tilted his head toward the mansion nice little cottage cozy he eyed the conductor thats narahara the wunderkind god knows what he cost he lifted the mug to his mouth and drank a fringe of foam coated the bottom half of his mustache budweiser he said i expected something more exotic but at least its full strength we sat down at an empty table larry crossed his legs with effort and took another deeper swallow of beer the movement inflated his chest and strained the buttons of his jacket he unbuttoned it and sat back a beeper was clipped to his belt larry is almost as wide as he is tall and he waddles the reasonable assumption is obesity but in swim trunks hes as firm as a frozen side of beef a curious mixture of hypertrophied muscle marbled with suet the only guy under six feet to have played defensive tackle for the university of arizona one time back in grad school i watched him benchpress twice his weight at the university gym without breathing hard then top it off with onehanded pushups he ran blunt fingers through steelwool hair wiped his mustache and watched as kruse charmed his way through the crowd the new department heads route took him closer to our table near enough to observe the mechanics of small talk but too far to hear what was being said it was like watching a mime show something entitled party games your mentors in fine form i said larry swallowed more beer and held out his hands i told you i was dead busted d would have worked for the devil himself a bargainbasement faust no need to explain doctor why not it still bugs me being a party to bullshit more beer entire semester a waste kruse and i had virtually nothing to do with each other i doubt if we spoke ten sentences the entire time i didnt like him because i thought he was shallow and a phony and he resented me cause i was male all his other assistants were women then whyd he hire you because his research subjects were males and they were unlikely to relax watching dirty movies with a bunch of women around taking notes not likely to answer the kinds of questions he was asking either how often they jerked off their most frequent masturbation fantasies did they do it in public toilets how often and who they fucked how long it took them to come what was their deepseated primal attitude toward liver in a can frontiers of human sexuality i said he shook his head sad thing is it could have been valuable look at all the clinical data masters and johnson came up with but kruse wasnt serious about collecting data it was as if he was going through the motions didnt the granting agency care no agency these were private suckers rich porn freaks he promised to make them respectable put the academic imprimatur on their hobby i turned and looked at kruse the blonde in the black dress was teetering on spiked heels whos the woman with him mrs k you dont remember suzanne i shook my head suzy straddle the talk of the department i must have slept through it you must have been comatose d she was a campus celebrity former porn actress got her nickname for being limber kruse met her at some hollywood party while doing research she couldnt have been more than eighteen or nineteen he left his second wife for her or maybe it was the third who keeps track got her enrolled in the university as an english major i think she lasted three weeks ring a bell yet i shook my head when was this in i was up in san francisco at langley porter oh yeah you doubleshifted internship and dissertation same year well d your precociousness may have dumped you in the job market one year sooner than the rest of us but you missed out on suzy she was really supposed to be something i actually worked with her for a week kruse assigned her to the study doing secretarial work she couldnt type screwed up the files sweet kid actually but somewhat basic the honoree and spouse had come closer suzanne kruse tagged along after her husband as if bolted to a track she looked fragile with bony shoulders a tightcorded neck bisected by a diamond choker nearly flat chest hollow cheeks and sharply pointed chin her arms were shapely but sinewy bony hands ending in long spindly fingers her nails were long and redlacquered they clutched her husbands sleeve digging into the tweed must be true love i said he stuck with her all these years dont bet that its wholesome monogamy kruses got a rep as a majorleague pussy hound and suzys known to be tolerant he cleared his throat submissive literally he nodded remember those parties kruse used to throw at his place in mandeville canyon the first year he joined the faculty oh yeah you were in frisco he stopped ate an egg roll and ruminated wait i think they were still going on in you were back by right graduated i said working at the hospital i met him once we didnt like each other he wouldnt have invited me no one was invited alex these were open houses in every sense of the word he chucked me under the chin you probably wouldnt have gone anyway because you were a good boy so serious actually i never got further than the door myself brenda took one look at them coating the floor with wesson oil and hauled my ass out of there but people who went said they were plusfour orgies if you could stand fucking other shrinks oh calcutta meets b f skinner what a scary idea huh and suzy straddle was one of the main attractions tied up harnessed muzzled and flogged how do you know all this campus gossip everyone knew it was no secret back then no one thought it was all that weird premicrobe days sexual freedom liberating the id expanding the boundaries of consciousness et cetera even the radical libbers in our class thought kruse was on the cutting edge of something meaningful or maybe it just got their rocks off being dominant either way it was philosophically acceptable to flog suzy because she was fulfilling some need of her own kruse do the flogging everyone did it was a real gang scene she was an equalopportunity floggee there look at her how shes holding on to him for dear life doesnt she seem submissive probably a passivedependent personality perfect symbiotic fit for a power junkie like kruse to me she looked scared adhering to her husband but staying in the background i watched her step forward and smile when spoken to then retreat tossing her long hair checking her nails her smile was as flat as a decal her dark eyes unnaturally bright she moved so that the sun hit the diamond choker and threw off sparks i thought of a dog collar kruse turned abruptly to take someones hand and his wife was caught off balance throwing her arm out for support she took hold of his sleeve and held on tighter wrapping herself around him he continued to knead her bare shoulder but for all the attention he paid to her she might have been a sweater love whatever the hell that means low selfesteem said larry youd have to be down on yourself to fuck on film guess so he drained his mug going for a refill can i get you something i held up my halffull soda glass still working on this he shrugged and went to the bar the kruses had circled away from our table toward one filled with magpies a fizz of small talk then he laughed a deep selfsatisfied sound he said something to a male graduate student pumped the students hand while running his eyes over the young mans pretty wife suzanne kruse kept smiling larry returned so he said settling hows it going with you great yeah me too thats why were here without our women right i sipped soda and gazed at him he maintained eye contact but busied himself with a chicken wing the therapists look gravid with concern genuine concern but i wanted no part of it suddenly i felt like bolting a quick jog back to the big stone arch farewell to gatsbyland instead i dipped into my own bag of shrinkmoves parried a question with a question hows brenda doing in law school he knew full well what was going on answered anyway top ten percent of the class for the second year in a row you must be proud of her sure except theres another entire year to go check me same time next year and see if im still functioning i nodded ive heard its a rotten process his grin lost its warmth anything that produces lawyers would have to be wouldnt it like turning sirloin into shit my favorite part is when she comes home and crossexamines me about the house and the kids he wiped his mouth and leaned in close one part of me understands it shes bright brighter than i am i always expected her to go for something other than housework she was the one who said no her own mother had worked full time farmed her out to babysitters she resented it she got pregnant on our honeymoon nine months later we had steven then the rest of them like aftershocks now all of a sudden she needs to find herself clara darrow he shook his head the problem is the timing here i am finally getting to a point where i dont have to hustle referrals the associates are reliable the practice is basically running itself the baby starts first grade next year we could take some time off travel instead shes gone twenty hours a day while i play mr mom he scowled be careful my friend though with robin itll probably be different shes already had her career might be ready to settle down i said robin and i are separated he stared at me shook his head again rubbed his chin and sighed shit im sorry how longs it been five weeks temporary vacation that just seemed to stretch he drained his beer im really sorry i always thought you guys were the perfect couple i thought so too larry my throat got tight and my chest burned i was certain that everyone was looking at me though when i looked around no one was just larry eyes as soft as a spaniels hope it works out he said i stared into my glass the ice had melted to slush think i will have something stronger i elbowed my way through the crush at the bar and ordered a double gin and tonic that fell just short of single strength on the way back to the table i came face to face with kruse he looked at me his eyes were lightbrown flecked with green the irises unusually large they widened with recognition i was certain then flicked away and focused somewhere over my shoulder simultaneously he shot out his hand grasped mine firmly covered it with his other and moved our arms up and down while exclaiming so nice you could come before i had a chance to reply hed used the handshake as leverage to propel himself past me spinning me halfway around before relinquishing his grip and moving on politicians hustle id been expertly manipulated again i turned saw his tailored back retreating followed by the shimmering silver sheet of his wifes hair swaying in counterpoint to her narrow tight derrière the two of them walked several steps before being taken in hand by a tall handsome middleaged woman slim and impeccably assembled in a custardyellow silk cocktail dress white rose corsage and strategically placed diamonds she could have been any presidents first lady her hair was chestnut accented with pewter combed back and tied in a chignon that crowned a long fulljawed face her lips were thin molded in a halfsmile finishingschool smile genetic poise i heard kruse say hello hope everythings just beautiful thank you paul if youve a moment there are some people id like you to meet of course dear the exchange sounded rehearsed lacking in warmth and had excluded suzanne kruse the three of them left the patio kruse and the first lady side by side the former suzy straddle following like a servant they headed for a group of swans basking in the reflected light of one of the pools their arrival was heralded by the cessation of chatter and the lowering of glasses a lot of flesh was pressed within seconds the swans were all listening raptly to kruse but the woman in yellow seemed bored even resentful i returned to the table took a deep drink of gin larry raised his glass and touched it to mine heres to oldfashioned girls d long may they fucking live i tossed back what was left of my gin and sucked on the ice i hadnt eaten all day felt a light buzz coming on and shook my head to clear it the movement brought a swatch of custardyellow into view the first lady had left kruses side she scanned the grounds took a few steps stopped and flicked her head toward a yellow spot on the lawn discarded napkin a waiter rushed to pick it up like a captain on the bow of a frigate the chestnuthaired woman shaded her eyes with her hand and continued to scan the grounds she glided to one of the rosebeds lifted a blossom and inspected it another waiter bearing shears was at her side immediately a moment later the flower was in her hair and she was moving on thats our hostess i said in the paleyellow dress no idea d not exactly my social circle kruse called her hope then thats her hope blalock springs eternal a moment later he said some hostess notice how were all kept outside no one gets into the house like dogs that havent been housebroken he laughed lifted one leg off the chair and made a rude sound with his lips then he cocked his head at a nearby table speaking of animal training observe the mazeandelectrode crowd eight or nine grad students sat surrounding a man in his late fifties the students favored corduroy jeans and plain cotton shifts lank hair and wirerims their mentor was stoopshouldered bald and wore a clipped white beard his suit was mudcolored hopsacking a couple of sizes too large it shrouded him like a monks habit he talked nonstop and jabbed his finger a lot the students looked glassyeyed the ratman himself said larry and his merry band of ratkateers probably going on about something sexy like the correlation between electroshockinduced defecation and stimulation voltage following experimentally induced frustration of a partially reinforced escape response acquired under widely spaced trials in fucking squirrels i laughed looks like he lost weight maybe hes doing weightloss tapes too nope heart attack last year its why he gave up being department head and passed it along to kruse the tapes started right after that fucking hypocrite remember how he used to put down the clinical students say we shouldnt consider our doctorates a union card for private practice what an asshole you should see the ads hes been running for his little nosmoking racket whereve they run trashy magazines one square inch of blackandwhite in the back along with pitches for military schools stuffenvelopesandmakeafortune schemes and oriental pen pals only reason i found out is one of my patients sent away for it and brought the cassette in to show me use the behavioral approach to quit smoking the ratmans name right there on the plastic along with this tacky mimeographed brochure listing his academic credentials he actually narrates the damned thing d in that pompous monotone trying to sound compassionate as if hed been working with people instead of rodents all these years he gave a disgusted look union cards is he making any money if he is he sure aint spending it on clothes larrys beeper went off he pulled it off his belt held it to his ear for a moment the service scuse me d he stopped a waiter asked for the nearest phone and was directed to the big white house i watched him duckwalk through the formal gardens then got up ordered another gin and tonic and stood there at the bar drinking it enjoying the anonymity i was starting to feel comfortably fuzzy when i heard something that set off an internal alarm familiar tones inflections a voice from the past i told myself it was imagination then i heard the voice again and searched the crowd i saw her over several sets of shoulders a timemachine jolt i tried to look away couldnt sharon exquisite as ever i knew her age without calculating thirtyfour a birthday in may may how strange to still remember i stepped closer got a better look maturity but no diminution of beauty a face out of a cameo oval fineboned cleanjawed the hair thick wavy black and glossy as caviar brushed back from a high flawless forehead spilling over square shoulders milkwhite complexion unfashionably sunshy high cheekbones gently defined rouged naturally with coins of dusty rose small closeset ears a single pearl in each black eyebrows arching above wideset deepblue eyes a thin straight nose gently flaring nostrils i remembered the feel of her skin pale as porcelain but warm always warm i craned to get a better view she had on a kneelength navyblue linen dress shortsleeved and loosefitting unsuccessful camouflage the contours of her body fought the confines of the dress and won full soft breasts wasp waist rich flare of hip tapering to long legs and sculpted ankles her arms were smooth white stalks she wore no rings or bracelets only the pearl studs and a matching string of operalength pearls that rode the swell of her bosom blue pumps with medium heels added an inch to her five and a half feet in one hand was a matching blue purse the other hand caressed it no wedding ring so what with robin at my side i would have taken brief notice or so i tried to convince myself i couldnt keep my eyes off her she had her eyes on a man one of the swans old enough to be her father big square bronze face corrugated with deep seams narrow pale eyes brushcut hair the color of iron filings wellbuilt despite his age and perfectly turned out in doublebreasted blue blazer and gray flannel slacks oddly boyish one of those youthful older men who populate the better clubs and resorts and are able to bed younger women without incurring snickers her lover what business was that of mine i kept staring romance didnt seem to be what was fueling her attention the two of them were off in one corner and she was arguing with him trying to convince him of something barely moving her lips and straining to look casual he just stood there listening sharon at a party it didnt fit shed hated them as much as i had but that had been a long time ago people change lord knew that applied to her i raised my glass to my lips watched her tug on one earlobe some things stayed the same i edged closer bumped into a matrons padded haunch and received a glare mumbling apologies i pressed forward the crush of drinkers was unyielding i wedged my way through seeking a voyeurs vantage deliciously close but safely out of view telling myself it was just curiosity suddenly she turned her head and saw me she pinkened with recognition and her lips parted we locked in on each other as if dancing dancing on a terrace a nest of lights in the distance weightless formless i felt dizzy bumped into someone else more apologies sharon kept looking straight at me the brushcut man was facing the other way looking contemplative i retreated further was swallowed by the crowd and returned to the table short of breath clutching my glass so tightly my fingers hurt i counted blades of grass until larry returned the call was about the baby he said she and her little playmate got into a fight shes tantrumming and insisting on being taken home the other girls mother says theyre both hysterical overtired ive got to go pick her up d sorry no problem im ready to leave myself yeah turned out to be pretty turgid didnt it but at least i got a look at la grande maison s entry hall big enough to skate in were in the wrong business d whats the right business marry it young spend the rest of your life pissing it away he looked back at the mansion cast his eyes over the grounds listen alex it was good seeing you little male pairbonding hostility release how about we get together in a couple of weeks shoot some pool at the faculty club ingest some cholesterol sounds great terrific ill call you look forward to it larry buttressed by our lies we left the party he was eager to get going but offered to drive me home i said id rather walk waited with him while the bearded valet fetched his keys the chevy station wagon had been repositioned for quick exit and washed the valet held the door open and expectorated a mouthful of sirs as he waited for larry to get comfortable when larry put the key in the ignition the valet shut the door gently and held his palm out smiling larry looked over at me i winked larry grinned rolled up the window and started the engine i strolled past the cars heard the wheeze of the chevys engine followed by curses muttered in some mediterranean language then a clatter and squeal as the wagon accelerated larry zipped past stuck out his left hand and waved id walked several yards when i heard someone calling thinking nothing of it i didnt break step then the call took on volume and clarity alex i looked over my shoulder navyblue dress swirl of black hair long white legs running she caught up with me breasts heaving upper lip pearled with sweat alex it really is you i cant believe it hello sharon howve you been dr witty just fine she touched her ear shook her head no youre one person to whom i dont have to pretend no i havent been fine not at all the ease with which shed slipped into familiarity the effortless erasure of all that had passed between us raised my defenses she stepped closer i smelled her perfume soap and water tinged with fresh grass and spring flowers im sorry to hear that i said oh alex she placed two fingers on my wrist let them rest there i felt her heat was jolted by a rush of energy below my waist all at once i was rockhard and furious about it but alive for the first time in a long while its so good to see you alex that voice sweet and creamy the midnight eyes sparkled good to see you too it came out thick and intense nothing like the indifference id aimed for her fingers were burning a hole in my wrist i dislodged her put my hands in my pockets if she sensed rejection she didnt show it just let her arm fall to her side and kept smiling alex its so funny we should run into each other like this pure esp ive been wanting to call you about what a triangle of tongue tip moved between her lips and licked away the sweat id coveted some issues that have come up nows not a good time but if you could find some time to talk id appreciate it what issues would we have to talk about after all these years her smile was a quartermoon of white light too immediate too wide i was hoping you wouldnt be angry after all these years im not angry sharon just puzzled she worried her earlobe her fingers flew forward and grazed my cheek before dropping youre a good guy delaware you always were be well she turned to leave i took hold of her hand and she stopped sharon im sorry things arent going well for you she laughed bit her lip no they really arent but thats not your problem even as she said it she came closer kept coming i realized i was pulling her toward me but with only the faintest pressure she was allowing herself to be reeled in i knew at that moment that shed do anything i wanted and her passivity touched off a strange meélange of feelings within me pity gratitude the joy of being needed at last the weight between my legs grew oppressive i dropped her hand our faces were inches apart my tongue strained against my teeth like a snake in a jar a stranger using my voice said if it means that much to you we can get together and talk it means a lot to me she said we made a lunch date for monday the moment she disappeared behind the gates i knew it had been a mistake but i wasnt sure i regretted it back home i checked with my service hoping for a call from robin something to make me regret it your board is clear dr delaware said the operator i thought i detected pity in her voice told myself i was getting paranoid that night i went to sleep with a head full of erotic images some time during the early morning hours i had a wet dream i woke sticky and cranky and knew without having to reason it out that i was going to break the date with sharon not looking forward to it i went through the motions of a normal morning showering shaving swallowing coffee dictating reports killed another couple of hours filing and skimming journals at noon mal worthy called and asked me to reserve wednesday for a deposition on the darren burkhalter case working on sunday mal brunch he said waiting for a table evil never rests neither can the good guys going to be seven attorneys on the other side alex have your bullshit detector finely tuned why the army multiple pockets the other drivers insurance company has assigned two of their downtown hotshots the estates sending another the drunk who rammed them was a fairly successful building contractor therere some bucks involved i told you about the brakes which gives us the auto manufacturers mouthpiece and the one representing the dealer who serviced the car the restaurant that served him the drinks makes six add to that a county attorney because were claiming inadequate lighting and insufficient cones around the ditch and youve got seven in toto intimidated should i be nope its quality that counts not quantity right well do it at my office get a little homebase advantage ill start by reading off your qualifications and as usual one of them will cut it off before it gets too hooha and stipulate to your expertise youve done this before you know the whole things supposed to be factfinding polite but ill be there to cover your ass if it starts to get nasty the insurance guys will probably put up the biggest kick their liability is clearest and theyve got the most to lose my hunch is that rather than attack your information per se theyll question the validity of early childhood trauma as a concept is it scientific fact or just shrinky bullshit and even if it is how durable is the damage can you prove that a traumatic experience at eighteen months will warp poor little darren for life never said i could i know that and you know that but please be more subtle on wednesday the important thing is they cant prove hell be fine and if it goes to trial believe me ill make damn sure the burden of proof will be on them a jury is going to feel mighty sorry for a cute little tyke who wakes up from a car nap only to see his fathers head sailing over the back seat and landing right next to him videotaping your sessions was a beautiful touch alex the kid comes across wonderfully vulnerable in a trial situation id get to show every second of footage all that hyper stuff along with the polaroids from the accident nothing like a bloody head to get the old sympathy juices flowing huh nothing like it a jury will fucking believe the concept alex theyll see no way this kid could ever be normal again and lets face it can any of us guarantee something like that could ever heal the other side knows that theyve already thrown out hints of settlement offers pennyante bullshit so its just a question of how much how soon your job will be to tell it like it is but dont get too academic just stick to the old to the best of my psychological knowledge line and well be fine ive got my actuary working overtime want to hook these bastards so tight theyll be paying darrens rent at the oldage home he paused added its only fair alex denises life is shattered its the only way for someone like her to beat the system youre a white knight mal something eating at you he sounded genuinely hurt no everythings fine just a little tired youre sure im sure he said nothing for a moment all right just as long as were communicating were communicating perfectly mal quality not quantity he was silent for a moment then said rest up and take care of yourself doc i want you in peak shape when youre dealing with the seven dwarfs i called sharon just after noon a machine answered my year for them hello this is dr ransom im not in right now but im very interested in receiving your message even on tape the sound of her voice brought back memories the feel of her fingers on my cheek all at once i had to be rid of her decided to do it now i waited for the emergency beeper number that therapists typically include at the end of their tapes but she didnt mention one beep i said sharon this is alex cant make monday good luck short and sweet dr heartbreaker an hour later her face was still in my mind a pale lovely mask drifting in and out of my consciousness i tried to chase the image away succeeded only in making it more vivid i surrendered to reminiscence told myself i was being a horny jerk allowing my little head to think for my big one nevertheless i sank deeper into timebuffered memories and began wondering if id done the right thing by breaking the date at one hoping to exchange one lovely mask for another i phoned san luis obispo robins mother answered yes this is alex rosalie oh hello is robin there no do you know when shell be back shes out with friends i see silence so hows the baby rosalie fine okay then please tell her i called all right bye click the privilege of owning a motherinlaw without having to do the paperwork monday i struggled through the morning paper hoping the venality and lowmindedness of international politics would cast my problems in a trivial light it proved effective until i finished the paper then that old empty feeling returned i fed the fish did a wash went down to the carport started up the seville and drove into south westwood to do some grocery shopping somewhere between frozen foods and canned goods i realized my basket was empty i left the supermarket without buying a thing there was a multiplex theater up the block from the market i chose a feature at random paid the earlybird discount price and sat low in my seat along with giggling teenage couples and other solitary men the show was a lowgrade thriller graced by neither coherent dialogue nor plot i walked out in the middle of a sweatsoaked love scene between the heroine and the dashing psychopath who was going to try to carve her up for postcoital dessert outside it was dark another day vanquished i forced a fastfood burger down my throat headed for home then remembered that the newspaper had been temporarily therapeutic evening a new edition a blind vendor was hawking it from a curb on wilshire i pulled over bought a paper paying with a dollar bill not waiting for the change back home i called my service no impersonal machine for old alex no messages either stripping down to my undershorts i took the times and a cup of instant coffee to bed slow news day most of the evening special was a rehash of the morning edition i stuffed myself on swindles and subterfuge found my eyes blurring perfect then i was brought abruptly back to focus by a story on page not even a story just filler a couple of columninches next to a wireservice piece on the sociological structure of south american fire ants but the headline caught my eye psychologists death possible suicide maura bannon staff writer los angeles police sources said the death of a local psychologist found this morning in her hollywood hills home probably resulted from a selfinflicted gunshot wound the body of sharon ransom was discovered this morning in the bedroom of her nichols canyon home she had apparently died sometime sunday night ransom lived alone in the jalmia drive house which also doubled as an office a native of new york city she was educated and trained in los angeles received her phd in no next of kin have been located sunday night just hours after id called her something cold and rank as sewer gas rose in my gut and bubbled in my throat i forced myself to read the article again and again a couple of column inches filler i thought of black hair blue eyes a blue dress pearls that remarkable face so alive so warm no youre one person to whom i dont have to pretend no i havent been fine not at all a cry for help the implied intimacy had angered me had it blocked me from seeing it for what it was she hadnt looked that upset and why me what had she seen in that quick glance across the shoulders of strangers that had led her to think i was the right one to turn to big mistake old alex fixated on his own needs soft white thighs and pillowy breasts no i havent been fine not at all im sorry to hear that dispensing vendingmachine empathy id reeled her in not giving half a shit enjoyed the feeling of power as she floated toward me passive if it means that much to you we can get together and talk and let me fuck your ears off it means a lot to me i clawed the page free from the paper crumpled it and threw it across the room closing my eyes i tried to let myself cry for her for me for robin for families that fell apart a world falling apart little boys who watched their fathers die anyone in the world who goddam deserved it the tears wouldnt come wait for the beep pull the trigger later after some of the shock wore off i realized that id rescued her once before perhaps shed remembered it had constructed a timemachine fantasy of her own the fall of i was twentyfour a brandnew phd caught up in the novelty of being addressed as doctor but still as poor as a student id just returned to la from the langley porter institute in san francisco to begin my fellowship at western pediatric hospital the position came with a jawbreaker of a title national institute of mental health postdoctoral scholar in clinical psychology and human development jointly appointed to the hospital and its affiliated medical school my job was to treat children teach interns do research and come up with a paper or two the chief psychologist could coauthor my pay was a month which the irs had just declared taxable there was barely enough left over to cover rent and utilities on a dingy overland avenue bachelor flat plainwrap food discount clothing thriftshop books and ongoing life support for a moribund nash rambler not covered was an eightyear accumulation of student loans and debts filed too long under miscellaneous a number of bank creditors delighted in dunning me monthly in order to earn extra money i took on nighttime gigs playing guitar in dance bands the way id scratched by in san francisco irregular work with spotty pay and all the bar food i could get down between sets i also let the university psych department know its illustrious graduate was available for freelance teaching assignments the department ignored me until one afternoon in november when one of its secretaries had me paged at the hospital dr delaware please this is dr delaware alice delaware alex oh it says here alice i thought you were a woman not the last time i checked guess not anyway i know its short notice but if youre available at eight tonight we could use you use away dont you want to hear what its about why not okay we need someone to supervise course a the clinical practicum for first and secondyear graduate students the professor who runs it was called out of town and none of the usual substitutes are available barrelscraping time sounds fine to me okay youre licensed right not until next year oh then im not sure hold on a moment later okay because youre not licensed the pay is eight dollars an hour instead of fifteen and subject to withholding and theres some paperwork youll have to fill out first youve twisted my arm pardon ill be there in theory clinical practicum is a link between book learning and the real world a way to introduce therapistsintraining to the practice of psychotherapy in a nurturant environment at my alma mater the process started early during their first semester clinicalpsych graduate students were assigned patients undergrads referred from the campus counseling service and poor people seeking free treatment at the university health clinic the students diagnosed and treated under the supervision of a faculty member once a week they presented their progress or lack thereof to peers and instructors sometimes things stayed on an intellectual level sometimes they got personal psych a was held in a windowless garret on the third floor of the tudor mansion that housed the clinical program the room was bare of furniture painted a grayish blue and carpeted in grubby gold shag in one corner was a pair of foampadded bats the kind provided by marriage counselors for good clean fighting in another were piled the remains of a disassembled polygraph i arrived five minutes late some paperwork having turned out to be a mountain of forms seven or eight students were already in place theyd removed their shoes and positioned themselves against the sloping walls reading chatting smoking catnapping ignoring me the room smelled of dirty socks tobacco and mildew for the most part they were an older seasonedlooking bunch refugees from the sixties in serapes faded jeans sweat shirts indian jewelry a few wore business clothes every one of them looked serious and burdened straighta students wondering if the grind was worth it hi im dr delaware i let the title roll off my tongue with delight and some guilt feeling like an impostor the students looked me over less than impressed alex i added dr kruse cant make it so im taking over tonight wheres paul asked a woman in her late twenties she was short with prematurely gray hair granny glasses a tight disapproving mouth out of town hollywoods not out of town said a big bearded man in plaid shirt and overalls smoking a freeform danish pipe are you one of his assistants asked the grayhaired woman she was attractive but pinchedlooking with angry nervous eyes a puritan in blue denim she appraised me baldly looked eager to condemn no ive never met him im a new faculty member proclaimed the bearded man as if uncovering a conspiracy i shook my head recent grad phd last june congratulations the bearded man clapped his hands silently a few of the others imitated him i smiled squatted assumed a lotus position near the door whats your usual procedure case presentation said a black woman unless someones got a crisis to bounce around does anyone silence yawns all right whose turn is it to present mine said the black woman she was stocky with a hennaed afro haloing a round chocolate face she wore a black poncho blue jeans and red vinyl boots an oversized carpetbag lay across her lap aurora bogardus second year last week i presented the case of a nineyearold boy with multiple tics paul made suggestions ive got some followup go ahead for starters nothings worked the kids getting worse she removed a chart from the carpetbag flipped through it and gave a brief case history for my benefit then described her initial treatment plan which seemed well thoughtout though unsuccessful that brings us up to date she said any questions gang twenty minutes of discussion followed the students suggestions emphasized social factors the familys poverty and frequent moves the anxiety the child was probably experiencing due to lack of friends someone commented that the boys being black in a racist society was a major stressor aurora bogardus looked disgusted i believe im well aware of that meanwhile ive still got to deal with the damned tics on a behavioral level the more he twitches the angrier everyone gets at him then everyone needs to learn to deal with that anger said the bearded man fine and dandy julian said aurora in the meantime the kids being ostracized i need action the operant conditioning system if you were paying attention julian you would have just heard that your operant conditioning system didnt work neither did the role manipulation paul suggested last week what kind of role manipulation i asked change the programming its part of his approach toward therapy communication dynamics shake up the family structure get them to change their power positions so that theyll be open to new behaviors get them to change in what way she gave me a weary look paul had me instruct the parents and siblings to start twitching and shaking too exaggeratedly he said once the symptom became part of the family norm it would cease to have rebellion value for the boy and would drop out of his behavioral repertoire whys that she shook her head its his theory not mine i said nothing maintained a look of curiosity okay okay she said according to paul symptoms are communications because the tic communication wouldnt be unique anymore the kid would have to find some other way of working through his rebellion it sounded illconceived potentially cruel and made me wonder about dr paul kruse i see hey i thought it was bullshit too said aurora going to tell paul that next week sure you will said someone watch me she closed the chart and put it back in her bag meanwhile this poor little boys shaking and twitching and his selfesteem is going right down the tubes have you thought of tourettes syndrome i asked she dismissed the question with a frown of course but he doesnt swear not all tourettes patients do paul said the symptoms didnt conform to a typical tourettes pattern in what way another weary look her answer took five minutes and was seriously flawed my doubts about kruse grew i still think you should consider tourettes i said we dont know enough about the syndrome to exclude atypical cases my advice is refer the boy to a pediatric neurologist haldol may be indicated ye olde medical model said julian he tamped his pipe relit it aurora moved her jaws as if chewing what are you feeling now one of the other men asked her he was narrowshouldered and thin with rusty hair tied in a ponytail and a drooping ragged mustache he wore a wrinkled brown corduroy suit buttondown shirt extrawide rep tie and dirty sneakers and spoke in a soft musical voice saturated with empathy but unctuous like a confessor or kiddieshow host share your feelings with us aurora oh christ she turned to me yeah ill do what you say if the medical model is what it takes so be it you sound frustrated said the grayhaired woman aurora turned on her lets cut the shit and move on okay before gray hair could reply the door opened all eyes drifted upward all eyes hardened a beautiful blackhaired girl stood in the doorway holding an armful of books girl not woman she looked girlish could have been an undergrad and for a moment i thought shed come to the wrong place but she stepped into the room my first thought was time warp she had a dark wounded beauty like an actress in one of those blackandwhite lateshow films noirs where good and evil blur visual images vie for control with a sinuous jazz score and everything ends ambiguously she wore a clinging pink knit dress piped with white and bisected by a white leather belt pink pumps with medium heels her hair had been rolled and set every strand in place gleaming her face was powdered mascaraed her lips glossed a wetlooking pink the dress reached her knees the leg that showed was shapely encased in sheer nylon her jewelry was real gold her nails long and polished the hue of the polish identical to that of the dress but precisely one shade deeper and perfume the fragrance cut through the staleness of the room soap and water fresh grass and spring flowers all curves and swells porcelain whiteness and dusty rose flawlessly put together almost painfully out of place in that sea of denim and deliberate drabness suzy creamcheese somebody muttered she heard it and winced looked around for a place to sit no empty spaces no one moved i shifted to one side said over here she stared at me hes dr delaware said julian alex hes endured the rites and rituals of this department and emerged seemingly unscathed she gave a fleeting smile sat down next to me folded her legs under a stretch of white thigh showed she tugged the dress down over her knees it caused the fabric to go tight over her breasts and accentuate their fullness her eyes were wide and bright midnightblue so dark the pupils blended with the irises sorry im late she said a sweet creamy voice so what else is new said gray hair any more followups to present i asked no one answered then i guess we can move on to new material what about sharon said ponytail grinning at the new arrival you havent shared a thing with us all semester sharon the blackhaired girl shook her head i really dont have anything prepared walter whats to prepare just pick a case give us the benefit of your wisdom or at least pauls wisdom said julian snickers nods of assent she pulled at her earlobe turned to me seeking reprieve the crack about kruse helped explain the tension that had accompanied her entrance whatever his therapeutic skills at manipulating roles this supervisor had allowed his group to be poisoned by favoritism but i was hired help not the one to deal with it i asked her have you presented at all this semester no alarmed do you have any case you could discuss i i suppose so she gave me a look more pitying than resentful youre hurting me but its not your fault shaken a bit i said then go ahead please the one i could talk about is a woman ive been seeing for two months shes a nineteenyearold sophomore initial testing shows her to be within normal limits on every measure with the mmpi depression scale a little elevated her boyfriend is a senior they met the first week of the semester and have been going together ever since she selfreferred to the counseling center because of problems in their relationship what kinds of problems asked gray hair a communication breakdown in the beginning they could talk to each other later things started to change now theyre pretty bad be more specific said gray hair sharon thought im not sure what you are they fucking asked ponytail walter sharon turned red and looked down at the carpet an oldfashioned blush i hadnt thought it still existed a few of the students looked embarrassed for her the rest seemed to be enjoying it are they pressed walter fucking she bit her lip theyre having relations yes how often i really havent kept a record why not it could be an important parameter of hold on i said give her a chance to finish shell never finish said gray hair weve been through this before terminal defensiveness if we dont confront it cut it off where it grows well be spinning our wheels the whole session theres nothing to confront i said let her get the facts out then well discuss them right said gray hair another protective male heard from you bring it out in them princess sharon ease up maddy said aurora bogardus let her talk sure sure gray hair folded her arms across her chest sat back glared waited go ahead i told sharon shed sat in silence removed from the fray like a parent waiting out a spat between siblings now she picked up where shed left off calm or on the edge theres been a communication breakdown the patient says she loves her boyfriend but feels theyre growing distant from one another they can no longer talk about things they used to be able to discuss such as asked julian through a cloud of smoke just about everything everything what to have for breakfast stuffing versus potatoes at this point yes theres been a complete breakdown breakdown said maddy youve used that word three times without explaining what you mean try clarifying rather than restating operationalize the word breakdown things have deteriorated said sharon making it sound like a question maddy laughed terrific that makes it perfectly clear sharon lowered her voice i dont really know what youre getting at maddy maddy shook her head in disgust said to no one in particular why waste time on this shit second the motion someone said i said lets stick to the case sharon why does this girl feel things have broken down weve discussed that for several sessions she claims she doesnt know at first she thought hed lost interest and was seeing another woman he denies that he spends all his free time with her so she thinks hes telling the truth but when theyre together he wont talk and seems angry at her or at least she feels that it came on all of a sudden got worse did anything else happen at that time i asked some kind of stressful event another blush did they begin having sex at that time sharon nod around then were there sexual problems its hard to know bullshit said maddy it would be easy to know if youd done your job properly i turned to her and asked how would you go about getting that kind of information maddy be real establish rapport she ticked each phrase off with her finger know the specific defenses of the client be prepared for the defensive bullshit and roll with it but if that doesnt work confront and stay with it until the client knows you mean business then simply go for it bring up the subject for christs sake shes been seeing this woman for two months she should have done all of that by now i looked at sharon i have she said the blush still in force weve talked about her defenses it takes time there are problems sure are said julian seckshooall problems enunciated maddy say the s word honey next time itll be easier scattered laughter sharon seemed to be taking it calmly but i kept my eye on her share the problems with us walter was urging grinning and playing with his ponytail they she isnt satisfied said sharon is she coming asked julian i dont think so dont think so no no she isnt then what are you doing to help her come she bit her lip again speak up said maddy sharons hands began to shake she laced her fingers together to hide it weve weve talked about reducing her anxiety relaxing her oh christ blame the woman said maddy who says its her problem maybe its him maybe hes a bumbler or a preemie she says hes okay shes the one whos nervous have you done any deep muscle relaxation asked aurora systematic desensitization no nothing that structured its still hard for her to talk about it wonder why said julian were just working on trying to stay calm said sharon it sounded like selfdescription hard to be calm about primal issues soothed walter have they done oral sex uh yes uh in what way she looked back down at the carpet the usual i dont know what that means sharon he looked at the others do any of you orchestrated smiles and shakes of the head a predatory bunch i pictured them as fullfledged therapists in a few years scary sharon was looking at the floor fighting a losing battle with her hands i thought of intervening wondered whether that violated the norms of the group decided i didnt care if it did but being too protective would harm her more in the long run while i was deliberating walter said what kind of oral sex i think we all know what oral sex is i said his eyebrows rose do we i wonder do any of you wonder this is bullshit said aurora got too many things to do she stood hefted her carpetbag and stamped out of the room three or four others followed quickly the door slammed a tight silence followed sharons eyes were moist and her earlobe had been tugged scarlet lets move on to something else i said lets not shouted maddy paul says no holds barred why the hell should she be the exception her anger seemed to lift her from the floor why the hell does she get saved every time she gets into her defensive mode and shuts us out to sharon this is reality honey not some fucking sorority game a fucking sorority game wouldnt be halfbad mused julian he sucked on his pipe ostentatiously back off i said he smiled as if he hadnt heard me stretched and recrossed his legs sorry alex no backoffs walter informed me pauls rules a tear dribbled down sharons cheek she wiped it away they do the usual meaning sucking ah said walter now were getting somewhere he held out his hands palms up fingers curled come on keep going the gesture seemed lecherous sharon sensed it too she looked away from him and said thats all walter tsk tsk said julian raising a professorial pipe lets operationalize does she suck him or does he suck her or have they advanced to mutual sucking the old sixnine pretzel sharons hands flew to her face she coughed to keep from crying camille said maddy what bullshit enough i barked maddys face darkened another authoritarian father figure heard from easy said someone everyone mellow out sharon got to her feet scooping up her books struggling with them all white legs and rustling nylon im sorry please excuse me she made a grab for the doorknob twisted it and ran out walter said catharsis could be a breakthrough i looked at him at all of them saw vulture smiles smugness and something else a flicker of fear class dismissed i said i caught up with her just as she reached the sidewalk sharon she kept running wait a second please she stopped kept her back to me i stepped in front of her she stared down at the pavement then up at the sky the night was starless her hair merged with it so that only her face was visible a pale floating mask im sorry i said she shook her head no it was my fault i acted like a baby totally inappropriate theres nothing inappropriate about not wanting to be bludgeoned theyre some bunch i should have kept a tighter rein on things should have seen what was happening she finally made eye contact smiled thats all right no one could have seen is it like that all the time sometimes dr kruse approves dr kruse says we have to confront our own defense systems before being able to help others small laugh i guess i have a ways to go youll do fine i said in the long run this kind of stuffs irrelevant thats nice of you to say dr delaware alex the smile widened thanks for checking on me alex i guess youd better be heading back to class class is over are you sure youre okay im fine she shifted her weight from one hip to the other trying to get a firmer grip on the books here let me help you with those something in her was bringing out the lancelot in me she said no no thats okay but didnt stop me from taking the books wheres your car im walking i live in the dorms curtis hall i can drive you to curtis its really not necessary it would be my pleasure well then she said id like that i dropped her off at the dorm made a date for the following saturday she was waiting at the curb when i came to pick her up wearing a yellow cashmere sweater blackandyellow tartan skirt black knee socks and loafers she let me open the car door for her the second my hand touched the steering wheel hers was upon it warm and firm we had dinner at one of the smoky noisy beerandpizza joints that cling to every college campus the best i could afford staking out a corner table we watched road runner cartoons ate and drank smiled at each other i couldnt keep my eyes off her wanted to know more about her to forge an impossible instant intimacy she fed me nibbles of information about herself she was twentyone had grown up on the east coast graduated from a small womens college come west for graduate school then she steered the conversation to grad school academic issues remembering the insinuations of the other students i asked about her association with kruse she said he was her faculty adviser made it sound unimportant when i asked what he was like she said he was dynamic and creative then changed the subject again i dropped it but remained curious after that ugly session id asked around about kruse had learned he was one of the clinical associates a new arrival whod already earned a reputation as a skirtchaser and an attentiongrabber not the kind of mentor i would have thought right for someone like sharon then again what did i really know about sharon about what was right for her i tried to learn more she danced nimbly away from my questions kept shifting the focus to me i experienced some frustration understood for an instant the anger of the other students then i reminded myself wed just met i was being pushy expecting too much too soon her demeanor suggested old money a conservative sheltered background precisely the kind of upbringing that would stress the dangers of instant intimacy yet there was the matter of her hand stroking mine the open affection of her smile not playing hardtoget at all we talked psychology she knew her stuff but kept deferring to my superior knowledge i sensed real depth beneath the suzy creamcheese exterior and something else agreeableness a ladylike niceness that caught me by pleasant surprise in that age of fourletter female anger masquerading as liberation my diploma said i was a doctor of the mind a sage at twentyfour grand arbiter of relationships but relationships still scared me women still scared me since adolescence id indentured myself to a regimen of study work more study struggling to pull myself up out of bluecollar purgatory and expecting the human factor to fall into place along with my career goals but new goals kept popping up and at twentyfour i was still pulling my social life limited to casual encounters mandatory calisthenic sex my last date had been more than two months ago a brief misadventure with a pretty blond neonatology intern from kansas who asked me out as we stood in the cafeteria line at the hospital she suggested the restaurant paid for her own meal invited herself to my apartment immediately sprawled on the couch popped a quaalude and got peevish when i refused to take one a moment later the peevishness was forgotten and she was bucknaked grinning and pointing to her crotch this is la buster eat pussy two months now here i was sitting opposite a demure beauty who made me feel like einstein and wiped her mouth even when it was clean i drank her in in the candleinchiantibottle light of that pizza joint everything she did seemed special spurning beer for up laughing like a kid at the misfortunes of wile e coyote twirling strands of hot cheese around her finger before taking them between perfect white teeth a flash of pink tongue i constructed a past for her one that reeked of high wasp sensibilities summer homes cotillions deb balls the hunt scores of suitors the scientist in me snipped my fantasies midframe total conjecture hotshot shes left you empty spaces youre filling them in with blind guesses i made another stab at finding out who she was she answered me without telling me a thing got me talking about myself again i surrendered to the cheap thrills of autobiography she made it easy she was a firstrate listener propping her chin on her knuckles staring up at me with those huge blue eyes making it clear that every word i uttered was monumentally important playing with my fingers laughing at my jokes tossing her hair so that the light caught her earrings at that point in time i was gods gift to sharon ransom it felt better than anything else i could recall without all that her looks might have snagged me even in that raucous place teeming with lush young bodies and heartbreaking faces her beauty was a magnet it seemed obvious that every passing man was stopping and caressing her visually the women appraising her with fierce acuity she was unaware of it remained zeroed in on me i heard myself open up talk about things i hadnt thought of in years whatever problems she might have shed clean up as a therapist from the beginning i wanted her physically with an intensity that shook me but something about her a fragility that i sensed or imagined held me back for half a dozen dates it remained chaste handholds and goodnight pecks a noseful of that light fresh perfume id drive home swollen but oddly content subsisting on recollections as we headed toward the dorm after our seventh evening together she said dont drop me off yet alex drive around the corner she directed me to a dark shaded side street adjacent to one of the athletic fields i parked she leaned over turned off the ignition removed her shoes and climbed over the seat and into the back of the rambler come she said i followed her over glad id washed the car sat beside her took her in my arms kissed her lips her eyes the sweet spot under her neck she shivered squirmed i touched her breast felt her heart pounding we kissed some more deeper longer i put my hand on her knee she shivered gave me a look that i thought was fear i lifted my hand she put it back between her knees wedged me in a soft hot vise then she spread her legs i went exploring up columns of white marble she was splayed had thrown her head back had her eyes closed was breathing through her mouth no underwear i rolled her skirt up saw a generous delta soft and black as sable fur oh god i said and started to pleasure her she held me back with one hand reached for my zipper with the other in a second i was free pointing skyward come to me she said i obeyed with milo out of town my only other police contact was delano hardy a dapper black detective who sometimes worked as milos partner a few years ago hed saved my life id bought him a guitar a classic fender stratocaster that robin had restored it was clear who owed whom but i called him anyway the desk man at west la told me detective hardy wouldnt be in until the following morning i debated trying him at home but knew he was a family man always trying to scrounge more time for his kids and left a message for him to call me i thought of someone who wouldnt mind being called at home ned biondi was one of those journalists who lived for the story hed been a metro writerreporter when i met him had since progressed to associate editor but managed to squeeze in a story now and then ned owed me id helped reverse his daughters descent to neardeath from anorexia hed taken a year and a half to pay me then added to his personal debt by profiting from a couple of big stories that id steered his way just after pm i reached him at his home in woodland hills doc i was going to call you oh yeah just got back from boston annemarie sends her love hows she doing still skinnier than wed like but otherwise great she started socialwork school this fall got a parttime job and found a new boyfriend to replace the bastard who dumped her give her my best will do whats up i wanted to ask you about a story in todays final suicide of a psychologist page twenty what about it i knew the woman ned oh jeez thats lousy is there anything more to it than what you printed no reason for there to be it wasnt exactly a hot scoop in fact i believe we got it over the phone from police communications no one actually went out to the scene is there anything you know that i should nothing at all whos maura bannon just a kid student intern friend of annemaries in fact shes doing a semester of work study little here little there she was the one who pushed for the piece kind of a naïve kid thought the shri psychologist suicide angle was newsworthy those of us familiar with the real world were less impressed but we let her stick it in the computer just to make her happy turns out section one ends up using it as filler the kids thrilled want me to have her call you if she has anything to tell me i doubt that she does pause doc the lady in question did you know her well my lie was reflexive not really it just came as a shock seeing the name of someone i knew must have said ned but his tone had turned wary you called sturgis first i assume hes out of town aha listen doc i dont want to be insensitive but if theres something about the lady that would flesh out the story id be open to hearing about it theres nothing ned okay sorry for snooping force of habit thats all right talk to you soon ned at eleventhirty i took a walk in the dark trudging up the glen toward mulholland listening to crickets and night birds when i got home an hour later the phone was ringing hello dr delaware this is yvette at your service im glad i caught you a call came in for you twenty minutes ago from your wife up in san luis obispo she left a message wanted to make sure you got it your wife slaponasunburn theyd been making the same mistake for years once upon a time it had been amusing whats the message shes on the move will be hard to reach shell get in touch with you when she can did she leave a number no she didnt dr delaware you sound tired been working too hard something like that stay well dr delaware same to you on the move hard to reach it should have hurt but i felt relieved unburdened since saturday id barely thought about robin had filled my mind with sharon i felt like an adulterer ashamed but thrilled i crawled into bed and hugged myself to sleep at two fortyfive in the morning i woke up wired and itchy after throwing on some clothes i staggered down to the carport and started up the seville i drove south to sunset headed east through beverly hills and boystown toward the western tip of hollywood and nichols canyon at that hour even the strip was dead i kept the windows open let the sharp chill gnaw at my face at fairfax i turned left traveled north and swung onto hollywood boulevard mention the boulevard to most people and inevitably one of two images comes to mind the good old days of graumans chinese the walk of the stars blacktie premieres a neonflooded night scene or the street as it is today slimy and vicious promising random violence but west of that scene just past la brea hollywood boulevard shows another face a single mile of treelined residential neighborhood decently maintained apartment buildings old stately churches and only slightly tarnished twostory homes perched atop welltended sloping lawns looking down on this smudge of suburbia is a section of the santa monica mountain range that meanders through la like a crooked spine in this part of hollywood the mountains seem to surge forward threateningly pushing against the fragile dermis of civilization nichols canyon begins a couple of blocks east of fairfax a lane and a half of winding blacktop feeding off the north side of the boulevard and running parallel to a summerdry wash small rustic houses sit behind the wash concealed by tangles of brush accessible only over homemade footbridges i passed a department of water and power terminal station lit by high arc lamps that gave off a harsh glare just beyond the terminal was floodcontrol district marshland fenced with chain link then larger houses on flatter ground sparsely distributed something wild and swift scurried across the road and dived into the bush coyote in the old days sharon had talked about seeing them though id never spotted one the old days what the hell was i expecting to gain by exhuming them by driving past her house like some moony teenager hoping to catch a glimpse of his beloved stupid neurotic but i craved something tangible something to reassure me shed once been real that i was real i drove on nichols veered to the right the straightaway turned into jalmia drive and compressed to a single lane darkened even further under a canopy of trees the road lurched dipped finally deadended without warning at a bamboowalled culdesac slotted with several steep driveways the one i was looking for was marked by a white mailbox on a stake and a white lattice gate that sagged on its posts i pulled to the side parked cut the engine and got out cool air night sounds the gate was unlocked and flimsy no more of a barrier than it had been years ago lifting it to avoid scraping the cement i looked around saw no one swung the gate open and passed through closing it behind me i began climbing on both sides of the driveway were plantings of fan palm bird of paradise yucca and giant banana classic fifties california landscaping nothing had changed i climbed on unmolested surprised at the absence of any kind of police presence officially the lapd treated suicides as if they were homicides and the departmental bureaucracy moved slothfully this soon after the death the file would certainly be open the paperwork barely begun there should have been warning posters a crimescene cordon some kind of marker nothing then i heard a burst of ignition and the rumble of a highperformance car engine louder i ducked behind one of the palms and pressed myself into the vegetation a white porsche carrera appeared from around the top of the drive and rolled slowly down in low gear with its headlights off the car passed within inches and i made out the face of the driver hatchetshaped fortyish with slit eyes and oddly mottled skin a wide black mustache spread above thin lips forming a stark contrast with blowdried snowwhite hair and thick white eyebrows not a face easily forgotten cyril trapp captain cyril trapp west la homicide milos boss a onetime hardboozing highlifer with flexible ethics now born again into religious sanctimony and gut hatred of anything irregular for the past year trapp had done his best to wear down milo a gay cop was as irregular as they come closedminded but not stupid he went about his persecution with subtlety avoiding deliberate gaybashing choosing instead to designate milo a sex crimes specialist and assign him to every homosexual murder that came up in west la exclusively it isolated my friend narrowed his life and plunged him into a roiling bath of blood and gore boy hookers destroyed and destroying corpses moldering because the morgue drivers didnt show to pick them up for fear of catching aids when milo complained trapp insisted he was simply making use of milos specialized knowledge of the deviant subculture the second complaint brought him an insubordination report in his file pushing the issue would have meant going up before hearing boards and hiring a lawyer the police benevolent association wouldnt go to bat on this one and unremitting media attention that would turn milo into the crusading gay cop that was something he wasnt probably never would be ready for so he pushed his oars through the muck working compulsively and starting to drink again the porsche disappeared down the drive but i could still hear its engine pulsate in a chugging idle then the creak of the car door opening padded footsteps the scrape of the gate finally trapp drove away so quietly i knew he was coasting i waited a few minutes and stepped out of the foliage thought about what id seen a captain checking out a routine suicide a west la captain checking out a hollywood division suicide it made no sense at all or was the visit something personal the use of the porsche instead of an unmarked suggested just that trapp and sharon involved too grotesque to contemplate too logical to dismiss i resumed my walk climbed up to the house and tried not to think about it nothing had changed the same high banks of ivy so tall they seemed to engulf the structure the same circular slab of concrete in lieu of a lawn at the center of the slab a raised circular bed rimmed with lava rock housed a pair of towering cocoa palms beyond the palms a lowslung onestory house gray stucco the front windowless and flatfaced shielded by a façade of vertically slatted wood and marked with oversized address numerals the roof was pitched almost flat and coated with white pebbles off to one side was a detached carport no car no signs of habitation at first glance an ugly piece of work one of those moderne structures that spread over postwar la aging poorly but i knew there was beauty within a freeform clifftop pool that wrapped itself around the north side of the house and gave the illusion of bleeding off into space walls of glass that afforded a breathtakingly uninterrupted canyon view the house had made a big impression on me though i didnt realize it until years later when the time came to buy a home of my own and i found myself gravitating toward a similar ecology hilltop remoteness wood and glass the indooroutdoor blend and geologic impermanence that characterize canyon living in la the front door was unobtrusive just another section of the slatted façade i tried it locked looked around some more and noticed something different a sign attached to the trunk of one of the palms i went over for a closer look and squinted just enough starlight to make out the letters for sale a real estate company with an office on north vermont in the los feliz district below it another sign smaller the name and number of the salesperson mickey mehrabian on the market before the body was cold routine suicide notwithstanding it had to be the fastest probate in california history unless the house hadnt belonged to her but shed told me it did shed told me lots of things i memorized mickey mehrabians number when i got back to the seville i wrote it down the following morning i called the real estate office mickey mehrabian was a woman with a lauren bacall voice slightly accented i made an appointment to see the house at eleven spent the next hour thinking about the first time id seen it something to show you alex surprise surprise shed been full of them i expected her to be flooded with suitors but she was always available when i asked her out even on the shortest notice and when a patient crisis caused me to break a date she never complained never pushed or pressured me for commitment of any sort the least demanding human being id ever known we made love nearly every time we were together though we never spent the night together at first she begged off going to my place wanted to do it in the backseat of the car after wed known each other for several months she relented but even when she did share my bed she treated it as if it were a backseat never completely disrobing never falling asleep after waking up several times from my own postcoital torpor to find her sitting on the edge of the bed fully dressed tugging her ear i asked her what was bothering her nothing im just restless always have been i have trouble sleeping anywhere but my own bed are you angry no of course not is there anything i can do take me home when youre ready i accommodated myself to her needs rut and run some of the edge was taken off my pleasure but enough remained to keep me coming back for more her pleasure the lack of it preyed on my mind she went through passionate motions moving energetically fueled by an energy that i wasnt sure was erotic but she never came it wasnt that she was unresponsive she was easily moistened always willing seemed to enjoy the act but climax wasnt part of her agenda when i was finished she was having given something to me but not her self i knew damn well that it wasnt right but her sweetness and beauty the thrill of possessing this creature i was sure everyone wanted sustained me an adolescent fantasy to be sure but a part of me wasnt that far past adolescence her arm around my waist was enough to make me hard thoughts of her trickled into idle moments and filled my senses i put my doubts aside but eventually it started to nag at me i wanted to give as much as i was getting because i really cared for her on top of that of course my male ego was crying out for reassurance was i too quick i worked at endurance she rode me out tireless as if we were engaged in some sort of athletic competition i tried being gentle got nowhere switched and did the caveman bit experimented with positions strummed her like a guitar worked over her and under her until i dripped with sweat and my body ached went down on her with blind devotion nothing worked i remembered the sexual inhibitions shed projected in practicum the case that had stymied her communications breakdown dr kruse says we have to confront our own defense systems before being able to help others the attack upon her defenses had brought her to tears i struggled to find a way to communicate without breaking her mentally composed and discarded several speeches before finally coming up with a monologue that seemed minimally hurtful i chose to deliver it as we lay sprawled in the back of the rambler still connected my head on her sweatered breast her hands stroking my hair she kept stroking as she listened then kissed me and said dont worry about me alex im just fine i want you to enjoy it too oh i do alex i love it she began rocking her hips enlarging me then wrapping her arms around me as i continued to swell inside of her she forced my head down smothered my mouth with hers tightening the pressure of her pelvis and her arms taking charge imprisoning me arcing and swallowing rotating and releasing heightening the pace until the pleasure was squeezed out of me in long convulsive waves i cried out gloriously helpless felt my spine shatter my joints come loose from their sockets when i was still she began stroking my hair again i was still erect began to move again she rolled out from under me smoothed her skirt took out a compact and fixed her makeup sharon she placed a finger on my lips youre so good to me she said wonderful i closed my eyes drifted away for several moments when i opened them she was gazing off in the distance as if i werent there from that night on i gave up hope of perfect love and took her selfishly she rewarded my compliance with devotion subservience though i was the one being molded the therapist in me knew it was wrong i employed the therapists rationalization to quell my doubts it did no good to push shed change when she was ready summer came and my fellowship ended sharon had completed the first year of grad school with top grades in all her qualifying exams id just passed my licensing exam and had a job lined up at western pediatric come autumn time to celebrate but no income until autumn the tone of the creditors letters had turned threatening when the opportunity to earn some real money presented itself i grabbed it an eightweek danceband gig back up in san francisco playing three sets a night six nights a week at the mark hopkins four grand plus room and board at a lombard street motel i asked her to come north with me spun visions of breakfast in sausalito good theater the palace of fine arts hiking on mt tamalpais she said id love to alex but ive some things to take care of what kinds of things family business problems back home she answered quickly oh no just the usual that doesnt tell me a thing i said i have no idea what the usual is because you never talk about your family soft kiss shrug theyre just a family like any other let me guess they want to haul you back to civilization so they can fix you up with the local scions she laughed kissed me again scions hardly i put my arm around her waist nuzzled her oh yeah i can see it now in a few weeks ill pick up the paper and see your picture in the society pages engaged to one of those guys with three last names and a career in investment banking that made her giggle i dont think so my dear and whys that because my heart belongs to you i took her face in my hands looked into her eyes does it sharon of course alex what do you think i think after all this time i dont know you very well you know me better than anyone thats still not very well she tugged her ear i really care about you alex then live with me when we get back ill get a bigger place a better one she kissed me so deeply i thought it signaled agreement then she pulled away and said its not that simple why not things are just complicated please lets not talk about this right now all right i said but consider it she licked the underside of my chin said yum consider this we began necking i pressed her to me buried myself in her hair her flesh it was like diving into a vat of sweet cream i unbuttoned her blouse said im really going to miss you i miss you already thats sweet she said well have fun in september then she began unzipping my fly at tenforty i left to meet the real estate agent the mild summer had finally begun to wilt surrendering to high eighties temperatures and air that smelled like oven exhaust but nichols canyon still looked fresh sunwashed filled with country sounds hard to believe hollywood the grifters and geeks was only yards away when i got to the house the lattice gate was open driving the seville up to the house i parked it next to a big burgundy fleetwood brougham with chrome wire wheels a phone antenna on the rear deck and plates that said selhous a tall dark brunette got out of the car midforties aerobicsfirm and shapely in tight acidwashed jeans highheeled boots and a blousy scoopnecked black suede top decorated with rhinestones she carried a snakeskin purse wore large onyx and glass costume jewelry and hexagonal bluetinted sunglasses doctor im mickey a wide automatic smile spread under the glasses alex delaware it is dr delaware yes she pushed the glasses up her forehead eyed the coat of dirt on the seville then my clothes old cords faded workshirt huaraches running a mental dun and bradstreet on me says hes a doctor but the citys full of bullshit artists drives a caddy but its eight years old another phony putting on the dog or someone who once had it and lost it beautiful day she said one hand on the door handle still scrutinizing still wary meeting strange men up in the hills had to give a woman frequent pause i smiled tried to look harmless said beautiful and looked at the house in the daylight the déjà vu was even stronger my personal patch of ghost town spooky she mistook my silent appraisal for displeasure said theres a fabulous view from the inside its really a charmer great bones i think it was designed by one of neutras students interesting it just came on the market doctor we havent even run ads in fact how did you find out about it ive always liked nichols canyon i said a friend who lives nearby told me it was available oh what kind of a doctor are you psychologist taking a day off half day one of the few i checked my watch and tried to look busy that seemed to reassure her her smile reappeared my niece wants to be a psychologist shes a very smart little girl thats terrific good luck to her oh i think we make our own luck dont we doctor she pulled keys out of her handbag and we walked to the slatted front door it opened to a small courtyard a few potted plants glass wind chimes that i remembered dangling over the lintel silent in the hot static air we went inside and she began her spiel all wellrehearsed pep i pretended to listen nodded and said uh huh at the right times forced myself to follow rather than lead i knew the place better than she did the interior smelled of carpet cleaning fluid and pine disinfectant sparkly clean expunged of death and disorder but to me it seemed mournful and forbidding a black museum the front of the house was a single open area encompassing living room dining area study and kitchen the kitchen was early decomassacre avocadogreen cabinetry roundedged coralcolored formica tops and a coral vinylcovered breakfast nook tucked into one corner the furniture was blond wood synthetic pastel fabrics and spidery black iron legs the kind of postwar jetstreamed stuff that looks poised for takeoff walls of textured beige plaster were hung with portraits of harlequins and serene seascapes bracket bookshelves were crowded with volumes on psychology the same books a bland listless room but the blandness projected the eye toward the east toward a wall of glass so clean it seemed invisible panels of sheet glass segmented by sliding glass doors on the other side was a narrow terrazzotiled terrace rimmed with white iron railing beyond the railing an eyeful a mindful of canyons peaks blue skies summer foliage isnt it something said mickey mehrabian spreading one arm as if the panorama were a picture shed painted really something we walked out on the terrace i felt dizzy remembered an evening of dancing brazilian guitars something to show you alex late september i got back to la before sharon did more solvent and lonely as hell shed left without leaving an address or number we hadnt exchanged as much as a postcard i should have been angry yet she was all i thought about as i drove down the coast i headed straight for curtis hall the floor counselor told me shed checked out of the dorm wouldnt be returning this semester no forwarding address no number i drove away enraged and miserable certain id been right shed been seduced back to the good life plied with rich boys new toys she was never coming back my apartment looked dingier than ever i avoided it spent as much time as possible at the hospital where the challenges of my new job helped distract me i took on a full caseload from the waiting list volunteered for the night shift in the emergency room on the third day she showed up at my office looking happy almost feverish with delight she closed the door deep kisses and embraces she made sounds about missing me let my hands roam her curves then she pulled away flushed and laughing free for lunch doctor she took me to the hospital parking lot to a shiny red convertible a brand new alfa romeo spider like it sure its great she tossed me the keys you drive we had lunch at an italian place on los feliz listened to opera and ate cannoli for dessert back in the car she said theres something i want to show you alex and directed me west to nichols canyon as i pulled up the driveway to the gray pebbleroofed house she said so what do you think doc who lives here yours truly youre renting it no its mine she got out of the car and skipped to the front door i was surprised to find the house furnished even more surprised by the dated fifties look of the place these were the days when organic was king earth tones homemade candles and batiks all this aluminum and plastic the flat cold colors seemed déclassé cartoonish she glided around exuding pride of ownership touching and straightening pulled open drapes and exposed the wall of glass the view made me forget the aluminum not a students pad by a long shot i thought an arrangement someone had set the place up for her someone old enough to have bought furniture in the fifties kruse shed never really clarified their relationship so what do you think doc really something howd you swing it she was in the kitchen pouring up into two glasses pouting you dont like it no no i do its fantastic your tone of voice tells me different alex i was just wondering how you managed it financially she gave a theatrical glower and answered in a mata hari voice i haf secret life aha oh alex dont be so glum its not as if i slept with anybody to get it that shook me i said i wasnt implying you had her grin was wicked but it did cross your mind sweet prince never i looked out at the mountains the sky was pale aqua above a horizon of pinkish brown more fifties color coordination nothing crossed my mind i said i just wasnt prepared i dont see or hear from you all summer now this she handed me a soda put her head on my shoulder its gorgeous i said not as gorgeous as you but gorgeous enjoy it thank you alex youre so sweet we stood there for a while sipping then she unlatched the sliding door and we stepped out onto the terrace narrow white space cantilevering over a sheer drop like stepping onto a cloud the chalky smell of dry brush rose up from the canyons in the distance was the hollywood sign sagging splintering a billboard for shattered dreams theres a pool too she said around the other side wanna skinnydip she smiled and leaned on the railing i touched her hair put my hand under her sweater and massaged her spine she made a contented sound leaned against me reached around and stroked my jaw i guess i should explain she said its just that its involved ive got time i said do you really she asked suddenly excited she turned around held my face in her hands you dont have to get back to the hospital right away nothing but meetings until six im due at the er at eight great we can sit here for a while and watch the sunset then ill drive you back you were going to explain i reminded her but shed already gone inside and turned on the stereo slow brazilian music came on gentle guitars and discreet percussion lead me she said back on the terrace snaking her arms around me in dancing the mans supposed to lead we swayed together bellytobelly tonguetotongue when the music ended she took my hand and led me through a short foyer into her bedroom more bleached glasstopped furniture a pole lamp a low wide bed with a square bleached headboard above it two narrow high windows she removed her shoes as i kicked off mine i noticed something on the walls crude childish drawings of apples pencil and crayon on oatmealcolored pulp paper but glassframed and expensively matted odd but i didnt spend much time wondering about it shed drawn blackout drapes across the windows plunged the room into darkness i smelled her perfume felt her hand cupping my groin come she said a disembodied voice and her hands settled upon my shoulders with surprising strength she bore down on me and lowered me to the bed got on top of me and kissed me hard we embraced and rolled made love fully clothed she sitting with her back against the headboard legs spread and drawn up sharply her hands clasping her knees i kneeling before her as if in prayer impaling her while gripping the top rim of the headboard a cramped backseat position when it was over she slid out from under me and said now ill explain im an orphan both of my parents died last year my heart was still pounding i said im sorry they were wonderful people alex very glamorous very gracious and courant a dispassionate way to talk about ones dead parents but grief could take many forms the important thing was that she was talking opening up daddy was an art director for one of the big publishing houses in new york she said mummy was an interior designer we lived in manhattan on park avenue and had a place in palm beach and another on long island southampton i was their only little girl the last sentence was uttered with special solemnity as if lacking siblings were an honor of the first rank they were active people traveled a lot by themselves but it didnt bother me because i knew they loved me very much last year they were in spain on holiday near majorca they were driving home from a party when their car went off a cliff i took her in my arms she felt loose and relaxed could have been talking about the weather unable to read her face in the darkness i listened for a catch in her voice rapid breathing some evidence of sorrow nothing im so sorry for you sharon thank you its been very hard thats why i didnt want to talk about them it was just too much to handle intellectually i know thats not the optimal way to deal with it that keeping it bottled up only leads to pathological grief and raises the risk of all kinds of symptoms but affectively i just couldnt talk about it every time i tried i just couldnt dont pressure yourself everyone goes at their own pace yes yes thats true im just explaining to you why i didnt want to talk about them why i really still dont alex i understand i know you do deep kiss youre so right for me alex i thought of the constricted way wed just made love am i oh god yes paul she stopped paul what nothing paul approves of me its not like that alex but yes yes he does i always talk about how wonderful you are and he says hes glad ive found someone so good for me he likes you weve never met pause he likes what ive told him about you i see whats the matter alex sounds like you and paul have lots to talk about i felt her hand reach around and take hold of me she squeezed gently kneaded this time i didnt respond and she lowered her fingers let them rest upon my scrotum hes my faculty adviser alex he supervises my cases that means we have to talk gentle stroking lets not discuss him or anyone else anymore okay okay but im still curious about where the house came from the house she said surprised oh the house inheritance of course it belonged to them my parents they were both born in california lived here before moving back east before i was born i was their only little girl so its mine now it took time for the estate to clear there was so much paperwork thats the reason i couldnt go with you to san francisco i had to clear everything up anyway now i have a house and some money theres a trust fund administered back east thats how i got the alfa i know its a little showy but i thought it was cute what do you think its adorable she went on for a while talking about the car the places we could go in it but all i could think about was a house we could live here together i was earning good money now could pay the utilities pay all the expenses youve got a lot more room now i said nibbling her ear enough for two oh yes after the dorm room im looking forward to being able to stretch and you can visit me up here any time you want well have fun alex goodsized especially by todays standards mickey mehrabian was hitting her stride tremendous decorator potential fabulous flow and the price includes all the furnishings some of these pieces are really deco classics you could keep them or sell them everythings tiptop the place is really a gem doctor we toured the kitchen and walked through the short foyer that led to the bedrooms the first door was closed she passed it by i opened it and went in oh yes she said this was the master bedroom the shampoodisinfectant smell was stronger here mixed with other industrial scents the ammonia of glass cleaner the malathion bite of insecticide lye soap a toxic cocktail the drapes had been removed only a tangle of cords and pulleys remained all the furniture was gone the carpet had been pulled up revealing hardwood flooring marred by tacks the two high windows revealed a view of treetops and power lines but no breeze no dilution of the chemical bath no apple drawings i heard a buzz she heard it too both of us looked around for the source found it immediately a swarm of gnats circling the center of the room an animate cloud its borders shifting amoebically pinpointing the spot despite the attempts to wash away the aura of death the insects knew had sensed with their primitive little gnat brains exactly what had taken place in this room on that spot i remembered something milo had told me women kill in the kitchen and die in the bedroom mickey mehrabian saw the look on my face and mistook it for squeamishness the open windows this time of year she said no problem taking care of it theres a motivated seller extremely flexible im sure youll have no problem including any repairs or adjustments as contingencies during escrow doctor why is he or she selling the wide smile reappeared no he or she an it really a corporation they own lots of properties turn them over regularly speculators the smile froze thats a naughty word doctor investors who lives here now no one the tenant moved out recently and took the bed yes only the bedroom furniture belonged to her i believe it was a woman she lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper you know la people coming and going now lets take a look at the other bedrooms we left the death room she asked do you live alone dr delaware i had to think before answering yes then you can use one of the bedrooms for a study or even to see your patients patients according to the newspaper sharon had seen her patients here i wondered about the people she treated the impact her death could be having on them then i realized there was someone else in her life someone upon whom the impact would be tremendous my mind went into overdrive i wanted to be out of there but i let mickey show me around allowed her patter to pass through me for a while before consulting my watch and saying oops ive got to get going do you think youll be putting in an offer doctor i need time to think about it thanks for showing it to me if its a view site youre after ive got some other listings i could show you i tapped the watch love to but cant right now why dont we make an appointment for another day not even time for that i said ill call you when im free fine she said coolly we left the house and she locked up we walked silently to separate cadillacs before she could open the door of her fleetwood a hint of movement caught our attention the rustle of foliage burrowing animals a man shot out of the greenery and began running away excuse me mickey called out struggling to stay calm her weirdo fantasies come to life the runner looked back stared at us stumbled fell and picked himself up again young disheveled hair wildeyed mouth open as if in a silent scream terrified or mad or both patients that gate said mickey it needs to be fixed better security no problem i was looking at the runner called hold on what is it do you know him he picked up speed disappeared around the curve in the driveway i heard an engine start began running myself to the bottom of the drive got there just as an old green pickup pulled away from the curb gears grinding swerving erratically going too fast weaving some letters were painted in white on the door but i couldnt make them out i ran back to my car got in who is that said mickey do you know him not yet i managed to catch up to him flashed my brights and honked he ignored me was all over the road weaving speeding then more geargrinding as he tried to shift the truck got stuck in neutral slowed to a coast the engine racing as he fed gas without disengaging the clutch he hit the brakes suddenly came to a full stop i stayed back could see him through the trucks rear window struggling tugging the truck stalled started stalled again he began coasting picking up some speed on the downhill then braking sliding reducing it to a crawl at the fenced marshland he let go of the wheel and threw his hands up the truck skidded veered headed straight for the chainlink fence he hit it but not hard didnt even dent his fender i pulled over behind him the tires spun for a while then the engine went dead before i had a chance to get out of the car he was out of the truck lurching arms hanging gorillalike a bottle in one hand i locked the car he was right next to me kicking the sevilles tires pressing both hands on my door the bottle was empty gatorade he raised it as if to smash my window lost his grip and let it spin out of his hand he followed its descent gave up looked at me his eyes were watery swollen rimmed scarlet gonna kill your ass man slurred speech theatrical grimaces the fuck following me he closed his eyes staggered fell forward knocked his forehead on the roof of the car the braindamaged stance of a lifelong boozehound but his life hadnt been that long what was he twentytwo or three he kicked the car grabbed the door handle missed and stumbled little more than a kid baby bulldog face short five four or five but stronglooking with sloping shoulders and thick sunburned arms red hair shoulderlength coarse uncombed wispy mustache and beard the color of lint pimples on his brow and cheeks he wore a sweatstained tshirt cutoff shorts tennis shoes without socks fuck man he said and scratched an armpit his hands were bluntedged scarred and scabbed caked with grime he rocked on his heels finally lost balance completely and landed on his rear he stayed that way for a while i slid across the seat and exited the seville on the passenger side he watched me not moving let his eyes drop shut again as if lacking the strength to keep them open i walked to his truck thirtyyearold ford poorly maintained wobbly white letters spelled out dj rasmussen carpentry and framing on the door under that a post office box in newhall in the truck bed were two ladders a toolbox a couple of blankets weighed down by metal parts the interior was littered with empty bottles more gatorade southern comfort several brands of wine cooler i pocketed the key removed the distributor cap and returned to where he still sat you dj glazed look up close he smelled of ferment and vomit what were you doing up there no answer were you paying last respects to dr ransom the glaze melted fast right track me too i said fuuck you followed by a putrid belch that made me step back he mumbled tried to move an arm couldnt closed his eyes seemed in pain i said i was a friend of hers belch and a gurgle he looked ready to throw up i took another couple of steps back waited an unproductive dry retch his eyes opened stared at nothing i was her friend i repeated how about you he moaned dryretched dj oh man youre he trailed off what fucking with my head im not trying to i said just trying to understand why shes dead more moaning he ran his tongue over his lips tried to spit and ended up drooling if she was more than just a friend it could be harder on you i said losing a therapist can be like losing a parent fuck you was she your doctor dj fuck you after several efforts he managed to get to his feet came at me fell upon me limp as a bundle of rags his arms bulky but boozedead carrying no punch i stopped him easily with a hand to the chest took hold of his arm and sat him back down i showed him the cap and the keys hey man what the youre in no shape to drive im holding on to these until you show me youve got it together fuck you less conviction talk to me dj then ill be out of your hair what about about being dr ransoms patient exaggerated shake of head uhuh not crazy whats your connection to her bad back lot of pain hurt fucking job remembering he bit his lip dr ransom was helping you with the pain nod and after he made a feeble try for the keys gimme my shit after what gimme my shit man after she helped you with the pain then what fuck you he screamed the cords on his neck swelled he punched out wildly missed tried to get up couldnt lift his butt from the ground id pushed a button it set me thinking fuck nothing after fuck nothing he flapped his arms swore tried to get up and buckled who referred you to dr ransom dj silence i repeated the question fuuck youu there may be other patients who are feeling as bad as you do dj he gave a sick smile then a feeble head shake uhuh if we can find out who referred them we can track them down help them no fuck ingway someone should get in touch with them dj im youre some fucking robin hood a friend i said a psychologist like her he looked around seemed to be noticing his surroundings for the first time where am i side of the road just down from dr ransoms house whore you some fucking robin hood a friend who referred you to her dj doctor which doctor carmen dr carmen he giggled carmen doctor carmens doctor nod whos carmen fuck you whats the name of carmens doctor a few more gorounds before he said bev hills jew wein i wasnt sure if he was giving me a name or asking for a drink wine dr weinfuuck wein something weinstein weinberg garden grow grow grow weingarden dr weingarden big mouthed jew he slumped and fell over lay on his side i nudged him dead to the world after copying down the postoffice box number on the truck door i searched among the bottles in the cab found one that was half full and emptied it then i let the air out of two of the tires removed one of the blankets from the truck bed hid the keys under the remaining two stashed the distributor cap in the bottom compartment of his tool box figuring if he could work all that out hed be sober enough to drive then i spread the blanket over him and left him to sleep it off i drove away telling myself id use the post office box to reach him in a few days encourage him to get a new therapist god knew he needed the help through the booze haze thered been heavy potential for violence one of those tightly wound pressurecooked young bulls who let things build to an excruciating level then blow it off without warning with fists brass knuckles blades chains and guns not exactly your typical privatepractice patient where had sharon gotten him how many others like him had she treated and how many fragile personalities were on the verge of shattering because shed no longer be there to hold them together i recalled rasmussens sudden rage when i asked what had happened after the pain treatment was over an ugly hunch that i couldnt justify but one that refused to fade away was that his relationship with sharon had gone beyond treatment something strong enough to draw him back to her house searching for what following in trapps footsteps could she have been sleeping with both of them i realized id wondered the same thing about the old sheik at the party about kruse years ago maybe i was getting carried away projecting assuming sexual links that didnt exist because my own entanglement with her had been carnal as milo would say limited thinking pal but limited or not i couldnt shake it i got home at onethirty found messages from maura bannon the student reporter and detective delano hardy del was on another line when i called so i pulled out the phone book and looked for a dr weingarden in beverly hills there were two by that name an isaac on bedford drive and a leslie on roxbury isaac weingarden answered his own phone he sounded like an old man with a soft kindly voice and a viennese accent when i found out he was a psychiatrist i was certain he was my man but he denied knowing sharon or rasmsussen you sound upset young man is there anything i can do no thanks i phoned leslie weingardens office the receptionist said doctors with a patient now could you please tell him its about dr sharon ransom him is a her hold on i listened to mantovani for several minutes then doctor cant be disturbed she said to take your number and shell get back to you could you just tell me if dr weingarden refers to dr ransom hesitation i have no idea sir im only passing along what the doctor told me at twofifteen del hardy called hi del hows it going busy with this heat coming on its going to get busier what can i do for you i told him about sharon about seeing cyril trapp about the quick sale of the house trapp huh interesting but he didnt sound interested though he was one of the few detectives cordial with milo that friendliness didnt stretch into friendship trapp was a burden he wasnt willing to share nichols canyon is hollywood division he said so i wouldnt even know whos on it with the workload weve got all the divisions are trying to clear the routine ones quickly do lots of stuff over the phone this quickly not usually he said but you never can tell i didnt say anything he said you say she was a friend of yours yes i suppose i could ask a few questions id really appreciate that del the paper said no family members had been located but i know she has a sister a twin i met her six years ago i was their only little girl another surprise name shirlee with two es she was disabled lived in a boardandcare out in glendale south brand about a mile past the galleria name of the place i was only there once never noticed ill check it out he lowered his voice listen about the trapp thing captain wouldnt be working some noglory suicide so his being up there was probably something personal maybe a real estate thing some guys move in on properties try to get em cheap not in good taste but you know how it is donald trump of the crime scene i said he laughed you got it one other possibility was the victim rich she came from money then that could be it he said sounding relieved someone pushed a few buttons the word came down from on high to keep it quiet clear it quickly trapp used to be with hollywood division maybe someone remembered that called in a favor personalized service happens all the time main thing about being rich is having stuff no one else can have right nowadays anyone can buy a mercedes on payments dope clothes same thing but privacy thats the ultimate luxury in this town okay i said but i was wondering whod pushed the buttons thought immediately of the old sheik at the party there was no way to pursue that with del so i thanked him again dont mention it he said hear from milo recently no have you i think hes due back monday not a word the duty roster says hes supposed to be back in the office monday knowing milo that means hell be in town saturday or sunday pacing around cussing and none too soon far as im concerned the vermin are out in force after he hung up i looked in the yellow pages for a rest home on south brand found nothing a few minutes later mal worthy called to remind me of tomorrows deposition he seemed worried about my state of mind kept asking me if i was okay im fine i told him perry mason couldnt get the better of me mason was a wimp watch out for these insurance guys by the way denise says definitely no more sessions for darren she wants to handle things by herself but thats off the record as far as the other sides concerned the kid will be in treatment for the rest of his life and beyond hows darren doing about the same persuade her to continue treatment mal if she wants someone else ill get her a referral shes pretty resolute alex but ill keep trying meanwhile im more concerned with helping her put food on the table ciao i spent the next couple of hours preparing for the deposition was interrupted by the phone dr delaware maura bannon la times she sounded around thirteen had a high voice with a slight lisp and a new england accent and turned her statements into questions hello ms bannon ned biondi gave me your number im so glad i caught you i wonder if we could meet for what purpose you knew dr ransom right i thought maybe you could give me some background on her i dont think i can help you oh she sounded crestfallen i havent seen dr ransom in years oh i just thought well you know im trying to give a wellrounded picture establish some context for the profile its such a strange thing a psychologist killing herself like that man bites dog you know people would be interested in finding out why have you learned anything more than what you put in your first article no i havent dr delaware is there anything more to find out because if there is id surely appreciate knowing about it i think the police have been holding back on me ive put several calls in to them but no ones returned them pause i dont think theyre taking me seriously privacy the ultimate luxury id like to help you i said but i really have nothing to add mr biondi said if i led mr biondi to believe any different im sorry ms bannon okay she said but if you find out anything please let me know ill do my best thanks dr delaware i sat back stared out the window and felt the loneliness coming on misery loves company the bigger the other guys misery the better the company i called newhall information and asked for a number on dj rasmussen no listing thinking of my only other connection to the young drunk i phoned dr leslie weingardens office i was just about to call you said the receptionist doctor can see you after her last patient around six i really dont need an appointment just wanted to talk to her over the phone im telling you what she told me mr delaware six will be fine leslie weingardens building was a threestory red brick federal structure with limestone cornice and forestgreen awnings situated in the heart of beverly hills medical district the interior was goldenoak raised paneling greenandrose carpeting the directory listed several dozen tenants mds dentists a handful of phds one of the phds caught my eye kruse pp suite made sense this was couch row but years before hed had another address leslie weingardens office was on the ground floor toward the rear of the building her nameplate listed her specialties as internal medicine and womens health issues her waiting room was small and decorated in budget goodcheer whiteandgray miniprint paper overstuffed white cotton chairs and danishmodern tables a scattering of art prints a potted schefflera in a straw basket no patients but the remnants of the days traffic were apparent gum wrappers an empty aspirin bottle and a used emery board on the coffee table magazines splayed open on the chairs i knocked on the glass partition waited several seconds before it slid open a hispanic woman in her fifties looked out can i help you dr delaware i have an appointment with dr weingarden ill let her know youre here i waited for half an hour leafing through magazines wondering if any of them had carried paul kruses column at sixthirty the door to the inner office opened and a goodlooking woman around thirty came out she was petite very slender with frosted short hair and a lean alert face she wore dangling silver earrings a white silk blouse pleated dovegray gabardine slacks and gray suede pumps a stethoscope hung from around her neck under it was a heavy gold chain her features were delicate and regular her eyes almondshaped and dark brown like robins she wore little makeup didnt have to i stood up mr delaware im dr weingarden she held out her hand and i shook it her bones were tiny her grip firm and dry she placed both hands on her hips what can i do for you you referred patients to a psychologist named sharon ransom i dont know if youve heard but shes dead committed suicide on sunday i wanted to talk to you about her about getting in touch with those patients no trace of shock yes i read the paper whats your involvement with her and her patients mostly personal somewhat professional i handed her my card she examined it youre a psychologist too then its dr delaware bea told me mr she put the card in her pocket were you her therapist the question surprised me no because she sure needed one frown why all the concern about her patients i ran into one of them today dj rasmussen he gave me your name that made her flinch but she said nothing he was drunk i said stoned drunk really out of it my hunch is that he was unbalanced to begin with and is now at risk for some kind of breakdown maybe violence losing a therapist can be like losing a parent ive been wondering how many of her other yes yes of course i understand all of that but what i still dont get is your concern whats your involvement in all of this i thought about the best way to answer some of its probably guilt sharon and i knew each other well back in graduate school i hadnt seen her for years ran into her by chance at a party last saturday she seemed upset about something asked if she could talk to me we made a date i had second thoughts and canceled the next day that night she killed herself i guess im still wondering if i could have stopped it id like to prevent any more grief if i can she fingered her stethoscope and stared at me this is for real isnt it you dont work for some shyster lawyer do you why would i she smiled so you want me to contact any patients i might have referred to her and tell me about any other referral sources youre familiar with the smile got cold that would be difficult dr delaware not a good idea at all not that there were that many referrals anyway and i have no idea who else referred to her though i sure feel sorry for them she stopped seemed to be searching for words sharon ransom was a she and i well you tell me first whyd you break your date with her i didnt want to get involved with her shes she was a complicated woman she sure was she looked at her watch removed the stethoscope all right im going to make a call and check on you if youre who you say you are well talk but ive got to eat first she left me in the waiting room came back several moments later and said okay without looking at me we walked a block to a coffee shop on brighton she ordered a tuna sandwich on rye and herb tea i pushed rubbery scrambled eggs around on my plate she ate quickly unceremoniously ordered a hot fudge sundae for dessert and finished half of it before pushing the dish away after wiping her mouth she said when they told me someone was calling about sharon frankly i was uptight she caused problems for me we havent worked together for a long time what kinds of problems one second she called the waitress over and asked for a refill of tea i ordered coffee the check came with the drinks i took it on me buying information i smiled you were talking about the problems she caused she shook her head boy i dont know if i really want to get into this confidential i promised legally as in youre my therapist if that makes you comfortable spoken like a true shrink yes it makes me comfortable were talking hot potato hereethical problems her eyes hardened there was no way for me to prevent it but try telling that to a malpractice jury when a shyster gets hold of something like that he goes back in the chart hits on every doc whos ever passed the patient in the hall the last thing on my mind is fomenting a lawsuit i said last thing on my mind too she slapped her hand on the table hard enough to make the salt shaker jump darn it she shafted me just thinking about her makes me mad im sorry shes dead but i just cant feel any grief she used me she sipped her tea i only met her last year she walked in introduced herself and invited me out to lunch i knew what she was doing hustling referrals nothing wrong with that ive only been in practice a little over a year have done my share of brownnosing and my first impression of her was very positive she was bright articulate seemed to have it all together her résumé looked terrific lots of varied clinical experience plus she was right here in the building its always good business to crossrefer almost all my patients are women most of them would be more comfortable with a female therapist so i figured why not give it a try the only reservation i had was that she was so goodlooking i wondered if it mightnt threaten some women but i told myself that was sexist thinking began sending her referrals not that many thank god its a small practice was her office on the third floor with dr kruse thats the one only he was never there just her by herself she took me up there once tiny place just a postagestamp waiting room and one consulting office she was kruses psychological assistant or something like that had a license number an assistants certificate whatever everything was kosher psychological assistant a temporary position aimed at providing experience for new phds under supervision of a licensed psychologist sharon had earned her doctorate six years ago had been long eligible for full licensure i wondered why she hadnt gotten it what shed done for six years kruse wrote her this terrific letter of recommendation she said he was a faculty member at the university so i figured that counted for something i really expected it to work out i was blown away when it didnt do you still have that résumé no remember anything else from it just what i told you why trying to backtrack how did she shaft you she gave me a sharp look you mean you havent figured it out my guess would be sexual misconduct sleeping with her patients but most of your patients are women was she gay she laughed gay yeah i could see how you might think that frankly i dont know what she was i was raised in chicago nothing about this city surprises me anymore but no she didnt sleep with women as far as i know were talking men husbands of patients boyfriends men wont go into therapy without prodding the women have to do everything getting the referral making the appointment my patients asked me for referrals and i sent half a dozen to sharon she thanked me by sleeping with them howd you find out she looked disgusted i was doing my books checking out bad debts and failuretoshows and i noticed that most of the women whose husbands id sent her hadnt paid or kept their followups it stood out like a sore thumb because other than those my collections were excellent my return rate close to perfect i started calling around to find out what had happened most of the women wouldnt speak to me some even hung up on me but two of them did talk the first let me have it with both barrels seems her husband had seen sharon for a few sessions something to do with job stress she taught him to relax that was it a few weeks later she called him and offered a followup session free of charge when he showed up she tried to seduce him really came on strong she took her clothes off for gods sake right there in the office he walked out on her went home and told his wife she was livid screaming that i should be ashamed of myself for associating with a conniving amoral bitch like that the second one was worse she just cried and cried she rubbed her temples took an aspirin out of her purse and swallowed it with tea unbelievable isnt it free followup visits im still waiting for the other shoe to drop as in seeyouincourt ive lost plenty of sleep over it im sorry i said not as sorry as i am now you tell me rasmussens all freaked out great he was one of them oh yeah a real prince his girlfriend is the one who just cried one of my walkin patients not too sophisticated vague psychosomatic complaints she needed attention i got to know her a little and she started opening up about him how he drank too much took dope pushed her around i spent lots of time counseling her trying to show her what a loser he was get her to leave him of course she didnt one of those passive types with an abusive father who keeps hooking up with papa surrogates then she told me the bum had injured himself on the job was having back pain and was thinking of suing it was his lawyer who suggested he see a shrink did i know one i figured here was a chance to get him some help for his head and sent him to sharon told her all about his other problems boy did she help him howd you meet him he was up at her house this morning up at her house she gave a jerk like that her home address what an idiot she had an office there oh yeah the paper mentioned that makes sense actually because she moved out of this building right after i confronted her about the hankypanky got a diagnosis on rasmussen some kind of personality disorder possible violent tendencies in other words a troublemaker terrific hes the weakest link a womanhater with low impulse control and hes already got a shyster wonderful he wont sue for sexual harassment i said few men would too embarrassing frontal assault upon the old machismo i sure hope youre right so far no ones made any moves but that doesnt mean theyre not going to and even if im spared legal grief shes already cost me plenty in terms of my reputation one patient badmouthing to ten others and none of the dropouts paid me for work id already done were talking solid four figures in lab fees alone im not established enough to kiss off that kind of loss without pain theres a doctor glut here on the west side where do you practice here on the west side but i work with kids oh she drummed her nails along the rim of the teacup i probably sound pretty mercenary to you huh here you are talking altruism debriefing patients all that good hippocratic stuff and all im worried about is covering my butt but i make no excuses for it cause if i dont cover my butt no one else will do it for me when i came out from northwestern to do my internship at harbor general i met the greatest guy in the world married him three weeks later a screenwriter doing research at the hospital for a miniseries pow love at first sight all of a sudden i had a house in playa del rey till death do us part he said he was turned on by my being a doctor pledged hed never leave me two years later he left me cleaned out our bank account and went to santa fe with some bimbo its taken me two years to climb out of it she looked inside the cup as if searching for gypsy leaves ive worked too darned hard to get this far and see some nymphomaniac ruin it all so no i wont be calling to debrief any of the men she screwed theyre big boys they can handle it probably turned it into a conquest by now convinced themselves theyre hot studs you let it rest too dr delaware keep her buried shed let her voice rise people were staring she noticed and lowered it how does someone like that become a therapist anyway dont you people do any screening not enough i said how did she react when you confronted her weirdly just looked at me with those big blues all innocent as if she didnt know what i was talking about then started in with the uhhuhs as if she were trying to play therapist with me when i was through she said sorry and just walked away no explanation no nothing the next day i saw her carrying boxes out of the office as her supervisor kruse was legally responsible for her did you talk to him i tried to must have called him twenty times i even slipped messages under the door he never responded i got pretty steamed thought of filing a complaint in the end i figured good riddance just dropped it his names still on the office directory does he practice here like i said ive never seen him and when i was looking for him i spoke to the janitor and he said hed never seen him ten to one kruse set it up for her she was probably screwing him too why do you say that because screwing men was her thing right it was what she did probably screwed her way to that phd i thought about that got lost in thoughts she said youre not going to pursue this debriefing stuff any further are you no i said making the decision at that moment what youve told me puts things in a different light but we should do something about rasmussen hes a time bomb let him blow himself up more good riddance what if he hurts someone else what could you do to prevent that anyway i had no answer listen she said i want to make myself very clear i want out free of all the garbage the worrying got that got it i sure hope you mean that if you use anything ive said to connect me with her ill deny saying it the files of all the patients she saw have been destroyed if you mention my name ill sue you for breach of confidentiality take it easy i said youve made your point i certainly hope so she snatched the check out of my hands and stood ill pay my own way thank you free followup visits that brought back something id worked hard at forgetting driving home i wondered how many men sharon had victimized how long it had been going on it was impossible now for me to imagine a man in her life without assuming a carnal link trapp the sheik dj rasmussen victims all i wondered especially about rasmussen had he still been involved with her at the time of her death it could explain why the loss had hit him so hard why hed drunk himself stuporous made a pilgrimage to her house meeting another pilgrim me how does someone like that become a therapist anyway dont you people do any screening i hadnt screened her out of my life had long rationalized it by telling myself id been young and naïve too green to know any better yet three days ago id been jacked up and ready to see her again ready to start what the fact that id broken the date was small comfort what would have happened had she phoned put a catch in her voice told me what a wonderful guy i was would i have been able to resist being needed spurned the opportunity to hear about her problem maybe even solve it i didnt have an honest answer which said plenty about my judgment and my mental health i lapsed into the esteemsapping selfdoubts id thought resolved during my training therapy what gave me the right to mold other peoples lives when i couldnt get my own life straight what made me an authority on other peoples kids when id never raised a child of my own dr expert who the hell was i kidding i remembered the goodmother smile of my training therapist ada small soft voice brooklyn accent soft eyes unconditional acceptance even the tough messages sweetened by kindness your strong need to always be in control alex its not a totally bad thing but at some point we will need to examine it ada had taken me a long way id been lucky to be assigned to her now we were colleagues crossreferring discussing patients it had been a long time since id related to her as a patient could i ever go back to showing her my scars sharon hadnt been so lucky with her assignment paul peter kruse power junkie pornographer equal opportunity flogger i could only imagine what training therapy with him had been like yet shed stayed with him long after graduating remained his assistant instead of getting her license doing her dirty work in space he leased it said as much about her as about him and i had to wonder whod called the shots in their relationship exploiters victims but her last victim had been herself why i forced myself to stop thinking about it pushed robins face into my mind no matter how things turned out what wed had once had been real the moment i got home i called san luis obispo hello hi robin alex mom said you called i tried to reach you several times just got in mom and i had a charming conversation oh did she give you a hard time nothing out of the ordinary main thing is hows she treating you she laughed i can handle her you sure you sound wiped out i am wiped out but that has nothing to do with her aarons turned out to be a screamer terrys up all night ive been relieving her never been so exhausted in my life good maybe youll yearn for the good old days and come back silence anyway i said i just thought id call and see how youre doing im hanging in how are you doing alex just dandy really would you believe semidandy whats the matter alex nothing you sound as if somethings weighing on you its nothing i said it just hasnt been a great week so far im sorry alex i know youve been patient no i said it has nothing to do with you oh she said sounding more hurt than relieved someone i knew back in school committed suicide how awful yes it is did you know this person well that gave me pause no i said not really still she said that kind of things so upsetting to hear how about we change the subject sure did i say something wrong no nothing i just dont feel like getting into it all right she said anyway ill let you go now im not rushing anywhere okay but we found little more to talk about and when i hung up i felt empty i filled the void with memories of sharon that second autumn we remained lovers of sorts when i managed to reach her she always said yes always had sweet things to say stimulating bits of academic knowledge to share she whispered in my ear rubbed my back spread her legs for me with the ease of applying her lipstick insisting i was her guy the only man in her life but reaching her was the challenge she was seldom home never left a clue to her whereabouts not that i was knocking myself out trying to find her the hospital owned me fifty hours a week and id taken on private patients at night in order to save up the down payment on a house of my own i kept busy solving the problems of others and ignoring my own a couple of times i dropped in on her unannounced making the drive up jalmia only to find the gray house locked the carport empty i gave up trying went without seeing her for a couple of weeks but late one saturday night stuck in the stopandgo on sunset after a wrenching evening with the parents of a mercilessly deformed newborn baby i found myself wanting a shoulder to cry on like a homing pigeon i veered north to hollywood boulevard turned off at nichols canyon when i pulled up the driveway the alfa romeo was sitting there the front door was unlocked i walked in the living room was brightly lit but empty i called her name no answer repeated it nothing i checked her bedroom half expecting to find her with another man half wanting to but she was in there alone sitting crosslegged on the bed stark naked eyes closed as if meditating id entered her body so many times but this was the first time id seen it unclothed she was flawless unbelievably rich i restrained myself from touching her whispered sharon she didnt budge i wondered if she was engaging in some kind of selfhypnosis id heard kruse was a master hypnotist had he been giving her private lessons but she looked stricken rather than entranced frowning breathing rapidly and shallowly her hands began to tremble i noticed something in the right one a small blackandwhite snapshot the oldfashioned type with sawtooth edges i came closer and looked at it two little beautiful blackhaired girls about two or three years old identical twins with shirley temple curls sitting side by side on a wooden garden bench clear skies and dark brooding granite mountains in the background picturepostcard mountains perfect enough to be a photographers backdrop the twins looked solemn and posed too solemn for their age theyd been dressed in identical cowgirl suits chaps fringes rhinestones and held identical ice cream cones carbon copies of each other except for one small detail one girl clutched her cone in her right hand the other in her left mirrorimage twins their features were set hypermature sharons features times two i was their only little girl surprise surprise i looked up at her touched her bare shoulder expecting the usual heat but she felt cold and dry strangely inorganic i leaned down and kissed the back of her neck she jumped cried out as if bitten striking out with her fists she fell back on the bed legs wideflung in a helpless caricature of sexual welcome panting staring up at me sharon she was looking at me as if i were a monster her mouth opened in a silent scream the snapshot fell to the floor picking it up i saw something written on the back a single sentence in a strong hand s and s silent partners i turned the photo over looked at the twins again no she screamed as she sprang up and charged me no no no gimme gimme mine mine gimme she clawed for the picture her fury was absolute a hellish transformation stunned i tossed it onto the bed she snatched it clutched it to her chest got up on all fours and crawled backward until she was up against the headboard her free hand struck out at the air between us defining a no mans land her hair was tangled medusawild she got to her knees swayed and shook big breasts bobbling sharon whats the matter go go honey go get out go go get out go sweat poured out of her flowed down her body hot pink patches rose on the snow of her skin as if she were burning from within sharon she hissed at me then whimpered and curled fetally holding the snapshot to her heart i watched it rise and fall with each labored breath took a step forward no get out get out the look in her eyes was murderous i backed out of the room ran from the house feeling dizzy sick suckerpunched certain that whatever we had was over not knowing if that was good or bad wednesday morning i was back in beverly hills in the penthouse offices of trenton worthy and la rosa waiting to give my deposition in a rosewoodpaneled conference room slathered with abstract art and furnished with buttercolored leather chairs and a footballshaped smokedglass table mal sat next to me grubbily trendy in an unstructured silver silk suit fiveday beard and shoulderlength hair behind us was a blackboard on a rosewood easel and a luggage rack holding a calfskin suitcase mals oneup on briefcase toters across the table sat a legal reporter with a steno machine surrounding her were eight not seven attorneys insurance company sent three mal whispered to me those first three i looked at the trio young pinstriped funereal their spokesman was a big prematurely bald fellow in his early thirties named moretti he had a meaty cleft chin wide shoulders and the charm of a drill instructor one of mals secretaries served coffee and sweet rolls and as we ate moretti made a point of letting me know hed been a psych major at stanford he dropped the names of prominent professors tried unsuccessfully to engage me in shoptalk and watched me over the rim of his coffee cup with sharp brown eyes when i presented my report he moved to the edge of his chair when i finished he was the first to speak the other lawyers deferred to him like any wolf pack theyd chosen their lead killer and were content to sit back and let him open the first wounds he reminded me that i was legally bound to tell the truth just as if i were in court that i was testifying under penalty of perjury then he removed a phonebookthick pile of photocopied articles from his briefcase and made a show of stacking the papers on the table shuffling and sorting and squaring off the corners lifting the top article he said id like to read you something doctor sure he smiled i really wasnt asking permission doctor i really wasnt granting it the smile disappeared mal nudged me under the table someone coughed moretti tried staring me down then put on a pair of rimless octagonal glasses cleared his throat and began to read he finished a paragraph before turning to me familiar doctor yes do you remember the source its the introduction to an article i published in the journal of pediatrics in summer of i believe august he examined the date but didnt comment on it do you remember the gist of that article doctor yes could you summarize it for us the article describes a study i did from through when i was at western pediatric hospital the research was funded by the national institute of mental health and was designed to learn the effects of chronic disease upon the psychological adjustment of children was it a welldesigned study doctor i believe so you believe so tell us what you did in this welldesigned study be specific about your methodology i administered several tests of psychological adjustment to a sample of sick children and a control group of healthy children the groups were matched in terms of social class parental marital status and family size there was no significant difference between the groups no significant difference on any measure of psychological adjustment thats correct moretti looked over at the legal reporter he talks fast do you have that down she nodded back to me for the sake of those of us who arent familiar with psychological jargon specify what no significant difference means the groups were statistically indistinguishable the average scores on these measures were similar average median the fifty percent mark mathematically its the best measure of typicality yes of course but what does all of that mean chronically ill children may develop some problems but being sick doesnt inevitably make them neurotic or psychotic hold on for a moment said moretti patting the stack of papers i dont see mention of any problems here doctor your basic finding was that the sick children were normal thats true however you spell it out right here doctor he held up the article flipped a page and jabbed his finger at it right here in table three spielberger state anxiety scores rosenberg selfesteem scores achenbach adjustment scores were all and im quoting verbatimwithin normal limits put in simple english these kids were no more nervous or insecure or maladjusted or neurotic than their healthy peers were they doctor this is starting to sound argumentative said mal were here to find facts quasifacts at best said moretti this is psychology not science you quoted the article counselor said mal your witnesss report seems to be contradicting his own published work counselor would you like me to answer your question i asked moretti he removed his glasses sat back and gave a quartersmile if you can read the discussion section i said the last three paragraphs specifically i list several problem areas chronically ill children have to deal with throughout their lives pain and discomfort disruption of school due to treatment and hospitalization body changes brought about by both disease and treatment social rejection overprotectiveness by parents in general children cope well with these problems but problems still exist the discussion section said moretti aha the place researchers dump their conjectures but your own data your statistics say otherwise really doctor in other words mal broke in turning to me what youre saying dr delaware is that sick children and traumatized children face a constant flood of challenges life is agonizing for them but some are able to handle it yes mal swept his eyes up and down the table avoiding moretti establishing momentary eye contact with each of the other lawyers no reason to penalize a child for coping well is there gentlemen whos the witness here snapped moretti waving the reprint no reason to penalize a child for dealing with his trauma said mal trauma said moretti theres nothing in this article about traumatized children said moretti these are chronically ill kidschronic as in longterm darren burkhalter is a oneshot deal he has no ongoing pain or physical change to deal with hed be even less vulnerable to problems than someone chronically disabled he allowed himself a full smile to him it was all a game i thought of little boys engaging in backalley pissing contests and said good point mr moretti chronically ill and traumatized children are very different thats why i was wondering why you quoted from the article in the first place a couple of the other lawyers smiled touché mal whispered in my ear one of the other insurance lawyers was whispering in morettis ear the lead man wasnt pleased with what he was hearing but he listened impassively then put the reprint aside all right doctor lets talk about the whole notion of early childhood trauma your conclusion as i understand it is that darren burkhalter will be scarred emotionally for life because of his presence during an automobile accident you understand wrong i said moretti reddened mal raised his eyebrows and gave a soft whistle now doctor what i did say mr moretti was that during my examination of him darren burkhalter exhibited classic symptoms of trauma for a child his age sleep problems nightmares phobias aggressiveness hyperactivity tantrums periods of increased clinginess according to both his mother and his daycare teacher he showed none of these behaviors prior to the accident its reasonable to assume they were related to the accident though i cant prove that with hard data whether or not these problems will develop into chronic disabilities isnt clear although the risk is high if psychotherapy doesnt continue in addition darren is lagging in his speech and language development his milestones are several months behind average how much of that is due to the trauma is impossible to judge but its well worth thinking about when considering this childs future it certainly is impossible to judge said moretti my reading of the literature in your field is that intelligence is primarily genetically determined the best predictor of a childs iq is his fathers iq katz dash and ellenberg this fathers iq will never be tested again said mal in lieu of that i requested that mrs burkhalter take an iq test but you refused that request mr worthy shes had enough stress counselor no matter said moretti inferences may still be drawn from what we know of these people neither mr nor mrs burkhalter finished high school both were dropouts worked at menial jobs that indicates a less than average genetic endowment for this family i wouldnt expect darren to be average would you dr delaware its hardly that simple i said parental iq predicts childrens iq better than most other factors but its still not a very good predictor accounting for less than twenty percent of the variance katz dash and ellenberg emphasize that in their followup study one out of five mr moretti not great odds for a bet are you a gambler doctor no thats why i took this case the reporter smiled moretti turned to mal counselor id advise that you counsel this witness on appropriate demeanor consider yourself advised dr delaware said mal fighting a grin he flashed his cuffs and studied his rolex may we proceed moretti put his glasses back on and scanned some papers dr delaware he said then paused as if anticipating a punch line come now dr delaware youre not saying that except for the accident darren burkhalter would have been expected to become a nuclear physicist are you no one knows what darren would have become or what he will become i said right now the facts are that following an unusually severe psychological trauma his language is below average and hes experiencing severe stress what was his language like before the accident his mother reports he was starting to talk however after the traum his mother said moretti and you base your conclusions on what she tells you along with other input such as your interview with his daycare teacher such as his teachers your expert witness she seemed very credible and had a good understanding of darren she reported that the parents were very involved very loving his father in particular had taken an interest in his yes lets talk about his father gregory joe burkhalter had a criminal record are you aware of that doctor yes i am a conviction for petty theft several years ago petty theft and larceny doctor he did jail time whats the point asked mal the point mr worthy is that your expert basing his opinion on an individual who would not qualify as an expert in court wants to make a case for this father being a major source of intellectual stimulation for this child hence major material and emotional loss due to paternal death this father was a criminal minimally educated mr moretti i said is it your position that only educated parents are worth grieving for he ignored me while in point of fact the data pertaining to the case in point indicate a socially and emotionally impoverished he went on for a while picking up volume and speed fairly glowing with combat lust mal too was caught up in the joust poised for the riposte more pissing and the truth be damned it started to really get to me and i broke in raising my voice to be heard over the tide of legalese mr moretti youre a classic case of a little knowledge being dangerous moretti rose half out of his seat caught himself then settled back down and bared his teeth getting defensive doctor this was supposed to be a factfinding meeting if you want to hear what i have to say fine if you want to play ego games i wont waste my time moretti clucked his tongue mr worthy if this is a portent of his courtroom behavior youre in a heap of trouble counselor mal said nothing but he scrawled on his note pad have i created a monster then covered it with his hand moretti didnt miss it anything we should have on the record counselor just doodling said mal and he began to sketch a naked woman we were talking about childhood trauma i said to moretti would you like me to address that issue or am i through moretti tried to look amused you may address it if you have something to add to your report since you drew faulty conclusions from my report i have plenty to add darren burkhalter is suffering a posttraumatic stress reaction that may convert to longterm psychological problems brief play therapy and counseling for the mother have brought about some symptom reduction but much more treatment is indicated to the other lawyers im not saying longterm psychological problems are inevitable but neither will i rule problems out no reasonable expert would oh for gods sake said moretti this child is two years old twentysix months same difference he was eighteen months at the time of the accident youre telling me that youll be willing to go into court and testify under oath that when hes twentysix years old he could be psychologically affected by an accident that took place when he was a baby thats exactly what im telling you a traumatic scene that vivid and bloody buried in his subconscious moretti snorted what does a subconscious look like doctor ive never seen one nevertheless you have one mr moretti as do i and everyone else in this room in simple terms the subconscious is a psychic storage bin the part of our mind where we put experiences and feelings we dont want to deal with when our defenses are down the bin tips over and some of the stored material spills out dreams fantasies seemingly irrational or even selfdestructive behaviors that we call symptoms the subconscious is real mr moretti its what makes you dream of winning a big part of what motivated you to become a lawyer that got to him he took pains to be cool but his eyes twitched his nostrils opened and his mouth drew so tight it puckered thank you for that insight doctor send me a bill though judging from what youre charging mr worthy i dont know if i can afford you in the meantime lets stick to the accident accident doesnt begin to describe what darren burkhalter experienced disaster would be more accurate the boy was napping in his car up until the moment of impact the first thing he saw when he woke up was his fathers decapitated head flying over the front seat and landing next to him the features still twitching several of the lawyers winced it missed falling right in his lap by inches i said darren must have thought it was some kind of doll because he tried to pick it up when he pulled away his hand and saw it covered with blood saw what it really was he went hysterical and stayed hysterical for five full days mr moretti screaming dada totally out of control i paused to let the image sink in he knew what was happening mr moretti hes played it out in my office every time hes been there hes clearly old enough to form a durable memory ill quote you statistics on that if youd like and that memory wont disappear simply because you want it to a memory that youre keeping alive by making him go through it over and over again said moretti so what youre asserting i said is that psychotherapy is making him worse that we should simply forget about it or pretend it didnt happen double touché whispered mal moretti was bugeyed its your position thats under scrutiny doctor i want to see you back up all this early trauma talk with data id be happy to i had my own stack of articles pulled them out cited references tossed out numbers and gave a somewhat manic lecture on the development of memory in children and their reactions to disaster and trauma i used the blackboard to summarize my findings generalizations said moretti clinical impressions youd prefer something more objective he smiled it would be nice terrific a secretary rolled in the video monitor slipped the tape into the vcr dimmed the lights and pushed the play button when it was over dead silence finally moretti smirked and said planning a second career in the film business doctor ive seen and heard enough said one of the other attorneys he closed his briefcase and pushed his chair from the table several others did the same any more questions asked mal nope said moretti but he looked buoyant and i experienced a pang of selfdoubt he winked and saluted me see you in court doctor when they were all gone mal slapped his knee and did a little dance right in the cojones absolutely beautiful i should be getting their offers this afternoon i made a stronger case than id intended i said bastard got to me i know you were beautiful he began collecting his papers what about morettis parting shot i asked he looked happy about going to court pure crapola saving face in front of his partners he may be the last to settle but believe me hell settle some asshole eh has a rep as a real blackhearted litigator but you slammed him good your little jibe about the subconscious was right on the mark alex he shook his head with glee god knows how tight he had to hold his sphincter not to shit right then and there and a big part of what motivated you to become a lawyer i didnt tell you this but morettis dad was a bigshot psychiatrist in milwaukee did a lot of forensics work moretti must have hated him because he really has a thing for shrinks thats why they assigned him this one stanford psych major i said blah blah blah blah blah mal raised his arm in mock terror boy youve really become a nasty bastard havent you just tired of the bullshit i walked to the door dont call me for a while okay hey dont get me wrong alex im not putting you down i like it i mean i really like it flattered i said and i left him to his triumphs and his calculations when i got back home the phone was ringing i picked it up at the same time the service operator did heard del hardys voice asking for dr delaware i broke in and told the operator id take it i found out a little he said couldnt get much help at hollywood but spoke to one of the coroners you in any mood to hear that kind of thing go ahead okay first off is time of death between eight pm and three am sunday second is cause of death twentytwo caliber bullet to the brain it passed right into the cerebral cortex and bounced around in there the way a smallcaliber bullet will doing lots of damage third there were heavy amounts of alcohol and barbiturates in her system borderline lethal dosage coroner also found some old scars between her toes that looked like tracks you ever know this lady to be into heavy drugs no i said but it was a long time ago yeah people change its what keeps us busy od and a bullet i said seriousness of intent said del especially for a female though if she really wanted to be sure eating the gun would have been the thing to do straight into the medulla wipes out the autonomic system and cuts off respiration but most folks dont know that they watch tv think the temple shot he stopped sorry its okay i said with that much downer in her system wouldnt she be too drowsy to shoot not right away said del now heres the interesting part coroner told me their office processed the case quickly orders of the boss their usual average is six to eight weeks this time of year they got orders also not to discuss it with anyone why all the secrecy pathologist got the clear impression it was a richfolks case grease the skids to the max keep it hushed the department released information to the press controlled info said del strategic thinking if you say nothing about something and someone finds out you were holding back they immediately start thinking conspiracy telling them what you want is safer makes you look open and sincere not that theres much to tell on this one straight suicide no evidence of foul play as far as the druggun combo the pathologist had two scenarios a she cocktailed booze and dope to do herself in then changed her mind and wanted to get it over faster or maybe more dramatically and went for the gun makes sense to me suicides a message right you guys taught us that final statement to the world people can get really choosy about how they phrase it right right whats b she used the dope and the booze to lower her inhibitions build up enough courage to shoot herself when she was feeling sufficiently mellow she pulled the trigger either way you look at it the end results the same did she leave a note no lots of people dont right right like that canadian guy mcwhatsisname said the medium can be the message all by itself whos the detective in charge of the case i asked guy named pinckley just left yesterday for vacation in hawaii convenient i wouldnt get in an uproar over that said del vacations are scheduled way in advance pinckleys a serious surfer he used to compete nationally he goes every year around this time in order to catch the big ones at wiamea i called hollywood and confirmed it the duty rosterd been set months ago who took over from pinckley nothing to take over doc the case is closed what about trapp being up at her house he lowered his voice i said i found out a little remember that didnt include walking into my captains office and giving him the third degree okay sorry no apology necessary just gotta be careful anything else del pause how well did you say you knew her it had been six years since id seen her well enough to know that she wasnt any nun well enough okay if you were next of kin or a husband i wouldnt be telling you this its strictly off the record my source at hollywood says theres a rumor drifting around the station that when they went up to her place one of the techs found a porn flick hidden under the mattress nothing sophisticated just a loop but a loop with her in it she might have been a doctor but she had other talents i sucked in my breath doc is the loop still in the evidence room del not everything makes it to the evidence room i see case like this it works out better for the lady whats better having the damned thing stored in some cops underwear drawer pulled out once in a blue moon for private screenings or letting the papers get hold of itdoctor had secret life you know what theyd do with that i mean this loop wasnt disney stuff what was on it what youd imagine could you be more specific del you really want to hear this go ahead he sighed okay what i was told was that it was one of those doctorpatient things you know checkup turns to sex she was the patient some guy was the doc pause thats all i know i did not see it did she leave anything else behind like patient files i didnt ask what about the quick sale on her house with the case closed thered be no reason not to sell did she own the house i didnt check that what about the twin sister has anyone located her no shirlee ransom on any of our files which means nothing she wasnt a criminal but dmv didnt have her either they wouldnt she couldnt have driven a car whatever searching for heirs isnt our business doc whichever lawyers probating the will would have to hire someone private and to answer your next question no i dont know who that is okay i said thanks for your time no problem glad to give it when i have it which was a polite way of saying dont bother me anymore a porn loop kruses research exploring the boundaries of human sexuality larry had laughed about it but selfconsciously working for kruse was a phase of his career he clearly wanted to forget now he was going to be reminded again i called his office in brentwood using the private line that bypassed his answering service im with a patient he said sotto voce call you back at a quarter to the hour he did at precisely munching on something and talking between bites missed me already d whats on your mind sharon ransom yeah i read about it oh god i forgot the two of you were an item way back when werent you she was at the party larry i ran into her when you went to make your call i talked to her the day before she died jesus did she look depressed a little down she said things werent going well but nothing profound nothing to set off any alarms you and i both know how much thats worth though yeah ye olde professional intuition might as well use a ouija board silence sharon ransom he said unreal she used to be gorgeous still was unreal he repeated i havent seen her since school never ran into her at any meetings or conventions she was living in la mystery lady she always projected a bit of that did she work on the porn project larry not when i was there why i told him about her being kruses assistant about the loop welcome to hollyweird he said but he didnt sound surprised and i commented on it thats cause im not surprised d someone else maybe but not her whys that truth be told i always thought she was strange in what way nothing blatant but something about her just wasnt set right like a beautiful painting hung off kilter you never said anything to me if id told you i thought your girlfriend was iffy in the personality department would you have listened to me calmly and said gee thanks lar nope nope is right au contraire you would have been highly pissed off probably never spoken to me again no no kiddies uncle larry keeps his mouth shut first rule of therapy when youre not sure say nothing and i wasnt sure its not as if i was formally diagnosing her this was just an impression besides you seemed to be enjoying yourself with her and i didnt see you marrying her why not she just didnt seem the marrying kind what kind did she seem the kind you keep on the side and destroy your life over d i figured you were too smart for that and i was right wasnt i pause he said let me ask you a question and dont take offense was she any good in bed not really i said went through the moves but didnt really dig it i was startled what makes you say that talking about the loop made me realize who she reminded me of the porn actresses kruse used to have in his movies i met them when i worked for him those girls all oozed sex appeal came on as if they could suck blood out of a rock but you got the feeling it was just a veneer something that came off with their makeup sensuality wasnt integrated in their personalities they knew how to split their feelings from their behavior split i said as in borderline exactly but dont get me wrong im not saying sharon was a borderline or even that all the actresses were but she and they all had some of that borderline quality to them am i on target at all bullseye i said she had typical borderline qualities all these years i never put it together dont shit on yourself d you were sleeping with her afflicted with severe pussyblindness i especially wouldnt expect you to be diagnosing her but im not surprised she made a fuck film borderline personality disorder if sharon had deserved that diagnosis id flirted with disaster the borderline patient is a therapists nightmare during my training years before i decided to specialize in children i treated more than my share of them and learned that the hard way or rather i tried to treat them because borderlines never really get better the best you can do is help them coast without getting sucked into their pathology at first glance they look normal sometimes even supernormal holding down highpressure jobs and excelling but they walk a constant tightrope between madness and sanity unable to form relationships incapable of achieving insight never free from a deep corroding sense of worthlessness and rage that spills over inevitably into selfdestruction theyre the chronically depressed the determinedly addictive the compulsively divorced living from one emotional disaster to the next bed hoppers stomach pumpers freeway jumpers and sadeyed bench sitters with arms stitched up like footballs and psychic wounds that can never be sutured their egos are as fragile as spun sugar their psyches irretrievably fragmented like a jigsaw puzzle with crucial pieces missing they play roles with alacrity excel at being anyone but themselves crave intimacy but repel it when they find it some of them gravitate toward stage or screen others do their acting in more subtle ways no one knows how or why a borderline becomes a borderline the freudians claim its due to emotional deprivation during the first two years of life the biochemical engineers blame faulty wiring neither school claims to be able to help them much borderlines go from therapist to therapist hoping to find a magic bullet for the crushing feelings of emptiness they turn to chemical bullets gobble tranquilizers and antidepressants alcohol and cocaine embrace gurus and heavenhucksters any charismatic creep promising a quick fix of the pain and they end up taking temporary vacations in psychiatric wards and prison cells emerge looking good raising everyones hopes until the next letdown real or imagined the next excursion into selfdamage what they dont do is change ada small had once talked to me about it the only time i can remember hearing anger in her voice stay away from them alex if you want to feel competent theyll make you look stupid every time youll work on getting rapport for months even years finally think youve got it and are ready to do some insight work maybe get some real change going and theyll walk out on you in a minute youll find yourself wondering what you did wrong questioning if you went into the right profession it wont be you its them they can look terrific one moment be out on the ledge the next out on the ledge more than any other psychiatric patient borderlines could be counted on to attempt suicide and to succeed i used to sit around bullshitting with the actresses larry was saying got to know some of them a little and began to understand them their promiscuity how they did what they did from a borderlines point of view promiscuity can be a halfway decent adaptation the perfect split one man for friendship another for intellectual stimulation another for sex split split split neat and clean if you cant achieve intimacy it sure beats being lonely splittings also a great way to cut yourself off from fucking on film and letting guys come all over your face just another job i mean how else could you do it then go home and make macaroni and cheese and do the crossword puzzle the girls admitted it said when they were on camera it was like watching someone else dissociation i said par excellence i thought of all the fragmentation in sharons life the routinized ultimately passionless way she made love the refusal to live with me with anyone the detachment with which shed spoken about her dead parents going into a helping profession and seducing her patients graduating but never getting her license that horrible night id found her with the twin photo im their only little girl the lies the loop hooking up with a sleaze like kruse did kruse ever film his students larry you think he made her do the film its logical he was her supervisor he was into porn i suppose so except his werent loops they were halfhour features color full sound supposed to be marital aids for couples with sexual dysfunction pseudodocumentaries with a disclaimer at the beginning and some guy who sounds like orson welles doing a voiceover narration while the camera zooms in on insertion besides kruse used actors and actresses pros i never saw a student in any of his stuff there may have been stuff you didnt see im sure there was but do you have any indication he filmed her no just a gut feeling what do you know about the loop besides the fact that she was in it supposed to be a doctorpatient seduction thing the person who described it to me never saw it himself and its since disappeared so basically youre talking thirdhand information the old telephone game you know how that kind of thing improves with the telling maybe it wasnt even her maybe pause wanna try to find out how i might be able to get hold of a copy old contacts from the research project i dont know i said yeah he said it would be kind of morbid forget i mentioned it oops my light just went on got a patient in the waiting room anything else on your mind i wrestled with my feelings curiosity no tell it like it is delaware voyeurism locked in combat with fear of learning yet more repugnant truths but i said see if you can get hold of the movie youre sure i wasnt but i heard myself say yes okay he said ill get back to you soon as i know yesterdays conversation with robin my irritability the way things had fizzled still preyed on my mind at four i phoned her the last person i wanted to talk to answered yes its me rosalie shes not here when are you expecting her back she didnt say all right would you please tell her im not telling her anything why dont you just quit she doesnt want to be with you isnt that plain to see itll be plain when i hear it from her rosalie listen i know youre supposed to be smart and all that but youre not as smart as you think you and her think youre all grown up got everything figured out dont need to hear advice from no one but shes still my kid and i dont like people pushing her around you think i push her around if the shoe fits mister yesterday after she talked to you she was all mopey for the rest of the day the way she used to be when she was a kid and couldnt get her way thank god some friends called so maybe she can finally have a good time shes a good kid doesnt need that kind of misery so why dont you just forget it im not about to forget anything i love her bullpuckey words i gritted my teeth just give her the message rosalie do your own dirty work slam i sat there tight with rage feeling cut off and helpless grew angry at robin for allowing herself to be protected like a child then i cooled and realized robin had no idea she was being protected had no reason to expect her mother would protect her the two of them had never had a close relationship daddy had seen to that now rosalie was trying to reassert her maternal rights i felt sorry for rosalie but it only partially quelled my anger and i still wanted to talk to robin to work things out why the hell was that turning out to be so difficult the phone was the wrong way to do it we needed time alone the right setting i called two airlines for flight schedules to san luis at both of them recorded messages put me on hold when the doorbell rang i hung up it rang again i went to the door looked through the peephole and saw a familiar face big and broad and lumpy almost boyish except for the acne pits that blanketed the cheeks coarse black hair slightly graying cut unfashionably close around the ears and neck and left long up on top with a kennedyesque shock falling across a low square brow and sideburns that reached to the bottom of fleshy earlobes a big highbridged nose a pair of startling green eyes under shaggy black brows pallid skin now lacquered with a hot pink coat of sunburn the nose red and peeling the entire ugly assemblage scowling i opened the door four days early milo crave civilization fish he said ignoring the question and holding out a metal ice chest he stared at me you look terrible gee thanks you look like strawberry yogurt yourself stirred from the bottom he grimaced itching all over here take it i have to scratch he shoved the chest at me the weight made me step backward i carried it into the house and placed it on the kitchen counter he followed me in and flopped down on a chair stretching out long legs and running his hands over his face as if washing without water so he said spreading his arms what do you think pretty goddamned abercrombie and itch huh he had on a redandblack plaid shirt baggy khakis rubbersoled laceup boots and a khaki fishermans vest with about a dozen zippered compartments trout lures hung from one of the pockets a fishing knife in a scabbard dangled from his belt hed put on some weight had to be pushing and the shirt was tight the buttons straining stunning i said he growled and loosened the laces on the boots rick he said he forced me to go shopping insisted we had to outmacho everyone did you succeed oh yeah we were so goddamned tough it scared the shit out of the fish little suckers jumped right out of the river landing in our skillets lemon slices in their mouths i laughed hey he said man still remembers how whats the matter guy who died before i could answer he was up and prying open the chest removing two big trout wrapped in plastic give me a fry pan butter garlic and onions no excuse me this is an upscale householdshallots give me shallots got any beer i got a grolsch from the refrigerator opened it and gave it to him going temperate on me he asked tilting his head back and drinking from the bottle not right now i gave him the pan and a knife and went back to rummage in the refrigerator which was near empty heres the butter no shallots no garlic either just this he looked at the wilted half bermuda onion in my hand took it and said tsk tsk slipping dr suave im reporting you to the foodie patrol he took the onion sliced it down the middle and immediately his eyes teared moving away and rubbing them he said better yet we play hunters and gatherers me catch you cook he sat down and worked on the beer i lifted a trout and inspected it it had been gutted and cleaned expertly nice huh he said pays to take a surgeon along where is rick getting some shuteye while he can hes got a twentyfourhour coming up at the er then twentyfour off and back on again for the saturday night shift gunshots and malicious foolishness after that hes started heading over to the free clinic to counsel aids patients what a guy huh all of a sudden im living with schweitzer he was smiling but his voice was heavy with irritation and i wondered if he and rick were going through another tough period i hoped not i had neither the energy nor the will to deal with it how were the great outdoors i asked what can i say we did the whole boy scout camping bit my daddy would have been heapum proud found a gorgeous place near the river downstream from white water last day we were there a canoe full of executive types came coasting by bankers computer jockeys you know the type play it so straight all year round the moment theyre away from home they freak and turn into blithering idiots anyway these yahoos come barreling downstream stinking drunk and louder than a sonic boom spot us lower their pants and flash us the moon he gave an evil grin if theyd only known who they were shoving their asses at huh panic time at the gop convention i laughed and began frying the onions milo went to the refrigerator got another beer and came back looking serious nothing in here he said whats going on i need to shop uhhuh he reached under his shirt and scratched his chest paced the kitchen and said hows the lovely ms castagna working hard uhhuh he kept pacing the onions turned translucent i added more butter to the pan and put the trout in they hissed and sizzled and the smell of fresh fish filled the room ah he said nothing like a friend at home in the kitchen do you do windows too whyd you come back early i asked too much pristine unspoiled beauty couldnt take it amazing the things one learns about ones wretched self out in the wilds seems both of us are urban sleazejunkies all that clean air and calm and we were going through the shakes he drank more beer shook his head you know how we are marriage made in heaven until we spend too much time together but enough about the sweet agony of relationships howre the trout almost done be careful not to overcook want to do it yourself touchy touchy i gave him one and a half trout and put half a fish on my plate then filled two glasses with ice water and brought them to the table i had a bottle of white wine somewhere but it wasnt chilled besides i didnt feel like drinking and the last thing milo needed was more alcohol he looked at the water as if it were polluted but drank it anyway after finishing the trout in a few moments he looked at my uneaten food want it i said not hungry i shook my head i ate just before you dropped in he gave me a long look fine hand it over when the halftrout was gone he said okay tell me what the hell is bothering you i considered telling him about robin told him about sharon instead honoring my pledge to leslie weingarden and leaving out the patient seductions he listened without commenting got up and searched the refrigerator for dessert and found an apple that he demolished in four bites wiping his face he said trapp huh youre sure it was him hes hard to miss with that white hair and that skin yeah the skin he said some sort of weird disease i described it to rick and he gave me a name for it but i forgot it autoimmune condition the body attacks itself by leeching pigment no one knows what causes it but in trapps case ive got a theory assholes so full of poison his own system cant stand him maybe well be lucky and hell fade away completely what do you think about his being at the house who knows id love nothing more than to get something on the scrote but this one doesnt scream felony maybe he and your late friend were getting it on and he went back to make sure he hadnt left any evidence sleazy but not indictable he shook his head if she was getting it on with him she must have been nuts what about the quick sale on the house i asked and the twin sister i know she exists existed because i met her six years ago if shes still alive shed be sharons heir six years is a long time alex and whos to say she hasnt been found del was right thats up to the lawyers sure sure it smells of coverup but that doesnt mean whats being covered up is anything juicy pal this kind of things routine when youre dealing with the pricey crowd just last month we had an art theft up in bel air thirteen million dollars worth of french impressionism gone like that he snapped his fingers private chef did it and split to monaco we filed the papers family hired private help they recovered the pictures few months later the chef had an accident with scalding water and speaking of accidents last april the teenage daughter of a prominent manufacturer up in the palisades got pissed at the family maid for throwing out one of her magazines stuck the poor ladys hand in a garbage disposal byebye five fingers but the maid changed her mind about filing charges took early retirement ten thousand per digit and shipped back to guatemala then theres a talk show host everyone knows him helluva witty and charming guy his game is getting drunk and putting women in the hospital the network adds two million a year to his salary for damage control ever read a word about any of it ever see it on the six oclock news rich folk in awkward situations alex sweep it under the rug and keep it out of court it happens all the time so youre saying forget the whole thing not so fast lone ranger i didnt say i was going to forget it ill pursue it but for selfish reasons the chance of getting something on trapp and theres one thing about the film story that does snag my interest harvey pinckley the guy who caught the call he was one of trapps boys when trapp was at hollywood firstclass asskisser del made it sound as if he was okay del didnt know him i did besides dels a good guy but our relationships been a bit frosty of late departmental politics marital problems his wifes giving him grief hes sure shes stepping out its turned him asocial sorry to hear that me too he was the only one in the division who ever treated me human and dont get me wrong were not ripping each others throats out but hes not going to extend himself for anyone anyway the timings right for a little extracurricular infogathering i dont have to report till monday and rick will either be working or sleeping it off all weekend he got up walked around idle hands make the devils work lad far be it from me to tempt satan just dont expect anything dramatic okay i nodded took the dishes to the sink and started washing he came over and placed a big padded hand on my shoulder you look down fess up doctor this friend was more than just a friend a long time ago milo but from the way you look when you talk about her its not that ancient a history or is there something else on that scary thing you call your mind nothing milo he removed his hand do consider one thing alex are you ready to hear more dirt about her cause from what we already know once we start digging it aint gonna be buried treasure time no problem i said trying to sound nonchalant uhhuh he said and went to get another beer when he was gone my nonchalance faded how much more dirt did i really want to encounter when id never made sense of what i knew already free followup visits id been followed up too the scene with the twin photo left me addled in pain unable to concentrate on work three days later i started calling her got no answer four days later i gathered my resolve and went back to the house on jalmia no one home i inquired at the psych department was informed she was on temporary leave none of her professors was worried about her absence shed had to take leave beforefamily business had always made up the work was a topnotch student they suggested i talk to her adviser dr kruse when kruse didnt return a weeks worth of phone calls i looked up his office address and drove there the building was five stories of anodized steel and bronzed glass on sunset near doheny granitelobbied and marooncarpeted with a noisy french restaurant that opened to a sidewalk café on the ground floor the directory listed an odd mix of tenants about a third psychologists and psychiatrists the rest various filmrelated concerns production companies agents publicists personal managers kruses suite was on the top floor his door was locked i kneeled opened the mail slot and peeked in darkness i got up and looked around one other suite took up the rest of the floor an outfit called creative image associates its double doors were locked too i taped a note under kruses nameplate leaving my name and number and asking him to get in touch as soon as possible re sr then i drove up to the house on jalmia again the oil stain in the carport was dry the foliage wilting the mailbox was crammed with at least a weeks worth of correspondence i skimmed the return addresses on the envelopes all junk nothing indicating where shed gone the following morning before heading for the hospital i went back to the psych department and got kruses home address out of the faculty files pacific palisades i drove there that evening and sat waiting for him the tail end of november just before thanksgiving las best time of year the sky had just deepened from el greco blue to a glowing pewter swelling with rain clouds and sweet with electricity kruses house was big pink and spanish on a private road off mandeville canyon just a short drive down to the coast highway and the high battering tides of autumn the street was narrow and quiet the nearby properties estatesized but kruses layout was open no high walls or gates psychology had been good to him the house was graceful with two hundred feet of landscaped garden on each side adorned with verandas monterey roofs handturned wooden grillwork leaded windows shading the south side of the lawn was a beautifully warped black pine giant bonsai a pair of brazilian orchid trees had sprinkled the freshly sown rye grass with violet blossoms a semicircular driveway inlaid with moorish tile cut an inverted u through the grass at twilight colored outdoor lights came on and highlighted the landscaping no cars not a sound more canyon seclusion sitting there i was reminded of the house on jalmia the masters influence thought about sharons inheritance story and wondered again if kruse had set her up i wondered too about what had happened to the other little girl in the photo he showed up shortly after eight driving a black gold pinstriped mercedes twoseater with the top down he gunned up the driveway instead of opening the door he swung his legs over it his long yellow hair was perfectly windblown a pair of mirrored sunglasses dangled from a gold chain around his neck he carried no briefcase just a small purselike calfskin shoulder bag that matched his boots he wore a gray cashmere sport coat white silk turtleneck and black slacks a black silk handkerchief trimmed with scarlet spilled out of his breast pocket as he headed toward his front door i got out of the rambler the sound of my door slamming made him turn he stared i jogged toward him and stepped into the artificial light dr kruse im alex delaware despite all the messages my name evoked no sign of recognition im a friend of sharon ransom hello alex im paul halfsmile his voice was low from the chest modulated like that of a disc jockey im trying to locate her i said he nodded but didnt answer the silence lengthened i felt obligated to speak she hasnt been home for over two weeks dr kruse i was wondering if you knew where she is you care about her he said as if answering a question i hadnt asked yes i do alex delaware he said ive called you several times left messages at your office big smile he gave his head a toss the yellow hair whipped back then settled across his forehead he took his keys out of his purse id love to help you alex but i cant he began walking to the door please dr kruse he stopped turned looked over his shoulder flicked his eyes at me and smiled again but it came out as a sour twist of his lips as if the sight of me made him ill paul likes you he likes what ive told him about you where is she dr kruse the fact that she didnt tell you implies something doesnt it just tell me if shes okay is she coming back to la or gone for good im sorry he said i cant talk to you about anything therapeutic confidentiality youre her therapist im her supervisor inherent in the supervisory relationship is more than a little psychotherapy telling me if shes all right wont violate confidentiality he shook his head then something odd happened to his face the upper half remained all hard scrutiny heavy blond brows and palebrown eyes flecked with green that bored into mine with svengalilike intensity but from the nose down hed gone slack the mouth curling into a foolish almost clownish leer two personalities sharing one face freaky as a carny show and twice as unsettling because there was hostility behind it the desire to ridicule to dominate tell her i care about her i said tell her whatever she does that i still care have a good evening he said then he went into his house an hour later back in my apartment i was furious determined to flush her and her bullshit out of my life a month later id settled down to solitude and a crushing workload was managing to fake contentment well enough to believe it myself when she called eleven pm id just gotten home dogtired and hungry when i heard her voice my resolve melted like old slush under a new sun im back im sorry ill explain everything she told me meet me at my house in an hour ill make it up to you i promise i showered put on fresh clothes drove to nichols canyon prepared to ask hard questions she was waiting for me at the door in a flamered lowcut jersey dress that barely contained her in her hand was a snifter of something pink and redolent of strawberries it obscured her perfume no spring flowers the house was brightly lit before i could speak she pulled me inside and pressed her mouth against mine worming her tongue between my teeth and keeping us fastened by pressing one hand hard to the back of my head her breath was sharp with alcohol it was the first time id seen her drink anything other than up when i commented on it she laughed and hurled the glass at the fireplace it shattered and left pink snailtracks on the wall strawberry daiquiri darling i guess im in a tropical mood her voice was husky inebriated she kissed me again harder began undulating against me i closed my eyes sank into the boozy sweetness of the kiss she moved away from me i opened my eyes saw her peeling out of the red dress shimmying and licking her lips the silk caught on her hips gave way after a tug then fell to the floor just a flimsy orange ribbon she stepped away from me gave me a look at her braless in black garter belt mesh stockings and highheeled shoes she ran her hands over her body in the abstract it was xrated comedy fredericks of hollywood a lampoon but she was anything but abstract and i stood there transfixed i let her strip me down in a practiced manner that excited and frightened me too nimble too professional how many other times how many other men whod taught her to hell with that i didnt care i wanted her she had me out in her hand kneading nibbling we embraced again naked her fingers traveled over my body scratching raising welts she put my hand between her legs rode my fingers engulfed them yum she said stepping back once more pirouetting and exhibiting herself i reached for the light switch she said no keep it bright i want to see it see everything i realized that the drapes were open we were standing before the wall of glass toplit giving a free show to hollywood i turned the light off party pooper she said and kneeled before me grinning i put my fingers in her hair was engulfed spun backward into a vortex of pleasure she pulled away to catch her breath said cmon the lights i want to see it in the bedroom i gasped lifting her in my arms i carried her down the hall as she continued to kiss me and stroke me the bedroom lights were on but the high windows afforded privacy i set her down on top of the covers she opened like a book to a favorite page i got on top she rounded her back and drew her legs up in the air put me in her and rocked her hips holding me at arms length so she could stare at the piston merger of our flesh once shed been married to modesty thered been a quickie divorce youre in me oh god she pinched her nipples touched herself made sure i watched she rode me withdrew me took me in hand rubbed me over her face slid me between her breasts wrapped me in the soft tangle of her hair then got under me pulled me down hard and tongued my anus a moment later we were locked together standing her back to the wall then she positioned me near the foot of the bed and sat on me staring over my shoulder into the mirror above the dresser not satisfied with that she pushed me off her and pulled me into the bathroom i realized why right away tall mirrored medicine chests on two walls mirrors that could be pulled out and angled for side views back views after arranging her stage she sat on the cold tile counter shivering and goosebumped put me in her again darted her eyes we ended up on the bathroom floor she squatting over me touching herself tracing a vaginal trail up and down my chest then impaling herself again when i closed my eyes she cried out no and pried them open finally she lost herself in the pleasure opened her mouth wide and panted and grunted sobbed and covered her face and came i exploded a second later she extricated herself licked me hard and kept moving slamming herself down on the tile using me selfishly climaxing a second time we staggered back to the bedroom and fell asleep in each others arms with the lights still on i slept woke up feeling drugged she wasnt in bed i found her in the living room hair pinned up dressed in tight jeans and a tank top another new look sitting in a sling chair drinking another strawberry daiquiri and reading a psych journal unaware of my presence i watched her stick a finger in the drink pull it out coated with pink foam and lick it off hi i said smiling and stretching she looked up at me her expression was odd flat bored then it heated and turned ugly contemptuous sharon she placed the drink on the carpet and stood up okay she said you got what you wanted you scummy prick now get the fuck out of here get the fuck out of my life get out i dressed hurriedly carelessly feeling as worthwhile as a scab rushed past her out of the house and into the rambler hands shaking i started the car and hurtled down jalmia only when i was back on hollywood boulevard did i take the time to breathe but breathing hurt as if id been poisoned i wanted suddenly to destroy her to leach her toxin from my blood i screamed entertaining murderous thoughts i sped along dark streets as dangerous as a drunk driver i got onto sunset passed nightclubs and disco joints smiling faces that seemed to mock my own misery but by the time i reached doheny my rage had faded to gnawing sadness disgust this was it no more mindfucks this was it remembering had plunged me into a cold sweat followup visits shed followed herself up too with pills and a gun on thursday morning i called paul kruses university office not really knowing what i was going to say to him he was out the department secretary had no idea when hed be back i looked up his private office in the phone book he had two the one on sunset and the one hed leased for sharon no answer at either same old song id become a virtuoso at playing it i thought of calling the airlines again didnt relish handling more phone abuse my thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door a messenger with a check from trenton worthy and la rosa and two large giftwrapped packages also from the law firm i tipped him and after he left i opened the packages one held a case of chivas regal the other a case of moët chandon a tip for me as i wondered why the phone rang did it get there asked mal a minute ago heey perfect timing or what dont drink it all in one place why the gratuity mal sevenfigure settlement is

rich should help but sure ill push her by the way after we settled on a figure moretti asked for your number he was very impressed flattered i gave it to him hes wasting his time thats what i figured but it wasnt my place to tell him to shove it do it yourself i imagine the new you will enjoy it at one oclock i went out and made another try at grocery shopping in the produce section my cart collided with one pushed by a tall auburnhaired woman oops sorry i disengaged moved aside and edged over to the tomatoes sorry myself she said cheerfully gets like the freeway in here sometimes doesnt it the market was nearly empty but i said sure does she smiled at me with even white teeth and i took a closer look late thirties or wellpreserved early forties a thick shag of dark hair surrounding a roundish pretty face snub nose and freckles eyes the color of a choppy sea she wore denim short shorts that advertised long tan runners legs and a lavender tshirt that did the same for high sharp breasts around one ankle was a thin gold chain her nails were long and silver the ones on the index fingers had been inlaid with diamond chips what do you think of this she asked handing me a cantaloupe too firm to be ripe no i dont think so just right huh big grin one leg bent and resting against the other she stretched and the tshirt rose up exposing a flat bronze tummy i turned the melon in my palms and knocked on it a couple of times just right when i handed it back our fingers touched im julie alex ive seen you here before alex you buy lots of chinese vegetables dont you a shot in the dark and a miss but why make her feel bad sure do love that bok choy she said as she hefted the cantaloupe placing it in her basket she turned her attention to half a pineapple wrapped in plastic mmm everything looks so good and ripe today yum i bagged some tomatoes selected a head of lettuce and a bunch of scallions and began to wheel away lawyer right i smiled and shook my head um lets see architect no im a psychologist are you really i love psychologists mine helped me so much thats great julie i began pushing my cart away nice meeting you listen she said im on this onemealaday cleansing diet just lunch lots of complex carbohydrates and i havent had it yet im famished theres a pasta bar up the block would you care to join me love to julie but i cant thanks though

faggots at six milo came by despite the fact that he wasnt due back at the station until monday he was dressed for work wilted seersucker suit washandwear shirt atrocious tie desert boots spent all day detecting he said after getting himself a beer and remarking that i was a good boy for restocking my cupboards hollywood division the coroners hall of records building and safety your lady docs a goddam phantom id sure love to know what the hells going on he sat down at the kitchen table i settled across from him and waited for him to finish the beer its as if she never was processed through anyones system he said i had to skulk around at hollywood pretend to be looking at something else while i checked for any file on her nothing not on paper or in the central computer i couldnt even find out who put the call in the night she died or who took it zilch at the coroners too no autopsy report no coldstorage log death certificate release i mean theres coverup and theres coverup but this is twilight zone stuff he rubbed his hand over his face one of the pathologists he said is a guy rick knew in med school usually i can get him to talk to me off the record give me results before he writes up the final report speculate about stuff that he cant put into writing i thought hed at least get me a copy of the report no way he made a big deal out of showing me there was no report made it clear i shouldnt ask for any favors on this one same pathologist del spoke to no that was itatani i talked to him first and it was the same thing the fix has come down hard and heavy on this one i confess to being intrigued maybe it wasnt suicide any reason to think that she made lots of people angry such as i told him about the patient seductions keeping leslie weingardens name out of it beautiful alex why didnt you let me know about this in the first place confidential source i cant give you any more details jesus he got up walked around sat back down you ask me to dig you a hole but wont give me a shovel jesus alex he went to get another beer its bad enough being back in realityville without spinning my wheels all day i didnt mean to send you on a wildgoose chase honk honk then he waved his hand nah who am i kidding i didnt do it for you i did it for myself trapp and i still dont think theres any big whodunit here ransom killed herself she was a maladjust what you just told me corroborates that out on the ledge i nodded find out anything about the twin sister nada another phantom no shirlee ransom in any of our files or anyone elses if you came up with the name of that hospital you saw her at we could search the business transfer and bankruptcy files but even then tracing individual patients would be a very long shot i cant come up with it because i never knew it milo what about checking the medical files you said ransom was rich why would her sister be on medical the parents were rich but that was years ago money runs out also also he said with all the lying she did you dont know what to believe i nodded lie she did pal like about owning the jalmia house the place is deeded to a corporation just like the real estate agent said a management company named

leland beldings company was till he died no idea who owns it now he drank beer the old basketcase billionaire himself now a guy like that you could see putting on a big fix but hes been buried for what fifteen years something like that wasnt his death disputed by who the guy who wrote that hoax book he killed himself after they exposed it which is a pretty good indication he had something to be ashamed of even the conspiracy freaks didnt believe that one anyway whoever owns it the corporation lives on clerk told me its one of the biggest landowners west of the mississippi thousands of parcels ransoms house happened to be one of them with that kind of landlord you can see why thered be a quick sale he finished his beer got up to get a third hows your liver i asked peachy mom he made

neighbors maybe one of them phoned in the call knows something about her about her and trapp that would be nice he went into the living room turned on the tv put his feet up and watched the evening news within moments he was asleep and i was remembering a blackandwhite snapshot and thinking despite what hed said about shirlee ransom i went into the library and called olivia brickerman hello

billion friday morning i booked a saturday flight to san luis on sky west at am larry daschoff called and told me hed located a copy of the porn loop i was wrong kruse made it must have been some kind of personal kick if you still want to see it ive got an hour and a half between patients he said noon to onethirty meet me at this place and well watch a matinee he recited a beverly hills address turningovertherock time i felt queasy unclean d ill meet you there the address was on north crescent drive in the beverly hills flats the pricey prairie stretching from santa monica boulevard to sunset and from doheny west to the beverly hilton hotel houses in the flats range from twobedroom teardowns that wouldnt stand out in a workingclass tract to mansions big enough to corral a politicians ego the teardowns go for a million and a half once a quiet cushy neighborhood of doctors dentists and showbusiness types the flats has become a repository for very new very flashy foreign money of questionable origin all that easy cash has brought with it a mania for monumentbuilding unfettered by tradition or taste and as i drove down crescent half the structures seemed to be in various phases of construction the final products would have done disney proud turreted graystone castle sans moat but cum tennis court mockmoorish minimosque italianatedutch truffle haute gingerbread haunted house postmoderne freeform fantasy larrys station wagon was parked in front of a peagreen pseudofrench pseudoregency pseudotownhouse with ramada inn overtones glitterflecked stucco walls multiple mansards greenandgray striped awnings louver windows olive trim the lawn was two squares of ivy split by a concrete path from the ivy sprouted whitewashed plaster statuary naked cherubs blind justice in agony a copy of the pietà a carp taking flight in the driveway was a fleet of cars hotpink tbird two rollsroyce silver shadows one silver one gold and a maroon lincoln town car with red vinyl top and a famous designers logo on its smoked windows i parked larry waved and got out of the chevy he saw me looking at the house and said pretty recherché huh d who are these people their name is fontaine gordon and chantal they made their money in patio furniture somewhere out in the midwest the plastic strap and tubular aluminum stuff sold out for a fortune several years ago moved to bh and retired they give lots to charity distribute thanksgiving turkeys on skid row come across like benevolent grandparents which they are but they love porn damn near worship it theyre the private donors i told you about the ones who funded kruses research good simple folk huh they really are d not into s and m or kiddie stuff just good oldfashioned straight sex on celluloid they claim it rejuvenated their marriage can get downright evangelical about it when kruse was setting up his research he heard about them and tapped them for funding they were so happy someone was going to finally educate the world about the therapeutic benefits of erotica that they coughed up without a fuss must have handed over a couple of hundred grand you can imagine how they felt when he changed his tune and started playing to the procensorship crowd and theyre still steamed when i called gordon remembered me as kruses ra and let me know that as far as theyre concerned kruse is the scum of the earth i mean he really catharted when he stopped to take a breath i made it clear i was no great kruse fan myself and told him what we were after he calmed down and said sure come on over i think the idea of helping us really jazzed him like all fanatics they love to show off what reason did you give him for wanting to see the film that the star was dead we were old friends and we wanted to remember her for everything shed done theyd read about it thought it would be a dandy memorial the grimy peeping tom feeling returned larry read my face said cold feet it seems ghoulish sure its ghoulish so are eulogies if you want to call it off ill go in there and tell them no i said lets do it try not to look so tortured he said one of the ways i gained entree was telling them you were sympatico to their hobby i crossed my eyes leered and did some heavy breathing hows that oscar caliber we reached the front door a solid slab painted glossy olive behind the green door said larry very subtle youre sure they have the loop gordon said definitely he also said they had something else we might be interested in he rang the bell and it chimed out the first few notes of bolero then swung open a filipino maid in a white uniform stood in the doorway petite thirtyish bespectacled her hair in a bun yes dr daschoff and dr delaware to see mr and mrs fontaine yes said the maid come in we stepped into a twostory rotunda with a pastoral mural blue skies green grass fluffy sheep hay bales a shepherd playing the pipes in the shade of a spreading sycamore in front of all that agrarian bliss sat a naked woman in a deck chair fat middleaged grayhaired lumpy legs she held a pencil in one hand a crossword puzzle book in the other didnt acknowledge our entry the maid saw us staring rapped her knuckles on the gray head hollow sculpture an original lombardo she said very expensive like that she pointed upward dangling from the ceiling was what appeared to be a calder mobile christmas bulbs had been laced around it a doityourself chandelier lots of money said the maid directly in front of us was an emeraldcarpeted staircase that spiraled to the left the space under the stairs terminated at a high chinese screen the other rooms were also blocked by screens come said the maid she turned her uniform was backless and cut low past the gluteal cleft lots of naked brown skin larry and i looked at each other he shrugged she unfolded part of the chinese screen led us through twenty feet and yet another partition her walk took on a sashay and we followed her midway down the hall to a green metal door on the wall was a keyhole and a key pad she cupped one hand with the other punched in a fivedigit code inserted a key turned it and the door slid open we entered a small elevator with padded quilted walls of gold brocade hung with ivory miniatures scenes from the kama sutra a buttonpress and we descended the three of us stood shoulder to shoulder the maid smelled of baby powder she looked bored we stepped out into a small dark anteroom and trailed her through japanned double doors on the other side was a huge highwalled windowless room at least three thousand square feet paneled in black lacquered wood silent and cool and barely lit as my eyes accommodated to the darkness i was able to make out details brassgrilled bookcases reading tables card catalogues display cases and library ladders all in the same ebonized finish above us a flat ceiling of black cork below dark carpeted floors the only light came from greenshaded bankers lamps on the tables i heard the hum of air conditioning saw ceiling sprinklers smoke alarms a large barometer on one wall a room designed to house treasures thank you rosa said a nasal male voice from across the room i squinted and saw human outlines a man and woman sitting side by side at one of the far tables the maid bowed turned and wiggled away when she was gone the same voice said little rosie ramos she was a real talent in the sixties px mamas ginza girls choose one from column x good helps so hard to find larry whispered out loud he said hello people the couple stood and walked toward us at ten feet away their faces took on clarity like cinema characters emerging from a dissolve the man was older than id expected seventy or close to it short and portly with thick straight white hair combed back and a jowly xavier cugat face he wore blackframed eyeglasses a white guayabera shirt over brown slacks and tan loafers even shoeless the woman was half a foot taller late fifties slender and finefeatured with an elegant carriage poodlecut red hair with a curl that looked natural and the kind of fair freckled skin that bruises easily her dress was limecolored thai silk with a dragon print and mandarin collar she wore apple jade jewelry gauzy black stockings and black ballet slippers thanks for seeing us said larry our pleasure larry said the man been a long time excuse me its doctor daschoff now isnt it phd said larry piled higher and deeper no no said the man wagging his finger you earned it be proud he shook larrys hand lots of therapists staking out la you doing okay oh gordie dont be so direct said the woman im doing fine gordon said larry turning to her hello chantal long time she curtsied and extended her hand lawrence this is dr alex delaware an old friend and colleague alex chantal and gordon fontaine alex said chantal curtsying again charmed she took my hand in both of hers her skin was hot and soft and moist she had large hazel eyes and a jawline that had been tucked tight her makeup was thick almost chalky but couldnt conceal the wrinkles and there was pain in the eyes shed been a knockout once and was still getting used to thinking of herself in the past tense pleased to meet you chantal she squeezed my hand and released it her husband looked me over and said youve got a photogenic face doctor ever act no i only ask because it seems everyone in la has acted at one time or another to his wife a goodlooking boy honey he put his arm around her shoulder your type wouldnt you say chantal gave a cold smile gordon told me she has a thing for men with curly hair running one hand over his own straight coiffure he lifted it and revealed a bare scalp the way mine used to be right honey he put the hairpiece down and patted it into place so did larry tell you about our little collection only in general terms he nodded you know what they say about the acquisition of art being an art itself now thats pure bunkum but it does take a certain determination and panache to acquire meaningfully and weve worked like the dickens to do just that he spread his arms as if blessing the room what you see here took two decades and iwonttellyouhowmany dollars to put together i knew my line id love to see it the next half hour was spent on a tour of the black room every genre of pornography was represented in astounding quantity and variety catalogued and labeled with smithsonian precision gordon fontaine jounced along guiding with fervor using a handheld remotecontrol module to switch lights on and off lock and unlock cabinets his wife hung back insinuating herself between larry and me smiling a lot observe gordon rolled open a print drawer and untied several portfolios of erotic lithographs recognizable without reading the signatures dali beardsley grosz picasso we moved on to an alarmequipped glass case housing an old english manuscript handwritten on parchment and illuminated with copulating peasants and cavorting farm animals preguttenberg said gordon chaucerian apocrypha chaucer was a highly sexual writer they never teach you that in high school other drawers were filled with erotic sketches from renaissance italy and japanese art watercolors of kimonoed courtesans entwined with stoic topknotted men lugging exaggerated sexual equipment overcompensation said chantal she nudged my arm we were shown displays of fertility talismans erotic woodblocks marital aids antique lingerie after a while my eyes began to blur those were used by brenda allens girls said gordon pointing to a set of yellowed silk undergarments and those red ones are from the bordello in new orleans where scott joplin played piano he stroked the glass if only they could talk eh we have edible ones too said chantal over there in a refrigerated case we swept past still more sexual devices collections of obscene party gags and novelties raunchy record albums and what gordon proclaimed to be the worlds finest collection of dildoes six hundred and fiftythree pieces gentlemen from all over the world every medium imaginable from monkeypod wood to scrimshawed ivory a hand brushed my rear i did a quarter turn saw chantal smile our bibliothèque said gordon pointing to a wall of bookshelves oversized giltedged treatises bound in leather hardand softcover contemporary books thousands of magazines some of them still shrinkwrapped and sealed with covers that left nothing to the imagination grandly tumescent men semenbathed wideeyed women titles like doublefucked stewardess and orifice supplies the fontaines seemed to know many of the models personally and discussed them with nearparental concern thats johnny strong he retired a couple of years ago and is selling securities up in tiburon look gordie theres laurie ruth sloan the milk queen herself to me she married money her husbands a real fascist and wont let her express herself anymore i tried to look sympathetic onward said gordon to the pièce de résistance a click of the remote module caused one of the bookcases to slide back behind it was a matteblack door that swung open at gordons prod inside was a large vaultscreening room two walls were lined with racks of film reels in metal canisters and videocassettes three rows of black leather easy chairs three chairs per row mounted on the rear wall was a gleaming array of projection equipment these are the cleanest prints youll ever see said gordon every important explicit film ever made all converted to videotape duplicate were also trying really hard to preserve the originals our restorer is topnotch twenty years at one of the studio archives another ten at the american film institute and our curator is a wellknown film critic who must remain unnamed he cleared his throatdue to lack of spine impressive i said we hope said chantal to donate it to a major university one day what she means by one day said gordon is after im gone oh hush gordie im going first no way hon youre not leaving me alone with my memories and my hand he waved a fleshy palm oh go on gordie youll do just fine for yourself gordon patted her hand the two of them exchanged affectionate glances larry looked at his watch of course said gordon im retired ive forgotten about time pressure you wanted to see shawnas loop shawna who i asked shawna blue thats the name pretty sharon used on the loop we always called her pretty sharon said chantal because she was such a lovely thing virtually flawless shawna blue was her nom damour she shook her head how sad that shes gone and a suicide do you find that surprising i asked of course she said to destroy oneself how awful how well did you know her not well at all i believe we just met her once am i right gordie just once how many films did she make same answer said gordon just one and it wasnt a commercial endeavor it was supposed to be for educational purposes the way he said supposed made me ask sounds like you have your doubts he frowned we put up the money based on its being educational the actual production was handled by that firstclass cockroach p p kruse peepee said chantal how apropos he claimed it was part of his research said gordon told us that one of his students had agreed to act in an erotic film as part of her course work when was this seventyfour he said october or november not long after sharon began grad school the bastard had been a fast worker it was supposed to be part of her research said gordon now we werent born yesterday we thought that was pretty thin but kruse assured us it was all on the upandup showed us forms approved by the university he even brought sharon to meet us here in our home that was the one time she seemed very vivacious very marilyn down to the hair she verified it was all part of her course work marilyn i said as in monroe yes she projected that same innocent yet erotic quality she was a blonde platinum said chantal like sunshine on clear water the sharon we knew had black hair said larry well i dont know about that said gordon kruse may have been lying about who she was he lied about everything else we opened our home to him gave him free access to our collection and he turned around and used it to pander to the bluenoses he gave a speech in front of church groups said chantal stamping her foot stood there and said terrible things about us called us perverted sexist if theres one man who isnt sexist its my gordie he didnt use our names added chantal but we knew he was referring to us his own wife was a porn star i said howd he explain that to the church groups suzy said gordon i wouldnt call her a star adequate style but strictly second drawer i suppose he could always claim he saved her from a life of sin but he probably never had to explain people have short memories after she married him suzy stopped working disappeared from view he probably turned her into a docile little hausfrau hes the type you know obsessed with power it echoed something larry had said at the party power junkie onward said gordon he went to the back of the room and began fiddling with the projection equipment kruse has just been appointed head of the psychology department i said scandalous said chantal youd think someone would know better youd think i said all cued gordon called from the back everyone get comfortable larry and i took the front end seats chantal got between us the room went black the screen dead white checkup he announced starring the late miss shawna blue and the late mr michael starbuck the screen filled with dancing lint followed by flickering countdown numbers i sat rigid holding my breath told myself id been an idiot to come then blackandwhite images floated in front of me and i lost myself in them there was no sound track only the whir of projection breaking the silence lettering that resemb checkup starring shawna blue mickey starbuck a creative image assoc production creative image a name on a door kruses neighbors in the sunset boulevard office not a neighbor after all but the two faces of dr k directed by pierre le voyeur a jumpy blackandwhite sweep of a doctors examining room the oldfashioned kind with enameled fixtures wooden examining table eye chart chintz drapes a square of six framed diplomas on the wall the door opened a woman walked in the camera pursued her spending a long time on the sway of her buttocks young and beautiful and wellendowed with long wavy platinumblond hair she wore a clinging lowcut jersey dress that barely contained her blackandwhite film but i knew the dress was flamecolored a flickering closeup magnified a beautiful pouting face sharons face despite the wig no doubt about it i felt sick and regretful stared at the screen like a child at a squashed bug the camera pulled back sharon pirouetted gazed into the mirror and fluffed her hair then a quick zoom more pout big eyes gazing out at the viewer boring into mine a full body shot shift to buttocks a series of quick bounces from mouth to hands to bosom shoddy the cheapest of the cheap but perversely magicalshe had come back to life was up there smiling and beckoning immortality conceived in light and shadow i had to restrain myself from reaching out to touch her wanted suddenly to yank her out of the screen to pull her back in time rescue her i gripped my armrests my heart was pounding filling my ears like a winter tide she stretched languidly and licked her lips the camera got so close her tongue resembled some kind of giant sea slug more closeups wet white teeth a purposeful bend forward flashing cleavage mooncratered nipplescape hands stroking breasts pinching she was twisting exhibiting clearly enjoying center stage keep it bright i want to see it see everything i thought of angled mirrors started sweating finally concentrating on the choppiness and relentless zooming helped restore her to something twodimensional i exhaled closed my eyes determined to maintain a sense of detachment before my breath had been totally expelled something dropped on my knee and settled there chantals hand i looked at her out of the corner of my eye she stared straight ahead mouth slightly parted i did nothing hoped she wouldnt explore let my eyes settle back on the screen sharon was performing a slow sinuous striptease peeling down to black garter belt mesh stockings and highheeled shoes a fredericks of hollywood parody touching herself bending spreading and kneading playing for the camera i watched her hands move felt them but something was wrong something about the hands offkilter the more i tried to figure out what it was the further it receded chinese fingerpuzzle time i stopped trying told myself it would come to me the camera got gynecologic moved upward inch by inch sharon on the examining table now fondled herself looked down at her crotch the camera swung to the doorknob as it rotated the door opened a tall dark broadshouldered man walked in carrying a clipboard late thirties long white coat headlamp and stethoscope a narrow hungry face downslanted eyes broken nose thin wide lips five oclock shadow the eyes were jumpy those of a hustler on full burn hed greased his hair to shoepolish sheen and parted it in the center a pencilline mustache traveled the length of his upper lip classic gigolo meets dumb blonde he stared at sharon raised his eyebrows mugged for the camera she pointed to her crotch gave a pained expression scratching his head he consulted his clipboard then put it down and removed the stethoscope he stood over her bent his knees and put his head between her legs poking probing looked up shrugged she winked at the camera pushed his head down writhed on cue he came up pretended to be gasping for breath she pushed him down again the rest was predictable closeup of his trousered erection she forcing him down sucking the fingers of one of her hands she pushed him off worked his zipper his pants fell to his ankles she removed the coat he was shirtless wore only a tie she pulled the tie until he hovered took him orally wideeyed and gulping as he got up on the table and mounted her chantals fingers began spiderwalking up my thigh i placed my hand over them preventing further progress gave a friendly squeeze and deposited them gently in her lap she made no sound didnt move a muscle comically rapid shifts in positions closeups of both their faces contorted he saying something cuing her a series of rapid thrusts withdrawal the milky proof of climax flying through the air she retrieved some from her belly licked her fingers winked at the camera again blank screen a checkup turned carnal followup visits i felt suffocated angry sad the room stayed mercifully dark well said gordon finally there it is chantal got up fast smoothed her dress excuse me i have something to attend to everything all right hon just fine dearie she kissed his cheek curtsied and said nice to see you again lawrence nice meeting you dr delaware she left the vault the late mickey starbuck i said howd he die gordon was still staring at his wifes exit route i had to repeat the question cocaine overdose several years ago poor mickey wanted to break into straight films but couldnt theres terrible discrimination against explicit stars he ended up driving a cab a sensitive soul really a fine young man two actors two suicides by overdose said larry sounds like a jinx nonsense said gordon sharply explicit films are like any other aspect of show business fragile egos instability big ups big downs some people cant cope the production company i said creative image associates a shadow for kruse gordon nodded protection foolish of me not to smell something rotten when he set it up if hed really gotten university approval why the need for a shadow when i saw the finished product i knew precisely what hed done but i didnt call him on it he was the doctor the expert at the time i thought he was brilliant visionary i figured he had a reason what had he done sit back down and ill show you he returned to the rear of the vault the room returned to darkness and another movie came on the screen this one had no title no actors credits just grainy jumpy action the camera work even more amateurish than the first but clearly its inspiration the setting a doctors office same kind of furniture same square of framed diplomas the stars a gorgeous woman with wavy blond hair longlegged stacked but several inches shorter than sharon the bones smaller the face slightly fuller similar enough to be sharons twin twin shirlee no that was impossible the shirlee id met had been crippled in childhood if sharon had told the truth big if film number two was barreling along at a keystone kops pace striptease hairfluffing a tall dark man entering through the door closeup on him fortyish shiny hair pencil mustache white coat stethoscope clipboard a crude resemblance to the late mickey starbuck but nothing striking and no leer this doctor seemed to be showing genuine surprise at the sight of the naked blonde lying spreadlegged on the table no shifts of context either a stationary camera fullview long shots and occasional closeups that seemed less concerned with eroticism than identification of the actors of him the blonde got up and rubbed herself against the doctor showed herself pinched her nipples stood on tiptoes and licked his neck he shook his head pointed to his watch she held him to her ground her hips he started to pull away again then loosened like something thawing allowed himself to be caressed she moved in then the same progression as in sharons film but different because this one wasnt staged this doctor wasnt acting no mugging for the camera because he didnt know there was a camera she knelt before him the camera concentrated on his face real passion they were up on the table the camera concentrated on his face he was lost in her she in control the camera concentrated on his face hidden camera a documentary real peepthroughthewindow stuff i closed my eyes thought of something else the blond beauty working like a pro sharons twin but from another time his alfalfa hairdo and pencil mustache authentic contemporary when was this made i called back to gordon he said in a choked voice as if resenting the interruption the doctor was bucking and gritting his teeth the blond woman waved him like a flag winked at the camera blank screen sharons mother i said i cant prove it said gordon returning to the front of the room but with that resemblance shed have to be wouldnt she when i met pretty sharon she reminded me of someone i couldnt remember who hadnt seen this film in a long time years its quite rare a real collectors item we try to avoid exposing it to unnecessary wear and tear he stopped expectant we appreciate your showing it to us mr fontaine my pleasure when i saw kruses finished product i realized who shed reminded me of kruse must have realized it too we gave him full access to our entire collection and he spent a lot of time in the vault he discovered lindas film and set out to ape it mother and daughter an intriguing theme but he should have been truthful about it did sharon know about the first film that i cant tell you as i said i only met her once linda who said larry linda lanier she was an actress or at least wanted to be one of the pretty young things who flooded hollywood after the war still do i guess i believe she got a contract at one of the studios but she never actually worked wrong kind of talent said larry who knows she didnt stick around long enough for anyone to find out that particular studio was owned by leland belding she ended up being one of his party girls the basketcase billionaire i said the magna corporation youre both too young to remember said gordon but he was quite a guy in his day renaissance man aerospace armaments shipping mining and the movies he invented a camera that they still use today and a noshimmy girdle based on aircraft design i said by party girl you mean hooker no no more like hostesses he used to throw lots of parties owning the studio gave him easy access to beautiful girls and he hired them as hostesses the bluenoses tried to make a thing of it but they never could prove a thing what about the doctor he was a real doctor the film was real too the vérité is almost overwhelming isnt it this is the original print the only remaining one whered you get it he shook his head trade secret doctor suffice it to say ive had it for a long time and it cost me plenty i could make copies and recoup all my original investment plus but that would open the floodgates for multiple reproduction and dilute the historical value of the original and i refuse to bend my principles what was the name of the doctor i dont know a lie fanatic and voyeur that he was he wouldnt have rested before gleaning every last detail about his treasure i said the film was part of a blackmail ploy wasnt it the doctor was the victim ridiculous what else then he didnt know he was being filmed hollywood practical joke he said old errol flynn bored peepholes in the walls of his bathrooms used a hidden camera to film his lady friends on the commode tacky muttered larry gordons face darkened im sorry you feel that way dr daschoff it was all in the spirit of fun larry said nothing never mind said gordon walking to the door of the vault and holding it open im sure you gentlemen have to get back to your patients he ushered us through the black room and to the elevator what happened to linda lanier i asked who knows he said then he began to prattle about the relationship between cultural norms and erotica and continued the lecture until we left his house never saw him like that said larry when we were back on the sidewalk his belief systems under assault i said he likes to think of his hobby as something benign like stamp collecting but you dont use stamps to blackmail he shook his head it was weird enough watching sharon but the second one was something else really evil that poor guy humping away all the while hes making his cinematic debut another shake of the head blackmail shit this is getting curiouser and curiouser d to make things worse i got a call this morning from an old fraternity brother a guy brenda and i both knew in college also ended up a shrink behavior therapist had a huge practice out in phoenix screwed his secretary she gave him the clap he passed it on to his wife and she kicked him out started badmouthing him all around town destroyed the practice couple of days ago he walks into the house blows her brains out and then his own doesnt say much for our profession does it know how to take tests write a dissertation and you graduate send in your check renew your license no one checks for psychopathology maybe the psychoanalysts have the right idea i said making their candidates go through longterm analysis before being allowed to qualify come on d think of all the analysts youve met who are total weirdos and all of us had our training therapies someone can be therapized up the yingyang and still be a rotten human being who knows maybe were suspect from the beginning i just read this article study of psychologists and psychiatrists family histories a whole bunch of us had severely depressed mothers i read it too sure fits me he said how about you i nodded you see thats it as kids we had to take care of our mommies so we learned to be hyperadult then when we grow up we look for other depressives to take care of that in itself isnt bad if weve worked through all our personal shit but if we dont nah there aint no simple answer d let the buyer goddam beware i walked him to the station wagon larry could sharons film have had anything to do with kruses research doubt it what about the university forms gordon saw bogus he said and illogical even back then no university would put itself out on a limb like that kruse showed him some piece of bullshit gordon believed it because he wanted to besides kruse never bothered to use any forms for anything he and the department had a mutual apathy going they took the bread he brought in gave him a basement lab no one was using didnt want to know what he was up to compared to all the deception experiments the social psychologists were doing his stuff seemed benign he stopped looked troubled what the hell was he after filming her like that who knows the only thing i can think of is some sort of radical therapy working through the sins of the mothers he thought about that yeah maybe that kind of weirdness would be right up his alley total control of the patients life marathon sessions regression hypnosis break down the defenses if in the process she found out that her mom was a bimbo hed have her vulnerable what if she found out because kruse told her i said he had access to the fontaines film vault could have been looking through it and discovered linda laniers loop her resemblance to sharon was striking he put it together then he researched lanier learned some nasty details maybe even about blackmail sharon told me some bogus story about rich sophisticated parents looks like she was hiding from reality kruse could have shown her the film when she was under hypnosis used it to break her down completely put her completely under his control then he suggested a way she could work through the trauma by making a film of her own cathartic roleplaying fucking bastard he said then she was a smart girl d how could she fall for it smart but screwed up those borderline characteristics we talked about and you yourself told me how persuasive kruse was he had radical libbers believing whipping his wife was something noble those were women he knew casually he was sharons supervisor her training therapist and she stayed with him after she got her doctorate as his assistant i never really understood the relationship between them but i knew it was intense the film was made soon after she came to la which means he was monkeying with her head right from the beginning or maybe he said he knew her from before maybe therapy plus cum shots he looked grim our esteemed department heads a real prince do you think the university should be apprised of his methods a little fling at whistleblowing he worried his mustache brenda tells me the slander laws are pretty damned convoluted kruses got money he could keep us in court for years and no matter how it turned out wed be raked over in the process are you ready for something like that i dont know well im not let the university do its own damned detective work let the buyer beware he put his hand on the door handle looked peeved look d youre semiretired your own man got plenty of time to run around looking at dirty movies ive got five kids a wife in law school high blood pressure and a mortgage to match forgive me for not wanting to play crusader rabbit okay okay i said take it easy i try to believe me but reality keeps squeezing my nuts he got in the car if i do anything i said ill keep you out of it good idea he looked at his watch got to roll cant say its been a yuck a minute but it certainly has been different two films another link to a dead billionaire and one amateur movie producer masquerading as a healer i drove home determined to reach kruse before i left for san luis the next day determined the bastard was going to talk to me one way or the other i tried his offices again still no answer i was about to phone his university exchange when the phone rang hello dr delaware please speaking dr delaware this is dr leslie weingarden ive got a crisis on my hands that i thought you might be able to help me with she sounded tightly strung what kind of crisis dr weingarden related to our previous conversation she said id rather not discuss it over the phone could you see your way clear to come down to my office sometime this afternoon give me twenty minutes i

receptionist came around and let me in we passed several examining rooms stopped at a door marked private and knocked a second later it opened partially and leslie slipped out she was perfectly made up every hair in place but she looked haggard and frightened how many patients out there bea just a couple but ones a nagger tell them an emergency came up ill be with them soon as i can bea left leslie said lets get away from the door we moved down the hall she leaned against the wall blew out her breath knitted her hands wish i still smoked she said thanks for coming whats up dj rasmussen hes dead his girlfriends inside totally coming apart she walked in half an hour ago just as i got back from lunch and broke down in the waiting room i hustled her in here fast before the other patients arrived and ive been tied up with her ever since i gave her a shot of im valium ten milligrams that seemed to calm her down for a while but then she started falling apart again still want to help think you can do anything by talking to her how did he die carmen the girlfriend said hed been drinking heavily for the last few days more heavily than usual she was frightened he was going to get rough with her because that was his usual pattern but instead he got weepy deeply depressed started talking about what a bad person he was all the terrible things hed done she tried to talk to him but he just got lower kept drinking early this morning she woke up and found a thousand dollars in cash on his pillow along with some personal snapshots of the two of them and a note that said goodbye she jumped out of bed saw hed taken his guns out of the cabinet but couldnt find him then she heard his truck starting and ran out after him the truck was full of guns and hed already started drinking she could smell it on him she tried to stop him but he shoved her away and drove off she got in her car and followed him they live out in newhall apparently there are lots of canyons and winding roads there he was speeding and weaving going over ninety she couldnt keep up and missed a turn but she retraced stayed with him and saw him go over an embankment the truck rolled around landed at the bottom and exploded just like tv she said leslie chewed on a fingernail do the police know about this yes she called them they asked her a few questions took her statement and told her to go home according to her they didnt seem very concerned dj was known locally as a troublemaker history of driving under the influence she claims she heard one of them mutter fucking streets are safer now thats all i know can you help ill try we entered her private office small booklined furnished with a pine writing desk and two chairs decorated with cute posters plants souvenir mugs photo cubes in one of the chairs sat a chubby young woman with a poor complexion she wore a white blousy shift brown stretch pants and flat sandals her hair was long and black blondstreaked and disheveled her eyes redrimmed and puffy when she saw me she turned away and buried her face in her hands leslie said carmen this is dr delaware dr delaware carmen seeber i sat in the other chair hi carmen carmen dr delawares a psychologist you can talk to him and with that leslie left the room the young woman kept her face hidden didnt move or speak after a while i said dr weingarden told me about dj im very sorry she started to sob humped shoulders heaving is there anything i can do for you carmen anything you need more sobs i met dj once i said he seemed a very troubled person a rush of tears it must have been hard for you living with him all the drinking but even so you miss him terribly its hard to believe hes gone she began swaying clutching her face oh god she cried out oh god oh god help me oh god i patted her shoulder she shuddered but didnt move away we sat that way for a while she calling out for divine help me absorbing her grief feeding her small bites of empathy providing tissues and a cup of water telling her none of it was her fault that shed done the best she could no one could have done better that it was okay to feel okay to hurt finally she looked up wiped her nose and said youre a nice man thank you my papa was a nice man he ya know died im sorry he left a long time ago when i was in ya know kindergarten i came home with stuff we made for thanksgiving ya know paper

nice she said im okay you can go now what about dr small the therapist i want you to see i dunno just one time wan smile okay promise promise i took her hand held it for a moment then went to the front desk and told bea to watch her i used a phone in an empty examining room to call ada the operator at her service told me she was about to go into session its an emergency i said and was patched through alex said ada whats wrong ive got a young woman in crisis that id like you to see as soon as possible its not a choice referral ada shes on medical and is anything but insightful but when i

seeing someone makes sense wheres this therapists office brentwood san vicente near barrington i gave her the address and the time of the appointment perfect i live in santa monica ill be leaving the office around sixthirty ill take her there myself until then well babysit her a moments hesitation this person youre referring to is good the best ive seen her myself that bit of selfdisclosure had reassured carmen but it irritated her doctor california honesty she said then jesus im sorry youve really been nice coming here on no notice its just that ive become a total cynic i know its not healthy ive got to get myself to where i can trust people again its tough i said thinking of my own crumbling sense of trust she fiddled with an earring listen i really do want to thank you for coming down here tell me what your fee is and ill write a check right now forget it i said no i insist i like to pay as i go no way leslie i never expected to get paid youre sure i just want you to know im not into exploitation i never suspected you were she looked uncomfortable removed her stethoscope and passed it from hand to hand i know the first time you were here i sounded pretty mercenary just out for myself all i can say is thats really not me i did want to call those patients kept batting it back and forth in my mind i dont blame myself for rasmussens death he was a time bomb it was only a matter of when but it has made me realize i have to take responsibility start acting like a physician when i left you with carmen i went to the phone and started calling i got through to a couple of the women they sounded okay said their men are okay too which i hope is true actually it went better than i thought they were less hostile than the first time maybe i got through i dont know but at least i made contact ill try until i reach all of them let the darned chips fall where they may for what its worth youre doing the right thing its worth plenty she said with sudden intensity then she looked embarrassed and glanced at the door of one of the examining rooms well ive got to be going try to hang on to the patients i have thanks again hesitation she stood on tiptoes kissed me on the cheek caught by surprise i moved my head and our lips brushed that was stupid she said before i could tell her it hadnt been she went in to see her next patient it was close to five by the time i reached the university the psych building was emptying and only one secretary remained in the department office i headed straight for the faculty roster and thumbed through it without her commenting maybe it was the corduroy jacket kruse was already listed in the directory as chairman his office number was i took note of his home address same place in pacific palisades i ran up the four flights aware suddenly that my energy had returned for the first time in a long while i felt imbued with purpose righteous with anger nothing like an enemy to cleanse ones soul his office was at the end of a long white hall carved mahogany double doors had replaced the usual departmental plywood the floor in front of the doorway was tarped with sawdustcoated canvas from inside came the sound of sawing and banging the doors were unlocked i walked into an outer office and found workmen laying parquet tile and hammering in mahogany molding others on ladders painting the walls a rich glossy burgundy brass wall sconces instead of overhead fluorescence a leather armchair still wrapped in plastic the air smelled of scorched wood and glue and paint a transistor radio on the floor blared out country music one of the workmen saw me turned off his skillsaw and stepped down from his footstool he was in his late twenties mediumsized but burly with enormous shoulders a bandanna flowed out of the rear pocket of his filthy jeans and he wore a bentvisored baseball cap over black curly hair his black beard was whitened by dust as were his hairy popeye arms his utility belt was crammed with tools and rode low on narrow hips clanking as he swaggered over professor kruse he said in a high boyish voice no im looking for him damn arent we all you know where he can be reached tell him to get over here pronto some fixtures came in that dont match the specs i dont know if they changed their mind again or what but we cant go much further till someone clears it up and the boss is out of the office scoping another job i said whens the last time you saw him he pulled out the bandanna and wiped his face last week when we were laying out the plans doing the rough work and the bathroom we didnt come back till yesterday cause the materials werent in everyone was getting bent out of shape cause this was supposed to be a rush job now therere other problems they keep changing their minds about what they want whos they kruse and his wife she was supposed to meet us an hour ago and go over everything but she never showed theyre not answering their phone either the boss comes back from palm springs hes gonna be steamed but i dont know what the hell were supposed to do without the client showing up you dont work for the university us hell no chalmers interiors pasadena this is a custom job retile the bathroom coffered ceiling in the big office lots of wood antique furniture persian rugs fake fireplace with a marble mantel he rubbed his forefinger against his thumb big money whos paying they are the kruses cost plus by the hour youd think theyd show up youd think he stuffed the bandanna back in his pocket easy come easy go huh didnt know professors did so good you one too yes but not here crosstown better football team crosstown he said he removed his hat and scratched his head gave a broad smile you here spying for the other side i smiled back just looking for dr kruse well if you see him tell him to get in touch or tomorrow well be somewhere else only got a halfdays work for a twoman crew boss wont want to commit ill do that mr rodriguez gil rodriguez he picked up a piece of scrap wood from the floor and used a stubby pencil to scratch his name and number on it i freelance too dry wall painting plastering can fix anything that dont have a computer in it and if you got any football tickets you want to sell ill be happy to take them off your hands traffic on sunset was thick the stone canyon entry to bel air was barricaded by roadwork making things even worse and the sun was sinking over the palisades when i got to kruses house same time of day as the first time id been there but no teal sky this one was babyblue innocence melting to sea clouds after what rodriguez had told me id expected an empty driveway but three cars were parked in front of the house the customized white mercedes with the ppk phd plates id seen at the party a restored blue jaguar etype with ssk plates and an old toyota the color of splitpea soup i walked past them knocked on the front door waited knocked again louder then used the bell i could hear the chimes anyone inside had to hear them too but no one answered then i looked down and noticed the pile of mail on the front steps wet and warped saw the wroughtiron mail slot stuffed with magazines and correspondence i rang again looked around to one side was the semienclosed courtyard planted with perennials and climbing bougainvillea it ended in a roundtopped gate of weathered wooden planks i went to the gate pushed it it opened i stepped through and walked toward the back of the property along the south side of the house passed under a wooden arbor and found myself in a large backyard gentle roll of lawn borders of tall trees freeform flower beds rock pool with spa backed by a waterfall that fell in a glassy sheet i heard a click the yard was bathed in soft colorful light and the pool glowed sapphire timers no light shone from inside the house but a rosecolored bulb wired to a birch tree highlighted a patio with a shadecloth awning and a floor of mexican tile several groupings of stylish teak furniture suntan lotion on a table crumpled bath towels on some of the chairs looking as if theyd been there for a while i sniffed mildew then something stronger a swim interrupted one of the french doors was open wide enough for the stench to stream out wide enough to enter i put my handkerchief over my nose and mouth stuck my head in far enough to see a rosecolored nightmare using the handkerchief i fumbled for a light switch found one two bodies sprawled across a desert of berber carpet barely recognizable as human but for the clothing that covered what remained of their torsos i gagged looked away saw high beamed ceilings overstuffed furniture tasteful good decorator then back down again to the horror i stared at the carpet tried to lose myself in the damn thing good weave immaculate except for the blackening stains one of the bodies wore a pinkflowered maillot bathing suit the other a oncewhite pair of speedo shorts and a peacockblue hawaiian shirt patterned with red orchids the bright cloth stood out against glutinous brownish green flesh faces replaced by lumps of oily cratered meat meat thatched with hair blond hair on both the hair on the bikinied corpse lighter much longer tipped with brown crust i gagged again pressed the handkerchief over my mouth and nose held my breath felt myself strangling and backed away from the corpses outside again back onto the patio but even as i backed away my eye was drawn through the french doors to the end of the room up a flight of tiled stairs rear staircase curving iron bannister on the top stair another decaying heap pink housedress what looked like dark hair more putrefaction more black stain oozing down the steps like some malignant slinky toy i turned and ran past the pool across springy grass to a bed of nightlit flowers all unearthly blues and mauves bent low and smelled their perfume sweet too sweet my gut churned i tried to vomit but couldnt i ran along the side of the house back to the courtyard across the front lawn empty road silent road all that horror but no one to share it with i got back in the seville sat in the car smelling death tasting it finally though the stink remained with me i felt able to drive and headed south down mandeville then east on sunset wanting a time machine anything that could turn back the clock turn it way back but willing to settle for a strong cigar a telephone and a friendly voice i found a pharmacy and a phone booth in brentwood milo picked up on the first ring listened to what i had to say and said i knew there was a reason i came home early twenty minutes later he came driving up to mandeville and sunset and followed me back to the murder house stay right there he said and i waited in the seville drawing on a cheap panatela while he went around to the back a while later he reappeared wiping his forehead he got into the passenger seat took a cigar out of my shirt pocket and lit up he blew a few smoke rings then began taking my statement coolly professional after leading me through my discovery of the bodies he put down his pad and asked whyd you come up here alex i told him about the porn loops dj rasmussens fatal accident the resurfacing of leland beldings name kruses hand runs through most of it not much hand left he said bodies been there for a while he put the note pad away any working guesses about whodunit rasmussen was an explosive type i said killed his father for the last few days hed been talking about being a sinner doing something terrible this could have been it why would he snuff kruse i dont know maybe he blamed kruse for sharons death he was pathologically attached to her sexually involved milo thought for a while whatd you touch in there the light switch but i used a handkerchief what else the gate i think thats it think harder thats all i can think of lets retrace your steps when we were through he said go home alex thats it glance at his timex crime scene boys should be here any minute go on disappear before the party begins milo go on alex let me do the damned job i drove away still tasting decay through the bite of tobacco everything sharon had touched was turning to death ever the mindprober i found myself wondering what had made her that way what kind of early trauma then something hit me the way shed acted that terrible night id found her with the twin photo thrashing screaming collapsing and ending up in a fetal curl so similar to darren burkhalters behavior in my office the reactions to the horror in his life that id captured on videotape then played for a roomful of attorneys without noticing the connection early childhood trauma long ago shed explained it to me followed it up with a display of tender loving kindness looking back a wellstaged display another act it was the summer of a hotel in newport beach swarming with psychologist conventioneers a cocktail lounge overlooking the harbor tinted picture windows redflocked walls chairs on rollers dark and empty and smelling of last nights party id sat at the bar gazing out at the water watching daggersharp yachts etch the surface of a blownglass marina nursing a beer and eating a dry club sandwich while lending half an ear to the bartenders gripes he was a short potbellied hispanic with quick hands and a coppery indian face i watched him clean glasses like a machine worst ive ever seen without a doubt yessir now your salesmen insurance computers whatever your salesmen are serious drinkers your pilots too comforting thought i said yeah your salesmen and your pilots but you psycho guys forget it even the teachers we had last winter were better and they werent any great shakes look at this place dead twisting open a bottle of baby onions he drained the juice and poured the pearly balls into a tray how many of you guys at this shebang anyway few thousand few thousand he shook his head look at this place what is it you all too busy analyzing other people not allowed to have fun maybe i said reflecting on how dull the convention had been but conventions always were the only reason id attended this one was because id been asked to deliver a paper on childhood stress the paper having now been read the inevitable picayune questions fielded i was grabbing a bit of solitude before heading back to la and a night shift on the adolescent ward maybe you guys should study yourselves pal analyze why you dont like to have fun good idea i put some money down on the bar and said have one on me he stared at the bills sure thanks lighting a cigarette he poured himself a beer and leaned forward anyway im for live and let live someone dont want to have fun okay but at least come in and order something know what i mean hell dont drink itanalyze it but order and leave a tip leave something for the working man to the working man i said and raised my glass i put it down empty refill doc on the house ill take a coke figures one rum and coke coming up hold the rum hold the fun he put the drink on the bar and was about to say something else when the door to the lounge opened and let in lobby noise his eyes shifted to the back of the room and he said my my i looked over my shoulder and saw a woman in white longlegged shapely a cloud of black hair standing near the cigarette machine head moving from side to side as if scouting foreign territory familiar i turned to get a better look sharon definitely sharon in a tailored linen suit matching purse and shoes she saw me waved as if wed had an appointment alex all at once she was at my side soap and water fresh grass she sat down on the stool next to mine crossed her legs and pulled her skirt down over her knees the bartender winked at me drink maam sevenup please yes maam after he handed her the drink and moved down she said you look great alex i like the beard saves time in the morning well i think its handsome she sipped toyed with her stirrer i keep hearing good things about you alex early tenure all those publications ive read quite a few of your articles learned a lot from them glad to hear it silence i finally graduated she said last month congratulations doctor thanks it took me longer than i thought it would but i got involved in clinical work and didnt apply myself to writing the dissertation as diligently as i should have we sat in silence a few feet away the bartender was whistling la bamba and tinkering with the ice crusher its good to see you she said i didnt answer she touched my sleeve i stared at her fingers until she removed them i wanted to see you she said what about i wanted to explain theres no need to explain anything sharon ancient history not to me difference of opinion she moved closer said i know i blew it in a choked whisper believe me i know it but that doesnt change the fact that after all these years youre still with me good memories special memories positive energy selective perception i said no she inched closer touched my sleeve again we did have some wonderful times alex ill never let go of that i said nothing alex the way we it ended i was horrible you had to think i was psychotic what happened was psychotic if you only knew how many times ive wanted to call you to explain then why didnt you because im a coward i run away from things its my style you saw that the first time we met in practicum her shoulders drooped some things never change forget it like i said ancient history what we had was special alex and i allowed it to be destroyed her voice stayed soft but got tighter the bartender glanced over my expression sent his eyes back to his work allowed it i said that sounds pretty passive she recoiled as if id spit in her face all right she said i destroyed it i was crazy it was a crazy time in my life dont think i havent regretted it a thousand times she tugged at her earlobe her hands were smooth and white alex meeting you here today was no accident i never attend conventions had no intention of going to this one but when i got the brochure in the mail i happened to notice your name on the program and wanted suddenly to see you again i attended your lecture stood at the back of the room the way you spoke your humanity i thought i might have a chance a chance for what to be friends bury the hard feelings consider them buried mission accomplished she leaned forward so that our lips were almost touching clutched my shoulder whispered please alex dont be vindictive let me show you there were tears in her eyes show me what i said a different side of me something ive never shown anyone we walked to the front of the hotel waited for the parking valets separate cars she said smiling so you can escape any time you want the address she gave me was on the south side of glendale the down side of town filled with usedcar lots splintering bytheday rooming houses thrift shops and greasy spoons half a mile north on brand the glendale galleria was under construction a polished brick tribute to gentrification but down here boutique was still a french word she arrived before me was sitting in the little red alfa in front of a onestory brown stucco building the place had a jaillike quality narrow silvered windows bolted and barred the front door a slab of brushed steel no landscaping other than a single thirsty liquidambar tree which cast spindly shadows on the tarpaper roof she met me at the door thanked me for coming then pushed the buzzer in the center of the steel door several moments later it was opened by a stocky coalblack man with short hair and a corkscrew chin beard he wore a diamond stud in one ear a lightblue uniform jacket over a black tshirt and jeans when he saw sharon he flashed a goldjacketed smile afternoon dr ransom his voice was highpitched gentle afternoon elmo this is dr delaware a friend of mine pleased to meet you sir to sharon shes all prettied up and ready for you thats great elmo he stood aside and we entered a waiting room floored with oxblood linoleum and furnished with orange plastic chairs and green tables to one side was an office labeled reception and windowed with a square of yellowed lucite we walked past it and up to another steel door marked no entry elmo selected a key from a heavy ring and sprung the latch we stepped into brightness and pandemonium a long high room with steelshuttered windows and a fluorescent ceiling that radiated a cold flat imitation daylight the walls were covered with sheets of emeraldgreen vinyl the air was hot and rancid and everywhere movement a random ballet scores of bodies twitching rocking stumbling brutalized by nature and the luck of the draw limbs frozen or trapped in endless athetoid spasm slack drooling mouths hunched backs shattered spines nubbed and missing limbs contortions and grimaces born of ravaged chromosomes and derailed neural pathways and made all the more cruel by the fact that these patients were young teenagers and young adults whod never know the pleasures of youths false immortality some of them clutched walkers and measured their progress in millimeters others contracted stiff as plaster statues bucked and fought the confines of wheelchairs the saddest among them slumped flaccid as invertebrates in highsided wagons and metal carts that resembled oversized baby strollers we made our way past a sea of glazed eyes as inert as plastic buttons past witless faces gazing up from the leather sanctuary of protective headgear an audience of blank faces unperturbed by the merest flicker of consciousness a gallery of deformity a cruel display of all that could go wrong with the box that humans come in in a corner of the room a rabbiteared console tv blasted a game show at top volume the shrieks of contestants competing with the wordless jabber and inchoate howls of the patients the only ones watching were half a dozen bluejacketed attendants they ignored us as we passed but the patients noticed as if magnetized they swarmed toward sharon began flocking around her wheeling and hobbling soon we were surrounded the attendants didnt budge she reached into her purse took out a box of gumdrops and began distributing candy one box emptied another appeared then another she dispensed another kind of sweetness too kissing misshapen heads hugging stunted bodies calling patients by name telling them how good they looked they competed for her favors begged for gumdrops cried out in ecstasy touched her as if she were magic she looked happier than id ever seen her complete a storybook princess reigning over a kingdom of the misshapen finally gumdrops depleted she said thats all people gotta go grumbles whines a few more minutes of pats and squeezes a couple of the attendants came forward and began corralling the patients finally we managed to pull away resumption of chaos elmo said they sure love you sharon didnt seem to hear the three of us walked to the end of the big room up to a door marked inpatient unit and shielded by an iron accordion grille which elmo unlocked another key twist the door opened and closed behind us and all was quiet we walked through a corridor covered in the same lurid green vinyl passed a couple of empty wards reeking of illness and despair a door with a mesh glass window that afforded a view of several stout mexican women laboring in a steamy industrial kitchen another green hallway and finally a steel slab marked private on the other side a new ambience plush carpeting soft lighting papered walls perfumed air and music the beatles as interpreted by a somnolent string orchestra four rooms marked private four oak doors fitted with brass peepholes elmo unlocked one and said okay the room was beige and hung with french impressionist lithos more plush carpeting and soft lighting oak wainscotting and oak crown molding rimmed the ceiling good furniture an antique chiffonier a pair of sturdy oak chairs two generous arched windows barred and filled with opaque glass block but curtained with chintz pullbacks and lace vases of freshcut flowers strategically placed the place smelled like a meadow but i wasnt paying attention to decorator touches in the center of the room was a hospital bed covered by a pearly pink quilt which had been pulled to the neck of a darkhaired woman her skin was graywhite her eyes huge and deepblue the same color as sharons but filmed and immobile aimed straight up at the ceiling her hair was black and thick spread over a plump lacetrimmed pillow the face it framed was emaciated dustdry still as a plaster cast her mouth gaped a black hole studded with peg teeth faint movement nudged the quilt shallow breathing then nothing then reignition heralded by a squeezetoy squeak i studied her face less a face than a sketch of one anatomic scaffolding stripped of the adornment of flesh and somewhere amid the ruins resemblance a hint of sharon sharon was holding her cradling her kissing her face squeak a swivel table next to the bed held a pitcher and glasses a tortoiseshell comb and brush set with matching manicure tools lipstick tissues makeup nail polish sharon pointed to the pitcher elmo filled the glass with water and handed it to her then left sharon tipped the rim of the glass to the womans mouth some of the water dribbled down sharon wiped the pale flesh kissed it its so good to see you darling she said elmo says youre doing just fine the woman remained blank as eggshell sharon cooed to her and rocked her the covers slipped down revealing a limp wisp of a body wrapped in a pink flannel nightgown contracted pathetic too fragile to be viable but the breathing continued shirlee we have a visitor his name is dr alex delaware hes a nice man alex meet miss shirlee ransom my sister my twin my silent partner i just stood there she stroked the womans hair clinically shes deaf and blind minimal cortical functioning but i know she senses people has some subliminal awareness of her surroundings i can feel it she gives off small vibrations you have to be tuned in to them have to be actually making contact with her to feel them she took my hand put it on a cold dry brow turning to shirlee isnt that true darling you do know whats going on dont you youre fairly humming today say something to her alex hello shirlee nothing there said sharon shes humming she hadnt stopped smiling but there were tears in her eyes she let go of my hand spoke to her sister alex delaware darling the one ive told you about shirl so handsome isnt he handsome and good i waited as she talked to a woman who couldnt hear sang prattled on about fashion music recipes current events then she folded back the covers rolled up the pink nightgown exposing chickencarcass ribs stick legs spiky knees loose puttygray skin the remnants of a female form so pathetically wasted i had to look away sharon turned her sister gently searching for bed sores kneading and stroking and massaging flexing and unflexing arms and legs rotating the jaw examining behind the ears before covering her up again after tucking her back under the quilt and propping the pillow she gave shirlees hair a hundred strokes with the tortoiseshell brush wiped her face with a damp washcloth dusted the collapsed cheeks with makeup and blush i want her to be as ladylike as possible for her morale her feminine selfimage she lifted one limp hand inspected nails that were surprisingly long and healthy these are looking beautiful shirl turning to me hers are so healthy they grow faster than mine do alex isnt that funny later we sat in the alfa and sharon cried for a while then she started to speak in those same flat tones shed used years ago to tell me about her parents deaths we were born absolutely identical carbon copies of each other i mean no one could tell us apart she laughed sometimes we couldnt tell ourselves apart remembering the photograph of the two little girls i said one difference mirrorimage identical that seemed to jolt her yes that shes a lefty im a righty and our hair whirls go in opposite directions she looked away from me tapped the alfas wooden steering wheel strange phenomenon mirrorimage monozygotes from a scientific point of view biochemically it makes no sense at all given an identical genetic structure in two individuals there should be no differences at all right let alone reversal of the cerebral hemispheres she got a dreamy look in her eyes and closed them thank you so much for coming alex it really means a lot to me im glad she took my hand hers was shaking i said go on you were talking about how similar the two of you were carbon copies she said and inseparable we loved each other with a gut intensity lived for each other did everything together cried hysterically when anyone tried to separate us until finally no one tried we were more than sisters more than twins partners psychic partners sharing a consciousness as if each of us could only be whole in the presence of the other we had our own languages two of them a spoken one and one based on gestures and secret looks we never stopped communicating even in our sleep wed reach out and touch each other and we shared the same intuitions the same perceptions she stopped this probably sounds strange to you its hard to explain to someone whos never had a twin alex but believe me all those stories you hear about synchrony of sensation are true they were certainly true for us even now sometimes ill wake in the middle of the night with an ache in my belly or a cramp in my arm ill call elmo and find out shirlee had a rough night it doesnt sound strange ive heard it before thanks for saying that she kissed my cheek tugged her earlobe when we were little we had a wonderful life together mummy and daddy the big apartment on park avenue all those rooms and cupboards and walkin closets we loved to hide loved to hide from the world but our favorite place was the summer house in southampton the property had been in our family for generations acres of grass and sand a big old whiteshingled monstrosity with creaky floors wicker furniture that was coming apart dusty old hooked rugs a stone fireplace it sat on top of a bluff that overlooked the ocean and sloped down to the water in a couple of places nothing elegant just a few tortured old pines and tarry dunes the beach hooked around in a crescent shape all wide and wet and full of clam spouts there was a dock with rowboats moored to it it danced in the waves slapped against all that warped wood it scared us but in a nice way we loved to be scared shirl and me in autumn the sky was always this wonderful shade of gray with silveryyellow spots where the sun broke through and the beach was full of horseshoe crabs and hermit crabs and jellyfish and strings of seaweed that would wash up in huge tangles wed throw ourselves into the tangles wrap ourselves in it all slimy and pretend we were two little mermaid princesses in silken gowns and pearl necklaces she stopped bit her lip said off to the south side of the property was a swimming pool big rectangular blue tiles sea horses painted on the bottom mummy and daddy never really decided whether they wanted an indoor or outdoor pool so they compromised and built a pool house over it white lattice with a retractable roof and devil ivy running through the lattice we used it a lot during the summer getting all salty in the ocean then washing it off in fresh water daddy taught us to swim when we were two and we learned quickly took to it like little tadpoles he used to say another pause to catch her breath a long stretch of silence that made me wonder if shed finished when she spoke again her voice was weaker when summer was over no one paid much attention to the pool the caretakers didnt always clean it properly and the water would get all green with algae give off a stench shirl and i were forbidden to go there but that only made it more appealing the moment we were free wed run straight there peek through the lattice see all that gooky water and imagine it was a lagoon full of monsters hideous monsters who could rise from the muck and attack us at any moment we decided the smell was monsters filling the water with their excretions monster poop she smiled shook her head pretty repulsive huh but exactly the kind of fantasies children get into in order to master their fears right i nodded the only problem alex was that our monsters materialized she wiped her eyes stuck her head out the window and breathed deeply sorry she said its okay no its not i promised myself id maintain more deep breathing it was a cold day a gray saturday late autumn we were three years old wore matching wool dresses with thick knitted leggings and brandnew patentleather shoes that wed pleaded with mummy to let us wear on condition that we wouldnt scratch them on the sand it was our last weekend on the island until spring wed stayed longer than we should have the house had poor heating and the chill was seeping right up from the ocean that kind of sharp east coast chill that gets right into your bones and stays there the sky was so clogged with rain clouds it was almost black had that oldpenny smell a coastal sky gives off before a storm our driver had gone into town to fill the car with gas and have it tuned before the drive back to the city the rest of the help was busy closing up the house mummy and daddy were sitting in the sunroom wrapped in shawls having a last martini shirl and i were off gallivanting from room to room unpacking what had been packed unfastening what had been fastened giggling and teasing and just getting generally underfoot our mischief level was especially high because we knew we wouldnt be back for a while and were determined to squeeze every bit of fun out of the day finally the help and mummy had enough of us they bundled us in heavy coats and put galoshes over our new shoes and sent us with a nanny to collect shells we ran down to the beach but the tide was rising and it had washed away all the shells and the seaweed was too cold to play with the nanny started flirting with one of the gardeners we snuck away headed straight for the pool house the gate was closed but not locked the lock lay on the ground one of the caretakers had begun to drain and clean the pool there were brushes and nets and chemicals and clumps of algae all around the deck but he wasnt there hed forgotten to lock it we snuck in it was dark inside only squares of black sky coming in through the lattice the filthy water was being suctioned through a garden hose that ran out to a gravel sump about three quarters of it remained acidgreen and bubbling and stinking worse than it ever had sulfur gas mixed in with all the chemicals the caretaker had dumped in our eyes started burning we began to cough then broke out into laughter this was really monstrous we loved it we began pretending the monsters were rising from the gook started chasing each other around the pool shrieking and giggling making monster faces going faster and faster and working ourselves up into a frenzy a hypnotic state everything blurred we saw only each other the concrete decking was slippery from all the algae and the suds from the chemicals our galoshes were slick and we started skidding all over the place we loved that too pretended we were at an ice rink tried deliberately to skid we were having a great time lost in the moment focused on our inner selves as if we were one self round and round we went hooting and slipping and sliding then all at once i saw shirl take a big skid and keep skidding saw a terrible look come on her face as she threw up her arms for balance she called out for help i knew this was no game and ran to grab her but i fell on my butt and landed just as she let out a horrible scream and plunged feetfirst into the pool i got up saw her hand sticking out her fingers flexing unflexing threw myself at her couldnt reach her started crying and screaming for help i stumbled again went down on my butt again finally got to my feet and ran to the edge the hand was gone i screamed her name it brought the nanny how shed looked the surprise the terror as shed gone under stayed with me and i kept screaming as the nanny asked me where she was i couldnt answer id absorbed her become her i knew she was drowning could feel myself choking and suffocating taste the putrid water clogging my nose and my mouth and my lungs the nanny was shaking me slapping my face i was hyperventilating but somehow i managed to point to the pool then mummy was there and daddy some of the help the nanny jumped in mummy was screaming my baby oh my baby and biting her fingers they bled all over her clothes the nanny was thrashing around coming up gasping covered with muck daddy kicked off his shoes tore off his jacket and dove in a graceful dive a moment later he surfaced with shirlee in his arms she was limp all covered with filth pale and deadlooking daddy tried to give her artificial respiration mummy was still panting her fingers were running with blood the nanny was lying on the ground looking dead herself the maids were sobbing the caretakers were staring at me i thought they were blaming me i started to howl and claw at them someone said take her out and everything went black telling the story had made her break out in a sweat i gave her my handkerchief she took it without comment wiped herself said i woke up back on park avenue it was the next day someone must have sedated me they told me shirlee had died had been buried nothing more was ever said about her my life was changed empty but i dont want to talk about that even now i cant talk about that its enough to say i had to reconstruct myself learn to be a new person a partner without a partner i came to accept lived in my head away from the world eventually i stopped thinking about shirlee consciously stopped i went through the motions being a good girl getting good grades never raising my voice but i was empty missing something i decided to become a psychologist to learn why i moved out here met you started to really live then everything changed mummy and daddy dying i had to go back east to talk to their lawyer he was nice a handsome fatherly man i remembered him vaguely from parties he took me out to the russian tea room and told me about my trust fund the house talked a lot about new responsibilities but wouldnt come out and say what they were when i asked him what he meant he looked uneasy called for the check we left the restaurant took a walk down fifth avenue past all the fine shops that mummy had always loved we walked in silence for several blocks and then he told me about shirlee that shed never died had been comatose when daddy pulled her out of the pool remained that way damaged with minimal cerebral functioning all the time id thought her dead shed been living in an institution in connecticut mummy was a perfect lady very genteel but she wasnt strong couldnt cope with adversity the lawyer said he knew it had to come as a shock he was sorry id been lied to but mummy and daddy had felt it best now however they were gone and since i was next of kin shirlee was my legal responsibility not that that had to burden me he the law firm would assume her guardianship handle all the finances administer her trust fund so that her medical expenses would continue to be paid there was absolutely no need for me to disrupt my life he had papers for me to sign and it would all be taken care of i filled with an anger i didnt know i was capable of started yelling at him right there on fifth avenue demanding to see her he tried to talk me out of it said i should wait until the shock subsided but i insisted i had to see her right now he called for a limousine we drove to connecticut the place was big and nicelooking an old stone mansion wellkept lawns a big sun porch nurses in starched uniforms doctors with german accents but she needed more than that she needed her partner i told the lawyer shed be returning with me to california to have her ready for travel within a week he tried again to talk me out of it said hed seen this kind of thing before survivor guilt the more he talked the angrier i got the poor man and since id reached my majority he had no choice i returned to la feeling righteous with purpose no longer just another grad student caught up in the grind i was a woman with a mission but the moment i stepped into my dorm room the enormity of everything hit me i realized my life would never be the same never be normal i dealt with it by staying busy ordering the lawyer around moving into the house signing papers convincing myself alex that i was in control i found this place it doesnt look that great on the outside but they really treat her special elmo is fantastic totally oriented toward oneonone care she lifted my hand to her cheek then placed it in her lap and held it tight now you alex your entree to this mess the night you found me holding the snapshot was soon after shirlee had been flown out what a job just getting her off the plane and into a van i hadnt slept for days was wired and fatigued the photo had come in a box with other family papers it had been in mummys purse the day she died i started staring at it fell into it like alice down the hole i was trying to integrate everything remember the good days but so angry that id been deceived that my whole life had been a deceit every moment colored by lies i felt sick alex nauseous my stomach was heaving as if the photo was capturing me eating me up the way the pool had eaten shirlee i freaked out stayed freaked for days i was hanging by a thread when you came in i never heard you alex not until you were standing over me and you seemed angry judging me disapproving when you picked the picture up off the floor and examined it it was as if youd invaded me forced your way into my private pain i wanted the pain all to myself wanted something all to myself i just blew im so sorry i returned the pressure of her hand its all right the next couple of weeks were horrible just a nightmare i worried what id done to you and me but frankly i was too drained to do anything about it and guilty because i couldnt get myself to care more about it i had so much to deal with my rage at my parents for lying to me my grief at losing them my rage at shirlee for coming back so damaged for being unable to respond to my love at the time i didnt realize that she was vibrating trying to communicate with me so many changes all at once alex like a jumble of crisscrossing live wires burning into my brain i got help kruse despite what you think of him he helped me alex helped put me back together again and he told me youd come looking for me which let me know you cared i cared about you thats why i finally forced myself to get together with you even though paul said i wasnt ready and he was right i came on like a nympho because i was feeling worthless out of control felt i owed you something acting like a sexpot made me feel in charge as if i were stepping out of my personality and adopting a new one but just for a short while later while you slept i despised what id done despised you i dumped on you because you were there she looked away and because you were good i ruined what we had because i was unable to tolerate goodness alex i didnt feel i deserved goodness and after all these years i still regret that i sat there trying to take it all in she leaned over and kissed me gradually the kiss took on heat and depth and we were pressed against each other groping our tongues dancing then we both pulled away sharon yes i know she said not again how could you ever know youd be safe i she placed a finger over my lips no reason to explain alex ancient history i just wanted to show you that im not all bad i kept quiet didnt say what had passed through my mind that maybe we could start again slowly carefully now that both of us had grown up she said ill let you go now we drove away in separate cars back from kruses house i sat in my living room with the lights out and turned it over again and again park avenue southampton summers mummy and daddy martinis in the sunroom genteel cardboard cutouts but a nasty little scrap of celluloid said mummy had been anything but genteel a rich mans party girl whod made love on film probably used it for blackmail my whole life had been a deceit every moment colored by lies i thought about shirlee ransom vegetative squeaking wondered if any part of the story had been true if she loved her twin how could she kill herself abandon a helpless cripple unless shirlee was dead too s and s silent partners a pair of little girls beautiful blackhaired mountains in the background ice cream cones in opposite hands mirrorimage twins shes a lefty im a righty suddenly i realized what had bothered me about the porn loop the tipofthemind incongruity that stayed under my skin sharon was righthanded but in the film stroking kneading shed favored her left being a sexpot made me feel in charge as if i were stepping out of my personality and stepping into someone elses switching trying on a new identity the left hand sinestra sinister some primitive cultures considered it evil putting on a blond wig and becoming a bad girl a lefthanded sinister girl suddenly something about the drowning story bothered me something that hadnt troubled me six years ago when id wanted to believe her the details the vivid imagery too complex for a threeyearold too much for a toddler to remember practiced detail or a wellrehearsed lie had she been coached had her memory enhanced as in hypnosis as in paul kruse master hypnotist amateur filmmaker professional sleaze i was certain now that hed known enough to fill in lots of blanks had died with that knowledge horribly bloodily taking two other people with him i wanted more than ever to know why feeling infected the carrier of some dread disease i canceled my flight to san luis turned on the tv and created some electronic companionship the kruse murders were the lead item on the eleven oclock news complete with sweeping live minicam shots of the murder house and inset photos of paul and suzanne in better days the third victim was identified as lourdes escobar age twentytwo a native of el salvador whod worked as the kruses maid her picture portrayed an openfaced young woman with plaited black hair and dark melting eyes innocent victim pronounced the reporter lowering his voice and oozing irony shed fled the turmoil and poverty of her native land fueled by the dream of a better life only to encounter violent death amid the seductive luxury of the city of the angels that kind of philosophizing meant he didnt know much i switched back and forth between channels hungry for facts all three newscasts were identical in style and lack of substance reporters addressing the anchors instead of the audience wondering out loud if one of kruses patients had turned homicidal or if this was just another random la bloodletting i absorbed predictions of runs on gun shops starved attack dogs the reporter cupped one ear and said one moment were about to have a statement from the police the camera shifted to cyril trapp clearing his throat his shirt was tv blue his white hair gleamed like a steel helmet under the spotlights his mottled skin was the color of dirty sheets his mustache wriggled as he chewed his cheek establishing eye contact with the camera he read a prepared statement pledging that the full investigative resources of the los angeles police department would be marshaled to solve these vicious slayings a tight smile and head shake he said thats all im at liberty to divulge at this time and walked away the reporter said there you have it keith and kelly reporting live at the scene of i turned off the set wondered about trapps presence at the crime scene waited for milo to call and clue me in when he hadnt phoned by one i undressed and slipped beneath the covers drymouthed and so tense my palate ached i tried deep breathing but instead of relaxing worked myself into a state of wideeyed hyperawareness embracing the pillow like a lover i tried to fill my head with pleasant images none came finally some time before dawn i managed to sink into sleep the next morning i called milo at the station and was told he was still on vacation no one answered at his house i took in the morning paper unlike sharons death the kruse murders were being treated as serious news a headline shouting doctor and spouse slain bannered over the top half of page the byline was that of a staff writer named dale conrad a name i recognized because hed covered behavioral science stories in the past generally doing a slipshod job the kruse piece was no exception despite all those column inches conrad had come up with nothing about the murders that hadnt been covered on last nights broadcasts the bulk of the article was biographical information on kruse hed been sixty at the time of his death twice the age of his wife whom the article described only as a former actress his birthplace was new york city his origins moneyed hed been commissioned as an officer in korea attached to a psychological warfare unit received his doctorate from a university in south florida and aided by society connections and his advice column built up a lucrative palm beach practice before moving to california his recent appointment to head the department was noted and his predecessor professor milton frazier was quoted as being shocked by the senseless death of an esteemed colleague the death of lourdes escobar was a lastparagraph afterthought also found was the body of the housekeeper i put the paper down new york old money society connections reminiscent of the phony background sharon had created for herself had it been a total fabrication failed starlet mother or not shed lived like a rich girl the clothes the car the house perhaps linda lanier had married money the call girls fantasy come true or perhaps shed gotten it another way passing along to her daughter a choice chunk of hillside real estate once owned by a dead billionaire whod employed her still deeded to that billionaires corporation and put up on the market the day after sharon died too many questions my head was starting to hurt i dressed found a legal pad and a couple of pens and left the house walking down the glen i crossed sunset and entered the north end of the university campus it was eleventwenty when i passed through the doors of the research library i headed straight for the reference section played with the melvyl computerized index and found two books on leland belding in the librarys holdings the first was a volume entitled ten tycoons the second was the basketcase billionaire by seaman cross surprised because id thought all copies of the book had been recalled i jotted down the call numbers began looking for anything on lanier linda but found nothing i left the computer and did a little lowtech research two hours spent turning the pages of volume after volume of the periodicals index nothing on linda lanier here either but over a hundred articles on leland belding stretching from the midthirties to the midseventies i selected what i hoped was a representative dozen references then took the elevator up to the stacks and began seeking out the sources by twothirty i was ensconced in a reading cubicle on the fourth floor surrounded by stacks of bound magazines the earliest pieces on belding were in aerospaceindustry journals written while the tycoon was still in his early twenties in them leland belding was hailed as a technical and financial prodigy a master designer of aircraft and collateral equipment with three patents for every year of his life the same photograph was used in each a publicity shot credited to l belding industries the young inventor sitting in the cockpit of one of his planes goggled and helmeted his attention fixed upon the instrument panel a handsome man but coldlooking beldings enormous wealth precocity boyish good looks and shyness made him a natural media hero and the tone of the earliest popular magazine pieces was worshipful one article designated him the most eligible bachelor of another called him the closest america had come to producing a crown prince a prewar profile in colliers summed up his rise to fame hed been born to wealth in the only child of an heiress from newport rhode island and a texas oil wildcatter turned gentleman rancher another official corporate photo belding appeared frightened of the camera standing shirtsleeves rolled to the elbows a large lug wrench in one hand next to a gargantuan piece of castiron machinery by age thirty hed attained a monkish look high forehead sensitive mouth thick eyeglasses that couldnt hide the intensity of round dark eyes a modernday midas according to the article representing the best of american ingenuity combined with good oldfashioned hard work though born with a silver spoon in his mouth belding had never allowed it to tarnish hed favored twentyhour days and wasnt afraid of getting his hands dirty he had a photographic memory knew his hundreds of employees by name but didnt suffer fools gladly had no patience for the frivolity of the cocktail crowd his idyllic life as an only son had been cut cruelly short when both his parents perished in a car crash returning after a party to their rented villa on the spanish island of ibiza just south of majorca another layer i stopped reading tried to make some sense of that when i couldnt i resumed reading at the time of the accident belding had been nineteen a senior at stanford majoring in physics and engineering he dropped out of college returned to houston to run the family petroleum business and expanded immediately into the manufacture of oildrilling equipment using designs that hed developed as student projects a year later he diversified into heavy farm machinery took flying lessons proved to be a natural and qualified easily as a pilot he began devoting himself to airplane construction within five years he dominated the aerospace industry flooding the field with technical innovations in he consolidated his holdings as the magna corporation corporate press release had mr belding graduated stanford he would have received his degree magna cum laude and moved from texas to los angeles where he built corporate headquarters an aircraft assembly plant and a private airstrip on a acre tract in the suburb of el segundo rumors of a public stock offering made bulls and bears take note but the offering never materialized and wall street regretted that out loud calling lee belding a cowboy whod eventually bite off more than he could chew belding had no comment continued branching out to shipping railroads real estate construction he obtained the contract for a department of labor annex in washington dc built lowcost housing in kentucky an army base in nevada then bucked the mob and the unions in order to create the casbah the largest most ostentatious casino ever to blot out the las vegas sun by his thirtieth birthday hed increased his inheritance thirty times over was one of the five richest men in america and definitely its most secretive refusing interviews and shunning public events the press forgave him playing hard to get only made him better copy and gave them more latitude privacy the last luxury it wasnt until after world war ii that the honeymoon between america and leland belding began to sour as the nation buried its dead and working people faced an uncertain future leftleaning journalists began to point out that belding had used the war to become a billionaire while ensconced in his penthouse at magna headquarters subsequent snooping revealed that between and the assets of the magna corporation had quadrupled due to successful bidding for thousands of government defense contracts magna had been the armed forces prime supplier of bombers aircraft guidance systems antiaircraft weapons tanks and halftracks even kration kits and servicemens uniforms terms like robber baron profiteer and exploiter of the working man began to crop up in editorials commentators asserting that lee belding was all take no give a selfobsessed tightwad devoid of the slightest shred of patriotic spirit one writer pointed out that he never donated to charity hadnt given a penny to the war bond drive rumors of corruption soon followed intimations that all those contracts hadnt been won by putting in the lowest bid by early the intimations became accusations and took on enough substance for the us senate to pay heed a subcommittee was created charged with investigating the genesis of leland beldings war profits and dissecting the inner workings of the magna corporation belding ignored the furor turned his talents to movies bought a studio and invented a handheld motion picture camera that promised to revolutionize the industry in november of the senate subcommittee held public hearings i found a summary of the proceedings in a business magazine conservative point of view no pictures all small print and dry prose but not dry enough to camouflage the racy nature of the main accusation against belding that he was less captain of industry than highclass pimp committee investigators claimed belding had shifted the odds on contract bids by throwing wild parties for war board officials government purchasing agents legislators these bashes took place in several secluded hollywood hills houses purchased by the magna corporation expressly as party pads and featured stag movies flowing booze indulgence in marijuana reefers as well as nude dancing and swimming displays by legions of young women of loose morals these women described as professional party girls were aspiring actresses chosen by the man who ran beldings studio a former management consultant named william houck billy vidal the hearings went on for more than six months then gradually what had promised to be a juicy story began to shrivel the subcommittee proved unable to produce witnesses to the notorious parties other than beldings business competitors who testified from hearsay and crumpled in crossexamination and the billionaire himself refused subpoenas to testify on the grounds of endangering the national security and was backed up by the defense department billy vidal did show up in the company of highpriced legal talent he denied his major role was to procure women for leland belding described himself as a successful beverly hillsbased management consultant to the film industry prior to meeting belding and produced documents to prove it his friendship with the young tycoon had begun when the two of them were students at stanford and he admired lee belding but he denied involvement in anything illegal or immoral a legion of character witnesses backed him up vidal was dismissed when subpoenas for magnas accounting records were rejected by the company once again on the basis of national security and both defense and state backed up belding the committee reached an impasse and died the senators saved face by delivering a mild reprimand to leland belding noting his invaluable contributions to the national defense but suggesting he be more careful in the future with his record keeping then they assigned staffers to compile a report of their findings and voted the committee out of existence cynics suggested that in view of the charge that members of congress had been on beldings party list the entire process had been just another example of the foxes guarding the henhouse but by this time no one really cared now the country was ripe with optimism intent on rebuilding and determined to have a damned good decade if a few hearty rascals had indulged in a little high living so be it party pads a film connection stag films i wanted to know more about bashful beldings conduit to the fast life before i could return to the index section to look for anything on william houck vidal the announcement that the library was closing in fifteen minutes came blaring out of a ceiling speaker i collected my two books and as many unread periodicals as i could carry made a beeline for the photocopy machines and spent the next ten minutes feeding dimes then i went downstairs and used my faculty card to check out the books armed with my treasures i headed home a white vw rabbit was parked in front of my carport blocking the seville a young woman slouched against it reading a book when she saw me she sprang up hi dr delaware yes dr delaware im maura bannon from the times the dr ransom story i wondered if i could talk to you just for a minute she was tall and stickskinny about twenty with a long freckled face that needed finishing she wore yellow sweats and white running shoes her pageboy hairdo was dyed orange with pink overtones the same color as the lashes around her lightbrown eyes she had a marked overbite with a toothpickwide gap between the upper incisors the book in her hand was wambaughs echoes in the darkness and shed flagged it in several places with yellow tags her nails were gnawed stubby howd you find out where i live ms bannon we reporters have our ways she smiled it made her look around twelve when she saw i wasnt smiling back she said theres a file on you at the paper from a few years ago when you were involved in catching those child molesters privacy the last luxury i see at least ned biondi hadnt played fast and loose i could tell from reading the clippings on you that youre a dedicated person she said someone who doesnt like bullshit and bullshit is what theyre giving me who is my bosses everyone first they tell me to forget the ransom story now when i ask to cover the kruse murders they give it to that dweeb dale conrad i mean the guy never leaves his desk he has about as much drive as a sloth on quaaludes when i tried to reach mr biondi his secretary told me he was out of town off to argentina taking some spanish course then she handed me an assignment to follow up a trained horse story out in anaheim a mild warm breeze blew in from somewhere across the glen it ruffled the tags in her book interesting reading i said holding my own books in a way that obscured their titles fascinating i want to be a crime writer get into the core of good and evil so i need to immerse myself in lifeanddeath issues i figured id go with the best the man was a cop has a real solid experiential base and the people in this one were so weird outwardly respectable but totally crazed like the people in this case which case cases actually dr ransom dr kruse two psychologists dying in the same week two psychologists who were connected to each other if they were connected in life maybe in death too which means ransom may have been murdered dont you think how were they connected she made a naughtynaughty gesture come on dr delaware you know what im talking about ransom was one of kruses students more than that a prize student he was her doctoral committee chairman how do you know that sources cmon dr delaware stop being coy youre a graduate of the same program you knew her so chances are you knew him too right very thorough just doing the job now could you please talk to me im not giving up on this story i wondered how much she actually knew and what to do with her want some coffee i said do you have tea once inside the house she said camomile if youve got it and immediately began inspecting the decor nice very la thanks her gaze shifted to the pile of papers and unopened mail on the table and she sniffed i realized the place had taken on a stale unlivedin smell live alone she asked for the moment i went into the kitchen and stashed my research materials in a cupboard fixed her a cup of tea and myself a cup of instant coffee put all of it on a tray with cream and sugar and brought it into the living room she was halfsitting halflying on the sofa i sat down facing her actually i said i was off campus by the time dr kruse came to the university i graduated the year before two months before she said june of i found your dissertation too she flushed realized shed given away her sources and tried to recover by looking stern im still willing to bet you knew him have you read the ransom dissertation skimmed it what was it about she bobbed her tea bag watched the water in her cup darken why dont you answer some of my questions before i answer yours i thought of the way the kruses had looked in death lourdes escobar dj rasmussen bodies piling up bigmoney connections grease the skids ms bannon its not in your best interests to pursue this case she put the cup down whats that supposed to mean asking the wrong questions could be dangerous oh wow she said rolling her eyes i dont believe this sexist protectionism sexism has nothing to do with it how old are you thats not relevant but it is in terms of experience dr delaware she said standing if all youre going to do is patronize me im out of here i waited she sat for your information ive worked as a reporter for four years on your college paper she flushed deeper this time byebye freckles ill have you know the college beat had plenty of tough stories because of one of my investigations two bookstore clerks were fired for embezzling congratulations but were talking about a whole other level now it wouldnt do to have you sent home to boston in a box oh come on she said but there was fear in her eyes she masked it with indignation i guess i was wrong about you guess so she walked to the door stopped and said this is rotten but no matter primed for action all id done was whet her appetite i said you may be right about there being a connection between the deaths but at this point all ive got is guesses nothing worth discussing guesses youve been snooping yourself why thats personal were you in love with her i drank coffee no then whats so personal youre a very nosy young lady goes with the territory dr delaware and if its so dangerous how come its okay for you to snoop ive got police connections police connections thats a laugh the cops are the ones covering up i found out through my connection that theyve done a total watergate on ransom all the forensic records have disappeared its as if she never existed my connections different outside the mainstream honest that gay guy from the molester case that caught me by surprise she looked pleased with herself a minnow swimming happily among the barracudas i said maybe we can cooperate she gave me somethingintended to be a hard knowing smile ah backscratching time but why would i want to deal because without dealing youll get nowhere thats a promise ive uncovered some information youll never be able to get hold of stuff thats useless to you in its present form im going to follow it up youll have exclusive rights to whatever i come up withif going publics not hazardous to our health she looked outraged oh thats just great its okay for big strong brave to go hunting but squaw must stay in teepee take it or leave it maura i began clearing the cups this stinks she said i waved goodbye then go do your own thing see what you come up with youre boxing me in and pulling a power trip you want to be a crime writer im offering you a chance not a guarantee to get a crime story and live long enough to see it come to print your alternative is to barrel ahead like nancy drew in which case youll either end up being fired and sent home on a supersaver flight or shipped back in the baggage hold in the same physical state as the kruses and their maid the maid she said no one talks about her thats cause shes expendable maura no money no connections human garbage straight to the compost heap thats crude this is no teenage sleuth fantasy she tapped her foot chewed a thumbnail put it in writing she said put what in writing that we have a deal a contract i have first dibs on your info i thought you were a journalist not an attorney rule one cover your ass wrong maura rule one is never leave tracks i carried the tray into the kitchen the phone rang before i could get to it shed picked up the living room extension when i came back she was holding the phone and smiling she hung up whos she a woman i told her to hold on id get you she said forget it sounded angry cute smile jealous shrug sorry very classy maura is total lack of manners part of your job training sorry she said looking this time as if she meant it a woman i pointed to the door goodbye ms bannon listen that really was rude i am sorry i went to the door and held it open i said i was sorry pause okay forget about the contract i mean if i cant trust you a piece of paper would be worthless wouldnt it so ill trust you im touched i turned the doorknob im saying ill go along i said backscratching time okay okay what do you want in return three things first a promise to back off for how long until i tell you its safe unacceptable have a nice day maura shit what do you want before we go on lets be clear i said no dropins no eavesdropping no cute stuff i got it the first time whos your contact at the coroners the person who told you about the missing file she was shocked what makes you think he or she is at the coroners you mentioned forensic data dont assume too much from that she said struggling to look enigmatic anyway no way will i divulge my sources just make sure he or she cools it for personal safety fine promise yes was that two oneb two is tell me everything youve learned about the connection between ransom and kruse just what ive told you the dissertation he was her supervisor they had an office together in beverly hills thats it thats it i studied her long enough to decide i believed her she asked whats three what was the dissertation about i told you ive only skimmed it from what youve skimmed it was something on twins twins and multiple personalities and i think it was ego integrity she used a lot of jargon three is make me a photocopy no way im not your secretary fair enough return it where you found it probably the edpsych library at the university and ill make my own copy she threw up a hand oh what the hell ill drop off a xerox tomorrow no dropins i reminded her mail it express it i wrote down my fedex number and gave it to her she stuck it between the pages of the wambaugh book shit she said are you this authoritarian with your patients i said thats it were in business at least you are i havent gotten a damned thing but promises she scrunched up her face youd better come through for me dr delaware because one way or the other im going to get a story when i learn something reportable youll be the first person i call and one more thing she said half out the door im no damned teenager im twentyone as of yesterday happy birthday i said and many more after she drove off i called san luis obispo robin answered hi its me i said was that you a few minutes ago howd you ever guess the person who picked up said there was an angry woman on the other line the person some kid reporter whos bugging me about an interview kid as in twelve kid as in twentyone buckteeth freckles a lisp why do i believe you because im saintly its great to hear from you i wanted to call each time i hang up i regret the way the conversation turned out think of all the right things to say but its too late thats the way i feel too alex talking to you has been like walking a mine field as if were lethal ingredients cant mix without exploding i know i said but ive got to believe it doesnt have to be that way it wasnt always that way she said nothing come on robin it used to be good of course it did a lot was wonderful but there were always problems maybe they were all mine i kept it all inside im sorry blame is useless i want to make it better robin im willing to work at it silence then she said i went into daddys shop yesterday mom has it preserved just the way it was at the time he died not a tool out of place like a museum the joseph castagna memorial shes that way never lets go never deals with anything i locked myself in just sat there for hours smelling the varnish and the sawdust thinking of him then of you how similar the two of you are wellmeaning warm but dominant so strong you take over alex he would have liked you there would have been conflict two bulls scratching and snorting but eventually the two of you would have been able to laugh together she laughed herself then cried sitting there i realized that part of what attracted me to you was that similarity how much you were like daddy even physically the curly hair the blue eyes when he was younger he was handsome the same type of good looks as yours pretty profound insight huh sometimes its hard to see that kind of thing god knows ive missed plenty of obvious things guess so but i cant help feeling stupid i mean here ive been going on and on about independence and establishing my identity resentful of you for being strong and dominating and all along ive wanted to be taken care of wanted to be daddied god i miss him so much alex and i miss you too and its all meshing into one big hurt come back home i said we can work it out i want to but i dont im afraid everything will go back to being just like it was before well make it different she didnt answer a week ago i would have pushed now with ghosts tugging at my heels i said i want you back right now but youve got to do whats right for yourself take your time i really appreciate your saying that alex i love you love you too i heard a creak turned and saw milo he saluted and retreated hastily from the kitchen alex she said are you still there someone just walked in little miss buckteeth big mr sturgis give him my love and tell him to keep you out of trouble will do be well you too alex i mean it ill call soon bye bye he was in the library thumbing through my psych books pretending to be interested hello sergeant major league oops he said sorry but the goddamned door was open howmanytimeshaveitoldyouaboutthat he resembled an old sheepdog that had wet the rug suddenly all i wanted to do was alleviate his embarrassment no secret i said temporary separation shes up in san luis obispo well work it out anyway you probably figured it out right i had my suspicions youve been looking steppedon and you havent been talking about her the way you usually do thus spake the detective i walked over to my desk began straightening papers without purpose he said hope you guys work it out the two of you were good try to avoid the past tense i said sharply oops again mea culpa mia farrow he beat his breast but looked genuinely abashed i went up to him and patted his back forget it big guy lets talk about something more pleasant like murder i went digging today came up with some interesting stuff dr snoop he said adopting the same protective tone id used on maura the library milo not exactly combat duty with you anythings possible anyway you tell me yours ill tell you mine but not on a dry mouth we went back into the kitchen popped a couple of beers and opened a package of sesame breadsticks i told him about sharons fantasy childhood the east coast society background that resembled kruses the orphanhood that echoed leland beldings its as if shes collecting fragments of other peoples histories in order to build one of her own milo okay he said other than her being a stone liar what does that mean probably a serious identity problem wish fulfillment maybe her own childhood was filled with abuse or abandonment being a twin played a part in it too and the belding connection is more than coincidence i told him about the war board parties secluded hollywood hills houses milo the one on jalmia fits that bill her mother works the party pad circuit thirtyfive years later sharons living in a pad so what are you saying old basket case was her daddy it would sure explain the highlevel coverup but who knows the way she twisted the truth has me doubting everything copthinking he said i checked out a couple of books on belding including the basketcase billionaire maybe something in there will be useful the book was a scam alex sometimes scams are laced with a bit of truth he chewed a breadstick said maybe howd you find it anyway i thought the damn thing was recalled i asked the librarian about that apparently large libraries get advance copies the recall order only applied to bookstores and commercial distributors anyway its been buried there since very few checkouts rare show of good taste on the part of the reading public he said anything else i recounted my meeting with maura bannon i think i convinced her to back off but shes got a source at the coroners i know who it is youre kidding nope your telling me clears something up few days ago there was this thirdyear med student from sc rotating through the coroners office asking too many questions about recent suicides seemed to be snooping around the files my source told me about it he was worried it was someone from the city spying around is he still snooping nah rotations over kids outta there probably just a boyfriend angling for some whiteknight sex from lois lane junior anyway you did right to cool her off this whole thing keeps getting weirder and weirder and the fix is in heavy yesterday at the kruse place trapp shows up before the crime scene crew arrives all evil smiles wanting to know how i caught the call when im still officially on vacation i told him id come in early to the squad room was working at my desk clearing some paperwork when an anonymous call came through reporting foul play at the kruse address total crap wouldnt have fooled a rookie but trapp didnt pursue it just thanked me for my initiative and said hed take over from here milo growled cracked his knuckles asshole coopted me i saw him on the news wasnt that a display bullshit augmented by horseshit and more to follow word has it trapps pushing the sex maniac angle but those women werent positioned like any sex murder victims ive ever seen no spread legs or sexual posing no rearranged clothing and as far as my coroner source can tell given the state of the bodies no strangulation or mutilation how did they die beaten and shot no way to tell which came first hands tied behind the backs single bullet to the back of the head execution that would be my working guess he took his anger out on a breadstick crunching and wiping crumbs off his shirt then he finished his beer and went to get another one from the fridge what else i said he sat down tilted his head back and poured brew down his throat time of death putrefactions no exact science but for that much rot to go down in an airconditioned room even with the door open those bodies had to be lying there for a while there was gas bloat skin peel and fluid loss meaning days not hours four to ten days is my sources theoretical range but we know the kruses were alive last saturday at that party so that narrows it to four to six days meaning they could have been killed either after sharon died or before thats right and if it was before a certain scenario rears its ugly head confirming your theory about rasmussen i called the newhall sheriffs station about him they knew him well ugly drunk chronic troublemaker very short fuse multiple assault busts and he did kill his dad beat him to death then shot him now we know he was getting it on with ransom but not as an equal right he was a major maladjust probably had half her iq she was manipulating him playing with his head lets say she had some major beef against kruse and mentioned it to rasmussen she wouldnt even have had to be direct as in go and kill the bastard just hint around complain about how kruse had hurt her maybe use hypnosis you said she knew hypnosis right i nodded so she could have used it to soften rasmussen up angling for some whiteknight pussy of his own he went and played lord high executioner killing his father all over again i said ah you shrinks his smile faded the maid and the wife died because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time he stopped talking the silence put me somewhere else whats the matter seeing her as a murder contractor just a scenario he said if she was that cold whyd she kill herself he shrugged thought you might be able to fill in that one i cant she had problems but she was never cruel fucking all those patients wasnt an act of charity she was never overtly cruel people change i know that but i just cant see her as a killer milo it doesnt sit right then forget it he said its all theoretical bullshit anyway i can spin you ten like it in as many minutes and its about as far as were gonna go given the state of the evidence too many unanswerable questions like are there phone records tying rasmussen to ransom between the time the kruses died and the time she died newhall to hollywood is a toll call normally that would be easy to trace except when i tried the records had been pulled and sealed courtesy of my employers and who reported ransoms death in the first place normally if i wanted to know that id just take a peek in her file but there aint no goddam file courtesy my employers he got up rubbed his hand over his face and paced the kitchen i drove up to her house this morning wanted to talk to her neighbors see if any of them had made the call i even figured out who lived across the canyon and visited them to see if theyd seen anything heard anything maybe a peeper with a telescope zilch two of the four houses in herculdesac were unoccupied owners out of town the thirds owned by this freelance artist old gal who does childrens books shutin bad arthritis she wanted to help problem is from her place you cant see whats going on in ransoms just the driveway no good view from any of them matter of fact party pad architecture i said hmm he said anyway from her garden the artist could see some comings and goings occasional visitors women and men including rasmussen in and out after about an hours time patients thats what she assumed but all that stopped about half a year ago the same time she was caught sleeping with her patients maybe she decided to retire except for rasmussen she held on to him he kept coming not often but up until a month ago the artist remembered seeing the green truck she also described a guy who sounded like kruse he stayed longer several hours at a time but she only saw him once or twice which doesnt mean much she cant get around too well it might have been more often other interesting thing is that a photo of trapp didnt register which means he probably wasnt one of ransoms boyfriends and if the bastard was investigating the case he never bothered to talk to the nextdoor neighbor didnt even do the basics sum total slimeballs involved in the coverup and im off the case goddammit alex it makes my adrenals hurt there are other question marks i said your scenarios based on some kind of hostility between sharon and kruse she was having problems she told me so at the party but nothing indicates they were with kruse at the time of her death she was still registered as his assistant she showed up at a party to honor him milo i did see her arguing with that older guy i told you about but i have no idea who he is what else he said theres lots of other factors to consider belding linda lanier the blackmailed doctor whoever he is and shirlee the missing twin i called olivia brickerman tried to get into the medical files the computer was down im hoping for something soon whyre you still pushing that even if you find her you wont be able to talk to her maybe i can find someone who knows her knew both of them i dont believe well ever understand sharon without knowing more about shirlee about the relationship between the two of them sharon perceived shirlee as more than a sister they were psychological partners halves of a whole twins can develop identity problems sharon chose that topic or something like it for her doctoral dissertation ten to one she was writing about herself that gave him pause air your dirty laundry and get a phd thats considered kosher not at all but she managed to get around lots of things well he said you go ahead look for your twin just dont expect too much what about you i said ive got another day and a half left before trapp locks me into some new plum assignment seeing as were dealing with thirtyfiveyearold stuff there comes to mind someone who might be able to educate us someone who was around in those days problem is hes unpredictable and were not exactly good buddies he got up slapped his thigh what the hell ill give it a try call you tomorrow morning meantime keep reading those books and magazines uncle milo will be giving you a pop quiz when you least expect it i spent the rest of the day getting a masters degree in leland belding starting where id left off the demise of the senate hearings immediately following his reprimand the billionaire threw himself into the movie business renaming his studio magnafilm scripting directing and producing a string of combat sagas featuring rugged individualist heroes who bucked the establishment and emerged victorious all were panned by the critics as mechanical and bland audiences stayed away in he purchased a hollywood trade paper fired the film critic and installed his own yes man bought a string of movie houses and filled them with his product more losses in he went into deeper seclusion than ever and i found only one reference covering the next two years magnas patent application for an aluminumreinforced girdle that suppressed bulges but heightened jiggle the device developed for an actress with a tendency to corpulence was marketed as the magnacorsair american women didnt go for it in late he emerged suddenly a new man a public leland belding attending premieres and parties squiring starlets to ciros trocadero the mocambo producing a new string of films vapid comedies heavy with double entendre he moved from his monastic apartment at magna headquarters to an estate in bel air built himself the worlds most powerful private jet upholstered in leopard skin and paneled with antique walnut stripped from a centuriesold french chateau that he reduced to rubble he bought old masters by the truckload outbid the vatican for religious treasures plundered from palestine snapped up race horses jockeys trainers an entire racecourse a baseball team an entire passenger train which he converted to a moving party pad he acquired a fleet of custommade cars duesies cords packards and rollsroyces the worlds three largest diamonds auction houses full of antique furniture more casinos in vegas and reno an assortment of domiciles stretching from california to new york for the first time in his life he began contributing to charity hugely ostentatiously endowing hospitals and scientific research institutions on condition that they be named after him and staffed by him he threw lavish balls supporting the opera the ballet the symphony all the while he was assembling a harem actresses heiresses ballerinas beauty queens the most eligible bachelor had finally come into his own on the surface a radical personality shift but a vogue writer reporting on a bash belding threw for the metropolitan museum of art described the billionaire as standing on the sidelines unsmiling and fidgety observing the festivities rather than participating in them he looked to these admittedly cynical eyes like a little lost boy locked in a room full of candy so much candy that hes lost his appetite for sweets given all the partying i expected to find something about william houck vidal but there was nothing not even a snapshot to suggest that the former management consultant had participated in the metamorphosis of his boss the sole mention of vidal during the early fifties was a quote in a business journal regarding early development of a new fighter bomber a quote attributed to w houck vidal senior vicepresident and head of operations for magna one man going from businessman to playboy the other reversing the process it was as if belding and vidal were perched on a psychic teetertotter switching identities then in early all of it stopped belding canceled a gala for the cancer society dropped completely from sight then commenced what one magazine called the greatest rummage sale in history the mansions cars jewels and other trappings of princely consumption were sold at great profit even the movie studio nicknamed magnaflop earned millions in real estate appreciation the press wondered what beldings new phase would be but there was none and when it became clear that the disappearing act was permanent coverage grew progressively sketchier until by the midsixties neither belding nor magna was mentioned other than in financial and technical journals the sixties oswald ruby hoffman and rubin stokely and rap no shortage of actors willing to strip for the camera no one cared about a rich hermit whod once made bad movies in leland beldings death was reported somewhere in california following a prolonged illness in accordance with the bachelor billionaires will a group of former magna executives assumed leadership of magna with the chairman of the board position going to william houck vidal and that was it until when a former reporter and hack ghostwriter named seaman cross produced a book claiming to be the unauthorized biography of leland belding according to cross the billionaire had faked his death in order to achieve true peace now having meditated in solitude for seventeen years hed decided he had something to say to the world and had chosen cross as his pepys granting hundreds of hours of interviews for a proposed book before abruptly changing his mind and calling off the project cross went ahead and completed the book anyway titling it the basketcase billionaire and obtaining a strong sixfigure advance during its very brief life it had caused a furor not my kind of stuff i hadnt paid much attention to it at the time but i ate it up now didnt put it down until i finished crosss thesis was that a personal tragedy during the early fifties a tragedy belding refused to discuss but which cross guessed was romantic had plunged the young billionaire into a manic playboy phase followed by serious mental collapse and several years of convalescence in a private mental hospital the man who emerged was a phobic paranoid selfobsessed devotee of a bizarre personal philosophy combining eastern religion militant vegetarianism and ayn randish individualism taken to the extreme cross claimed numerous visits to beldings home a hermetically sealed geodesic dome somewhere out in the desert which the billionaire never left the mode of transport was dramatic cross was driven always blindfolded always in the middle of the night to a heliport less than an hour out of la the implication was el segundo then flown to the dome for about two hours and whisked home before dawn the dome was described as equipped with a computerized communications panel by which belding could monitor his international business interests regulate air and water purification systems developed by the magna corporation for nasa automatic vacuuming and ambient chemical disinfection and a convoluted network of pipes valves tubes and chutes through which mail messages sterile food and drink entered and waste material exited no one but belding was allowed inside the dome no photos or sketches were permitted cross had been forced to conduct his interviews from a booth on wheels positioned so that it abutted a speaker panel on the dome we communicated he wrote by a twoway microphone system that belding controlled when he wanted me to see him he afforded me a view through a clear plastic window a panel that he could blacken with the touch of a button he used this blackout panel not infrequently to punish me for asking the wrong question he would withhold his attention until i apologized and promised to be good bizarre as that was the strangest part of the story was crosss description of belding emaciated to nearauschwitzian dimensions fullbearded with long matted gray hair reaching halfway down his back tangles of crystal necklaces hanging from his wattled neck and huge crystal rings on every finger the nails of those fingers were polished a glossy black sharpened into points and appeared nearly two inches long the color of his skin was an eerie greenishwhite his eyes behind thick rosetinted lenses bulged exophthalmically and never ceased to move darting from side to side and blinking like those of a toad hunting flies but it was his voice that i found most unsettling flat mechanical completely stripped of emotion a voice devoid of humanity even now i shiver when i think of it crosss posture throughout the book was one of morbid fascination he couldnt conceal his antipathy toward the billionaire but neither could he tear himself away at regular intervals he wrote belding would interrupt our sessions to nibble on raw vegetables drink copious amounts of sterilized water then squat to urinate and defecate in full view of this writer into a brass pot that he kept atop an altarlike platform once the pot had sat on the altar for precisely fifteen minutes hed remove it and expel it through an evacuation chute during the process of excretion a selfsatisfied nearreligious expression would settle upon his gaunt raptorish features and though he refused to discuss this ritual my reflexive impression was selfworship the logical culmination of a lifetime of unbridled narcissism and power the latter half of the book was fairly dull stuff cross pontificating about the weakness of a society that could create a monster like belding transcripts of beldings ramblings on the meaning of life a barely intelligible amalgam of hinduism nihilism quantum physics and social darwinism including indictments of the mental and moral dwarfs who deify weakness the biography ended with a final burst of editorializing leland belding represents everything wrong with the capitalist system he is the grotesque result of the concentration of too much wealth and too much power in the hands of one eminently fallible and twisted man he is the emperor of selfindulgence a fanatical misanthrope who views other life forms as nothing more than potential sources of bacterial and viral infection he is preoccupied with his own body on a corpuscular level and would like nothing more than to live out his days on a planet denuded of all animal and plant life other than those organisms required to sustain what remains of the wretched life of one leland belding the basketcase billionaire had been a wellkept publishing industry secret catching even the magna corporation by surprise garnering massive postpublication attention and shooting immediately to the top of the nonfiction bestseller list a record paperback sale was made magna lost no time in suing cross and his publishers claiming the book was a hoax and libelous producing medical and legal documents proving leland belding had indeed died years before cross claimed to have spoken with him reporters were taken to a gravesite at company headquarters a body was exhumed and verified as beldings crosss publisher got nervous and asked the writer to produce his data cross reassured them and held a defiant news conference his editor at his side in front of a public storage vault in long beach california where hed stashed thirty cartons of notes many of them supposedly signed and dated by leland belding cameras whirring he unlocked the vault opened box after box only to find each stuffed with notes unrelated to belding frantic he continued searching produced old college essays tax returns stacks of bound newspapers shopping lists the detritus of a life soon to be ruined not a word on belding crosss horror was captured in closeup as he shrieked conspiracy but when a police investigation concluded that no one but the writer had entered the vault and his editor admitted shed never actually seen the alleged notes crosss credibility vanished his publishers faced with public humiliation and a legal adversary rich enough and tough enough to bankrupt them settled quickly they ran fullpage ads in major newspapers featuring apologies to the magna corporation and the memory of leland belding immediately ceased further publication and recalled all volumes shipped to stores and wholesalers refunded the record paperback advance to the softcover house the publishers then sued cross demanding return of his advance plus interest plus punitive damages cross refused hired attorneys countersued the publishing house filed a criminal complaint for fraud and misrepresentation in new york district court cross was arrested fought extradition and lost was shipped back east and imprisoned for five days at rikers island during that time he claimed to have been beaten and homosexually raped he tried to sell his account of the ordeal to several magazines but none was interested released on bail he was found one week later in a tenement room on ludlow street in new yorks lower east side head in the oven a note on the floor admitting the book had been fiction an audacious scam hed taken the risk believing magna would be too publicityshy to challenge him hadnt meant to harm anyone and was sorry for any pain hed caused more death i turned to the magazines looking for coverage of the hoax found a long feature in time complete with a picture of cross shackled in police custody next to that was a shot of william houck vidal the chairman of magna had been photographed walking down courtroom steps a wide smile on his face the fingers of one hand held in a victory v i knew that face big and square and deeply tanned narrow pale eyes a few blond hairs remaining in the brushcut hair a country club face the face fifteen years younger of the man id seen with sharon at the party the old sheik shed been trying to convince of something i reached milo the next morning and told him what id learned he said nothing for a moment then ive got us a history lesson lined up at eleven maybe we can tie up some more loose ends he arrived at ten after ten we got in the seville and he directed me east on sunset the boulevard was sundayempty even on the strip only a thin gathering of brunchers and featherheaded rockers hunched at sidewalk cafés mixing with coke whores call girls and call boys trying to shake off the night before wholesome said milo he pulled out a cigar said you got me started on these again lit up and blew soapylooking smoke out the window what is that panamanian transylvanian he puffed with enthusiasm within seconds the car was fogged we cruised past la brea past western no more café scene just fastfood stands pawnshops discount outlets and darker skin tones through the window came laughter and transistor music seasoned with bursts of spanish families strolled the boulevard parents young enough to be kids themselves marshaling broods of blackhaired cherubs now thats wholesome i said he nodded cream of the crop i mean it poor devils ransom everything they own to the goddam coyotes get raped robbed and ripped off trying to make it over the fence then we treat em like vermin and send em back as if the goddam country wasnt built on immigration hell if my forebears hadnt stowed away on a steamer and snuck in through canada id be digging potatoes somewhere out in county cork he thought about that seen postcards of county cork maybe better off we passed through the hospital row that stretched between edgemont and vermont rode past western peds where id spent so much of my

the exact amount ya know but she found ya know fortyfour hundred more in one of his ya know socks how long ago was recently couple of weeks ago at least one week before everyone started dying i kept driving past the silverlake district and echo park toward the western edge of downtown where skyscrapers rose out of a tangle of freeway loops and back streets glinting silver and bronze against a mudbottomed sky if it was cash for kill he said you know what that means premeditation someoned been planning that contract setting it up he told me to turn left on an unmarked alley that climbed north of sunset and tunneled between two buildingsupply lots we passed dumpsters stuffed to the rim graffitid rear walls piles of plywood discards damaged window screens and hackedup packing crates another quarter mile and we were weaving on cracked asphalt through weedchoked lots at the back of some of the lots were leanto shacks that looked ready to crumble the alley angled and turned to dirt fifty yards later it terminated at a cinderblock wall to the left more dead grass to the right of it a crowseye view of the freeway park said milo we got out even this high up the traffic roared from the interchange the block wall was topped by barbed wire cut into the block was a roundtopped wooden door scraped raw by time and the elements no lock no handle just a rusty metal spike imbedded in the wood looped around it was a leather thong hanging from the thong was an old corroded cowbell a tile sign over the door said rue de oscar wilde i looked up at the barbed wire said where are the gun turrets milo frowned picked up a rock and hit the cowbell it gave off a dull clunk all at once from the other side of the wall came a rising tide of animal sounds dogs cats lots of them and barnyard clatter poultry clucks goat bleats the animals got closer louder so loud that they almost blocked out the sound of the freeway the goats were the loudest they made me think of voodoo rites and the back of my neck tingled dont say i never took you anywhere interesting said milo the animals were scratching at the other side of the wall i could smell them milo called out hello nothing he repeated the greeting pounded the cowbell several times finally a whiny crackling voice of indeterminate gender said hold your frigging water whos there milo so what do you want me to do break open the frigging mouton rothschild opening the door would be a good start wouldnt it just but the door did push open an old man stood in the doorway wearing only a baggy pair of white boxer shorts a red silk scarf around his neck and a long pukashell necklace that rested on a hairless chest behind him an army of quadrupeds bounced and squealed and churned up the dust dozens of dogs of uncertain pedigree a couple of battlescarred tomcats and in the background chickens geese ducks sheep several black nubian goats which licked the dust and tried to chomp our cuffs cool it said milo swatting the old man said down quiet without enthusiasm he walked through the opening closed the door behind him he was midsized and very thin but flabby with stringy arms and knobby varicosed legs narrow sagging grandmothers breasts and a protuberant belly his skin had been sunbaked the color of bourbon and had an oily sheen the hair on his head was skimpy white fuzz as if hed coated his bare pate with glue then dipped it in cotton wool he had a weak chin big beak nose and narrowset eyes that squinted so tightly they appeared sealed shut a shaggy white fu manchu mustache ran down the sides of his mouth continuing past the jawline and dangling an inch he looked us over frowned spat on the ground gandhi with gastritis afternoon ellston said milo nice to see youre in your usual good cheer the sound of his voice set the dogs howling quiet youre upsetting them way you always do the old man came up to me and stared running his tongue along the inner wall of one cheek scratching his head he gave off a strange blend of odors childrens zoo french cologne mentholated unguent not bad he said finally but rick was cuter he touched my shoulder i stiffened involuntarily his stare hardened and he spat again milo stepped closer to me this is dr alex delaware hes a friend another doctor the old man shook his head and turned to me tell me one thing curly what the hell you upscale medico studs see in an ugly uncouth lump like him friend said milo as in friend hes straight ellston the old man raised a limp wrist adopted a mincing pose sure he is darling the old man looped his arm in mine what kind of doctor are you dr alex psychologist ooh he drew away quickly stuck out his tongue and made a raspberry i dont like your type always analyzing always judging ellston said milo you gave me enough shit over the phone i have no appetite for any more if you want to help fine if not thats fine too and well leave you to play farmer john such a rude lump said the old man to me hes a frigging rude lump full of anger because he still hasnt accepted what he is thinks he can deal with all of it by playing policeman milos eyes flashed the old mans opened wide in response the left iris was blue the right milky gray with cataract tsk tsk our poor gendarme is upset hit a nerve lump good the only time you look halfhuman is when youre pissed off when you get frigging real i dont like your type mimicked milo always analyzing always judging to me enough of this crap lets split suit yourself said the old man but there was worry in his voice a headstrong kid whod pushed his parents too far we headed back to the car every step we took made the dogs bark louder the old man cried out stupid lump no patience never had any milo ignored him just so happens lump that the subject of your inquiry is one with whom im well versed i actually met the rat bastard right said milo over his shoulder and you fucked jean harlow well maybe i did that too an instant later whats in it for me anyway the old man was raising his voice to be heard over the animals milo stopped shrugged turned good will ha plus a hundred for your time but forget it least you could have frigging done shouted the old man was to be civil i tried ellston i always try the old man was standing with his hands on his hips his boxer shorts flapped and his hair flew out like strands of cotton candy well you didnt try hard enough where was the introduction a proper civil introduction he shook one fist and his loose flesh danced milo growled and turned an introduction will make you happy dont be an ass sturgis i havent aimed for happy in a long long time but it might frigging placate me milo swore under his breath cmon he told me one more try we retraced our steps the old man looked away from us worked his jaws and tried hard to maintain dignity the boxer shorts interfered ellston said milo this is dr alex delaware alex meet mr ellston crotty incomplete huffed the old man detective ellston crotty the old man held out his hand detective first grade ellston j crotty junior los angeles police department central division retired we shook he thumped his chest youre looking at the ace of central vice dr curly a pleasure to make your frigging acquaintance the animals followed us as if heading for the ark a homemade pathway of railroad ties and cement squares bordered by unkempt hedges and sicklooking dwarf citrus trees took us to a small asphaltshingled house with a wide front porch littered with boxes and old machine parts next to the house an ancient dodge coupe sat on blocks the structure looked out on a flat halfacre of dirt yard fenced with chicken wire more goats and poultry paced the yard to the rear of the property was a ramshackle henhouse the barnyard smell had grown intense i looked around no neighbors only sky and trees we were atop a hill to the north were smogglazed hints of mountaintop i could still hear the freeway providing a bass line to the treble clucks of the chickens leaning against one of the fence posts was a bag of feed corn crotty stuck his hand in tossed a handful of grain into the yard and watched the birds scramble frigging greedy bastards he said then gave them some more old macdonalds farm on the edge of the urban jungle we climbed onto the porch this is all frigging illegal crotty said with pride breaks every frigging zoning law in the books but my compadres down the hill are all illegals living in noncode shacks love my fresh eggs and hate the authorities hell if theyre going to rat i pay their little kids to clean up the coop two bucks an hour more greenback than theyre ever gonna see otherwise they think im some kind of frigging great white father great white shark muttered milo whats that some of those little kids are pretty sharp well i

me food all wrapped in aluminum foil they love aluminum foil good stuff too no fastfood shit menudo and sweet tamales like you used to be able to get over on alvarado before the corporate frigs took over he pushed open a screen door walked into the house and let it slam shut milo caught it we entered the house was small and unlit crammed so full of junk there was barely room to walk we inched our way past stacks of old newspapers towers of cardboard boxes and rawwood fruit crates jumbles of clothing an upright piano painted with gray primer three ironing boards bearing a collection of clock radios in various stages of disassembly the furniture that managed to coexist with the clutter was cheap dark wood and overstuffed chairs sleeved with antimacassars and doilies thrift shop fare the floor was pine trodden gray splintered in several places by dry rot a mantel above the brickedin fireplace bore porcelain figurines most of them chipped or missing limbs the clock on the mantel wall said cocacola it was frozen at sevenfifteen sit said crotty he brushed newspapers off an easy chair and sank down a cloud of dust rose and settled like dew milo and i cleared a sofa with broken springs created our own dust storm crotty cleared his throat milo pulled out his wallet and handed him several bills the old man counted it fanned it out closed his fingers over it okay lets make this quick belding leland a capitalist pig too much money no morals a latent fag i said why do you say that and heard milo groan crotty turned on me because im a frigging expert on latency is why dr psychology you might have the diploma but ive got the experience he grinned and added handson experience lets stick to belding said milo crotty ignored him let me tell you curly one thing i know its latents for thirty years i frigging lived that trip milo yawned closed his eyes hes frigging bored said crotty if anyone should be listening its him hell youd think someone in his position would seek me out kneel at my feet and beg for my accumulated wisdom but no how do i meet the lump in the first place halfdead in the emergency room sweet rick massaging my heart bringing me back to life and

cut out for you shrink that is one big frigging piece of work sitting next to you take you years just to get through the top layer of denial belding said milo or give back the bread belding repeated crotty a capitalist vicious because he was a latent i know what that does to a person he got up looked over a group of boxes on the floor went down on his knees in front of one of them and pawed through it with both hands here we go said milo crotty pulled out a brown cloth scrapbook flipped pages wiped his forehead then sat down next to me and pointed there his fingertip rested next to a snapshot of a young man in police uniform blackandwhite sawtooth edges just like the one of sharon and shirlee the young man wore a police uniform stood next to a patrol car on a palmlined street his features were delicate almost girlish his eyes big and round innocent thick wavy dark hair parted in the middle a dimple on his right cheek a pretty boy the easily bruised countenance of a young monty clift glom this said crotty and pointed to another photo on the page same man in civilian attire standing next to the dodge id just seen in the driveway he wore sports clothes and had his arm around the waist of a girl she wore a halter and shorts was shapely her face had been scratched out with a ballpoint pen i was some piece of beef back then said crotty he yanked the book away snapped it shut

wonder why i was going home each night puking my own guts out and drinking gin until i could feel my liver sizzling he let go of my collar milo was looking the other way staring off into space i was eating myself up is why said crotty until i took a vacation down south tijuana crossed the border looking for action got stoned drunk in a cantina watching a donkey mount a woman stumbled outside and asked a cabbie to take me to a whorehouse but the cabbie wasnt fooled drove me to a crappy little place on the outskirts of town cardboard walls painted turquoise chickens outside the door and in twentyfour hours later i knew who i was knew i was trapped what i didnt know was how to get out of it he folded and unfolded the money finally crumpled it in his fist no guts for quick suicide i kept

through the network been seeing him saw him yesterday in fact and changed his frigging diapers milo cleared his throat crotty turned on him god forbid you should get involved with the network lump maybe reach out to help someone perish the thought you should admit to sizzling your liver cause you dont know who you are belding said milo taking out his note pad thats what were here to talk about ah said crotty disgustedly no one spoke for a while mr crotty i said why do you think belding was latent the old man coughed waved his hand ahh who the hell knows maybe he wasnt maybe im full of shit one thing i can tell you he was no stud despite how the papers played up his dating all those actresses i did meet him at a party he used to hire offduty cops for security and sometimes not so offduty the department was in to him in a big way kissing his rich ass until it sparkled be specific said milo yeah right okay one time must have been back in or i got pulled off a childmolesting case and assigned to one of his bashes out in bel air priorities eh big charity thing full orchestra all the best folks tooting and shuffling lots of female flesh plenty of cloakroom clinches but all stud belding did was watch everyone else thats what he was a watcher like some frigging camera on legs i remember thinking what a cold bastard he was repressing latent thats what you meant by meeting him yeah we shook frigging hands okay whyd you call him vicious i said i call killing vicious whod he kill asked milo crotty wiped his brow and coughed thousands of people lump all the ones his frigging planes bombed milo looked disgusted thanks for the political commentary anything more you want to tell us about belding i told you plenty how about his sidekick vidal billy the pimp he was at that party too very suave good teeth excellentlooking teeth anything else besides his dental health he was supposed to be the one who supplied belding with the girls what about the war board parties asked milo the ones belding got investigated for did the department do guard duty on those wouldnt surprise me like i said the department was in to him name names said milo pencil poised it was a frigging long time ago lump listen ellston i didnt pay a hundred to get stuff i can get in the locker room crotty smiled guy in your situation lump doesnt get anything in the locker room milo ran his hand over his face a knot swelled his jawline okay okay said crotty the two im sure were in beldings pocket were a couple of shits named hummel and degranzfeld working advice when i came on as head crackers soon after hummel was transferred out to be the chiefs chauffeur a year later he was a lieutenant out at newton division which was a hell of a match because he was a racist pig used to go down to main street and beat colored whores to a pulp wore pigskin gloves said he wanted to avoid infection how do you know he and the other guy were beldings boys it was obvious from the way they moved up fast without earning it they were connected and both of them always dressed good ate good degranzfeld had a big house out in alhambra horses orchard land you didnt have to be sherlock to see they were in somebodys pocket lots of pockets besides beldings let me frigging finish lump later both of them quit the force and went to work for belding at probably six times the salary all the graft they could eat first names said milo writing royal hummel victor degranzfeld sticky vicky we used to call him he was a twerp and a sneak too yellowbellied to get physical but just as sadistic as hummel when he worked vice he was head bagman coordinated collections from all the downtown bookies and pimps when hummel moved to newton he had degranzfeld transferred over there as daywatch commander bosom buddies probably a couple of latents themselves later both of them were picked to head metro narcotics this was in the early fifties there was a big dope panic and the department knew it could get funding increases by making big busts all right said milo lets talk about the houses belding owned the party pads know where any of them were located crotty laughed party pads isnt that sweet whered you come up with that lump party pads they were fuck pads everyone called em that cause thats what mr leland belding used em for brought bigwigs there had a stable of bimboes all set to clean their pipes until they were ready to sign on any frigging dotted line and no i dont know any locations never got invited to those soirees he got up sidestepped a wall of boxes and went through a doorway into what i assumed was the kitchen milo said sorry you had to hear his life story its okay it was interesting not after the thousandth time you badmouthing me crotty had come out of the kitchen was glaring at us a glass of water in one hand the other balled up in a fist no said milo just admiring the decor hah the old man opened his free hand revealing a palmful of pills vitamins he said and swallowed some of them he washed them down grimaced swallowed some more and rubbed his abdomen im getting tired get the hell out of here and let me get some rest tabs not run yet said milo make it snappy got a couple more names for you actress named linda lanier rumored to be one of beldings bimboes and some doctor she screwed on a stag film give him the physical description alex as i did crotty lost color and put the glass down on a crate wiped his forehead seemed to lose balance and rested his hands on the back of a motheaten settee he puffed out his cheeks milo said lets have it ellston whyre you poking around in the deadletter pile lump milo shook his head you know the rules sure sure come here and squeeze me then throw me a few crumbs a hundred buys a lot of squeeze said milo but he pulled out his wallet and gave the old man more money crotty looked surprised he stared at the bills linda lanier said milo and the doctor in the film in reference to belding asked crotty in reference to anything spit it out ellston then well leave you to dream of your swede you should know such dreams said crotty he looked at the floor rubbed his mustache crossed his legs linda lanier well well well everything comes around in a circle doesnt it like my little blond banker and everything else in this frigging world he straightened stood made his way to the gray piano sat down and picked off a couple of notes the instrument was badly out of tune he extracted a dissonant boogiewoogie with his left hand random high notes with his right then as abruptly as hed begun he stopped and said this is terribly weird lump if i didnt know better id start using words like destiny not that id want you in my destiny he played several bars of slow blues let his hands fall to his sides lanier and the doctor you say they did it on film milo nodded and pointed to me he saw it she was beautiful wasnt she i said yes she was cmon said milo spit it out crotty gave a weak smile i fibbed lump when you asked me about belding being a killer i fudged with that political shit because i didnt know what alley cat you were chasing actually i meant it literally but i didnt want to get into it nothing i could ever prove you dont have to prove a goddam thing said milo just tell me what you know he peeled off more bills crotty snatched them your doctor he said sounds exactly like a guy named neurath donald neurath md you described him to a t curly and i know he and linda lanier had a thing going how do you know that said milo crotty looked illatease cmon ellston okay okay one of my assignments when i wasnt snaring faggots was working the scraper club detail illegal abortions back in those days there were three ways for a girl in trouble to go coat hanger in the alley some butcher in a white coat or a bona fide medico moonlighting for big bucks neurath was one of the bona fides plenty of doctors did it but it was still a class a felony meaning excellent payoff potential for the department there was an approved group of abortionists we used to call it the scraper club maybe twenty or so doctors spread all over the city respectable guys with established practices they kicked back a percentage of their fees in return for protection by vice and a guarantee that anyone not in the club would get busted hard and fast and it worked there was this one guy osteopath out in the valley tried to muscle in on one of the approved guys business by charging half as much for a scrape a week after he started they busted him using a female cop who just happened to be pregnant bail denied stuck in a county cell with hardcases while he was in lockup his office got torched and someone scared his daughter while she was walking home from school pretty said milo thats the way it was back then lump are you sure its that much better now youre positive this neurath was a member of the club i know it for a fact because i picked up moolah from his office big fancy suite on wilshire near western he stopped stared at milo thats right i played bagman too not my favorite frigging assignment but i had enough on my mind without worrying about some pennyante payoff for something that was gonna happen anyway hell today a kid can walk into a clinic and leave scraped halfhour later so whats the big deal right milo said keep talking crotty gave him a sour look we conducted our business after hours no one around id ride the elevator up to his office make sure i was alone give a coded knock on the door once i was in neither of us would talk pretending it wasnt happening hed hand me a manila envelope id do a superficial count and be off what kind of doctor was he obstetrician nice little irony there eh neurath giveth neurath taketh away what about him and lanier one evening after i picked up the loot i went down the block to this chinese place to have a little moogoo and rice wine before heading back i was sitting in a back booth when in walks neurath with this platinumblond dish it was dark they didnt notice me she had her arm in his they were looking pretty cozy they took a table across the room sat close together talking pretty intense the old pieceontheside routine except this dish was really elegantlooking no tramp few minutes later she got up to go to the ladies room and i got a good look at her face it was then that i recognized her from beldings party shed been wearing a black dress no back very little front lots of mink trim because of the mink id figured her for a rich brat shed stuck in my mind because she was gorgeous really gorgeous perfect face delicious body but elegant classy he shifted his glance to me im not without feeling for females dr psychology probably appreciate the species a lot more than most hetero studs what else said milo nothing else they had a couple of drinks coochycooed then left no doubt for some motel no big deal then about a year later the dishs face is all over the papers and the more i learn about it the more curious i get he coughed again scratched his midriff there was this dope bust lots of shooting she got killed along with some guy who turned out to be her brother the papers made both of them out to be bigtime pushers she was a contract player with beldings studio never made a single film and supposedly that was strong evidence it was just a cover no matter that most of the players never worked and shed been a party girl not a word of that in print the brother worked at the studio too as a grip both of them small potatoes yet they managed to pay the rent on this very ritzy pad on fountain ten rooms owned a fancy car were living frigging high papers made a big deal about that going into detail about her furs and jewelry about how the two of them had come a long way for a couple of texas crackerscause thats what they were her real name was eulalee johnson the brother was a nasty little punk named cable used to strongarm smalltime bookies lean on streetwalkers but never got too far smalltime all the way not exactly your bigtime pushers huh lump but the department fed it to the papers and the papers ate it like candy three hundred grand worth of h found on the premises hell of a lot in those days john q public bought it you didnt hell no no one pushing that much smack south of fresno was doing it without mob connections cohen or dragna certainly not a couple of texas crackers whod come out of nowhere i checked the brothers sheet drunk and disorderly lewd conduct larceny the strongarm stuff penny ante no connections with anyone no one on the street had ever seen him with a reefer in his pocket the whole thing smelled bad and the fact that hummel and degranzfeld did the shooting made it stink to high heaven why were you checking ellston crotty smiled always searching for leverage lump but this was too scary i didnt want to touch it still it stuck in my craw now here you are stirring it up again aint that sweet howd it go down asked milo supposedly someone phonetipped metro narc to a huge stash in the fountain pad hummel and degranzfeld took the call brought a couple of blackandwhites along for backup but had the uniforms wait outside while they checked out the premises alls quiet on the western front then bang bang bang the uniforms rush in both johnsons are shot to pieces on the living room floor hummel and de granzfeld are tallying up this giant dope stash departments version is they knocked on the door were met with unfriendly fire smashed the door down and jumped in guns ablazin cute eh a party girl and a smalltime drifter taking on narco bulls any board of inquiry into the shooting said milo very funny lump even with a woman getting shot john qs usually squeamish about that this was mccarthy fever height of the dope panic john q was paranoid about pushers in every schoolyard and the department made lanier out to be a bigtime bad girl satans frigging bride not only werent hummel and sticky vicky investigated they were instant heroes the mayor pinned ribbons on them this was just before leland belding had turned into a playboy the year of sharon and shirlees birth did linda lanier leave any children i asked no said crotty id remember that that kind of thing would have made it into the papers human interest and all that why you got family members out for revenge revenge against who asked milo belding that phony bust had his name written all over it why do you say that hummel and degranzfeld were his boys lanier was his party girl supporting that place on fountain woulda been like you and me springing for lunch in the process of asking around i learned lanier might have been more than just a party girl shed been known to enter beldings private office on the studio lot stay in for a couple of hours leave happy this is stuff office boys knew but it never got a line of print i figure they had something or other going she offended belding in some serious way and he had to get rid of her offended how said milo who knows maybe she got pushy about something maybe her stupid brother put the arm on the wrong guy the doctor neurath could have been her sugar daddy said milo crotty shook his head neurath had money problems his wife was a compulsive gambler he was into the sharks on and off its why he started moonlighting in the first place and one more thing laniers building on fountain was owned by belding milo and i looked at each other crotty said bastard owned half of la at one time neurath was an obstetrician i said maybe linda lanier was seeing him professionally pregnant said crotty putting the paternal squeeze on belding sure why not milo said how soon after the shooting did hummel and dewhatsisname quit not long after maybe a couple of months and this with both of them commended and promoted now tell me more about the film lanier and neurath were on doctor and nurse skit i said the doctor didnt know he was on camera more strongarm said milo the brother could be said crotty what would they be strongarming neurath about who knows maybe the scraper club maybe the wifes gambling problem either could have screwed up his reputation he had a society practice nice plump hancock park matrons waiting for stirrup time is he still around who knows what about hummel and degranzfeld degranzfeld died a couple of years after moving to nevada affair with a married woman husband had a temper far as i know hummels still in vegas one thing for sure hes still got pull in the department or at least he did a couple of years ago how so said milo he had this nephew real fascist fuckup liked the booze almost flunked out of the academy the bullying son of a bitch frigging chip off the old block he was involved in that hollywood division robbery scandal a few years back eminently qualified for a board of rights or worse but nothing except a transfer to ramparts then all of a sudden guys a bornagain christian promoted to captain west la he stopped stared at milo grinned like a kid on christmas morning so thats what this is about what said milo innocently lump you crafty badger gonna get that scum arent you finally do a good deed after all after that crotty got solicitous offering us coffee and cake but we thanked him and declined left him standing in the doorway under the cowbell surrounded by his animals feisty old guy i said when we were back in the car bluster said milo hes been pouring it on since he tested positive oh yeah those pills werent vitamins theyre some kind of immune strengthening regimen he got through his network he beat hepatitis a few years back thinks if hes mean enough hell beat this too pause thats why i humored him it took a while to turn the seville around in the alley when wed gone a couple of miles on sunset milo said trapp paying off old debts to his uncle a moment later got to find out what hes fixing maybe a murder made to look like suicide you keep coming back to that and wouldnt it be nice but wheres the evidence belding and magna were old hands at camouflaging murder beldings dead magna lives on what some corporate conspiracy the old chromeandglass bogeyman no i said its always people it always comes down to people several blocks later he said the kruse killings werent made to look like anything but murder hard to do that with three bodies so trapps using the sex murder thing instead and maybe killing kruse wasnt part of the plan if rasmussen did it the way we theorized milos face got hard we passed vine hollywood was finally getting out of bed the cinerama dome was showing a spielberg movie and the lines stretched around the block a few blocks farther it was all bythehour motels and jumpylooking streetwalkers banking on loneliness and clean blood milo stared at them turned away leaned back against the seat and said i could use a drink early for me i didnt say i wanted one i said i could use one descriptive statement oh when we stopped for a red light at la cienega he said what do you think of crottys theory lanier and her brother squeezing belding and neurath the loop sure seemed to be setting neurath up the loop he said whered those porn freaks say they got it they didnt just said it was expensive ill bet he said then lets take a side trip see if we can get them to be a little more forthcoming i drove to beverly hills and turned left at crescent the streets were empty people who tear down million houses in order to build million houses tend to stay inside to play with their toys we pulled up in front of the fontaines green monstrosity and got out of the car the windows were shuttered empty driveway no answer to milos ring he tried again waited several minutes before heading back toward the car i said last time there were four cars here theyre not just out to brunch before he could answer a rattling noise from the neighboring house drew our attention a heavyset darkhaired boy of around eleven was riding his skateboard up and down the driveway dodging between a trio of mercedes milo waved at him the boy stopped turned off his walkman and stared at us milo flashed his gold badge and the kid gave his board a kick and skated our way he turned a handle on the front gate rolled through and sped over hi said milo the boy peered at the badge beverly hills cop he said with a thick accent yo dude he had a black spiky hairdo and a buttery round face his teeth were banded with plastic braces a bit of black down clouded his cheeks he wore a red nylon tank top emblazoned with the legend surf or die and redflowered shorts that reached below his knees his

laurens i said and for the first time in a long time we laughed but it faded quickly and by the time we reached home both of us were morose fucking case said milo too many dead people too long ago vidals still alive i said looking damned robust in fact vidal said milo grunting what did crotty call him billy the pimp from that to chairman of the board steep climb sharp spikes would lend traction i said along with a few heads to step on my plan monday morning was to return to the library and search for more on billy vidal and the linda lanier dope bust but the fedex man came to the door at bearing a single parcel inside was a dictionarysize book bound in darkgreen leather a note rubberbanded to the cover said here i kept my side of it hope you do ditto mb i took the book into the library read the title page the silent partner identity crisis and ego dysfunction in a case of multiple personality masquerading as pseudotwinship clinical and research ramifications by sharon jean ransom a dissertation presented to the faculty of the graduate school in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree doctor of philosophy psychology june i turned to the dedication page to shirlee and jasper who have meant more to me than they could ever imagine and to paul who has guided me adroitly from darkness to light jasper friend lover another victim in the acknowledgments section sharon reiterated her thanks to kruse following it with cursory appreciation for the other members of her committee professors sandra j romansky and milton f frazier id never heard of romansky supposed she could have come to the department after id left i pulled out my american psychological association directory and found her listed as a consultant in public health at a hospital in american samoa her bio cited a oneyear visiting lectureship at the university during the academic year her appointment had been in womens studies out of the anthropology department in june of shed been a brand new phd twentysix years old two years younger than sharon the outside member permitted on each committee usually chosen by the candidate for easygoing personality and lack of deep knowledge in the field of research i could try to trace her but the directory was three years out of date and there was no guarantee she hadnt moved on besides there was a better source of information closer to home hard to believe the ratman had agreed to sit on the committee a hardnosed experimentalist frazier had always despised anything vaguely patientoriented and regarded clinical psychology as the soft underbelly of behavioral science hed been department chairman during my student days and i recalled how hed pushed for the rat rule requiring all graduate students to conduct a full year of animal research before advancing to candidacy for the phd the faculty had voted that down but a requirement that all doctoral research feature experimentation control groups manipulation of variables had passed case studies were absolutely forbidden yet that was exactly what this study sounded like my eye dropped to the last line on the page and deep thanks to alex who even in his absence continues to inspire me i turned the page so hard it nearly tore began reading the document that had earned sharon the right to call herself doctor the first chapter was very slow going an excruciatingly complete review of the literature on identity development and the psychology of twins flooded with footnotes references and the jargon maura bannon had mentioned my guess was that the student reporter hadnt gotten past it chapter two described the psychotherapy of a patient sharon called j a young woman whom shed treated for seven years and whose unique pathology and ideative processes possess structural and functional as well as interactive characteristics that traverse numerous diagnostic boundaries heretofore believed to be orthogonal and manifest significant heuristic and pedagogic value for the study of identity development the blurring of ego boundaries and the use of hypnotic and hypnagogic regressive techniques in the treatment of idiopathic personality disorders in other words js problems were so unusual they could teach therapists about the way the mind worked j was described as a young woman in her late twenties from an upperclass background educated and intelligent shed come to california to pursue a career in an unspecified profession and presented herself to sharon for treatment because of low selfesteem depression insomnia and feelings of hollowness but most disturbing of all were what j called her lost hours for some time shed awakened as if from a long sleep to find herself alone in strange places wandering the streets pulled to the side of a road in her car lying in bed in a cheap hotel room or sitting at the counter of a dingy coffee shop ticket stubs and auto rental receipts in her purse suggested shed flown or driven to these places but she had no memory of doing so no memory of what shed done for periods that calendar checks revealed to be three or four days it was as if entire chunks had been stolen out of her life sharon diagnosed these time warps correctly as fugue states like amnesia and hysteria fugue is a dissociative reaction a literal splittingoff of the psyche from anxiety and conflict a dissociative patient confronted with a stressful world selfejects from that world and flies off into any number of escapes in hysteria the conflict is transferred to a physical symptom pseudoparalysis blindness and the patient often exhibits a belle indifférence apathy about the disability as if it were happening to someone else in amnesia and fugue actual flight and memory loss take place but in fugue the erasure is shortterm the patient remembers who he or she was before the escape is fully in touch when he comes out of it its what happens in between that remains the mystery abused and neglected children learn early to cut themselves off from horror and when they grow up are susceptible to dissociative symptoms the same is true of patients with fragmented or blurred identities narcissists borderlines by the time j showed up in sharons office her fugues had become so frequent nearly one a month that she was developing a fear of leaving her house was using barbiturates to calm her nerves sharon took a detailed history probing for early trauma but j insisted shed had a storybook childhood all the creature comforts worldly attractive parents whod cherished and adored her up until the day they died in an automobile crash everything had been wonderful she insisted there was no rational reason for her to be having these problems therapy would be brief just a tuneup and shed be in perfect running order sharon noted that this type of extreme denial was consistent with a dissociative pattern she thought it unwise to confront j suggested a sixmonth trial period of psychotherapy and when j refused to commit herself for that long agreed to three months j missed her first appointment and the next sharon tried to call her but the phone number shed been given was disconnected for the next three months she didnt hear from j assumed the young woman had changed her mind then one evening after sharon had seen her last patient j burst into the office weeping and numbed by tranquilizers begging to be seen it took a while for sharon to calm her down and hear her story convinced that a change of scenery was all she really needed a willful flight commented sharon shed taken a plane to rome shopped on the via veneto dined at fine restaurants had a wonderful time until she woke up several days later on a filthy venice side street clothing torn halfnaked bruised and sore her face and body caked with dried semen she assumed shed been raped but had no memory of the attack after showering and dressing she booked the next flight back to the states drove from the airport to sharons office she realized now that shed been wrong that she seriously needed help and she was willing to do whatever it took despite that flash of insight treatment didnt proceed smoothly j was ambivalent about psychotherapy and alternated between worshipping sharon and verbally abusing her over the next two years it became clear that js ambivalence represented a core element of her personality something fundamental to her makeup she presented two distinct faces the needy vulnerable orphan begging for support endowing sharon with godlike qualities flooding her with flattery and gifts and the rageswollen foulmouthed brat who claimed you dont give a shit about me youre only into this in order to lay some giant fucking power trip on me good patient bad patient j grew more facile at switching between the two and by the end of the second year of therapy shifts were occurring several times during a single session sharon questioned her initial diagnosis and considered another multiple personality syndrome that rarest of disorders the ultimate dissociation though j hadnt exhibited two distinct personalities her shifts had the feel of a latent multiple syndrome and the complaints that had brought her into therapy were markedly similar to those exhibited by multiples unaware of their condition sharon checked with her supervisor the esteemed professor kruse and he suggested using hypnosis as a diagnostic tool but j refused to be hypnotized shied away from the loss of control besides she insisted she was feeling great was sure she was almost completely cured and she did look much better the fugues had lessened the last escape taking place three months earlier she was free of barbiturates had higher selfesteem sharon congratulated her but confided her doubts to kruse he advised waiting and seeing two weeks later j terminated therapy five weeks after that she returned to sharons office ten pounds lighter back on drugs having experienced a sevenday fugue that left her stranded in the mojave desert naked her car out of gas her purse missing an empty pill vial in her hand every bit of progress seemed to have been wiped out sharon had been vindicated but expressed profound sadness at js regression once again hypnosis was suggested j reacted with anger accusing sharon of lusting for mind control youre just jealous because im so sexy and beautiful and youre a driedup spinster bitch you havent done me a fucking bit of good so where do you come off telling me to hand you my mind j stomped out of the office proclaiming she was through with this bullshit going to find myself another shrink three days later she was back stoned on barbiturates scabbed and sunburned tearing at her skin and weeping that shed really fucked up this time and was willing to do anything to stop the inner pain sharon began hypnotic treatment not surprisingly j was an excellent subject hypnosis itself is a dissociation the results were dramatic almost immediate j was indeed suffering from multiple personality syndrome under trance two identities emerged j and jana identical twins precise physical replicas of each other but psychological polar opposites the j persona was wellmannered wellgroomed a high achiever though tending toward passivity she cared about other people and despite the unexplained absences due to fugue managed to perform excellently in a peopleoriented profession she had an oldfashioned view of sex and romance believed in true love marriage and family absolute fidelity but admitted to being sexually active with a man shed cared deeply about that relationship had ended however because of intrusion by her alter ego jana was as blatant as j was reticent she favored tinted wigs revealing clothing and heavy makeup saw nothing wrong with tooting dope popping the occasional downer and liked to drink strawberry daiquiris she boasted of being a livefortoday bitch queen of the hopto a total juicy lucy wrapped up in a fucking town and country ribbon which makes whats inside all the more hot she enjoyed promiscuous sex recounted a party during which shed taken quaaludes and had intercourse with ten men consecutively in one night men she laughed were weak primitive apes governed by their lusts a sexy snatch is everything with one of these i can get as many of those as i want neither twin acknowledged the others existence sharon regarded their existence as a pitched battle for the patients ego and despite janas flair for drama it was the mannerly j who appeared to be winning j occupied about percent of the patients consciousness served as her public identity carried her name but the percent claimed by jana was the root of the patients problems jana stepped in sharon theorized during periods of high stress when the patients defense system was weak the fugues were brief periods of actually being jana doing things that j couldnt reconcile with her selfimage as a perfect lady gradually under hypnosis jana reappeared more and more and eventually began describing what had happened during the lost hours the fugues were preceded by a pressing drive for complete physical escape an almost sensual pressure to bolt impulsive travel soon followed the patient would put on a wig get in her party clothes jump in her car get onto the nearest freeway and drive aimlessly often for hundreds of miles without itinerary not even listening to music just the sound of my own hot blood pumping sometimes the car took her to the airport where she used a credit card to book a flight at random other times she stayed on the road in either case the jaunts usually ended in debauchery an excursion to san francisco that climaxed with a threeday orgy of meth sniffing and righteous group gropes with a bunch of angels in golden gate park pilleating in a manhattan disco followed by skinpopping heroin in a south bronx shooting gallery orgies in various european cities assignations with derelicts and headcase street pickups and a righteous skin groove making a pornographic movie somewhere out in florida fucking and sucking like a superstar the parties always ended in druginduced blackout during which jana retreated and j woke up oblivious to everything her twin had done this ability to split was the crux of the patients problem sharon decided and she targeted it for therapeutic assault js ego had to be integrated the twins drawn closer and closer eventually confronting each other reaching some sort of rapprochement and merging into one fully functioning identity a potentially traumatic process she acknowledged unsupported by much clinical data very few therapists claimed to have actually integrated multiple personalities so the prognosis for change was poor but kruse encouraged her supporting her theory that since these multiples were identical twins they shared a psychic core and would be amenable to fusion during hypnosis she began introducing j to small bites of jana brief glimpses of drives down a highway a signpost or hotel room that jana had mentioned camerashutter exposures of neutral material that could be easily withdrawn if the patients anxiety rose too high j tolerated this well no outward signs of anxiety though she didnt respond to any of the jana material and disobeyed sharons posthypnotic suggestion that she recall these details the following session was identical no memory no response at all sharon tried again nothing session after session blank wall despite the patients previous suggestibility she was completely noncompliant determined apparently that the twins would never meet surprised at the strength of the patients resistance sharon wondered if shed been wrong about twinship making integration easier perhaps just the opposite was true the fact that j and jana were physically identical but psychological mirror opposites had intensified their rivalry she began researching the psychology of twins especially identicals consulted kruse then took another tack continuing to hypnotize the patient but backing away from attempts at integration instead she adopted a more chummy role simply chatting with the patient about seemingly innocuous topics female siblings twins identicals leading j through dispassionate discussions was there really a special bond between twins and if so what was its nature what was the best way to raise twins as children how much of the behavioral similarity between identicals was due to heredity how much to genetics riding with the resistance she termed it taking careful note of the patients body language and speech tones synchronizing her own movements with them exploiting the hidden message in accordance with dr p p kruses theory of communication dynamics this went on for several more months at a casual glance nothing more than two friends gabbing but the patient responded to the shift in strategy by slipping deeper than ever into hypnosis showing such profound suggestibility that she developed total skin anesthesia to a lit match eventually adjusting her breathing to the cadence of sharons speech appearing ready for direct suggestion but sharon never offered one just kept on chatting then during the fiftyfourth session the patient slipped spontaneously into the jana role and began describing a wild night that had taken place in italy a party at a private villa in venice peopled by weird grinning characters and fed by flowing booze abundant dope at first just another jana orgy tale every prurient detail recounted with relish then halfway into the story something else my sisters there jana said amazed a fucking wallflower over in that corner in that ugly unvarnished chair sharon whats she feeling terrified scared shitless men are sucking her nipples naked hairy baboons theyre swarming over her sticking things into her sharon things their things their scummy things theyre hurting her and laughing and theres the camera sharon wheres the camera there on the other side of the room im oh no im holding it i want to see everything the lights are all on but she doesnt like it but im filming her anyway i cant stop as she continued to describe the scene janas voice faltered and quivered she described j as exactly like looking exactly like me but you know more innocent she was always more innocent theyre really going at her i feel sharon what nothing sharon what did you feel jana when you saw what was happening to your sister nothing pause bad sharon very bad a a little bad angry expression but it was her own fucking fault dont do the crime if you cant do the time right she shouldnt have gone if she didnt want to play right sharon did she have a choice jana pause what do you mean sharon did j have a choice about going to the party long silence sharon jana yeah i heard you first i thought yeah sure she did everyone has a choice then i sharon what jana i dont know i mean i really dont know her i mean were exactly the same but theres something about her that i dont know its like were i dont know more than sisters i dont know what the right word is maybe part forget it pause sharon partners jana startled i said forget it enough of this shit lets talk about fun stuff what i was doing at the fucking party sharon all right what were you doing jana baffled after a long silence i dont remember aw it was probably boring anyway any party shed go to had to be a door had been opened sharon restrained herself from nudging it further she let jana ramble on waited until all her anger dissipated then ended the session certain that a breakthrough had taken place for the first time in more than three years j had allowed the twins to coexist and had offered a new clue the word partner seemed to have strong emotional loading sharon decided to pursue that brought it up the next time she hypnotized j whats that doctor what did you just say sharon partners i suggested that you and jana are something more than just sisters or even twins perhaps youre partners psychological partners j is thoughtful silent starts to smile sharon whats funny j nothing i suppose youre right you usually are sharon but does it make sense to you i suppose so though if she is my partner shes certainly a silent one we never talk she refuses to talk to me pause her smile widens silent partners what business are we in sharon the business of living j amused i suppose so sharon would you like to talk more about that about being a silent partner j i dont know i guess so maybe not no shes so rude and unpleasant i really cant tolerate being around her lets change the subject if you dont mind j didnt show up for the next session or the next when she finally reappeared two months later she seemed composed claimed her life was going great she just needed a tuneup sharon resumed hypnotherapy continued her attempt to get the twins to meet five more months of frustration during which sharon began thinking of herself as a failure wondered if js needs couldnt be better served by another therapist one with more experience perhaps a male but kruse encouraged her to continue advising still more reliance on nonverbal manipulation another month of status quo and j disappeared once again five weeks later she materialized bursting into the office while sharon was seeing another patient calling that woman a fucking wimp telling her your problems dont mean diddly and ordering her out of the office despite sharons attempt to take charge of the situation the other patient ran out crying sharon told j never to do that again j became jana and accused sharon of being an evil and selfish cunt youre a fucking manipulating cunt out to get everything i own everything i am all you want to do is bleed me fucking dry after threatening to sue sharon and ruin her she stormed out of the office and never returned end of treatment time for the failing therapist to ruminate a hundredpage discussion section a hundred pages of mondaymorning quarterbacking the end point sharons realization that her attempt to reconcile j and jana had been doomed to failure at the outset because the twins were intractable psychic enemies the triumph of one necessitated the death of the other a psychological death but one that had to be so vivid so decisive that it might have been a literal demise instead of seeking integration she realized now she should have worked at strengthening good js identity teamed up with the good twin to destroy the destructive flagrantly disturbed jana theres no room she concluded in this young womans psyche for any type of partner let alone the conflictual silent partners represented by the splits of her personality the nature of human identity is such that the business of living is must be a solitary process lonely at times but enriched by the strength and satisfaction that comes from selfdetermination and a fully integrated ego alone were born alone we die one hell of a case if there had ever been a case i knew j id made love to her danced with her out on a terrace i knew jana too had watched her throw strawberry daiquiris against a fireplace wiggle out of a flamecolored dress and do with me what she wanted a chapter on the psychology of twins yet never once had sharon acknowledged in print that she had a twin her own silent partner denial deceit autobiography shed delved into her own tormented psyche created a phony case history and passed it off as doctoral research working it through some sort of avantgarde therapy just like the porn loop kruse had been her chairman it stank of kruse but what of shirlee the real silent partner had sharon abandoned her to a silent dark world and who the hell was jasper and deep thanks to alex who even in his absence continues to inspire me demure passive ladylike j oldfashioned views about sex and romance though shed been sexually active with a man she cared deeply about the relationship ending after intrusion by jana i hefted the dissertation four hundredplus pages of souldredging pseudoscholarship lies how the hell had she gotten away with it i thought i knew a way to find out before i left i called olivias office sorry darling systems still down maybe by the end of the day okay thanks ill call you later one more thing that hospital you were looking for in glendale i spoke to a friend of mine used to work at glendale adventist she said there was a place on brand named resthaven terrace that closed down just recently she used to consult to them doing their medical management closed down completely thats what arlene said where can i reach arlene st johns in santa monica assistant director of social services arlene melamed she gave me the number and said youre really hot to find this shirlee gal arent you its complicated olivia it always is with you i called arlene melameds office and used olivias name to get through her secretary seconds later a woman with a strong voice said mrs melamed i introduced myself told her i was trying to trace a former patient whod been at resthaven terrace treated when doctor six years ago thats before my time i didnt start there until a year ago this patient had multiple disabilities needed chronic care she could very well have been there a year ago name shirlee ransom two es in shirlee sorry doesnt ring a bell not that that means much i wasnt doing any casework just paper shuffling what ward was she in one of the private rooms back of the building then i certainly cant help you doctor i worked only with the medical cases trying to get the billing system in shape i thought for a moment she had an attendant a man named elmo black muscular elmo castelmaine you know him after resthaven closed he came to work for me at adventist a very fine man unfortunately we had budgetary problems and had to let him go he didnt have enough formal education to satisfy personnel do you have any idea where hes working now after the layoff he got a job at an oldage home in the fairfax area i have no idea if hes still there do you recall the name of that place no but hold on hes in my rolodex he was such a nice man id planned to keep in touch with him in case something came up ah here it is elmo castelmaine king solomon gardens edinburgh street i copied down the address and number and said mrs melamed when did resthaven close six months ago what kind of a place was it im not sure what you mean who ran it a corporation national outfit called chronicare they owned a string of similar places all over the west coast fancylooking operation but they never got their act together running resthaven clinically administratively clinically they were adequate not the best but far from the worst businesswise the place was a disaster their billing system was a complete mess they hired incompetent clerical help never even came close to recovering most of the money the state owed them i was brought in to straighten it out but it was an impossible assignment there was no one to talk to the home office was out in el segundo nobody ever returned calls it was as if they really didnt care about turning a profit after it closed where did the patients go other hospitals i suppose i quit before that el segundo i said do you know if they were owned by a larger corporation wouldnt surprise me she said nowadays everything is i thanked her called my broker lou cestare in oregon and confirmed that chronicare was a subsidiary of the magna corporation but forget about buying in alex they never went public magna never does we chatted a while then i signed off and phoned king solomon gardens the receptionist confirmed that elmo castelmaine still worked there but he was busy with a patient couldnt come to the phone right then i left a message for him to call me regarding shirlee ransom and set out for campus i got to milton fraziers office by two the office hours card on the door was blank a knock produced no response but the door was unlocked i opened it to find the ratman wearing a stiff tweed suit and rimless halfglasses hunched over his desk using a yellow felttip pen to underline sections of a manuscript the window shades were partially drawn giving the room a sallow cast fraziers beard was disheveled as if hed been picking at it my hello professor produced a scowl and a wave of his hand that could have meant anything from come in to get the hell out of here a stiffbacked chair faced the desk i sat down and waited as frazier continued to underline using graceless slashing movements the desk was stacked high with more manuscripts i leaned forward and read the title of the one on top a textbook chapter he edited i bided my time the office had beige walls a dozen or so diplomas and certificates doublestacked metal bookshelves over cracked vinyl flooring no custom interior design for this department head lined up on one of the shelves was a collection of glass beakers animal brains floating in formaldehyde the place smelled of old paper and wet rodent i waited for a long time frazier finished with one manuscript lifted another from the stack and began working on it he made more yellow marks shook his head twisted his beard hairs showed no intention of stopping alex delaware i said class of he sat up sharply stared at me straightened his lapels his shirt bagged his tie was a handpainted horror just ancient enough to have come back into fashion he studied me hmm delaware cant say that i remember a lie but i let it pass i thought you were a student he said as if that explained his ignoring me eyes back on the manuscript he added if its an associateship youre after it will have to wait im not seeing anyone without an appointment publishers deadline new book headshake revised edition of paradigms slash flip paradigms of vertebrate learning for thirty years his claim to fame tenth edition he added congratulations yes well i suppose congratulations are in order however one almost regrets obligating oneself to a new edition when the onerousness of the task becomes apparent strident demands by commercially motivated publishers to include new chapters regardless of the lack of rigor with which they are obtained or the coherence with which they are presented he slapped the stack of chapters enduring all this rubbish has shown me just how low standards have sunk the american psychologist trained after hasnt a clue about proper research design nor the ability to construct a grammatical sentence i nodded damned shame when standards sink all sorts of strange things start to happen he looked up annoyed but listening i said strange things like an unqualified attentionseeker making department head the marker froze midair he tried to stare me down but his eye contact was spotty given the circumstances thats an exceptionally rude remark doesnt change the facts exactly whats on your mind doctor how kruse managed to bend all the rules this is in exceedingly poor taste whats your concern with all this call me a concerned alumnus he sucked his teeth any complaints you may have had against professor kruse have been rendered moot by his untimely death if as you contend youre truly concerned about the department you wont occupy my time or anyone elses on trivial personal matters were all frightfully busy this whole horrid affair has greatly disrupted the scheme of things ill bet it has especially for those members of the faculty whod counted on all that blalock money kruses death has put all of you in jeopardy he put the marker down fought to keep his hand steady i said with the rug pulled out from under you i can see why youd have to get that tenth edition rolling moving stiffly robotically he leaned back in his chair trying to look casual but coming across deflated you think youre such a bright boy dont you always did always barreling your way through everythingdoing your own thing and here i thought you didnt remember your rudeness jogged my memory young man i recall you quite clearly now the precocious threeyear man in case you dont know i was opposed to letting you finish early even though you completed your requirements i sensed that you needed seasoning maturity obviously the passage of time alone hasnt solved that problem i moved to the edge of my chair picked up the yellow marker and put it down the issue professor isnt my maturity its the sorry state of your ethics selling the department to the highest bidder how much did kruse pay to have you step down and let him take over was it in a lump sum or monthly installments check or credit card or did he bring you cash in a plain brown bag he paled started to rise from his chair sank back down and shook a wobbly finger at me watch your tongue dont be crass crass i said is a quickbuck mailorder stopsmoking scheme targeted at the sucker market what kind of scientific rigor did you muster to come up with that one he opened his mouth and closed it moved his head and shoulders in a way that made his clothing seem to swallow him up youve no comprehension of the situation delaware not a whit then educate me what was the payoff he swiveled away stared at a thousand books pretended to be studying the spine on one of the volumes if youre clogged i said let me prime your pump kruse funded your little stab at free enterprise all the ad money the printing the manufacture of the tapes either his own money or he tapped mrs blalock what did it come out to ten thousand fifteen he spent more on his summer wardrobe but for you it would be major venture capital he said nothing no doubt he was the one who suggested the con in the first place i said ads in the back of the magazine that ran his column more silence but hed gone pale add to that the nonstop flow of blalock money for your academic research and it was a sweet deal for both of you no more brownnosing for grants or pretending to be relevant for you and kruse got tenure instant respectability in order to avoid wagging tongues and petty jealousies he probably arranged some funding for the other faculty members too all you rigorous researchers would be coasting doing your own thing though i suspect the rest of the senior staff would be surprised to learn how much extra kruse kicked back to you make for a terrific staff meeting wouldnt it professor no he said feebly theres nothing to be ashamed of my regimen for smokers is based on sound behavioral principles obtaining private endowments for research is a timehonored tradition given the state of our national economy its certainly the wave of the future you were never one for the future frazier kruse shoved you into it why are you doing this delaware attacking the department we made you im not talking about the department just you and kruse he made cudchewing motions with his lips as if trying to bring up the right word when he finally spoke his voice was weak youll find no scandal here everythings been done through proper channels im willing to test that hypothesis delaware i spent the morning reading a fascinating document frazier the silent partner identity crisis and ego dysfunction in a case of multiple personality et cetera ring a bell he looked genuinely blank the doctoral dissertation of sharon ransom phd submitted to the department in partial fulfillment and approved by you a single case study not a shred of empirical research a clear violation of every rule you pushed through you signed your name to the damn thing howd she get away with it how much did kruse pay you to bend that far sometimes he said allowances are made this went beyond allowances this was fraud i fail to understand just what she wrote about herself about her own psychopathology camouflaged it as a case history and palmed it off as research what do you think the board of regents would make of that not to mention apas ethics committee time and newsweek whatever remained of his composure crumbled and his color got bad i remembered what larry had said about a heart attack and wondered if id pushed too hard jesus god he said dont pursue this i didnt know an aberration i assure you it will never happen again true kruse is dead let the dead rest delaware please all i want is information i said softly give me some truth and the matters dropped what what do you want to know the connection between ransom and kruse i dont know much about that thats the lords truth only that she was his protégée i remembered how soon it was after sharon arrived that kruse had filmed her he brought her with him didnt he sponsored her application yes but where did he bring her from wherever he was from i assume where was that florida palm beach he nodded was she from palm beach too i have no idea we could find out by checking her application records when did she graduate he picked up the phone called the department and mouthed a few orders a moment later he was frowning saying are you sure doublecheck silence all right all right he hung up and said her file is gone how convenient delaware call the registrars office all theyd have would be her transcript transcripts list prior institutions attended he nodded dialed a number pulled rank with a clerk and waited then he used the yellow marker to write something in a column of the manuscript and hung up not florida long island new york a place called forsythe teachers college i used his paper and pen to copy that down by the way he said her grades were superb undergraduate and graduate unblemished as no indication of anything other than exceptional scholarship she might very well have gotten in without his help what else do you know about her why do you need to know all of this i stared at him said nothing i had nothing to do with her he said kruse was the one with a personal interest in her how personal if youre assuming something corrupt i wouldnt know about that why would i assume that he hesitated looked queasy its no secret that he was known for certain proclivities drives were those drives directed toward sharon ransom no i thats not the kind of thing i pay much attention to i believed him think those drives helped her get straight as absolutely not thats simply howd he manage to get her in he didnt get her in he sponsored her her grades were perfect his sponsorship was simply an additional factor in her favor nothing unusual faculty members have always been allowed to sponsor applicants tenured faculty i said when have clinical associates ever had that kind of clout a long silence im sure you know the answer to that tell me anyway he cleared his throat as if ready to spit expelled a single word money blalock money as well as his own he came from a wealthy family ran in the same social circle as mrs blalock and her ilk you know how rare those kinds of contacts are among academics especially at a public university he was regarded as more than just another clinical associate a clinical associate with training in psychological warfare i beg your pardon never mind i said so he was your bridge between town and gown thats correct nothing shameful about that is there i remembered what larry had said about kruse treating one of the blalock children was his only connection with mrs blalock a social one as far as i know please delaware dont make something ominous out of all this and get her involved the department was in dire financial straits kruse brought substantial funds with him and promised to use his connections to obtain an ample endowment from mrs blalock he made good on that promise in return we offered him an unpaid appointment unpaid in terms of salary he got lab facilities for his pornography research real academic rigor he flinched it wasnt that simple the department did not simply yield like a harlot it took months to confirm his appointment the senior faculty debated it heavily there was significant opposition not least of which was my own the man was sorely lacking in academic credentials his column in that crass magazine was positively offensive however however in the end expediency won out he twisted beard hairs made them crackle when i heard about his research i realized letting him in had been an error in judgment but one impossible to undo without creating adverse publicity so instead you made him department head he continued playing with his beard several brittle white hairs rained down on the desk back to the ransom dissertation i said howd it get through departmental scrutiny kruse came to me requesting that the experimental rule be waived for one of his students when he told me she planned to submit a case study i immediately refused he was persistent pointed out her perfect academic record said she was an unusually skillful clinician for what thats worth and that the case she wanted to present was unique had major research ramifications how major publishable in a major journal nevertheless he failed to sway me but he kept pressing buttonholing me daily coming into my office interrupting my work in order to argue his case finally i relented finally as in fill the coffers i said when you read the dissertation did you regret your decision i thought it was rubbish but no different from any other clinical study psychology should have remained in the laboratory true to its scientific roots never been allowed to venture out into all that poorly defined treatment rubbish let the psychiatrists muck around in that kind of silliness you had no idea it was autobiographical of course not how could i i never met her except once at her oral exam must have been a tough exam kruse you as his rubber stamp and an outside member sandra romansky remember her not in the slightest do you know how many committees i sit on had i the smallest inkling of any impropriety i would have put my foot down you can count on that reassuring he said i was only tangentially involved how thoroughly did you read it i asked not thoroughly at all he said as if seizing on extenuating evidence believe me delaware i barely skimmed the blasted thing i went down to the department office told the secretary i was working with professor frazier verified that the file was missing and called long island information to find the number of forsythe college administration there confirmed that sharon jean ransom had attended the school from through theyd never heard of paul peter kruse i called my service for messages nothing from olivia or elmo castelmaine but dr small and detective sturgis had phoned the detective said dont call him hell get back to you the operator told me she giggled detective you getting involved in something exciting dr delaware hardly i said just the usual your usuals probably a major rush compared to mine dr delaware have a nice day one fortythree i waited seven minutes and called ada small figuring to get her between patients she picked up the line said alex thanks for getting back so quickly that young woman you referred carmen seeber she came for two sessions then didnt show up for the third i called her several times finally managed to reach her at home and tried to talk to her about it but she was pretty defensive insisted she was fine didnt need any more therapy shes fine all right shacked up with a drug addict probably giving him every penny she owns how do you know that from the police i see pause well thank you for the referral anyway im sorry it didnt work out im the one who should be apologizing you did me the favor thats all right alex i wanted to ask her if carmen had shed any light on dj rasmussens death but knew better than to try to breach confidentiality ill try calling her next week she said but im not optimistic you and i both know about the power of resistance i thought of denise burkhalter all we can do is try true tell me alex how are you doing i answered too quickly just dandy why if im out of line please forgive me but both times weve spoken recently youve sounded tight tense on full burn the phrase id used in therapy to describe the fasttrack mindset that overtook me during periods of stress what robin had always called hyperspace and managed to soothe me out of just a little tired ada im fine thanks for asking im glad to hear that another pause if you ever do need to toss things around you know im here for you i do ada thanks and take care you too alex take good care of yourself i walked toward the north end of campus stopping for a cup of vendingmachine coffee before entering the research library back to the periodical index i found nothing on william houck vidal other than business quotes prior to the basketcase billionaire lawsuit i backtracked and found a time piece on the war board senate hearings entitled hollywood meets dc amid rumors of scandal a piece id missed while culling belding material vidal had just made his first appearance before the committee and the magazine was trying to flesh out his background a headshot photo showed him with fewer wrinkles thick blond hair a blinding smile the good teeth crotty had remembered and wiseguy eyes vidal was described as a socialite whod parlayed shrewdness connections and more than a soupçon of charm into a lucrative motion picture consulting position hollywood sources suggested it was he whod persuaded leland belding to enter the movie business both men had attended stanford as a sophomore vidal had served as the president of a mens club that belding also belonged to but their association was thought to have been casual the future billionaire had shunned organizations never attending a single club function their working relationship was cemented in vidal served as the middleman in a business deal between belding and blalock industries which supplied wartime steel to the magna corporation at a discount rate vidal introduced leland belding to henry abbot blalock he was perfectly positioned to do so because blalock was his brotherinlaw married to vidals sister the former hope estes vidal the vidals were described as the last descendants of an old venerable familymayflower lineage but dwindled fortunes henry blalock londonborn son of a chimney sweep had been admitted to the blue book set after his marriage to hope the vidal name still dripped with social status time wondered if brother billys current problems with the senate would change all that billy and hope brother and sister it explained vidals presence at the party but not his relationship to sharon not what theyd been talking about i searched for further mention of the blalocks found nothing on hope some businessrelated references to henry a his fortune had been made in steel railroads and real estate like leland belding he owned it all had never gone public unlike belding hed stayed out of the headlines in he died age fiftynine of a stroke while on safari in kenya leaving a grieving widow the former hope estes vidal contributions to the heart foundation in lieu of flowers no mention of offspring what of the child kruse had treated had the widow remarried i kept thumbing the index found a single item dated six months after henry blalocks death the sale of blalock industries to the magna corporation for an unspecified sum rumored to be a bargain the decline of blalocks holdings was noted and attributed to failure to adapt to changing realities particularly the growing importance of crosscontinental air shipping the implication was clear beldings planes had helped antiquate blalocks trains then magna had swooped down and made off with the pickings though from the looks of hope blalocks lodgings those pickings had been substantial i wondered if brother billy had played middleman again seen to it that her interests were protected another hour of thumbing brought nothing more i thought of somewhere else to look went down to the ground floor and asked the reference librarian if the stack holdings included social registers she looked it up told me the los angeles blue book was kept in special collections which had closed for the day my thoughts slid down to the lower rungs of the social ladder another brothersister story i remained in the reference section tried to find newspaper accounts of the linda lanier dope bust it was harder than i thought of all the local papers only the times was indexed and that only from the new york times index went back to but contained nothing on linda lanier i went to the newspaper stacks on the second floor banks of drawers and rows of microfiche machines showed my faculty card filled out forms collected spools ellston crotty had dated the bust assuming linda lanier had been sharons mother shed had to have been alive at the time of sharons birth may which narrowed it further i spun my way through the spring of starting with the times and keeping the herald mirror and daily news in reserve it took more than an hour to find the story august the times never one for crime stories relegated it to the middle of part one but the other papers had given it frontpage treatment complete with purple prose photographs of the slain pushers and the cops whod killed them the articles jibed with crottys account minus his cynicism linda laniereulalee johnson and her brother cable johnson major heroin traffickers had fired at raiding metro narc detectives and been killed by return fire in a single lightning operation detectives royal hummel and victor degranzfeld had put an end to one of the most predatory drug rings in la history the detectives photos showed them grinning and kneeling beside bindles of white powder hummel was wide and beefy in a light suit and widebrimmed straw hat i thought i detected a hint of cyril trapp in the hatchet jaw and narrow lips degranzfeld was pearshaped mustachioed and sliteyed and wore a chalkstriped doublebreasted suit and dark stetson he looked illatease as if smiling were an imposition i didnt have to study the picture of linda laniereulalee johnson to recognize the blond bombshell id watched seduce dr donald neurath the photo was highquality a professional studio job the kind of windswept glossy threequarterface pose favored by wouldbe actresses for publicity portfolios sharons face in a platinum wig cable johnson was memorialized in a county jail mug shot that showed him to be a meanlooking poorly shaven loser with drooping eyes and a greasy ducksass hairdo the eyes were lazy but managed to project a hardedged scrapforsurvival brightness shrewdness rather than abstract intelligence the kind whod make out in the short term get tripped up over and over again by an inflated sense of self and inability to delay gratification his criminal record was termed extensive and included arrests for extortion trying to squeeze money out of some smalltime east la bookies public drunkenness disorderly conduct larceny and theft a sad but petty litany nothing that supported the papers labeling of him and his sister as majorleague dope pushers ruthless sophisticated but for their deaths destined to flood the city with illegal narcotics anonymous police sources were quoted claiming the johnsons were associated with mexican mob elements theyd grown up in the south texas border town of port wallace a tough hamlet known to law enforcement officials as an entry point for brown heroin had clearly moved to la with intentions of pushing that substance to the schoolchildren of brentwood pasadena and beverly hills as part of their plan they obtained jobs at an unnamed film studio cable as a grip linda as a contract player trawling for bit parts this provided a cover for narcotics trafficking within the film community a segment of the population long known to be enamored of illicit drugs and nonconformist personal habits both were known as hangerson at leftleaning parties also attended by known communists and fellow travelers dope and bolshevism prime demons of the fifties enough to make shooting a beautiful young woman to death palatable admirable i ran a few more spools through the machine nothing linking linda lanier to leland belding not a word about party pads and nothing about children singly or in pairs old stories old connections but the strands were tangling even as they knitted and i was no closer to understanding sharon how shed lived and why she and so many others had died at pm milo called and added to the confusion bastard trapp lost no time snowing me under he said reorganizing the deadcase file pure scutwork i played hooky wore out my phone ear your gal ransom had a severe allergy to the truth no birth records in new york no manhattan ransoms not on park avenue or any of the other highpriced zip codes clear back to the late forties same for long island southamptons a tight little community the local gendarmes say no ransoms in the phone book no ransoms ever lived in any of the big estates she went to college there forsythe not right there nearby howd you find out through her university transcript howd you find out social security she applied in gave the college as her address but thats the first time her name shows up anywhere as if she didnt exist until then if you have any contacts in palm beach florida try there milo kruse practiced there until when he moved out to la he brought her with him uhuh im ahead of you him i did find plenty of paper on born in new york park avenue as a matter of fact big apartment that he sold in the real estate transfer listed a palm beach address and i called down there these richtown departments arent easy to deal with very protective of the locals i told them ransom had been a burglary victim we recovered her stuff wanted to give it back to her they looked her up nada not even a whisper alex so kruse hooked up with her somewhere else and speaking of kruse he was not the hotshot psychotherapist you described i stroked my source at the irs accessed the guys tax returns his practice only produced income of thirty thou a year at a hundred bucks an hour thats only five or six hours a week not exactly your busy shrink another five gs came from writing the rest another half mil was investment income bluechip stocks and bond dividends real estate and a little business venture called creative image associates blue movies he listed it as a producer and manufacturer of health education materials he and his wife were sole shareholders declared a loss for five years then folded what years let me see ive got it right here through sharons last year in college her first four years in grad school what it boils down to alex is a rich guy living off inheritance dabbling dabbling in peoples lives i said the army taught him psychological warfare for what thats worth when i was a medic i caught an eyeful of the armys psychological warfare for the most part worthless bullshit the viet cong laughed at it ad agencies do it better anyway bottom line is ransom emerges as your basic phantom lady with a rich patron for all practical purposes she could have dropped out of the sky in martinis in the sunroom whats that nothing important i said heres another possibility i looked up the newspaper coverage of the lanierjohnson drug bust linda and her brother were from south texas place called port wallace maybe there are records down there maybe he said anything in the papers that crotty didnt tell us just that in addition to the dope thing the red scare was raised supposedly the johnsons went to parties with subversives given the mood of the country that would have guaranteed public support for the shootout hummel and degranzfeld were treated like most valuable players uncle hummel he said i called vegas hes still alive still working for magna chief of security at the casbah and two other casinos the company owns there lives in a big house in the best part of town wages of sin huh one more thing to chew on i said billy vidal and hope blalock are brother and sister vidal set up deals between blalocks husband and belding after blalocks husband died magna bought her out cheap after belding died vidal ended up chairman of magna mrs blalock was bankrolling kruse supposedly because hed treated one of her kids but she doesnt seem to have any kids jesus he said ever get the feeling alex were playing somebody elses game by somebody elses rules in somebody elses goddam stadium he agreed to run a texas trace and told me to watch my back before hanging up i wanted to call olivia again but it was close to eleven past her and alberts bedtime so i waited until nine the next morning phoned her office and was told mrs brickerman was up in sacramento on business this morning and was expected back shortly i tried to reach elmo castelmaine at king solomon gardens he was on shift again busy with a patient i got in the seville and drove to the fairfax district to edinburgh street the oldage home was one of dozens of boxy twostory buildings lining the narrow treeless street king solomon gardens had no gardens just one pudgytrunked roofhigh date palm to the left of the double glass entry doors the building was white texturecoat trimmed in electric blue a ramp carpeted in blue astroturf served in place of front steps cement had been laid down where the lawn should have been painted hospital green and furnished with folding chairs old people sat sunvisored kerchiefed and supporthosed fanning themselves playing cards just staring off into space i found a parking space halfway down the block and was headed back when i spotted a chunky black man across the street pushing a wheelchair i quickened my pace and got a better look white uniform tunic over blue jeans no corkscrew beard no earring the crown of the head yielding to neartotal baldness the stocky body softer the face looser doublechinned but the one i remembered from resthaven i crossed the street caught up mr castelmaine he stopped looked back an old woman was in the wheelchair she didnt pay any notice despite the heat she wore a sweater buttoned to the neck and an indian blanket across her knees her hair was thin and brittle dyed black the breeze blew through it exposing white patches of scalp she appeared to be sleeping with her eyes open thats me the same highpitched voice now who might you be alex delaware i left you a message yesterday that doesnt help me much i still dont know you any better than i did ten seconds ago we met years ago six years ago at resthaven terrace i came with sharon ransom visited her sister shirlee the woman in the chair began to sniffle and whimper castelmaine bent down patted her head pulled a tissue out of his jeans and dabbed at her nose now now mrs lipschitz its okay hes gonna come get you she pouted come on now mrs lipschitz honey your beaus gonna come dont you worry the woman lifted her face she was sharpfeatured toothless wrinkled as a discarded shopping bag her eyes were palebrown and heavily mascaraed a brightred patch of lipstick had been smeared over a puckered fissure of a mouth somewhere behind the crease and corrugation the mask of cosmetics shone a spark of beauty her eyes filled with tears aw mrs lipschitz said castelmaine she drew the blanket up to her mouth began chewing on the coarse fabric castelmaine turned to me and said softly they reach a certain age they can never get warm no matter what the weather never get full satisfaction of any kind mrs lipschitz cried out her lips worked around a word for a while and finally formed it party castelmaine kneeled beside her eased the blanket away from her mouth and tucked it around her youre gonna go to that party hon but youve got to be careful not to ruin your makeup with all those tears okay he placed two fingers under the old womans chin and smiled okay she looked up at him nodded gooood and we are looking pretty today honey all spiffed up and raring to go the old woman held up one shriveled hand a thick black one wrapped around it party she said sure theres gonna be a party and youre so pretty clara celia lipschitz that youre gonna be the belle of that party all the handsome boys are gonna line up to dance with you a rush of tears now cmon cc no more of that hes gonna come take you to that party youve got to be looking your best more struggle to enunciate late just a little late clara celia he probably hit some heavy traffic you know all that gridlock ive been telling you about or maybe he stopped off at a flower shop to get you a nice corsage nice pink orchid corsage like he knows you love late just a little he repeated and resumed pushing the chair i tagged along he began singing softly in a sweet tenor so high it verged on falsetto now c cc rider cmon see baby what you have done the music and the repetitive rub of the chairs tires against the sidewalk set up a lullaby rhythm the old womans head began to loll cc lipschitz see what you have done we stopped directly across the street from king solomon castelmaine looked both ways and nudged the chair over the curb you made all the handsome boys love you and now your man has come mrs lipschitz slept he pushed her across the green cement exchanging greetings with some of the other old people got to the bottom of the ramp and told me wait here ill be with you soon as im through i stood around got drawn into conversation with a thickwaisted old man with one good eye and a vfw cap who claimed to have fought with teddy roosevelt at san juan hill then waited belligerently as if expecting me to doubt him when i didnt he launched into a lecture on us policy in latin america and was going strong ten minutes later when castelmaine reappeared i shook the old mans hand told him it had been educational a smart boy he told castelmaine the attendant smiled that probably means mr cantor that he didnt disagree with you whats to disagree emes is emes you got to keep those pinkos in line or they eat your liver the emes is we gotta go mr cantor so whos stopping you go gey avek we walked back across the green cement how about a cup of coffee i said dont drink coffee lets walk we turned left on edinburgh and strolled past more old people past sweating windows and cooking smells dry lawns musty doorways i dont remember you he said not as a specific person i do remember dr ransom visiting with a man because it only happened once he looked me over no i cant say that i remember it being you i looked different i said had a beard longer hair he shrugged could be anyway what can i do for you unconcerned i realized he hadnt heard about sharon gritted my teeth and said dr ransom died he stopped put both hands alongside his face died when a week ago how suicide mr castelmaine it was in the papers never read the papers get enough bad news just from living oh no such a kind wonderful girl i cant believe it i said nothing he kept shaking his head what pushed her so low she had to go and do something like that thats what im trying to find out his eyes were moist and bloodshot you her man i was years ago we hadnt seen each other for a long time met at a party she said something was bothering her i never found out what it was two days later she was gone oh lord this is just terrible im sorry howd she do it pills and a gunshot to the head oh god doesnt make any sense someone beautiful and rich doing something like that all day i wheel around the old ones fading away losing the ability to do anything for themselves but they hang on nothing but memories to keep them going then someone like dr ransom throws it all away we resumed walking just doesnt make sense he repeated i know i said i thought you might be able to help me make some sense of it me how by telling me what you know about her what i know he said isnt much she was a fine woman always looked happy to me always treated me well she was devoted to that sister of hers you dont see a lot of that some of them start out all noble guilty for putting the loved one away swearing to god theyre gonna be visiting all the time taking care of everything but after a while of getting nothing back they get tired start coming less and less lots of them disappear completely but not dr ransom she was always there for poor shirlee every week like clockwork wednesday afternoon two to five sometimes two or three times a week and not just sitting feeding and fixing and loving that poor girl and getting nothing in return did anyone else ever visit shirlee not a one excepting the time she came with you only dr ransom like clockwork she was the best family to one of those people i ever saw giving not getting i watched her do it steadily up until the day i quit when was that eight months ago whyd you quit cause they were gonna let me go dr ransom tipped me off that the place was going to shut down said she appreciated all id done for shirlee was sorry she couldnt take me with her but that shirlee would continue to get good care she said id made a big difference then she gave me fifteen hundred dollars cash to show she meant it that shows you what she was like makes no sense for her to get that low so she knew resthaven was going to close and she was correct couple of weeks later everyone else got form letters pink slips dear employee a friend of mine was working the wards i warned her but she didnt believe me when it happened she didnt get any notice no severance just byebye charlie were bankrupt out of business and so are you do you have any idea where dr ransom took shirlee no but believe me it had to be somewhere fine she loved that girl treated her like a queen he stopped turned grim with her dead whos gonna take care of the poor thing i dont know i have no idea where she is no one does oh lord this is starting to sound mournful im sure shes all right i said the family has money did she talk much about them not to me she didnt but you knew she was rich she was paying the bills at resthaven she had to be besides anyone could tell she had money just by looking at her the way she dressed and carried herself being a doctor dr ransom was paying the bills thats what it said right at the top of the chart all financial correspondence to be directed to dr ransom what else was in the chart all the therapy records pt ot for a while dr ransom even had a speech therapist come in but that was a waste of time shirlee was nowhere near talking same with a braille teacher dr ransom tried everything she loved that girl i just cant see her destroying herself and abandoning the poor thing was there a medical history in the chart just some early stuff and a summary of all the problems written out by dr ransom any birth records he shook his head were any other doctors involved in shirlees care just dr ransom no physicians what do you think she was she was a psychologist did she tell you she was an md he thought for a while come to think of it no she didnt but the way she took charge of shirlees case writing orders for the therapists i just took it for granted shirlee must have had physical complaints who handled those youd think she would have but funny thing was except for all her problems she was really healthy had a good strong heart good blood pressure clear lungs all you had to do was turn her feed her change her give her postural drainage and shed go on forever he gazed up at the sky shook his head wonder where she is poor thing did dr ransom ever talk about the accident his eyebrows arched what accident is that the drowning that caused all of shirlees problems now you lost me she drowned when she was a small child dr ransom told me about it said it was what caused shirlees brain damage well i dont know about that because what she told me was something totally different the poor girl was born that way born blind and deaf and crippled thats right all of it multiple congenital deformities lord knows i saw it often enough staring up from dr ransoms summary he shook his head multiple congenital deformities poor thing started out that way never any chance at all it was close to noon i drove to a gas station nearby and used the pay phone to call olivias office mrs brickerman i was informed had returned from sacramento but wasnt expected back in the office today i phoned her home number let it ring ten times and was just ready to hang up when she picked it up breathless alex i just got in literally from the airport spent the morning taking a power breakfast with senate aides and trying to get them to give us more money what a bunch if any of them had ever owned an idea they sold it a long time ago cheap hate to bother you i said but i was wondering if the system was back up yes it is as of this morning and just to show you how much i love you i used sacramento divisions mainframe to run your shirlee ransom through sorry nothing i did find a person by that name same spelling but on the medical files date of birth not do you have an address on her no you told me i didnt figure youd be interested in a senior citizen makes sense i said you are interested i might be if its not too much of a all right all right let me change out of this business suit and ill call the office try and get my assistant to overcome her computerphobia itll take a while where can i get back to you im calling from a pay phone cloak and dagger nonsense alex what are you up to digging up bones ugh whats your number i read it off to her thats my neighborhood where are you calling from gas station on melrose near fairfax oh for gods sake youre two minutes away come over and watch me play hightech detective the brickermans house was small newly painted white with a spanish tile roof narrow beds of petunias had been planted along the driveway which was filled with olivias mammoth chrysler new yorker shed left the door unlocked albert brickerman was in the living room in a bathrobe and slippers staring at the chessboard he grunted in response to my greeting olivia was in the kitchen scrambling eggs wearing a white ruffled blouse and size navy skirt her hair was a hennad frizz her cheeks plump and rosy she

yucaipa when the kids were little i used to take them down there to pick apples apples apples darling little red round things keep the doctor away why the surprise i didnt know apples grew down there they used to then one year we went down there and there was nothing left all the upick places closed down the trees dead and dying were talking boonies alex nothings out there except miss new years and mr christmas the san bernardino freeway propelled me like a pea through a shooter past an exurban blur of industrial parks ticky tack housing developments and auto lots wider than some small towns just beyond pomona and the county fairgrounds the scenery shifted to ranches egg farms warehouses and freight yards running parallel to the south side of the freeway were railroad tracks cotton bowl and southern pacific boxcars sat stagnant on the rails the rear third of the train was meshed compartments crammed with gleaming little japanese sedans a brief burst of architectural fervor past claremont and then everything got quiet i drove through empty sunscorched hills past smaller farms and ranches sloping fields of alfalfa horses grazing sluggishly in the heat the yucaipa exit narrowed to a single lane that ran alongside a tractor graveyard i slowed and cruised past a string of aluminumsided trailers billed as the big mall an untended taco shack and a boardedup shop advertising very rare antiques willow glen shared billing on a road sign with a bible college twenty miles south and a state agricultural depot the directional arrow aimed me over a covered bridge and onto a razorstraight road that cut through more farmland citrus and avocado plantings ramshackle stables and untended fields broad slabs of blank brown space were broken by trailer parks tinroofed juke joints and cinderblock churches and surrounded by the granite drapery of the san bernardino mountains the mountains faded from rawhide to lavendergray in the distance the upper peaks merging with a pearly mist of sky heat percolated up from the lowlands softening the contours of the pines that clung to the mountainsides creating fringed silhouettes that recalled ink bleeding into blotting paper willow glen road materialized as the left arm of a boulevard stop in the middle of nowhere a sharp hook past a splintered sign advertising fresh produce and a jumbo turkey ranch long vacated the blacktop twisted and climbed toward the mountains then up into them the air got cooler cleaner ten miles in a few apple orchards appeared freshly tilled small plots backed by frame houses and surrounded by barbed wire and windbreak willows the trees cut low with wide crotches for handpicking cherrysized orbs peeked out from under sage canopies of leaf harvest looked to be a good two months away homemade signs on stakes driven into the road shoulder welcomed the upick crowd but there didnt seem enough fruit to provide more than a days desultory picking as the road climbed higher neglected orchards began to dominate the landscape larger dusty stretches filled with dead trees some felled others whittled to limbless graywhite spikes the asphalt ended at twin telephonepolesized posts banded with chamber of commerce and service club badges a chain dangling from between the posts supported a sign that read willow glen village pop i stopped looked past the sign the village seemed to be nothing more than a tiny rustic shopping mall shaded by willows and pines and fronted by an empty parking lot the trees parted at the far end of the lot and the road continued as compressed dirt i drove in parked and stepped out into clean dry heat the first thing that caught my eye was a large blackandwhite ilama nibbling hay in a small corral behind the corral was a narrow frame house painted barnred and trimmed in white the sign over the doorway read willow glen fun center and petting zoo i searched for human habitation saw none waved at the llama and got a ruminant stare in return a handful of other buildings all small all wooden shingleroofed and unpainted and connected to one another by planked walkways hughs woodcarvers paradise the enchanted forest antique shoppe grannys treasure trove gifts and souvenirs every one shuttered tight the ground was cushioned by pine needles and willow leaves i walked through it still searching for company spotted a flash of white and a jet of smoke rising from behind the woodcarvers shop lowhanging branches blocked the view i walked past them saw a series of weathered wood booths bolted together under a single brandnew red roof as i got closer the air got sweet the heavy sweetness of honey mixed with the tang of apples the trees receded and i was standing in a bright clearing one of the booths was labeled apple press cidery another clover honey but the sweet smoke was coming from next door a greenshuttered section designated golden delicious café deep dish pie cobbler the cafés façade was whitewashed planks and stainedglass windows windows decorated with black boughs pinkwhite blossoms green red and yellow apples the door was open i went in inside everything was spotless and whitewashed picnic tables and benches a white ceiling fan recirculating hot honeyed air a formicatopped counter and three white naugahyde stools hanging plants an old brass cash register and a mimeographed poster advertising a yucaipa astrologer a young woman sat behind the counter drinking coffee and reading a biology textbook behind her a passthrough window provided a view of a stainlesssteel kitchen i sat down she looked up nineteen or twenty with a sharply upturned nose clipped curly blond hair and wide dark eyes she wore a white shirt and black jeans was slim but hippy a greenapple badge on her shirt said wendy she smiled maura bannons age less sophisticated no doubt but somehow older than the reporter hi what can i get you i pointed to her coffee cup how about some of that for starts sure cream and sugar black would you like a menu thanks she handed me a plasticized rectangle the selection surprised me id expected burgers and fries but a dozen entrees were listed some of them complex with a nod toward nouvelle each tagged with letters indicating the proper wine c for chardonnay jr for johannesburg riesling on the back of the menu was a full wine list goodquality french and california vintages as well as a locally produced apple wine described as light and fruity similar in nose and flavor to sauvignon blanc she brought the coffee something to eat how about an apple pickers lunch sure she turned her back on me opened a refrigerator and various drawers and cabinets tinkered for a while put cutlery and a linen napkin on the counter and served up a platter of perfectly sliced apples and thick wedges of cheese garnished with mint here you go she said adding a wholewheat roll and butter molded into flowers the goat cheese is really good made by a family of basques out near loma linda organically fed animals she waited olivias eggs still sat in my stomach i took a small bite terrific thanks im studying food presentation in college want to run my own place some day i get to use working here as part of my independent studies i pointed at the textbook summer school she grimaced finals tests arent my specialty more coffee sure i sipped kind of quiet today every day during picking season september through january we get a handful of tourists on weekends but its not like it used to be people know about cherry picking in beaumont but we havent gotten much publicity it didnt used to be that way the village was built in people used to go home with bushel baskets of spartans and jonathans but city people came and bought up some of the land didnt take care of it i saw dead orchards on the way up isnt it sad apples need care just like children all those doctors and lawyers from la and san diego bought the orchards for taxes then just let them die weve been trying my family and me to get the place going again the orange county register might run a piece on us that would sure help meanwhile were getting the jam and honey going starting to do real good with mail order plus i cook for the rangers and aggie commissioners passing through get my independent study taken care of you with the state no i said whats with the ilama cedric hes ours my familys thats our house behind his pen our village house mom and my brothers are in there right now planning out the zoo were going to have a fullfledged petting zoo by next summer keep the little kids busy so the parents can shop cedrics a doll dad got him in trade hes a doctor has a chiropractic practice down in yucaipa thats where we live most of the time there was this circus coming through gypsies or something like that in these painted wagons with accordions and tape machines they set up in one of the fields passed the hat one of the men sprained his back doing acrobatics dad fixed him up but the guy couldnt pay so dad took cedric in trade he loves animals then we got the idea for the petting zoo my sisters studying animal husbandry at cal poly shes going to run it sounds great does your family own the whole village she laughed i wish no just the house and cedrics pen and these back shops the front shops are owned by other people but theyre not around much granny from the gift shop died last summer and her family hasnt decided what they want to do no one believes the terrys are going to turn willow glen around but were sure going to try the population sign said four thirtytwo wheres everyone else i think that numbers high but there are other families a few growers the rest work down in yucaipa everyones on the other side of the village you have to drive through past the trees another laugh yeah its hard to see isnt it set up kind of to trap people she looked at my plate i gobbled in response pushed it away halffinished she was undeterred how about some deepdish i baked some just twenty minutes ago she looked so eager that i said sure she set a big square of pastry before me along with a spoon and said its so thick this is better than a fork then she refilled my coffee cup and waited again i put a spoonful of pie in my mouth if id been hungry it would have been great thin sugary crust crisp chunks of apple in light syrup tinged with cinnamon and sherry still warm this is terrific wendy you have a bright future as a chef she beamed well thank you much mister if you want another piece ill give it to you on the house got so much my hog brothers are only going to scarf it down without thanking me anyway i patted my stomach lets see how i do with this when id struggled through several more mouthfuls she said if youre not the state what brings you up here about looking for someone who shirlee and jasper ransom what would you want with them theyre related to a friend of mine related how im not sure maybe parents cant be a very close friend i put down my spoon its complicated wendy do you know where i can find them she hesitated when her eyes met mine they were hard with suspicion whats the matter i asked nothing i just like folks to be truthful what makes you think i havent been coming up here talking about shirlee and jasper maybe being someones parents driving all the way up here just to send regards its true if you had any idea who she stopped herself said im not going to be uncharitable lets just say i never knew them to have any relatives not in the five years ive lived here no visitors either she looked at her watch and tapped her fingers on the countertop you finished mister cause i have to close up do more studying i pushed my plate away wheres rural route four she shrugged moved down the counter and picked up her book i stood up check please five dollars even i gave her a five she took it by the corner avoiding my touch what is it wendy whyre you upset i know what you are what am i bank man looking to foreclose on the rest of the village just like you did with hugh and granny trying to sweettalk all the other deed holders buy up everything cheap so you can turn it into some condo project or something youre a terrific cook wendy but not too hot as a detective i have nothing to do with any banks im a psychologist from la my name is alex delaware i pulled id out of my wallet drivers license psychology license med school faculty card here see for yourself she pretended to be bored but studied the papers okay so what even if youre who you say you are whats your business here an old friend of mine another psychologist named sharon ransom died recently she left no next of kin theres some indication shes related to shirlee and jasper ransom i found their address thought they might want to talk howd this sharon die suicide that drained the color from her face how old was she thirtyfour she looked away busied herself with cutlery sharon ransom i said heard of her never never heard of jasper and shirlee having kids period youre mistaken mister maybe i said thanks for lunch she called after me all of willow glen is rural route four go past the schoolhouse about a mile theres an old abandoned press turn right and keep going but youre wasting your time i exited the village endured fifty yards of potholes before the dirt smoothed and the rural route sign appeared i drove past more orchards and several homesteads graced by sprawling wood houses and fenced with low split rails then a flag on a pole marking a twostory stone schoolhouse shaped like a milk carton and set in the middle of an oakshaded leafcarpeted playground the playground bled into forest the forest into mountain nametagged mailboxes lined the road rileys upick and pumpkins closed leidecker broward sutcliffe i drove past the abandoned apple press before realizing it backed up and pulled to the side of the road from that distance it looked like scrap corrugated steel sides ulcered with rust and caving inward mere fringes of tarpaper roof remaining exposing ageblackened rafters neckhigh weeds scrambling for the light surrounding the building was sunken land littered with spare parts deadwood and weeds that had reached the sun been baked to summer straw turn right and keep going i saw no road no entry remembered wendys distrust and wondered if shed led me wrong i kept the engine running and got out four oclock but sun was still pouring it on and within moments i was sweating the road was silent my nose picked up a skunk scent i shaded my eyes with my hand looked around and finally saw a bald spot in the weeds the barest outline of a pathway running alongside the press a shiny depression in the straw where rubber tires had finally vanquished the tangle i thought of walking didnt know how far in i had to go returning to the car i backed up until i found a dip in the shoulder and nosed down into the sunken field the seville didnt take well to rural travel it skidded and slid on the slick straw finally i got some traction and was able to negotiate my way onto the path i nudged the car forward past the press into an ocean of weeds the depression turned into a dirt path and i picked up speed crossed a broad field at the far end was a copse of weeping willows between the lacy leaves of the trees hints of metal more corrugated buildings shirlee and jasper ransom didnt seem like hospitable sorts wendy had thought it unlikely theyd ever been parents had stopped herself before explaining why not wanting to be uncharitable or had she been afraid perhaps sharon had escaped them escaped this place for good reason constructing fantasies of a pure and perfect childhood in order to block out a reality too terrible to confront i wondered what i was getting myself into let a jaspershirlee fantasy of my own float by mammoth rural mutants toothless and walleyed in filthy overalls surrounded by a pack of slavering fanged mutts and greeting my arrival with buckshot i stopped listened for dogs silence telling myself to keep the old imagination in check i gave the seville gas when i reached the willows there was no place for the car to enter i turned off the ignition stepped out walked under the drooping boughs and through the copse heard the trickle of water a voice humming tunelessly then came to the habitat of jasper and shirlee ransom two shacks on a small plot of dirt a pair of tiny primitive buildings sided with irregularly cut wood and roofed with tin in place of windows sheets of wax paper between the shacks was a wooden outhouse complete with a crescent hole in the door a rope clothesline was strung between the outhouse and one of the shacks faded garments were pinned to the hemp beyond the outhouse was a water tank on metal braces next to it a small electric generator half the property was planted with apple trees a dozen or so infant seedlings staked and tagged a woman stood watering them with a garden hose connected to the water tank water dribbled out from between her fingers making it appear as if she were leaking feeding the trees with her own body fluid the water spattered on the ground settled in muddy swirls turned to dirt soup she hadnt heard me sixties squat and very short four foot eight or nine gray hair cut in a pageboy and flat doughy features she squinted mouth open accentuating an underslung jaw a thatch of whiskers sprouted from her chin she wore a onepiece smock of blue print material that resembled bed sheeting the bottom hem was uneven her legs were pale and thick puddingsoft and unshaven she grasped the hose with both hands as if it were a live snake and concentrated on the water dribble i said hello she turned squinted several times raising the hose in the process the water squirted against the trunk of one of the saplings a smile guileless she waved her hand tentatively like a child meeting a stranger hello i repeated hullo her enunciation was poor i came closer mrs ransom that perplexed her shirlee several rapid nods thas me shirlee in her excitement she dropped the hose and it began to twirl and spit she tried to grab it couldnt caught a jet of water full in the face cried out and threw up her hands i retrieved the muddy rubber coil bent it and washed it off and gave it back to her thanku she rubbed her face on the shoulder of her smock trying to dry it i took out a clean handkerchief and dabbed at her face thanku sir shirlee my name is alex im a friend of sharons i steeled myself for an outpouring of grief got another smile brighter pretty sharon my heart ached i forced the words out nearly choked on the present tense yes she is pretty my sharon letter want to see it yes i do she looked down at the hose appeared lost in thought wait slowly deliberately she backed away from the saplings and made her way to the water tank it took a long time for her to turn off the spigot even longer to coil the tubing neatly on the ground when she was through she looked at me with pride great i said nice trees pretty apple mizz leiderk gave them me and jasper baby tree did you plant them yourselves giggle no gabeeel gabriel nod we take real good care im sure you do shirlee yes can i see that letter from sharon yes i followed her flatfooted shuffle into one of the shacks the walls were unpainted drywall streaked with waterstains the floor plywood the ceiling bare beams a particleboard partition had been used to bisect the space one half was a utility area small refrigerator electric hot plate ancient washer with rollers boxes of soap powder and insecticide sat next to the fridge on the other side was a lowceilinged room floored with a sheet of orange indooroutdoor carpeting a whitepainted castiron bed draped with an armysurplus blanket nearly filled the space the blanket was tucked tight with military corners against one wall was an electric heater the sun streamed in golden and gentle through waxpaper windows a broom was propped in one corner it had seen good use the place was spotless the only other furniture was a small raw pine dresser a box of crayons sat on top along with several pencils worn down to nubs and pads of pulp paper neatly stacked and weighed down with a rock the top sheet was a drawing apples primitive childish did you draw this shirlee jasp he a good drawer yes he is where is he now she left the cabin pointed toward the outhouse making i see draw real good i nodded agreement the letter shirlee oh she smiled wider cuffed the side of her head with one fist i forget we returned to the bedroom she opened one of the dresser drawers inside were precisely ordered piles of garments more of the same bleachedout stuff id seen on the clothesline she slid one hand under the clothes retrieved an envelope and handed it to me smudged with fingerprints handled to tissuefineness the postmark long island new york the address written in large block letters mr and mrs jasper ransom rural route willow glen california inside was a single sheet of white stationery the letterhead said forsythe teachers college for women woodburn manor long island ny the same block lettering had been used for the text dear mom and dad im

slipped the letter back into the envelope shirlee ransom was looking at me smiling it took several seconds before i could speak its a nice letter shirlee a beautiful letter yes i handed it back to her do you have more she shook her head we had lots big rains came in and whoosh she waved her arms everything wash away she said dollies toys papers she pointed to the waxpaper windows rain comes in why

after she became a teacher did she come back here to willow glen no too smart calfurna california yes far away did she write you from california troubled look i regretted the question yes whens the last time you heard from her she bit her finger twisted her mouth crismus last christmas yes without conviction shed talked about a sixteenyearold letter as if it had arrived today thought california was some distant place i wondered if she could read asked her christmas a long time ago yes something else atop the dresser caught my eye a corner of blue leatherette under the apple drawings i pulled it out a savings passbook from a bank in yucaipa she didnt seem to mind my intrusion feeling like a burglar anyway i opened the book several years worth of transactions in an unwavering pattern cash deposits on the first of each month occasional withdrawals a carryover balance of and some change the account was in trusteeship for jasper ransom and shirlee ransom cotenants the trustee helen a leidecker money said shirlee proud smile i put the book back where id found it shirlee where was sharon born look of bafflement did you give birth to her did she come out of your tummy giggles i heard footsteps and turned a man came in he saw me hitched up his pants raised his eyebrows and shuffled over to his wifes side he wasnt much bigger than she barely over five feet and about her age balding with virtually no chin and very large very softlooking blue eyes a fleshy nose tunneled between the eyes shadowing a protruding upper lip his mouth hung slightly open he had only a few yellowed teeth an andy gump face coated with fine white hair that resembled soap film his shoulders so narrow that his short arms seemed to grow out of his neck his hands dangled at his sides and ended in pudgy hands with splayed fingers he wore a white tshirt several sizes too large for him gray work pants tied with a string around the waist and hightop sneakers the pants were pressed his fly was open ooh jasp said shirlee hiding her mouth with her hand and pointing he looked puzzled she giggled and pulled up his zipper patted him playfully on the cheek he blushed looked down hi i said holding out my hand my name is alex he ignored me seemed preoccupied with his sneakers mr ransom jasper shirlee broke in don hear nuthin don talk i managed to catch his eye and mouthed the word hello blank stare i offered my hand again he threw rabbity glances around the room i turned to shirlee could you tell him im a friend of sharons she scratched her chin contemplated then screamed at him he know sharon sharon sharon the little mans eyes grew wide darted away from mine please tell him i like his drawings shirlee drawings shouted shirlee she did a crude pantomime of a moving pencil he like drawwings drawwings jasper screwed up his face drawwings silly jasp more pencil movements she took him by the hand and pointed to the stack of papers on the dresser then rotated him and pointed to me drawings i smiled said theyre beautiful uhh the sound was lowpitched guttural straining i remembered where id heard something like it resthaven drawwings shirlee was still shouting its all right i said thank you shirlee but by now she was performing from her own script drawings go go she gave his flat buttocks a shove he trotted out of the shack jasp gofer drawing said shirlee great shirlee we were talking about where sharon was born i asked you if she came out of your tummy silly she looked down and stretched the fabric of her dress tight over her abdomen stroked the soft protrusion no baby then how did she get to be your little girl the doughy face lit up eyes brightening with guile a present sharon was a present yes from who she shook her head who gave her to you as a present the headshake grew stronger why cant you tell me cant why not shirlee cant secret who told you to keep it secret cant secret seekrut she was frothing at the mouth looked ready to cry okay i said its good to keep a secret if thats what you promised secret i understand shirlee she sniffled smiled said uhoh water time and walked out i followed her to the yard jasper had just come out of the other shack and was walking toward us clutching several sheets of paper he saw me and waved them in the air i walked over and he shoved them at me more apples great jasper beautiful shirlee said water time and glanced at the hose jasper had left the door of the other shack open and i walked in a single unpartitioned space red carpeting a bed sat in the center canopied and covered with laceedged quilting the fabric was speckled with greenblack mold and rotted through i touched a piece of lace it turned to dust between my fingers the headboard and canopy frame were muddy with oxidation and gave off a bitter odor above the bed hanging from a nail driven crookedly into the drywall was a framed beatles poster a blowup of the rubber soul album the glass was streaked and cracked and flyspecked against the opposite wall was a chest of drawers covered with more decayed lace perfume bottles and glass figurines i tried to pick up a bottle but it stuck to the lace a trail of ants streamed over the chest top several dead silverfish lay strewn among the bottles the drawers were warped and hard to open the top one was empty except for more bugs same with all the others a sound came from the doorway shirlee and jasper were standing there holding each other like scared children weathering a storm her room i said just the way she left it shirlee nodded jasper looked at her imitated her i tried to picture sharon living with them being raised by them martinis in the sunroom i smiled to cover my sadness they smiled back also covering a servile anxiety waiting for my next command there was so much i wanted to ask them but i knew id gotten as many answers as i ever would i saw the fear in their eyes searched for the right words before i found them the doorway filled with flesh he wasnt much more than a kid seventeen or eighteen still peachfuzzed and babyfaced but enormous sixfive two ninety perhaps thirty of it baby fat with pink skin and a short neck broader than his moon face his hair was cut in a blond crewcut and he was trying without much success to grow a mustache his mouth was tiny and petulant his eyes halfobscured by rosy cheeks as large and round as softballs he wore faded jeans and an extraextralarge black cowboy shirt with white piping and pearl buttons the sleeves were rolled as far as they could go midway up pink forearms as thick as my thighs he stood behind the ransoms sweating giving off heat and a lockerroom odor whore you his voice was nasal hadnt totally crossed over to manliness my names alex delaware im a friend of sharon ransom she doesnt live here anymore i know that i drove up from he bothering you he demanded of shirlee she winced hullo gabeeel the kid softened his tone repeated his question as if used to doing so shirlee said he like jasp drawings gabriel i said im not out to cause any i dont care what youre out to do these people are special they need to be treated special he lowered an enormous paw onto each of the ransoms shoulders i said your mothers mrs leidecker what of it id like to speak with her he bunched his shoulders and his eyes became slits except for his size it would have seemed comical a little boy playing at machismo whats my mom got to do with it she was sharons teacher i was sharons friend there are things id like to talk to her about things that shouldnt be discussed in present company im sure you know what i mean the look on his face said he knew exactly what i meant he moved back from the doorway a bit and said mom doesnt need any upsetting either ive no intention of upsetting her just talking he thought for a while said okay mister ill take you to her but ill be there all the time so dont be getting any ideas he moved completely out of the doorway the sunlight returned come on you guys he told jasper and shirlee you should get back to those trees make sure each of them gets a good soak they looked up at him jasper handed him a drawing he said great jasp ill add it to my collection overenunciating then the manchild bent low and patted the head of the childish man shirlee grabbed his hand and he kissed her lightly on the forehead you take care of yourselves you hear keep watering those trees and soon well have something to pick together okay and dont talk to strangers shirlee nodded gravely then clapped her hands and giggled jasper smiled and gave him another drawing thanks again keep up the good work rembrandt to me come on we started to leave jasper ran after us grunting sounds we stopped he gave me a drawing turned away embarrassed i raised his weak chin with my hand mouthed thank you overenunciating just as the boy had jaspers grin said he understood i held out my hand this time he gave it a weak shake and held on come on mister said gabriel leave them be i patted the little mans hand and pried it loose followed gabriel toward the willows jogging to keep pace before stepping under the weeping green branches i looked back and saw the two of them hand in hand standing in the middle of their dirt lot staring after us as if we were explorers conquistadors setting out for some brave new world that they could never hope to see hed parked a big restored triumph motorcycle in back of the seville two helmets one candyapple red the other starred and striped dangled from the handlebars he put on the red one climbed on and kickstarted the bike i said who told you i was here wendy he ran his hand over his bristletop and tried to stare me down we take care of each other mister he gave the bike gas set off a dust storm in the dry weeds then did a wheelie and peeled out i jumped into the seville trailed him as quickly as i could lost sight of him past the abandoned press but found him a second later headed back toward the village i put on speed caught up we passed the mailbox that bore his family name kept going until the schoolhouse where he decelerated further and signaled right he shot up the driveway circled the playground came to a halt at the schoolhouse steps he climbed the stairs taking three at a time i followed noticed a wooden sign near the entrance willow glen school established once part of the blalock ranch the letters were rustic and burned into the wood same style on the sign marking la mar road a private road in holmby hills as i stopped to take that in gabriel made it to the top of the stairs threw open the door and let it swing shut behind him i ran up caught it and walked into a big airy schoolroom that smelled of fingerpaint and pencil shavings on the brightly painted walls were health and safety posters crayon drawings no apples blackboards hung on three walls below palmer penmanship guides an american flag dangled over a large round clock that put the time at facing each blackboard were about ten wooden school desks the oldfashioned type with narrow tops and inkwells a partners desk faced all three seating groups a fairhaired woman holding a pencil sat behind it gabriel stood over her whispering when he saw me he straightened and cleared his throat the woman put the pencil down and looked up she appeared to be in her early forties with short wavy hair and broad square shoulders she wore a shortsleeved white blouse her arms were tan fleshy ending in dainty longnailed hands gabriel whispered something to her i said hello and came closer she stood six feet or close to it and older than a first impression suggested late forties or early fifties the white blouse was tucked into a kneelength brown linen skirt she had heavy breasts a thin almost pinched waist that accentuated the breadth of her shoulders beneath the tan was a bed of ruddiness a suggestion of the same coral tone that blanketed her son like some perpetual sunburn she had a long pleasant face enhanced by carefully applied makeup full lips and large luminous amber eyes her nose was prominent her chin cleft and firmly set an open face strong and weathered hello she said without warmth what can i do for you sir i wanted to talk about sharon ransom im alex delaware hearing my name changed her she said oh in a weaker voice mom said gabriel taking her arm its all right honey go back to the house and let me talk to this man no way mom we dont know him its all right gabe moom gabriel if i tell you its all right then its all right now kindly get back to the house and attend to your chores the old spartans back of the pumpkin patch need pruning theres still plenty of corn to husk and the pumpkin vines need tying he grunted gave me the evil eye go gabey she said he removed his hand from her arm shot me another glare then pulled out his key ring and stomped out muttering thank you honey she called out just before the door closed when he was gone she said we lost mr leidecker last spring since then gabes been trying to replace his dad and im afraid hes grown overly protective a good son i said a wonderful one but hes still just a child the first time people meet him theyre overwhelmed by his size they dont realize that hes only sixteen i didnt hear his bike start did you no she walked to a window and yelled down i said back home gabriel leidecker get those vines propped up by the time i get back or its curtains for you kid protest noises floated up from below she stood in the window hands on hips such a baby she said with affection probably my fault i was much harder on his brothers how many children do you have five five boys all married and gone except for gabey subconsciously i probably want to keep him immature she shouted scoot and waved out the window the rumble of the triumph filtered up to us when the silence returned she shook my hand and said im helen leidecker forgive me for not greeting you properly gabe didnt tell me who you were or what you were about just that some city stranger was snooping around the ransoms place and wanting to talk to me she pointed to the school desks if you dont mind one of those please sit down brings back memories i said squeezing behind a frontrow seat oh really did you attend a school like this we had more than one room but the setting was similar where was that dr delaware dr delaware i hadnt given her my title missouri a midwesterner she said im originally from new york if someone had told me id end up in a sleepy little hamlet like willow glen id have thought it hilarious where in new york long island the hamptons not the wealthy part my people serviced the idle rich she went back behind her desk and sat if youre thirsty she said theres a cooler full of drinks around back but im afraid all weve got is milk chocolate milk or orange drink she smiled got younger again ive repeated that so many times its etched indelibly into my brain no thanks i said i had a big lunch wendys a wonderful cook isnt she wonderful early warning system too as i said dr delaware this is a sleepy little hamlet everyone knows everything about everybody does that include knowledge of shirlee and jasper ransom especially them they need special kindness especially now i said her face collapsed as if suddenly filleted oh gosh she said and opened a desk drawer taking out an embroidered handkerchief she dabbed at her eyes when she turned them on me again grief had made them even larger they dont read the papers she said can barely read a primer how am i going to tell them i had no answer for that i was weary of searching for answers do they have other family she shook her head she was all they had and me ive become their mother i know im going to have to deal with it she pressed the handkerchief to her face like a poultice please excuse me she said im as shaky as the day i read about itthat was a horror i just cant believe it she was so beautiful so alive yes she was for all intents and purposes i was the one who raised her and now shes gone blotted out as if she never existed in the first place such a damned ugly waste thinking about it makes me angry at her which is unfair it was her life she never asked for what i gave her never oh i dont know she averted her face her makeup had started to run she reminded me of a parade float the morning after i said it was her life but she left a lot of people grieving this is more than grief she said ive just been through that this is worse i thought i knew her like a daughter but all these years she must have been carrying around so much pain i had no idea she never expressed it no one knew i said she never really showed herself she threw up her hands and let them drop like dead weights what could have been so terrible that she lost all hope i dont know thats why im up here mrs leidecker helen alex alex she said alex delaware how strange to meet you after all these years in a way i feel i know you she told me all about you how much she loved you she considered you the one true love of her life even though she knew it could never work out because of your sister despite that she admired you so deeply for the way you devoted yourself to joan she must have read the shock on my face as pain and gave me a look rich with sympathy joan i said the poor thing hows she doing about the same she nodded sadly sharon knew her condition would never really improve but even though your commitment to joan meant you could never commit fully to anyone else she admired you for it if anything id say it intensified her love for you she talked about you as if you were a saint she felt that kind of family loyalty was so rare nowadays im hardly a saint i said but you are a good man and that old cliché remains valid as ever theyre hard to find a faraway look came onto her face mr leidecker was one taciturn a stubborn dutchman but a heart of gold gabe has some of that goodness hes a kind boy i only hope losing his dad so young doesnt harden him she stood up walked over to one of the blackboards and made a few cursory swipes with a rag the effort seemed to exhaust her she returned to her seat straightened papers and said its been a year for losses poor shirlee and jasper i so dread telling them its my own doing i changed their lives now the change has wrought tragedy theres no reason to blame you please she said gently i know its not rational but i cant help the way i feel if i hadnt gotten involved in their lives things would have been different but not necessarily better who knows she said her eyes had filled with tears who knows she looked at the clock on the wall ive been cooped up in here all afternoon grading papers i could really use a stretch me too as we descended the schoolhouse steps i pointed to the wooden sign the blalock ranch werent they into shipping or something steel and railroads it was never really a ranch back in the twenties they were competing with southern pacific for the rail lines connecting california with the rest of the country they surveyed san bernardino and riverside for an inland route and bought up a good chunk of both counties entire villages at a time they paid top dollar to get willow glen land away from the apple farmers whod homesteaded it since the civil war the result was a huge spread that they called a ranch but they never grew or raised anything on it just fenced it in and posted guards and the railroad was never built the depression after world war two they started selling some of the smaller parcels back to private people but several of the big tracts were snapped up by another corporation which one she patted her hair some aviation concern the one run by that mad billionaire belding she smiled and that dr delaware is your california history lesson for the day we entered the playground strolled past swings and slides headed toward the forest that carpeted the foot of the mountains does magna still own land here i asked plenty of it but they wont sell people have tried for all intents and purposes that keeps willow glen a backwater speck most of the old families have given up sold out to rich doctors and lawyers who use the orchards for tax writeoffs and run them down capped irrigation lines no pruning or fertilizing most of them dont even bother to come up and harvest in some places the earths turned hard and dry as cement the few growers whove stayed have become suspicious and mistrustful theyre convinced its all part of a conspiracy to run things down so the city folk can buy whats left on the cheap and put up condominiums or something thats what wendy thought her folks are newcomers really pretty naïve but you have to admire them for trying who owns the land jasper and shirlee live on thats magna land is that common knowledge mr leidecker told me and he was hardly a gossip howd they end up there no one knows according to mr leidecker i wasnt living here then they showed up at the general store to buy groceries back in back when there was a general store when people tried to talk to them jasper waved his hands and grunted and she giggled it was obvious they were retarded children wholl never grow up the prevailing theory is that they escaped from some institution maybe wandered away from a bus and ended up here by accident people help them when its needed but in general no one pays them much mind theyre harmless someone pays them mind i said five hundred dollars a month she gave a handinthecookiejar look i beg your pardon i saw their bankbook sitting on top of the dresser on the dresser what am i going to do with those two ive told them so many times to keep that book hidden tried to get them to let me keep it at my place but they think its some kind of symbol of freedom wont part with it they can get really stubborn when they want to jasper especially did you see those waxpaper windows on their shacks after all these years he still refuses to have glass installed poor shirlee freezes in the winter gabe and i have to bring down piles of blankets and by the end of the season theyre mildewed beyond repair the cold doesnt seem to bother jasper poor thing needs to be told to come in from the rain she shook her head on top of the dresser not that anyone from around here would hurt them but thats a lot of money to advertise especially for two defenseless innocents who sends it i asked ive never been able to find out it arrives like clockwork on the first of every month posted from the central depot in los angeles plain white envelope a typed address no return shirlee has no clear concept of time so she cant say how long shes been receiving it only that its been a long time there was a man ernest halverson used to deliver the mail until he retired in he thought he remembered envelopes arriving as early as or but hed had a couple of strokes by the time i talked to him and his memory wasnt perfect all the other oldtimers are long gone was it always five hundred no used to be three then four it went up to five after sharon left for college thoughtful benefactor i said but how could they be expected to handle that kind of money they couldnt they were living like animals until we began taking care of them wandering into town every couple of weeks with two or three twentydollar bills trying to buy groceries they had no idea how to make change or how much things were worth people are honest here they never took advantage wasnt there curiosity about where they were getting the money im sure there was but willow glen folk dont pry and no one realized how much money they were hoarding not until sharon discovered it thousands of dollars wadded up under the mattress or just loose in a drawer jasper had used several of the bills for art projects drawing mustaches on the faces folding them into paper airplanes how old was sharon when she made the discovery almost seven it was i remember the year because we had unusually hard winter rains those shacks were originally built for storage with only a thin cement pad underneath and i knew theyd be hit hard so we went over mr leidecker and myself sure enough it was dreadful their plot was halfflooded boggy the dirt running off like melted chocolate water had perforated the wax paper and was pouring in shirlee and jasper were standing kneedeep in mud scared and totally helpless i didnt see sharon went looking for her and found her in her shack standing on top of her bed wrapped in a blanket shivering and shouting something about green soup i had no idea what she was talking about i took her in my arms to warm her but she kept shouting about soup when we got outside mr leidecker was pointing all wideeyed at bits of green paper stuck in the mud and washing away in the flood money lots of it at first i thought it was play money id given sharon some board games but it wasnt it was real between mr leidecker and myself we managed to salvage most of it we hung the wet bills over our hearth to dry them put them in a cigar box and kept them safe first thing after the rains stopped i drove shirlee and jasper down to yucaipa and set up the bank account i sign for everything take a little out for expenses make sure they save the rest ive managed to teach them a little elementary math how to budget how to make change once they finally learn something they can usually retain it but theyll never really understand what theyve got quite a tidy little nest egg along with medical and social security the two of them should be comfortable for the rest of their days how old are they i have no idea because they dont they have no papers didnt even know their birthdays the government had never heard of them either when we applied for social security and medical we estimated their ages gave them birthdates miss new years and mr christmas you applied when sharon left for college yes i wanted to cover all bases how did you come up with sharons birthdate she and i decided on one when she was ten she smiled july fourth her declaration of independence i put i got a really good fix on her age from the doctor i took her to boneage xrays teeth height and weight she was somewhere between four and five she and i had celebrated a different birthday may may a rare splurge for dinner and dancing and lovemaking another fiction i wondered what that date symbolized any possibility i asked that she was their biological child unlikely the doctor examined all of them and said shirlee was almost certainly sterile so where did she come from right for a while i lived with the nightmare that she was someones kidnapped baby i went down to san bernardino and checked six years worth of papers from all around the country found a couple of cases that sounded possible but when i followed them up i learned that both of those children had been murdered so her origins remain clouded when you ask shirlee about it she just giggles and says sharon was given to them she told me it was a secret thats just a game with her playing secret theyre really just like children whats the prevailing theory about how they got her there really isnt one mind you the doctor wasnt absolutely certain shirlee couldnt conceivehighly unlikely was the way he put it so i suppose anythings possible though the notion of two poor souls like that producing something so exquisite is she trailed off no alex i have no idea sharon must have been curious about her roots youd expect her to be wouldnt you but she never really went through any identity search not even during adolescence she knew she was different from shirlee and jasper but she loved them accepted things the way they were the only conflict i ever saw was the summer before she left for college that was really hard for her she was excited and frightened and tremendously guilty about abandoning them she knew she was taking a giant step and things would never be the same she stopped bent picked up an oak leaf and twirled it between her fingers the sky between the trees was darkening unintimidated by city lights the stars were burning pinholes through the blackness whens the last time sharon visited here i asked a long time ago she said making it sound like a confession once she broke away she found it very painful to return that may sound callous but her situation was unique we walked on the schoolroom windows shone through the dark buttercolored rectangles we hadnt gone far had been walking in circles her last visit she said was in shed just graduated from college had been accepted to graduate school and was moving down to la i threw a little party for her at my house mr leidecker and the boys wore starched white shirts and matching ties and i bought new outfits for shirlee and jasper sharon arrived looking lovely a real picture she brought gifts for all of us a handmade wooden checkers set for shirlee and a tin of fancy colored pencils from england for jasper she also gave them a graduation picture full cap and gown with an honors tassel i didnt see that back at the shack no somehow they managed to lose it just like the money they never knew what they had still dont you can understand why sharon would have no place here its a miracle she survived before i found her shirlee did show me a letter how often did she write not regularly what was the point theyre only marginally literate but she called me regularly to see how they were doing she really cared about them she threw away the leaf it was so hard for her please understand that she really struggled with breaking away the guilt was nearly overwhelming i told her she was doing the right thing what was the alternative being stuck forever as a caretaker she stopped oh im so sorry that was thoughtless for a moment i was puzzled by her embarrassment joan i said i think your devotion is wonderful i shrugged dr noble im comfortable with my choice yes sharon said you were and thats my point she had to make her own choices she couldnt be bound by some strange twist of fate when did she tell you about joan about six months after the graduation party her first year of grad school she called to ask about shirlee and jasper but she sounded troubled i could tell something else was on her mind i asked if she wanted to get together and to my surprise she said yes we met for lunch in redlands she looked like a real professional woman perfectly groomed mature but sad a blue angel i asked her why she said shed met the man of her dreams spent a lot of time describing your virtues i said sounds like hes perfect why the long face then she told me about joan how it would never work out because of her did she tell you what caused joans problems the drowning oh yes how terrible and you a little boy watching she touched my arm in a gesture of comfort she understood alex she wasnt bitter or angry is that all that was troubling her thats all she talked about when did you see her next she bit her lip never that was the last time she did continue to call but less and less frequently half a year later the calls stopped but we got cards on christmas fruitofthemonth packages she managed a weak smile everything but the apples several yards later she said i understood though id helped her shed her old life i was still part of it she needed to make a complete break years later when she got her phd she sent me an invitation to her commencement shed made it to the top finally felt secure enough to reconnect did you go no it arrived late the day after the ceremony mail mixup happens all the time on a rural route no mail mixup had prevented the monthly cash payments to the ransoms i said nothing all those years she said i felt i understood her now i realize i was deluding myself i barely knew her we walked toward yellow windows i said how did you and sharon actually meet my old dogooder busybody personality asserting itself it was shortly after my marriage right after mr leidecker brought me back here in she shook her head said thirty years then nothing else i said moving from the big city to willow glen must have been pretty jarring for you oh it was after college i got a position teaching at a private school on the upper east side of manhattan children of the rich nights i volunteered at the uso thats where i met mr leidecker he was in the army taking courses at city college courtesy of uncle sam he came into the hall one night looking absolutely forlorn we struck up a conversation he was very handsome very sweet so different from the fast shallow men id been encountering in the city when he talked about willow glen he made it sound like paradise he loved the land his roots here run deep his family came out from pennsylvania for the gold rush got as far as willow glen and settled for golden delicious he always used to say that two months later i was married a schoolmarm in a oneroom school we reached the stone building she looked up at the sky my husband was a taciturn man but he knew how to tell a tale he played the guitar beautifully and sang like a dream we made a good life together sounds wonderful i said oh it was i came to love this place the people here are solid and decent the children are almost touchingly innocent even more so before we got cable tv but one always makes tradeoffs once upon a time i fancied myself an intellectual not that i was but i did love to attend poetry readings in greenwich village visit art galleries listen to the bandshell concerts in central park i loved the whole city scene new york was a lovely place back then cleaner safer ideas seemed to burst right out of the sidewalks we were at the bottom of the schoolroom stairs the light from above spilled over her face lit flames in her eyes her hip brushed against mine she moved away quickly and fluffed her hair willow glen is a cultural desert she said climbing i belong to four book clubs subscribe to twenty monthly periodicals but believe me its no substitute in the beginning i made mr leidecker drive me to la for the philharmonic san diego for the shakespeare festival at the old globe he did it without complaining good soul that he was but i knew he detested it he never stayed awake through a single show and eventually i stopped putting him through it the only play ive seen in years is the one i write myself the christmas pageant that the children put on god rest ye merry gentlemen accompanied by my offkey piano thumping she laughed at least the children enjoy it theyre not very sophisticated around here at home the emphasis is on making a living sharon was different she had a rapacious mind just loved to learn amazing i said considering her home life yes truly amazing especially when you consider the state she was in when i first laid eyes on her the way she blossomed was a miracle i feel privileged to have been part of it no matter how things turned out she choked back tears pushed the door and walked quickly to her desk i watched as she tidied up how i repeated did the two of you actually meet right after i got here i kept hearing my pupils talk about a family of retardstheir term not mine living out behind the old abandoned cider press two grownups and a little girl who ran around naked and chattered like a monkey at first i thought it was just schoolyard fantasy the kind of thing children love to make up but when i mentioned it to mr leidecker he said oh sure thats jasper and shirlee ransom theyre feebleminded but harmless just shrugged it off the old village idiot thing what about the child i asked is she feebleminded too why hasnt she been enrolled in school has she been inoculated has anyone bothered to give her a decent checkup or seen to it that she gets proper nutrition that made him stop and think and he got a bothered look on his face you know helen he said i never much thought about that he was ashamed thats the kind of man he was the very next afternoon after school i drove down the road found the press and went looking for them it was just as the children had described tobacco road those pathetic shacks and they were a lot worse before we fixed them up no indoor plumbing electricity or gas heat water from an old hand pump with god knows what kind of organisms in it before we supplied the trees just a dry dirt patch shirlee and jasper just standing there smiling at me following me around but not putting up a lick of protest when i went into their shack inside i got my first surprise id expected chaos but everything was scrubbed down with lye soap extremely wellkept all the clothes folded neatly beds you could bounce a dime on and the two of them are very diligent about their hygiene though they do neglect their teeth welltrained i said yes as if someone had drilled the basics into them which supports the institution theory unfortunately that training didnt extend to child care sharon was filthy that gorgeous black hair so dusty it looked tan all matted and tangled with burrs the first time i laid eyes on her she was up in one of the willow trees crouched on a limb naked as a jay with something shiny in her hands staring down with those huge blue eyes looking indeed like a little monkey i asked shirlee to have her come down shirlee called up to her called her by her name yes sharon that we didnt have to improvise shirlee kept calling begging her to come down but sharon ignored her it was clear there was no parental authority they couldnt control her finally after i pretended to ignore her she scampered down kept her distance and stared at me but not afraid on the contrary she seemed actually happy to see a new face then she did something that really took me by surprise the shiny thing shed been holding was an open jar of mayonnaise she stuck one hand into it scooped out a big glob and began eating it flies smelled it and began crawling all over her i took the jar away she squawked but not too loudly she craved discipline i put my arm around her she seemed to like that she smelled foul looked like one of those feral children you hear about but despite that she was absolutely gorgeous that face those eyes i sat her down on a stump held up the mayo jar and said this is eaten with tuna or ham not by itself shirlee was listening she started to giggle sharon took her cue laughed and ran her greasy hands through her hair then she said i like it by itself clear as a bell it shocked me id assumed she was retarded too had little or no speech i took a close look at her and saw something a quickness in her eyes the way she responded to my movements definitely something upstairs she was also very well coordinated when i commented on what an excellent climber she was she showed off for me shinnied up the tree did cartwheels and handstands shirlee and jasper watched and clapped their hands to them she was a toy i asked them if i could take her with me for a few hours they agreed without hesitation even though theyd never met me no parentchild bond though they were clearly delighted with her kissed and hugged her a lot before we left how did sharon react to being taken away she wasnt happy but she didnt fight it she especially didnt like it when i tried to cover her with a blanket funny thing is once she got used to clothes she never liked to take them off as if being naked reminded her of the way shed been i said im sure it did and thought of backseat love she actually became quite a fashion plate used to pore over my magazines and cut out the ones she liked she never liked pants only dresses fifties dresses i said what was it like the first time you brought her home she allowed me to take her by the hand and climbed up into the car as if shed ridden in one before during the ride i tried to talk to her but she just sat there staring out the window when we reached my house she got out squatted and defecated on the driveway when i gasped she seemed genuinely surprised as if doing that sort of thing was perfectly normal it was obvious thered been absolutely no limitsetting of any sort i took her inside sat her on the commode washed her up combed out the tangles at that point she began screaming bloody murder then i dressed her in one of mr leideckers old shirts sat her down and fed her a proper dinner she ate like a lumberjack got off the chair and started to squat again i hauled her into the bathroom made her mind that was the beginning she knew i cared but she did talk fluently it was strange uneven sometimes whole phrases would pour out then shed be at a loss to describe something simple she had giant holes in her knowledge of the world when she got frustrated shed start to grunt and point like jasper but not in any sort of sign language i was trained in american sign and neither she nor jasper knew it though ive taught him a little bit since he has his own primitive language when he bothers to communicate at all thats the environment she was living in before i found her from that to phd i said i told you it was a miracle she learned astonishingly quickly four months of steady drilling to get her talking properly another three to teach her to read she was ready for it an empty glass waiting to be filled the more time i spent with her the clearer it became that not only wasnt she retarded she was gifted highly gifted and previously educated by someone whod taught her about cars whole phrases then punched holes in her knowledge of the world helen had stopped talking was holding her hand to her mouth breathing deeply all for nothing she looked at the clock on the wall im sorry i have to go now i hitched a ride with gabe he bought me a helmet with his own money how could i refuse poor things probably beside himself suspecting god knows what id be happy to give you a lift she hesitated then said all right give me a couple of minutes to close up her house was large and peakroofed and floodlit trimmed generously with white gingerbread and set back from the road behind half an acre of thriving orchard gabes bike was parked near the front porch next to an old chevy truck and a honda accord she led me around to the side door and we entered through the kitchen gabe sat at the table his back to us husking corn and listening to loud rap music on a ghetto blaster not much smaller than the honda ears of corn were piled chinhigh he worked slowly but steadily bobbing in time to the music she kissed the top of his head he gave her a sympathybegging look of misery when he saw me the misery turned to anger she turned down the volume on the blaster he said whats with him dont be rude gabriel daddy taught you better than that the mention of his father made him look like a small lost child he pouted picked up an ear of corn tore off the husk and idly shredded the silk his mother said dr delaware is a guest you will stay for dinner doctor i had no need of food but was hungry for facts be pleased to i said thank you very much gabe mumbled something hostile the music was still loud enough to block out his words but not his meaning clean up and set the table gabriel perhaps nutrition will restore your manners i ate mom what did you have chicken pie the rest of the potatoes the snap beans the pumpkin bread all the pumpkin bread kids grin yup and for dessert the ice cream leave any for sweettoothed mom the grin faded sorry thats okay sweetie she said tousling his hair i need to cut down you did me a favor he spread his hands over the pile of corn and gave her an imploring look look how much i got done can i quit for tonight she crossed her arms tried to look stern all right youll pick up with the rest tomorrow what about homework did it all of it yes maam fine youre free on bail he stood gave me a look that said dont let me get you alone and made a show of cracking his knuckles ive told you not to do that gabriel youll ruin your hands sorry she kissed him again now off with you he made it to the doorway said uh mom what is it can i go into town that depends on what youre going to do there russell and brad called theres a movie at the sixplex in redlands which one top gun whos driving brad all right just as long as its not russell in that soupedup jeep of his one neàrmiss is enough do i make myself clear young man yes maam all right dont betray my trust gabe and be home by eleven thanks he lumbered out so happy to be free that he forgot to glare at me the dining room was big and dark and the smell of lavender permeated the papered walls the furniture was old carved black walnut heavy drapes masked the windows and faded family portraits in antique frames hung in the empty spaces a pictorial history of the leidecker clan at various stages of development helen had once been beautiful her looks enhanced by a generous smile that might never be resuscitated her four older sons were shaggyhaired beanpoles who resembled her their father was a yellowbearded barrelchested precursor to gabe whod started life as a bald pink squinting sphere of suet sharon was in none of the pictures i helped set the table with china and silver and linen napkins noticed a guitar case on the floor next to the china cabinet mr leideckers she said no matter how many times i told him to put it away it always ended up there he played so well i really didnt mind now i just leave it there sometimes i feel its the music i miss the most she looked so low that i said i play do you then by all means i opened the case inside was an old gibson l vintage thirties nestled in blue plush mint condition the inlays undamaged the wood freshly polished the gold plating on the tailpiece and tuners gleaming as if new it gave off that wetcat odor that old instruments acquire i lifted it strummed the open strings tuned shed gone back into the kitchen and called out come in here so i can listen i brought the guitar in sat down at the table and fingered a few jazz chords while she fixed chicken mashed potatoes corn beans and fresh lemonade the guitar had a warm rich tone and i played la mer using djangos liquid gypsy arrangement very pretty she said but i could tell that jazz even warm jazz wasnt her thing i switched to fingerpicking played something melodic and countrified in cmajor and her face got young she brought the food to the table huge quantities of it i put the guitar away she seated me at the head positioned herself to my right and smiled nervously i was taking a dead mans place felt something was expected of me some protocol that i could never hope to master that and the ceremonious way she filled my plate put me in a melancholy mood she toyed with her food and watched me while i forced myself to eat i got down as much as i could paid compliments in between bites and waited until shed cleared the dishes and brought apple pie before saying the graduation picture that the ransoms lost did sharon give one to you oh that she said her shoulders drooped and her eyes moistened i felt as if id thrown a drowning survivor back into icy waters before i could say anything she sprang up disappeared down the hall she returned with an eightbyten photo in a maroon velvet standup frame handed it to me as if passing the sacrament and stood over me as i studied it sharon beaming in crimson cap and gown with a gold tassel and shoulder braid her black hair longer flowing over her shoulders her face radiant without blemish the epitome of allamerican college womanhood staring off into the distance with youthful optimism envisioning a rosy future or just some campus photographers idea of what proud parents liked for their mantels in the bottom lefthand corner of the photo was goldleaf lettering ephegians class of forsythe teachers college for women long island ny your alma mater i said yes she sat down held the picture to her bosom she always wanted to be a teacher i knew forsythe was the right place for her rigorous and protective enough to cushion her from the shock of going out into the world the seventies were a rough time and shed led a sheltered life she loved it there got straight as graduated summa cum laude better than leland belding she was very bright i said she was a brilliant girl alex not that some things werent a struggle in the very beginning toilet training for one and all the social things but i just dug my heels in and stuck with it good practice for when i had to train my boys but anything intellectual she absorbed like a sponge how did your boys get along with her no sibling rivalry if thats what you mean she was tender with them loving like some terrific older sister and she wasnt threatening because she went home every night in the beginning that was hard for me i wanted so much to adopt her make her all mine and let her lead a normal life but in their own way shirlee and jasper did love her and she loved them too it would have been wrong to destroy that wrong to rob those two of the only precious thing they owned somehow theyd been given a jewel my job was to polish her keep her safe i taught her about being a lady brought her pretty things a pretty canopied bed but kept it there with them she never spent the night with you she shook her head i sent her home it was best years later with me shed sent herself home i have trouble sleeping anywhere but my own bed early patterns early trauma she was happy just the way things were alex she thrived thats why i never called in the authorities some social worker from the city would have come down taken one look at shirlee and jasper and stuck them in an institution for the rest of their lives with sharon farmed out to a foster home paperwork and bureaucracy shed have slipped between the cracks my way was best summa cum laude i said tapping the photo certainly seems so she was a pleasure to teach i tutored her intensively until she was seven then enrolled her in my school shed done so well she was actually ahead of her classmates ready for thirdgrade work but her social skills were still weak she was shy around children her own age accustomed to playing with eric and michael who were still babies how did the other children relate to her at first as an oddity there were lots of cruel comments but i put an end to them right away she never did get really sociable wasnt what youd call popular but she did learn to mix when it was necessary as they got older the boys started to notice her looks but she wasnt into that kind of thing was mostly concerned with getting good grades she wanted to be a teacher to make something of herself and she was always at the head of the class that wasnt just my bias because when she went down to yucaipa for junior high and high school she got consistent straight as including honors courses and her scores on the sat were among the highest in the school she could have gotten in anywhere didnt need me for acceptance to forsythe as it was they gave her a full scholarship plus stipend when did she change her mind about becoming a teacher beginning of her senior year shed majored in psychology given her background you could see why shed be interested in human nature no offense but she never said anything about actually becoming a psychologist until she went to a careers day at long island university representatives of various professions sitting at tables handing out literature and counseling students she met a psychologist there a professor who really impressed her and apparently she impressed him as well he told her shed make an excellent psychologist was quite adamant about it to the point of offering to sponsor her he was moving to los angeles guaranteed her acceptance to graduate school there if she wanted it it was a real boost for her to see herself as a doctor what was this professors name she never told it to me you never asked her she was always a private person told me what she wanted me to know i came to learn that the worst way to get anything out of her was to ask how about some pie id love to but im really full well im going to have some i crave something sweet i just really crave that right now i learned nothing more through a half hour of photo albums and family anecdotes some of the snapshots featured sharon lithe smiling beautiful as a child enchanting as a teenager mothering the boys when i commented on them helen said nothing by nine oclock an awkwardness had settled between us like two kids whod gone further than they should have on the first date we were pulling back when i thanked her for her time she was eager to see me leave i left willow glen at five after and was back on route fortyfive minutes later my freeway companions were semis hauling produce flatbeds loaded with specimen trees and hay i started to feel logy and tried listening to music that made me even drowsier and i pulled off near fontana into the lot of a combo selfserve shell station and twentyfourhour truck stop inside were scuffed gray counters red vinyl booths mended with duct tape rotating racks of freeway toys and hard heavy silence a couple of broadbacked teamsters and one sunkeneyed drifter sat at the counter ignoring overtheshoulder glances i took a corner booth that provided the illusion of privacy a thin waitress with a portwine stain on her left cheek filled my cup with industrialstrength liquid caffeine and i filled my mind with a tempest of questions sharon queen of deception shed risen literally from the muck made something of herself in fulfillment of helen leideckers pygmalion dream that dream had been tinged by selfishness helens desire to relive her urban intellectual fantasies through sharon but no less sincere for that and shed wrought a remarkable transformation a wild child tamed chiseled and buffed into a paragon of scholarship and good breeding top of the class summa cum laude but helen had never been given all the pieces to the puzzle had no idea what had taken place during the first four years of sharons life the formative years when the mortar of identity is blended the foundation of character set and hardened i thought once again of that night id found her with the silent partner photo naked regressed to the days before helen had found her a twoyearold boys tantrum kept coming to mind early trauma blocking out the horror what horror for sharon whod raised her for the first three years of her life bridging the gap between linda lanier and helen leidecker not the ransoms they were too dull to have taught her about cars about language i remembered the two of them gazing after gabe and me as we left their dirt patch their sole souvenir of parenthood a letter your only little girl shed used the same phrase to refer to another set of parents noël coward bon vivants whod never existed not in manhattan palm beach long island or la martinis in the sunroom waxpaper windows separating the two a galactic abyss the impossible leap between wishful thinking and dismal reality shed tried to bridge that gap with lies and halftruths fabricating an identity out of the fragments of other peoples lives losing herself in the process her pain and shame must have been terrible for the first time since her death i let myself feel really sorry for her fragments a park avenue snippet from wellborn kruse a car crash orphan story lifted from leland beldings bio a ladylike demeanor and love for erudition from helen leidecker no doubt shed sat at helens feet absorbing stories about the way the idle rich comported themselves out in the hamptons had enhanced her knowledge as a forsythe student strolling past the gated entrances of sprawling beach estates collecting mental images like bits of broken seashell images that enabled her to paint me a toovivid picture of chauffeurs and clam spouts two little girls in a pool house shirlee joan sharon jean shed rotated the story of the drowned twin one way for helen another for me lying to those she ostensibly loved with the ease of brushing her hair pseudotwinship identity problems two little girls eating ice cream mirrorimage twins pseudo multiple personality elmo castelmaine was certain shirlee had been born crippled which meant she couldnt be one of the children id seen in the sawtoothedged photo but he was relying on information sharon had provided or lying himself not that there was any reason to doubt him but id grown allergic to trust and what was to say the crippled woman was really a twin a relation of any kind she and sharon had shared general physical traits hair color eye color that id accepted as proof of sisterhood accepted what sharon had told me about shirlee because at the time thered been no reason not to shirlee if that was even her name shirlee with two es sharon had made a point of the two es named after her adoptive mother more symbolism joan another mindgame all those years helen had said i felt i understood her now i realize i was deluding myself i barely knew her welcome to the club teach i knew that the way sharon had lived and died had been programmed by something that had taken place before helen had discovered her gorging on mayonnaise the early years i drank coffee explored blind alleys my thoughts shifted to darren burkhalter his fathers head landing on the backseat like some bloody beachball the early years unfinished business mal had chalked up another victory hed get a new mercedes and darren would grow up a rich kid but all the money in the world couldnt expunge that image from a twoyearold mind i thought about all the misborn afflicted children id treated tiny bodies hurled into lifes storm with all the selfdetermination of dandelion husks something told to me by a patient came to mind the bitter farewell comment of a once selfconfident man whod just buried his only child if god exists doc he fucking well has a nasty sense of humor had some sick joke dominated sharons formative years if so who was the comedian a smalltown girl named linda lanier was one half of the biologic equation whod supplied the other twentythree chromosomes some hollywood hangeron or onenightstand mattress jockey an obstetrician with an afterhours sideline scraping away life a billionaire i sat in that café and thought about it for a long time and kept coming back to leland belding sharon had grown up on magna land lived in a magna house her mother had made love to beldingoffice boys knew that martinis in his sunroom but if belding had sired her why had he abandoned her palmed her off on the ransoms in exchange for squatting rights and paper money in an unmarked envelope twenty years later the house the car reunion had he finally acknowledged her created an heir but he was supposed to have died six years before that what of his other heir the other little ice cream eater doubleabandonment two dirt patches i considered the little i knew about belding obsessed with machines precision a hermit cold cold enough to set up the mother of his children hypothetical ugly i dropped my spoon the clatter broke through the silence of the truck stop you okay said the waitress standing over me coffeepot in hand i looked up yeah sure im fine her expression said shed heard that one before more she hefted the pot no thanks i pushed money at her stood and left the truck stop had no trouble staying awake all the way to la i got home just after midnight adrenalinejolted and drunk on riddles milo rarely went to bed before one i called his house rick picked up the phone projecting that odd groggy vigilance that er docs acquire after years on the front lines dr silverman rick its alex alex oh what time is it twelveten sorry for waking you sokay no sweat yawn alex what time is it anyway twelveten rick exhalation oh yeah i can see that confirmed by the luminescent dial another yawn just got in an hour ago alex double shift couple hours of down time before the next one kicks in must have dozed off seems a reasonable response to fatigue rick go back to sleep no gotta shower get some food down milos not here stuck on night watch night watch he hasnt done that for a while didnt have to for a while seniority yesterday trapp changed the rules pig thats the pits not to worry alex the big guyll get even hes been pacing a lot got that look in his eye half pit bull half pit bull i know the one okay ill try him at the station just in case please leave him a message to call me will do goodnight rick good morning alex i phoned west la detectives the cop who answered sounded groggier than rick he told me detective sturgis was out had no idea when he was returning i got into bed and finally dozed off i awoke at seven wondering what progress trapp had made with the kruse killings when i went out on the terrace to get the papers milo was out there slumped in a chaise longue reading the sports section i said how bout them dodgers big fella the voice was someone elses hoarse and thick he lowered the paper looked at me then out over the glen what army camped in your mouth i shrugged he inhaled deeply still taking in the view ah the good life i fed your fish could swear that big blackandgold ones growing teeth ive been training him on shark chum hows life on the night watch peachy he stood and stretched who told you rick i called you last night woke him up sounds like trapps back on the warpath he grunted we went into the house he fixed himself a bowl of cheerios and milk stood at the counter and spooned the cereal down nonstop before pausing to catch his breath hand me a napkin yeah its a regular funfest working the twilight zone paperwork on the cases that the guys from pm conveniently neglect to finish processing lots of duis and overdoses toward the end of shift most of the calls are bullshit everyone talking and moving real slow bad guys and good guys like the whole damned citys on quaaludes i caught two dbs both of which turned out to be accidentals but at least i get to check out some heterosexual corpses he smiled we all rot the same he went to the refrigerator took out a container of orange juice poured a glass for me and kept the carton for himself i said to what do i owe the pleasure showandtell time i was driving back home listening to the scanner when something interesting popped up on beverly hills frequency burglary call on north crescent drive he recited the address the fontaines house i said green mansions itself i detoured to get a looksee guess who the detective turned out to be our old buddy dickie cash guess he hasnt sold his screenplay yet i spun him some yarn about it maybe being related to a hotprowl homicide out in brentwood and got the basic details breakin occurred sometime during the early morning hours sophisticated job there was a hightech security system but the right wires were cut and the alarm company never picked up a tweet only reason anyone caught on was that a neighbor spotted an open door out to the rear alley early this morning our little friend playing chames bond no doubt cash let me inside the house real good taste those two master bedroom has a mural of big pink drooling lips the inventory of missing items is fairly typical for that neighborhood some porcelain and silver couple of widescreen tvs stereo equipment but plenty of really expensive stuff left behind three more tvs jewelry furs better silver all easy to fence not much of a haul after all that wirecutting dickie was intrigued but not inclined to do much about it in view of absentee victims the fact that they werent courteous enough to leave a forwarding with his department what about the basement museum he ran his hand over his face dickie doesnt know about any museum and guilty as it made me feel i didnt educate him he did show me the elevator but there was no key or the access code to operate it not listed with the alarm company either but if they ever do get down there ten to one the place will look like pompeii after the big lava party tying up loose ends i said he nodded question is who any idea where the fontaines are bahamas bijans dad was less than helpful beverly hills cab only had a record of taking them to the airport but i did manage to trace the car storage company and through them the travel agency firstclass passage la to miami ditto to nassau they kept moving after that but the agent couldnt or wouldnt say where there was no way for me to push the issue my guess is one of the smaller remote islands bad phone lines rum drinks named after birds and monkeys banks that make the swiss look nosy kind of environment where someone with cash could stay cozy for a long time he finished the juice then the cereal raised the bowl to his lips and drank the milk whereve you been anyway he said and what were you calling me about last night i told him what id learned in willow glen weird he said very weird but i dont hear any crime unless she was kidnapped as a kid am i missing something i shook my head i want to run some ideas by you he filled the bowl again run lets say sharon and her twin were the result of an affair between leland belding and linda lanier a partygirl thing that went further than usual according to crotty he singled her out she used to go to his office linda kept the pregnancy secret because she was worried belding would force her to terminate how could she know that maybe she knew he didnt like children or maybe she was making an educated guess belding was a cold man shunned relationships the last thing he would have wanted was an heir he hadnt planned make sense so far go on crotty saw lanier and donald neurath together playing coochycoo what if neurath was her doctor as well as her lover they met on a professional level and it went further theme of the loop the loop was a cartoon of their relationship compressed for posterity he sat back put his spoon down she starts as a party girl with belding takes it further starts as a patient with neurath takes it further she was beautiful but more than that an expert seductress she had to have had something special for belding to pick her out from all the other party girls as her gynecologist neurath would be among the first to know she was pregnant maybe the first if hed gotten deeply emotionally involved with her finding out she was carrying another mans child could have made him angry jealous what if he offered to abort it and she refused he then threatened to tell belding lindas back was up against the wall she told her brother and his extortionists mind came up with a plot seduce neurath on film get leverage cable worked at the studio had access to equipment it wouldnt have been hard for him to set it up milo chewed on that for a long time then said and cable being a sleazeball figures out how to make some extra cash on the deal sells a copy of the loop to some collector i nodded gordon fontaine or someone else who eventually sells it to him years later paul kruse comes across it sees the resemblance to sharon and gets curious but thats jumping the gun lets stick with linda for a moment when her pregnancy shows she leaves town gives birth to twins sometime between spring and summer of now she figures its safe to tell belding aborting a fetus is one thing rejecting two adorable girl babies is another maybe brother cable builds up her confidence visions of dollar signs would be dancing in front of his eyes linda pays belding a visit shows him the girls states her demand make an honest woman out of me or shell out enough money so the kids uncle cable and i can live happily ever after milo gave a sour look sounds just like the kind of stupid scam stone losers always try to pull the dumb story you piece together after theyve ended up on a slab it was stupid the johnsons were pennyante players they gravely underestimated the threat they posed to belding and his lack of compassion the twins would be his sole heirs his entire fortune was at stake monstrous loss of control for a man used to being master of his own destiny this is a man who didnt believe in sharing the wealth never took his business public he wouldnt have tolerated a single careless afternoon coming back to haunt him as linda talked to him the wheels started turning but he didnt show it put on a happy face played the proud papa expressed his good will by putting all of them up in that penthouse on fountain bought them a car furs jewels instant entree to the good life and all he asked in return was that they keep the babies a secret until the moment was right to go public buying himself a little time the johnsons complied a pair of hicks in hog heaven up until the day they died and the twins remained a secret cold said milo but it makes sense doesnt it hummel and degranzfeld were beldings boys narcotics detectives in a perfect position to set up a phony dope bust bankrolled by belding they could get their hands on plenty of heroin they kept the uniforms outside went into that apartment alone to set up the shootout arrange the crime scene but getting rid of linda and cable solved only part of beldings problem he was still stuck with two little babies he didnt want under the best of circumstances raising twins is a challenge for someone like belding the prospect would have been overwhelming a lot scarier than designing girdles or buying up companies so he resorted to habitbought his way out of it and his deal with the ransoms was a lot cheaper than any he would have had to cut with linda and cable the same arrangement with sharons twin and some other couple some other dirt lot no helen leidecker the other girl ending up crippled or set up his own kids mother to be ripped off then sold them ultracold he was a cold man milo a misanthrope who preferred machines to people he never married never developed normal attachments ended up a hermit according to the hoax book according to everyone seaman cross just embellished reality and you know babies get abandoned all the time with a lot less reason casa de los niños was full of them why the ransoms he said what connection would a billionaire have with people like that maybe none when i say belding did these things i dont mean literally he probably never got his hands dirty had some intermediary like billy vidal handle it that was his specialty procuring people for beldings needs where the intermediary found them who knows but their being retarded would be a plus not a minus theyd be passive obedient not likely to get greedy or ask questions they think concretely are stubborn good at keeping secrets or forgetting i had an exhibition of that just yesterday on top of that they were anonymous neither of them even knew their birthdays no government agency had any record of them not until when sharon went away to college and helen leidecker decided they needed extra protection and took it upon herself to file for medical and social security if she hadnt id never have found them milo said if ransom hadnt named the crippled woman after shirlee yes and i dont profess to understand that she was full of weird symbols but be that as it may giving a child to shirlee and jasper was equivalent to erasing that childs identity perhaps belding never even expected her to survive but helen leidecker discovered her tutored her sent her out into the world out to kruse kruse went to that careers day at liu under the guise of altruism but he was a predator a lecher and a power junkie always on the prowl for new disciples maybe he was attracted by sharons looks or maybe hed seen linda laniers loop and was struck by the resemblance in either case he turned on the charisma got her talking about herself saw how evasive she was about her background and grew even more intrigued the two of them were a perfect match for mind control she molded by helen no real roots he lusting to play svengali jim jones and the koolaid gang milos big face had darkened with anger on a onetoone level i said he got up and brought back a beer as he drank i said he took her under his wing milo convinced her shed make a great psychologist her grades made that realistic brought her out to california with him set her up in grad school set himself up as her adviser he supervised her cases which always involves some therapy he turned it into intensive therapy for kruse that meant bizarre communications hypnotic manipulation like many people with confused identities she was an excellent hypnotic subject his power role in their relationship increased her susceptibility he ageregressed her exposed early childhood memories that intrigued him further some sort of early trauma that she was unaware of on a conscious level maybe even something about belding kruse started snooping and making movies i nodded an updated version of her mothers loop part of the therapy kruse probably presented it to her in terms of reattaching her to her roots to mother love his game was controlling her building up one part of her tearing down another using hypnosis he could suggest amnesia keep her consciously unaware end up knowing more about her than she knew herself he fed her bits of her own subconscious in calculated nibbles kept her dependent insecure psychological warfare no matter what you saw in vietnam he was an expert then when the time was right he turned her loose on belding big bread bigtime control and i think i know exactly when it happened milo the summer of she disappeared with no explanation for two months the next time i saw her she had a sports car a house a damned comfortable lifestyle for a grad student without a job my first thought was that kruse was keeping her she knew that even made a joke about it told me the inheritance story which we now know was bullshit but maybe in a sense there was some truth to it shed put in a claim on her birthright but it played havoc with her mind accentuated her identity problems the time i found her staring at the twin picture she was in some kind of trance almost catatonic when she realized i was standing there she went crazy i was sure we were through then she called me up asked me to come over and came on to me like a nymphomaniac years later she was doing the same thing with her patients patients kruse set her up with she never got her license remained his assistant worked out of offices he paid the rent on i felt my own rage grow kruse was in a position to help her but all the bastard did was play with her head instead of treating her he had her write up her own case as a phony case history and use it for her dissertation probably his idea of a joke thumbing his nose at the rules one problem said milo by belding was long dead maybe not cross admitted he lied milo i dont know whats true and whats not but even if belding was dead magna lived on lots of money and power to leech off lets say kruse leaned on the corporation on billy vidal whyd they let him get away with it for twelve years whyd they let him live ive been turning that over in my mind and i still cant come up with an answer the only thing i can come up with was that kruse also had something on vidals sister something they couldnt risk coming out she endowed his professorship set him up as department head ive been told it was gratitude he treated a child of hers but in her husbands obituary there was no mention of children maybe she remarried and had some i was going to check on that before i found out about willow glen maybe said milo the blalock thing is just a cover vidal using his sister as a screen with the payoff really coming from magna maybe but that still doesnt explain why they let him get away with it for so long he got up paced drank beer had another so i said what do you think what i think is youve got something there what i also think is we may never get to the bottom of it people thirty years in the grave and it all depends on belding being the daddy how the hell you going to verify that i dont know he paced some more said lets get back to the here and now for a sec why did ransom kill herself maybe it was grief over kruses death or maybe it wasnt suicide i know theres no proof im just hypothesizing what about the kruse killings like we said before rasmussens not exactly your corporate hit man the only reason we latched on to rasmussen was that he talked about doing terrible things around the time the kruses were murdered not just that he said asshole had a history of violence killed his own father i liked all that psych stuff you dished out killing daddy all over again to paraphrase an expert that aint evidence pal given rasmussens history terrible things could mean anything fucking pretzel he said round and around theres someone who could clear it up for us vidal alive and well in el segundo right milo said lets just waltz into his office and announce to his secretarys assistants gofer that we want an audience with the big boss friendly little chat about child abandonment blackmail inheritance claims multiple murder i threw up my hands went to get a beer of my own dont get miffed he called after me im not trying to piss on your parade just striving to keep things logical i know i know its just damned frustrating how she died or the things she did when she was alive both sergeant freud he used his finger to draw a happy face in the frost of his glass something else the twin photo how old were the girls in it about three so they couldnt have been separated from birth alex meaning either both were cared for by someone else or both were given to the ransoms so what the hell happened to the sister helen leidecker never mentioned a second girl living in willow glen did you ask her no didnt bring up the picture no she seemed honest no it just didnt come up he said nothing okay i said flunk me in freshman interrogation easy he said just trying to get a clear picture if you get one share it with me goddammit milo maybe the damned picture wasnt even sharon and her sister i dont know what the hell is real anymore he let me stew then said suggesting you let go of it all would be stupid i suppose i didnt answer before you indulge yourself in selfcontempt alex why not just give the leidecker woman a call ask her about the picture and if you get a weird reaction thatll be the tipoff that she hasnt been honest annie which could mean more coverup as in the twin was hurt under suspicious circumstances and shes trying to protect someone who the ransoms i dont see them as abusers not abusers neglecters you yourself said they werent parent material could barely cope with one kid two would have been impossible what if they turned their back at the wrong moment and one twin had an accident as in drowning as in my head was spinning id crammed all night was still floundering milo leaned over and patted my shoulder dont fret even if we cant take it to court we can always sell it to the movies show dickie cash the way its done call my agent i said have your people call my people and lets take a power bran muffin i forced a smile have you checked port wallace birth records yet not yet if youre right about lanier going home to have her baby hometown would be the perfect place assuming she never read thomas wolfe how about you give a call down there and see what you come up with start with the chamber of commerce and find out the names of any hospitals doing business back in if youre lucky and they hold on to records a little lying will pry it out of them say youre some kind of bureaucrat theyll do anything to get rid of you if nothing pans out check out the county registrar call helen call port wallace any more assignments sir hey you want to play sleuth develop a taste for the tedious stuff the safe stuff he scowled damn right alex think back to what the kruses and the escobar girl looked like and how fast the fontaines lit out for coconut country if youre right about a tenth of this were dealing with people with very long arms he made a circle with thumb and forefinger released the finger as if flicking away a speck of dust poof life is fragile something i got from freshman philosophy stay inside keep your doors locked dont take candy from strangers he rinsed out his bowl put it in the drainer saluted and began to leave where are you off to got something i have to follow up on the something that kept you from calling port wallace stalking the wild trapp he glowered at me i said rick assured me youre going to get him rick should stick to cutting up people for fun and profit yeah im gunning for the scrote found a soft spot on top of his other virtues he has a penchant for females of the underage persuasion how underage teenage jailbait when he was back in hollywood division he was heavily into the police scouts earned himself a departmental commendation for public service beyond the call of blah blah part of that service was providing personal guidance to some of the more comely young lady scouts howd you find this out classic source disgruntled former employee female officer hispanic couple of years behind me in the academy she used to work the hollywood evidence room took leave to have a baby after she returned trapp made her life so miserable she opted for stress disability and quit few years ago i ran into her downtown day of her final hearing racking my brains for a hook into trapp made me remember she really hated him i looked her up and paid her a visit shes married to an accountant got a fat little kid nice split level in simi valley but even after all these years talking about trapp made her eyes bulge he used to grope her make racist comments how mexican girls lost their virginity before their baby teeth what brownnose really means all of it delivered in a tio taco accent why didnt she report it when it was happening why didnt all those kids at casa de los niños tell anyone what was happening to them fear intimidation back then the city didnt believe in sexual harassment filing a complaint would have meant exposing her entire sexual history to internal affairs and the press and shed been known to party these days her consciousness is raised she realizes how badly she got screwed and is sitting on a lot of rage but she hasnt talked about it to anyone certainly not hubby after she spilled her guts she made me swear i wouldnt drag her into anything so ive got knowledge that i cant use but if i can find corroboration the bastards good as gone he walked to the door and that my friend is where im choosing to focus my extracurricular attention good luck yeah ill work it from my end maybe itll all connect and well meet in gloccamorra meanwhile watch your rear you too sturgis yours aint scorchproof i got helen leideckers number from san bernardino information no answer frustrated but relieved i hadnt relished testing her integrity i found a us atlas and located port wallace texas in the southernmost part of the state just west of laredo a faint black speck on the texas side of the rio grande i called the operator for the south texas area code dialed information and asked for the port wallace chamber of commerce one second sir came the drawled reply followed by clicks and several computer squeaks no such listing sir are there any government offices listed in port wallace ill check sir click a united states post office sir ill take that hold for that number sir i called the post office no answer there either checked my watch eight am here two hours later there maybe they believed in the leisurely life i called again nothing so much for my assignments but there was still plenty to do the research library had a single listing for neurath donald a book on fertility published by a university press and housed across campus in the biomedical library the date and subject matter fit but it was hard to reconcile an abortionist with the author of something that scholarly nevertheless i made the trek to biomed consulted the index medicus and found two other articles on fertility authored in and by a donald neurath with a los angeles address the la county medical association directory features photos of members i found the one from and flipped to the ns his face jumped out at me slicked hair pencilline mustache and lemonsucking expression as if life had treated him poorly or maybe it was living too close to the edge his office was on wilshire just where crotty had put it a member of ama education at a firstrate medical school excellent internship and residency an academic appointment at the school that loosely employed me the two faces of dr n another split identity i hurried to the biomed stacks found his book and the two articles the former was an edited compendium of current fertility research eight chapters by other doctors the last one by neurath his research involved the treatment of infertility with injections of sex hormones to stimulate ovulation revolutionary stuff during a period in which human fertility remained a medical mystery neurath emphasized this listed previous treatments as slapshot and generally unsuccessful endometrial biopsies surgical enlargement of the pelvic veins implantation of radioactive metal in the uterus even longterm psychoanalysis combined with tranquilizers to overcome ovulationblocking anxiety stemming from hostile motherdaughter identification though researchers had begun to make a connection between sex hormones and ovulation as early as the s experimentation had been limited to animals neurath had taken it a step further injecting half a dozen barren women with hormones obtained from the ovaries and pituitaries of female cadavers combining the injections with a regimen of temperaturetaking and blood tests in order to get a precise fix on the time of ovulation after several months of repeated treatments three of the women became pregnant two suffered miscarriages but one carried a healthy baby to term while stressing that his findings were preliminary and needed to be replicated by controlled studies neurath suggested that hormonal manipulation promised hope for childless couples and should be attempted on a large scale the article was a shorter version of the book chapter the one from was a letter to the editor responding to the article by a group of doctors who complained that neuraths treating of humans was premature based on flimsy data and his findings were tainted by poor research design medical science the letter emphasized knew little about the effects of gonadotropic hormones on general health in addition to not helping his patients neurath might very well be endangering them he countered with a fourparagraph retort that boiled down to the ends justified the means but he hadnt published further fertility and abortion neurath giveth neurath taketh away power on an intoxicating level power lust loomed as the motivating force behind so many of the lives that had brushed up against sharons i wanted very much to speak to dr donald neurath looked him up in the current county directory and found nothing i kept backtracking his last entry was very busy year i searched the journal of the american medical association for obituaries neuraths was in the june issue hed died in august of the previous year age fortyfive of unspecified causes while vacationing in mexico same month same year as linda lanier and brother cable the effects of gonadotropic hormones ahead of his time pieces began to fall into place a new slant on an old problem improbable but it explained so many other things i thought of something else another part of the puzzle crying out for solution left biomed and headed for the north side of campus running feeling lightfooted for the first time in a long time the special collections room was in the basement of the research library down a long quiet hall that discouraged casual dropins smallish cool humiditycontrolled furnished with dark oak reading tables that matched the raised panels on the walls i showed my faculty card and my requisition slip to the librarian he went searching and came back shortly with everything i wanted handed me two pencils and a pad of lined paper then went back to studying his chemistry book there were two other people hunkered down for serious study a woman in a batik dress examining an old map with a magnifying glass and a fat man in a blue blazer gray slacks and ascot alternating trifocaled attention between a folio of audubon prints and a laptop computer by comparison my own reading material was unimpressive a pile of small books bound in blue cloth selections from the la social register thin paper and small print neatly ordered listings of country clubs charity galas genealogical societies but mainly a roster of the right people addresses phone numbers ancestral minutiae selfcongratulation for those whose fascination with the usthem game hadnt ended in high school i found what i wanted quickly enough copied down names connected the dots until the truth or something damned close to it began to take shape closer and closer but still theoretical i left the room found a phone still no answer at helen leideckers but a sleepy male voice answered in port wallace texas brothertons is this the post office post office tackle and bait pickled eggs cold beer name your game were game this is mr baxter state of california bureau of records los angeles branch la hows the quake situation shaky hacking laugh what can i do for yall california weve received an application from a certain

where to find out the same vinecrusted fieldstone walls and mentholated air the same long shady stretch past the wooden slab sign this time i was driving la legitimate but the silence and the solitude and the knowledge of what i was about to do made me feel like a trespasser i pulled up in front of the gates and used the phone on the stand to call the house no answer i tried again a male midatlantic voice answered blalock residence mrs blalock please who shall i say is calling sir dr alex delaware pause is she expecting you dr delaware no but shell want to see me ramey im sorry sir she isnt tell her it concerns the exploits of the marchesa di orano silence would you like me to spell that ramey no answer are you still with me ramey yes sir of course i could talk to the press instead they always love a human interest story especially one with heavy irony that wont be necessary sir one moment sir moments later the gates slid open i got back in the car and drove up the fishscale drive the verdigris roofs of the mansion were gold at the peaks where the sunlight made contact emptied of tents the grounds looked even more vast the fountains threw off opalescent spray that thinned and dissipated while still arcing the pools below were shimmering ellipses of liquid mercury i parked in front of the limestone steps and climbed to an immense landing guarded by statuary lions recumbent but snarling one of the double entry doors was open ramey stood holding it all pink face black serge and white linen this way sir no emotion no sign of recognition i walked past him and in larry had said the entry hall was big enough to skate in it could have accommodated a hockey stadium three stories of white marble rich with moldings flutings and emblems backed by a doublecarved white marble staircase that would have put tara to shame a concerthallsized chandelier hung from the goldleaf coffered ceiling the floors were more white marble inlaid with diamonds of black granite and polished to glass giltframed portraits of dyspepticlooking colonial types hung between columns of precisely pleated ruby velvet drapes tied back with beefy gold cord ramey veered right with the smoothness of a limousine on legs and led me down a long dim portrait gallery then opened another set of double doors and showed me into a hot bright sunroom a tiffany skylight forming the roof one wall of beveled mirror three of glass that looked out onto infinite lawns and impossibly gnarled trees the flooring was malachite and granite in a pattern that would have given pause to escher healthylooking palms and bromeliads sat in chinese porcelain pots the furniture was sage and maroon wicker with darkgreen cushions and glasstopped tables hope blalock sat on a wicker divan within her reach was a bar on wheels holding an assortment of decanters and a crystal pitcher frosted opaque she didnt look nearly as robust as her plants wore a black silk dress and black shoes no makeup or jewelry shed drawn her hair back in a chestnut bun that gleamed like polished hardwood and she stroked it absently as she sat at the very edge of the divan barely lowering rump to fabric as if daring gravity she ignored my arrival continued staring out through one of the glass walls ankles crossed one hand in her lap the other gripping a cocktail glass halffilled with something clear in which an olive floated madam said the butler thank you ramey her voice was throaty tinged with brass she waved the butler away waved me toward a chair i sat opposite her she met my gaze her complexion was the color of overcooked spaghetti overlaid with a fine mesh of wrinkles her aquablue eyes could have been beautiful but for sparse lashes and deep gray sockets that made them stand out like gems in dirty silver frown lines tugged at her mouth a halo of postmenopausal down encircled her unpowdered face i gazed at her glass martini would you care for a splash doctor thank you the wrong answer she frowned touched one finger to the pitcher and dotted the frost these are vodka martinis she said that will be fine the drink was strong and very dry and made the roof of my mouth ache she waited until id swallowed before taking a sip but took a long one i said nice sunroom have them in all your homes just what kind of doctor are you psychologist i might have said witch doctor but of course and just what is it you want i want you to confirm some theories i have about your family history the skin around her lips turned white my family history what concern is that of yours i just got back from willow glen she put her glass down her unsteadiness made it rattle against the tabletop willow glen she said i believe we used to own land there but not any longer i fail to see while i was there i ran into shirlee and jasper ransom her eyes widened squeezed shut and reopened she gave a hard forced blink as if she hoped she could make me disappear im sure i dont know what youre talking about then why did you agree to see me the lesser of two evils you mention my daughter make vulgar threats about going to the press people of our station are constantly subjected to harassment it behooves us to know what kind of baseless rumors are being circulated baseless i said and vulgar i sat back crossed my legs and sipped it must have been hard for you i said covering for her all these years palm beach rome here her lips formed an o she started to say something shook her head favored me with another hand wave and gave a look that said i was something the maid had neglected to sweep up psychologists keepers of secrets brassy laugh how much do you want doctor im not interested in your money a louder laugh oh everyones interested in my money im like some bag of blood crusted with leeches the only question is how much blood each of them gets hard to think of shirlee and jasper as leeches i said though i suppose over time youve been able to turn things around and see yourself as the victim i got up inspected one of the bromeliads graygreen striped leaves pink flowers i touched a petal silk i realized all the plants were actually i said the two of them have done quite well for themselves much better than you ever expected how long did you figure theyd last living out there in the dirt she didnt reply i said cash in an envelope for people who didnt know how to make change a dirt lot two shacks and letshopeforthebest very generous as was the other gift you gave them though at the time i imagine you didnt view it as a gift more of a throwaway like old clothes to your favorite charity she shot to her feet shook a fist that trembled so violently she had to restrain it with her other hand who the hell are you and what do you want im an old friend of sharon ransoms also known as jewel rae johnson sharon jean blalock take your pick she sank back down oh god a close friend i said close enough to care about her to want to understand how and why she hung her head this cant be happening not again it isnt im not kruse im not interested in exploiting your problems mrs blalock all i want is the truth from the beginning a shake of the gleaming head no i its impossible wrong of you to do this i got up took hold of the pitcher and filled her glass ill start i said you fill in the blanks please she said looking up suddenly no more than a pale old woman its over done with you obviously know enough to understand how ive suffered you havent a patent on suffering even kruse suffered oh spare me some people reap what they sow a spasm of hatred passed across her face then settled on it changing it damaging it like some palsy of the spirit what about lourdes escobar mrs blalock what did she sow im not familiar with that name i wouldnt expect you to be she was the kruses maid twentytwo years old she just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and ended up looking like dog food thats disgusting i had nothing to do with anyones death you set wheels in motion trying to solve your little problem now its finally solved thirty years too late stop she was gasping hands pressed to her chest i looked the other way fingered a silk palm frond she breathed theatrically for a while saw it wasnt working and settled down to a silent smolder you have no right she said im not strong the truth i said the truth the truth and then what and then nothing then im gone oh yes she said oh yes of course just like your trainer with your pockets empty and fairy tales come true i came closer stared down at her no one trained me i said not kruse or anyone else and let me tell you a fairy tale once upon a time there was a young woman beautiful and rich a veritable princess and like a princess in a fairy tale she had everything except the thing she wanted the most another hard forced blink when her eyes opened something behind them had died she needed both hands to bring her glass to her lips put it down empty another refill down the hatch i said the princess prayed and prayed but nothing helped finally one day her prayers were answered just like magic but things didnt turn out the way she thought they would she couldnt handle her good fortune had to make arrangements she said he told you everything the monster he promised me damn him to hell i shook my head no one told me anything the information was there for the looking your husbands obituary in listed no children neither do any of your blue book entries until the following year then two new entries sharon jean sherry marie hands back on chest oh my god i said it must have frustrated a man like him having no heirs him a mans man but his seed was all water she took a long swallow of martini not that it stopped him from blaming me why didnt the two of you adopt henry wouldnt hear of it a blalock by blood mgirl nothing else would do his death created an opportunity i said brother billy saw that and seized the moment when he showed up a few months after the funeral and told you what he had for you you thought your prayers had been answered the timing was perfect let everyone think old henry had finally come through in spades bequeathed you not one but two beautiful little baby girls they were beautiful she said so tiny but already beautiful my own little girls you renamed them beautiful new names she said for a new life where did your brother tell you he got them he didnt just that their mother had fallen on hard times and couldnt care for them anymore hard times the hardest werent you curious absolutely not billy said the less i knew the less any of us knew the better that way when they got older and started to ask questions id be able to honestly say i didnt know im sure you disapprove doctor you psychologists preach the gospel of open communication everyone bleeding all over everyone else i dont see that society is any better for your vile meddling she emptied her glass again i was ready with the pitcher when shed finished most of the refill i said when did things start to go bad bad between the girls she closed her eyes put her head back against the cushion in the beginning things were lovelyexactly like a dream come true they were bookends so perfect perfect blue eyes black hair pink cheeks a pair of little bisque dolls i had my seamstress fashion them dozens of matching outfits teensy gowns and bonnets chemises and booties their feet were so tiny the booties were no larger than a thimble i took a shopping excursion to europe brought back the loveliest things for the nursery an entire collection of real bisque dolls handprinted wall coverings a pair of exquisite louis quatorze cradles their bedroom always smelled sweet with freshcut flowers and sachets that i prepared myself she lowered her arms allowing the glass to tilt a rivulet of liquid ran down the side and speckled the stone floor she didnt move i broke into her reverie when did the troubles start mrs blalock dont pick at me young man how old were they when the conflict became apparent early i dont recall exactly i stared waited oh she shook a fist at me it was so long ago how on earth can i be expected to remember seven eight months old i dont know theyd just started crawling and getting into everything how old are babies when they do that seven eight months sounds right tell me about it whats there to tell they were identical but were so different conflict was inevitable different in what way sherry was active dominant strong in body and spirit she knew what she wanted and went right for it wouldnt take no for an answer she gave a smile satisfied strange what was sharon like a wilted flower ephemeral distant she sat and played with one thing over and over and over never demanded a thing one never knew what was on her mind the two of them established their roles and played them to the hilt leader and follower just like a little stage play if there was a bit of candy or a toy that they both wanted sherry would just move right in bowl sharon over and take it away in the very beginning sharon put up some resistance but she never won and soon she learned that one way or the other sherry was going to triumph that strange smile again applauding that triumph the smile id seen so many times on the faces of ineffectual parents saddled with extremely disturbed aggressive youngsters hes so aggressive such a tiger smile she beat up the little girl next door really demolished her the poor thing smile hes a real asskicker my boy gonna get into serious trouble one day smile the doasifeel notasisay smile legitimizing bullying granting permission to knock down gouge scrape pummel and above all win the kind of offkilter response guaranteed to get a therapist hmming and noting inappropriate affect in the chart and knowing treatment wouldnt be easy poor sharon really did get knocked around mrs blalock said what did you do about it what could i do i tried reasoning with them told sharon she needed to face up to sherry be more selfconfident i informed sherry in no uncertain terms that this was no way for a young lady to behave but the moment i was gone theyd revert to type i do believe it was a little game between them collaboration she was right about that but shed gotten the players wrong she said im long past blaming myself their characters were predetermined programmed from the very start in the end nature triumphs thats why your field will never amount to much was there anything positive about their relationship oh i suppose they loved each other when they werent fighting there were the usual hugs and kisses and they had their own little nonsense language that no one else understood and despite the rivalry they were inseparable sherry leading sharon tagging behind taking her licks but always the fighting competition for everything strange phenomenon mirrorimage monozygotes given an identical genetic structure there should be no differences at all sherry always won she was saying smile by the age of two shed become a real little martinet a little stage director telling sharon where to stand what to say when to say it if sharon dared not to listen sherry lashed out slapping and kicking and biting i tried to separate them forbade them to play with one another even got them separate nannies howd they react to being separated sherry threw tantrums broke things sharon just huddled in the corner as if in a trance eventually they always managed to sneak back and reconnect because they needed each other werent complete without each other silent partners i said no reaction i was always the outsider she said it wasnt a good situation not for any of us they drove me to distraction getting away with hurting her sister wasnt good for sherry it hurt her too perhaps even more than it hurt sharon bones may mend but once injured the mind never seems to set properly were sharons bones ever actually broken of course not she said as if addressing an idiot i was speaking figuratively how serious were her injuries it wasnt child abuse if thats what youre getting at nothing we had to call a doctor for clumps of hair pulled out bites scratches by the time she was two sherry knew how to raise a nasty bruise but nothing serious until the drowning the glass in her hand began to shake i filled it waited until shed drained it kept the pitcher at hand how old were they when it happened a little over three our first summer away together where my place in southampton the shoals item one on a list id just read in a social register skylark in holmby hills le dauphin in palm beach an unnamed flat in rome her real children another sunroom i said a latticed pool house my knowing shook her further she swallowed hard you seem to know everything i really dont see the need far from everything refill i smiled she looked at me with gratitude boozers version of the stockholm syndrome bottoms up she drank shuddered drank some more said heres to glorious glorious truth the drowning i said how did it happen it was the last day of holiday early autumn i was up in my sunroom i love sunrooms merging with nature ive had sunrooms in all of my homes the one at the shoals was the finest more of a pavilion actually an old english look comfy and warm i was sitting there looking out at the atlantic its a more intimate ocean the atlantic dont you think definitely compared to the pacific which is so undemanding at least thats what ive always believed she held her glass up squinted sloshed vodka i said where were the girls she tightened her grip on the glass raised her voice ah where were the girls playing what else do little girls do playing down on the beach with a nanny a slabfaced english pudding i paid her passage from liverpool gave her my best old gowns lovely quarters she came with recommendations the slut flirting with ramey with the hired help with anything in pants that day she was batting her lashes at the groundsman and took her eyes off the girls they snuck into the pool house the latticed pool house which was supposed to be locked and wasnt heads rolled that day they rolled she emptied her glass belched softly and looked mortified i pretended not to notice said then what happened thenfinally the pudding realized they were gone went looking for them heard laughter from the pool house when she got there sherry was standing by the side of the pool slapping her knees laughing the idiot asked where sharon was sherry pointed to the pool the stupid pudding looked over and saw one arm sticking out of the water she jumped in managed to pull sharon out the pool was filthy ready to be drained until spring both of them got slimy it served the slut right and sherry kept laughing i said she let go of the glass it rolled down her lap hit the stone floor and shattered the shards formed a wet gemlike mosaic that transfixed her yes laughing she said such merriment through it all how seriously was sharon injured not seriously at all just her pride shed swallowed some water the dumb cluck fiddled with her and she vomited all of it up i arrived just in time to see that all that brown water shooting out of her revolting when did you realize it hadnt been an accident sherry marched up to us thumping her little chest saying i push her just like that i push her as if she was proud of it i thought she was joking away her fear told ramey to take her away give her some warm milk and soft biscuits but she struggled began screaming i push her i push her claiming credit then she broke away from him ran over to where sharon was lying and tried to kick her to roll her over back into the pool shake of head smile later when sharon was feeling better she confirmed it sherry push me and there was a bruise on her back tiny little knuckle marks she stared at the liquid on the floor with longing i dribbled some martini into another glass and handed it to her eyeing the miserly portion she frowned but drank then licked the rim with the look of a child flouting table manners she wanted to do it again right in front of me wanted me to see it thats when i knew it was serious they couldnt had to be separated couldnt be together ever again enter brother billy billy always took good care of me why the ransoms they worked for us for billy where in palm beach making beds cleaning where did they come from originally a place near the everglades one of our acquaintances a very fine doctor took in the feebleminded taught them honest labor how to be good citizens trained properly you know they make the best workers everything scrubbed down with lye soap all the clothes folded neatly beds you could bounce a dime on as if someone had trained them in the basics a long time ago living near the swamps all that mud theyd have felt right at home on their dirt patch green soup the doctor and henry were golf chums she was saying henry always made a point of hiring freddys the doctors imbeciles for grounds work fruitpicking repetitive things he believed it was our civic responsibility to help and you were helping them further when you gave them sharon she missed the sarcasm seized on the rationalization yes i knew they couldnt have children shirleed been fixed freddy had all of them fixed for their own good billy said wed be giving her them the greatest gift anyone could give while solving our problem at the same time everyone comes out a winner yes exactly why did it have to be done i said why not keep sharon at home and send sherry away for some kind of treatment her reply sounded rehearsed sherry needed me more she was really the needy one and times borne me out on that two progeny in the blue book through after that only one my guesses turned to fact the pieces finally fitting but it sickened me like a badnews diagnosis i loosened my tie clenched my jaw what did you tell your friends no answer that shed died pneumonia was there a funeral she shook her head we let it be known we wanted things private our wishes were respected in lieu of flowers donations to planned parenthood thousands of dollars were donated more winners i said i felt like throttling a little insight into her instead i slipped on the therapists mask pretended she was a patient told myself to be understanding nonjudgmental but even as i smiled the horror stayed with me the bottom line just another sickening sordid childabuse case psychopathology fueling cruelty a weak dependent woman despising her weakness projecting that hatred onto the child she saw as weak seeing another childs viciousness as strength envying it feeding it one way or the other sherry was going to triumph she was tilting her head back trying to suck nourishment from an empty glass i was cold with rage felt a chill in my bones even through the haze of intoxication she picked up on it her smile vanished i lifted the pitcher she held up one arm ready to ward off a blow i shook my head apportioned more martini what did you hope to accomplish peace she said barely audible stability for everyone did you get it no answer no surprise i said the girls loved each other needed each other they shared a private world theyd created by separating them you destroyed that world sherry would have had to get worse much worse she looked down said she put it out of her mind how did you go about doing it what do you mean the mechanics of the transfer how exactly did you do it sharon knew shirlee and jasper theyd played with her been kind to her she liked them she was happy going off with them going off where on a shopping trip that never ended the arm rose in defense again she was happy better off not being pummeled what about sherry what explanation did she get i i told her that sharon had she submerged the rest of her sentence in vodka i said you told her sharon had died that shed been in an accident and wouldnt be coming back what kind of accident just an accident at sherrys age she would have assumed the drowning did it that shed killed her sister no impossible ridiculous shed seen sharon survive this was days after at that age none of that would have made a difference oh no you cant accuse me of no i didnt wouldnt ever have done anything so cruel to sherry she kept asking for sharon didnt she for a while then she stopped put it out of her mind did she stop having nightmares too her expression told me all my years of schooling hadnt been wasted no those if you know everything why are you putting me through this heres something else i know after sharon was gone sherry was terrified separation anxietys the primal fear at three and her fear kept climbing she started to lash out get more violent began taking it out on you another good guess yes she said eager to be the victim she threw the most horrid tantrums id ever seen more than tantrums fits animal fits wouldnt let me hold her kicked me bit me spit at me destroyed things one day she walked into my bedroom and deliberately broke my favorite tang vase right in front of me when i scolded her she snatched up a manicure scissors and went for my arm i needed stitches what did you do about this new problem i started to think more seriously about her origins her biology i asked billy he told me her lineage wasnt choice but i refused to be discouraged by that made improving her my main project i thought a change of scenery might help i closed up this house took her back with me to palm beach my place there is tranquil rare palms lovely big bay windows one of addison mizners best i thought the ambience the rhythm of the waves would calm her a couple of thousand miles between her and willow glen i said no that had nothing to do with it sharon was out of her life was she she stared at me began to cry but without tears as if she were a dry well had nothing to draw upon i did my best she finally said in a strangled voice sent her to the best nursery school the very best id attended it myself she had dance lessons equestrian training charm school boat rides junior cotillion to no avail she wasnt good around other children people started to talk i decided she needed more of my individual attention devoted myself to her we went to europe a few thousand more miles to your place in rome my atelier she said henry gave it to me when i was studying art on the way there we took the grand tour london paris monte carlo gstaad vienna i bought her a darling set of miniature luggage to match mine had a whole new wardrobe made up for her even a little fur coat with matching hat she loved dressing up she could be so sweet and charming when she wanted beautiful and poised just like royalty i wanted her exposed to the finer things in life to compensate for her origins yes i refused to see her as incorrigible i loved her how did the trip go she didnt answer throughout all of this did you ever consider reuniting her with sharon it came to mind but i didnt know how i didnt think it was best dont look at me like that i was doing what i thought was best did you ever think of sharon of how she was doing billy gave me reports she was fine doing just fine they were sweet people they are and they did a damned good job of raising her considering what they had to work with but did you really expect them to make it yes i did of course i did what do you take me for she was thriving it was the best thing for her mayonnaise from a jar waxpaper windows i said until last week i i dont know about that no im sure you wouldnt lets get back to sherry given her social problems how did she do in school she went through ten schools in three years after that we used tutors when did you first take her to kruse she looked down at her empty glass i rationed another inch she polished it off i said how old was she when he started treating her ten why didnt you seek help before then i thought i could work things out myself what made you change your mind she hurt another child at a birthday party hurt how why must you know this oh all right whats the difference im already stripped raw they were playing pin the tail on the donkey she missed the donkey and got angry she despised losing tore off her blindfold and stuck the pin into a little boys rear the birthday boy the child was a brat the parents were nouveau riche social climbers utterly without sense they made a mountain out of a molehill threatened to call the police unless i took her to someone whyd you choose kruse i knew him socially my people had known his people for generations he had a lovely home not far from mine with a beautiful office suite on the ground floor complete with a private entrance i thought hed be discreet she laughed a drunken strident laugh i dont seem to be much for prescience do i tell me about the treatment four sessions a week one hundred twentyfive dollars a session payment for ten sessions in advance what diagnosis did he give you he never gave me one what about treatment goals methods no nothing like that all he said was that she had serious problems character problems and needed intensive therapy when i tried to ask questions he made it very clear that everything that went on between them was confidential i was forbidden to be involved at all i didnt like that but he was the doctor i assumed he knew what he was doing i stayed completely out of it had ramey drive her to her appointments did kruse help her in the beginning shed come home from seeing him and be calm almost too calm what do you mean sleepy drowsy i know now that he was hypnotizing her but whatever benefits that brought didnt last within an hour or two she was the same old sherry meaning what defiance foul language that terrible temper still breaking things except when she wanted something then she could be the most charming little doll in the world sweet as sugar a real actress she knew how to twist people to her needs he taught her how to do it even better all the time i thought he was helping her he was teaching her how to manipulate did you ever tell him about sharon he wouldnt let me tell him anything if he had would you have told him no that was in the past but eventually you did tell him not until later how much later years she was a teenager fourteen or fifteen he called me late at night caught me offguard he liked to do that all of a sudden hed completely changed his tune all of a sudden it was imperative i be involved come in to be evaluated five years of going nowhere and now he wanted me on the couch i wanted no part of such a thing by then id realized that it was useless her personality wasnt going to change she was the prisoner of her genes but he wouldnt take no for an answer kept calling me badgering me dropping in to chat when i was entertaining guests pulling me aside at parties and telling me that she and i were a what was the word he used a dyad a destructive dyad two people on a psychological seesaw trying to knock each other off her behavior affected mine mine hers in order for her to stop doing all those terrible things we needed to equalize our communications find emotional homeostasis or some rubbish like that i felt he simply wanted to control me and i wasnt about to give in but he was like a a drill kept at it simply wouldnt give up still i was able to resist prideful smile then things got much worse and i caved in worse in what way she started doing teenage things running away disappearing for days at a time completely without warning id send ramey out for her but he rarely found her then out of nowhere shed come crawling back usually in the middle of the night all disheveled filthy crying promising never to do it again but she always did did she talk about where shed been oh the next morning shed be boasting telling me horrid tales in order to make me suffer crossing the bridge and heading over to the colored part of town things like that i never knew how much to believe didnt want to believe any of it later when she was old enough to drive shed take off in one of my cars and vanish weeks later the credit card bills and traffic tickets would start trickling in and id find out shed been traipsing all over georgia louisiana dull little towns id never heard of what she did there god only knows one time she went to mardi gras and came home painted green i finally took away her driving privileges when she ruined my favorite car a lovely old bentley painted lilac with etched windows henrys gift to me on our tenth she drove it into the ocean just left it there and walked away but she always managed to find a set of keys be off again one way or the other sherry would triumph no smile now i remembered what del had told me about the needle marks said when did she get into drugs when she was thirteen paul had tranquilizers prescribed for her he wasnt an md wasnt allowed to prescribe she shrugged he got her those drugs prescription tranquilizers what about street drugs i dont know i suppose so why not nothing could stop her from doing what she wanted during this period how often was kruse seeing her when she chose to go he billed me even if she didnt show up what was the official schedule no change four sessions a week did you ever question him ask why years of treatment hadnt improved her he he was hard to approach when i finally raised the issue he got very angry said she was irreparably disturbed would never be normal would need treatment all her life just to maintain and that it was my fault id waited too long to bring her in couldnt expect to wheel a jalopy into a garage and have a rollsroyce emerge then hed start in again pressuring me to come in for evaluation she was getting worse and worse he broke me down i agreed to talk to him what about the usual rubbish he wanted to know about my childhood did i dream at night why id married henry how things made me feel he always talked in a low monotonous voice had shiny things in his office little toys that moved back and forth i knew what he was doing trying to hypnotize me everyone in palm beach knew he did that kind of thing he did it at parties at the planned parenthood ball made people quack like ducks for amusement i resolved not to give in it was difficult his voice was like warm milk but i fought it told him i didnt see what any of that had to do with sherry he kept pushing finally i blurted out that he was wasting his time she wasnt even mine was the product of some sluts bad genes that made him stop droning and he looked at me strangely she sighed closed her eyes my heart sank trying to resist him id said too much given him just what he needed to bleed me dry youd never told him she was adopted i never told anyone from the day i got her how did he react to finding out broke his pipe in half slammed his hand on the desk took me by the shoulders and shook me told me id wasted his time all these years and severely damaged sherry said i didnt care about her was a terrible mother a selfish person my communications were perverse my secretiveness was what had made her what she was he kept going on like that attacking me i was in tears tried to leave the office but he stood in the doorway and blocked me kept hurling abuse i threatened to scream he smiled and said go ahead by tomorrow all of palm beach would know sherry would know the moment i stepped out the door hed call her tell her how id lied to her that broke me i knew it would be the final straw between us i begged him not to tell begged him to have pity he smiled went back behind his desk and lit another pipe just sat there puffing and looking at me as if i were trash i was whimpering like a baby finally he said hed reconsider on condition that i be honest from now on completely open i i told him everything what exactly did you tell him that the father was unknown the mother a tart whod fancied herself an actress that shed died soon after the baby was born you still didnt tell him about sharon no no you werent worried sherry would tell him how could she tell him something she didnt know it was out of her head im sure of that because she never mentioned it and when she was angry she threw everything else in my face what if she chanced to open up an old blue book she shook her head she didnt like books didnt read never learned to read well some sort of blockage the tutors couldnt break through but kruse found out anyway how i have no idea but i did a college careers day spotting his former patient discovering it wasnt his former patient at all but a carbon copy mirrorimaged she was saying he bled me for years the monster i hope hes writhing in eternal hellfire why didnt brother billy fix that for you i i dont know i told billy he always told me to have patience she turned away from me i doled out more martini but she didnt drink it just held her glass and straightened her posture her eyes closed and her breathing got shallow a boozehounds tolerance but it wouldnt be long before she passed out i was phrasing my next question for maximum impact when the door swung open two men stepped into the sunroom the first was cyril trapp in white polo shirt pressed designer jeans topsiders and black members only jacket california casual betrayed by the tension in his whiteblotched face and the blue steel revolver in his right hand the second man kept his hands in his pockets as he examined the room with the practiced eye of a pit boss older midsixties tall and wide big bones padded with hard fat he wore a doeskincolored western suit brown silk shirt string tie gathered by a large smokytopaz clasp peanutbuttercolored lizard boots and a straw cowboy hat his skin tone matched the boots forty pounds heavier than trapp but the same hatchet jaw and thin lips his eyes settled on me his stare was that of a naturalist studying some rare but hideous specimen mr hummel i said how are things in vegas he didnt answer just moved his lips the way denture wearers do shut up said trapp pointing the gun at my face put your hands behind your head and dont move friends of yours i said to hope blalock she shook her head her eyes were electric with fear were here to help you maam said hummel his voice was badlands basso profundo coarsened by smoke and drink and desert air ramey came in all spotless black serge and starched white its all right madam he said everythings in order he looked at me with tight fury and i knew whod called in the goon squad trapp stepped forward waved the revolver get those hands behind you i didnt move fast enough to suit him and the weapon was pressed hard under my nose hope blalock gasped ramey went to her side trapp put a little more weight behind the gun looking at all that metal crossed my eyes i tightened reflexively trapp leaned harder royal hummel said easy he came around behind me i heard a ratchet slip felt cold metal around my wrists not too tight son perfect uncle roy shut the fuck up said trapp hope blalock winced hummel said easy ct and patted the back of my neck his touch bothered me more than the gun close your eyes son he said and i obeyed the pressure of the revolver was replaced by something tight and elastic around my head banding my eyes so tight i couldnt open them strong hands gripped me under my arms i was lifted so that only my shoe tips touched the floor propelled forward like a kite in a headwind it was a very big house they dragged me for a long time before i heard a door open felt hot air on my face trapp started laughing what said his uncle stretching the word to two syllables how we got this joker fucking butler did it they searched me confiscated my watch keys and wallet and put me in a vehicle that smelled brandnew settle down son said hummel easing me into the backseat and removing the cuffs he slammed the door i heard him go around to the front then the engine started muted as if my ears were stuffed i peeled back an inch of blindfold and inspected the interior blackened windows that let in only hints of light a black glass partition sealing off the rear compartment a cell lined in gray vinyl rockhard bench seats nylon carpeting cloth roof no dome light no ornamentation at all not a clue to make or model the plainwrap styling of a midsize economy american sedan a bottomoftheline dodge ford or olds but with a twist no door handles no ashtrays or seat belts no metal at all i ran my hands over the doors trying to find some hidden latch nothing a hard rap on the partition brought no response san quentin on wheels we began to move i peeled off the blindfold heavyduty black elastic no label it already stank of the fear in my sweat i heard the spatter of gravel muted like the ignition soundproofing i pressed my face to the window saw only my reflection in the darkened glass i didnt like the way i looked we picked up speed i sensed it the way you sense acceleration in an elevator a pitofthestomach lurch cut off from the world i had only my fear to listen to i might have been in a crypt a sudden turn made me slide across the seat when the car straightened i kicked the door then karatekicked it hard no give i pounded the windows until my hands hurt attacked the partition not even a hint of vibration i knew then that id be there as long as they wanted me to my chest went tight any road noise the soundproofing let in was blotted out by the pounding of my heart theyd robbed me sensorily the key was to regain my bearings i searched for mental signposts the only thing left was time but no watch i began counting one thousand one one thousand two settled back for the ride after about fortyfive minutes the car came to a stop the left rear door opened hummel bent low and peered in he wore mirrored sunglasses and held a longnosed chromeplated colt parallel to his leg behind him was cement flooring sepiatinged darkness i smelled auto fumes he raised his other hand to his crotch and unbound his shorts transfer time son gonna have to cuff you again bend forward no mention of the fact that id removed the blindfold i stuffed it behind the seat and did what he asked the good little prisoner hoping compliance would buy me the privilege of vision but the moment my hands were bound on went the elastic i said where are we going stupid question helplessness does that to you for a ride cmon ct lets hustle a door slammed trapps voice said lets move this turkey amused a moment later i smelled aramis heard the buzz of his whisper in my ear fucking butler did it isnt that a hoot faggo tsk tsk i said bad language for a bornagain sudden beebite pain behind my ear a finger flick shut the fu ct said hummel all right double armgrip footsteps echoing the auto fumes stronger an underground parking lot twentytwo paces stop wait mechanical hum gears grinding something sliding ending with a clang elevator door a push forward slide shut click rapid climb another push out in the heat the stench of gasoline so powerful i could taste it more cement a loud whoosh growing louder very loud gasoline no something stronger an airport smell jet fuel whoosh whoosh gusts of cool air slicing through the heat propellors a slow chug picking up speed helicopter rotor they dragged me forward i thought of seaman cross driven blindfolded to a landing strip less than an hour from la flown to leland beldings dome somewhere out in the desert the rotor noise grew deafening scrambling my thoughts gusts of turbulence slapped my face plastered my clothes to my body theres a step here hummel shouted putting pressure under my elbow pushing me lifting me step up son there you go good climbing one step two step mother may i half a dozen still more keep going said hummel now stop put your foot forward there we go good boy hand on my head pushing down duck son he placed me in a bucket seat and belted me in a door slammed my ears clogged the noise level dropped a notch but remained loud i heard radio stutter a new voice from the front male militaryflat saying something to hummel hummel answered back planning their words drowned out by the rotor a moment later we lifted off with a surge that bounced and buffeted me like a pachinko ball the copter swayed rose again gained stability suspended in midair i thought again of seaman crosss nose dive from celebrity to death missing notes in a public storage vault books recalled locked up raped head in the oven time if youre right about a tenth of this were dealing with people with very long arms the copter kept climbing i fought the shakes worked hard at pretending this was an e ride at disneyland up up and away wed been traveling for more than two hours by my slow count when more radio noises burped from the front of the cabin and i felt the copter take a drop in altitude more radio stutter one decipherable word roger we dipped for landing i remembered reading somewhere that copters cruised between and knots if my counting was nearaccurate that meant a to mile trip i mentally traced a circle with la at its center fresno to mexico longitudinally from the colorado desert to somewhere over the pacific on the eastwest axis no shortage of desert in three directions another sharp drop moments later we hit solid ground smooth said hummel in seconds i felt his breath hot and spearminted on my face heard him grunt as he loosened the belt enjoy the ride son not bad i said borrowing someone elses voice some milquetoasts quavering tenor but the movie stank he chuckled took hold of my arm guided me out of the copter and down i stumbled a couple of times hummel kept me upright and moving not breaking half a step the old heaveho march hed probably used it on a thousand vegas drunks we walked for a slowcount of four hundred the air was very hot very dry silent stay here he said and i heard the horsey clump of his departing bootsteps then nothing i stood there unguarded for a threehundred count three hundred more ten minutes left to my own devices another five minutes and i started to wonder if he was coming back three more and i hoped he was his walking away meant escape would be folly i tried to picture where i was at the edge of a precipice playing target at the end of a shooting range or simply dropped in the middle of nowhere giftwrapped brunch for the scorpions and the buzzards donald neuraths obituary came to mind unspecified causes while vacationing in mexico maybe hummel was bluffing i considered moving uncertainty locked my joints i was a man with one foot on a land mine immobility my life sentence i stood there counting sweating trying to maintain enduring the molasses drip of time slowed by fear finally i forced myself to take a single step forward a baby step mother may i please solid ground no fireworks another step i swung one foot out in a slow arc testing no tripwires was inching forward when an electric whine sounded from somewhere behind me stop and go whine stop whine a golf cart or something like it coming closer footsteps cute little dance son said hummel we could use the rain he put me in the cart it had shallow seats and no roof we rode under a blazing sun for about fifteen minutes before he stopped eased me out and led me through revolving doors into a building airconditioned to frigidity we passed through three more doors each one opening after a series of clicks then made a quick righthand turn went thirty more paces and entered a room that smelled of disinfectant stay loose and no onell hurt you he said multiple footsteps shuffled forward off came the handcuffs several sets of hands pinioned my arms and legs braced my head tilted it back fingers filled my mouth pried under my tongue i gagged my clothes were stripped off the hands ran a marathon over my body ruffled my hair probed my armpits my orifices deftly quickly without a hint of prurient interest then i was dressed again buttoned and zipped all of it over in a couple of minutes i was walked through two more clicking doors and deposited in a big deep chair leather tannically fragrant the door closed by the time i yanked off the blindfold they were gone the room was big dark done in neohomeontherange plank walls navajo rugs over distressed pine floors wagonwheel chandelier brasschained from a beamed cathedral ceiling a set of armchairs fashioned of cowhide stretched on a stag antler frame wallsize oil paintings of tiredlooking cowboys and buckingbronco bronzes in the center of the room was a big clawfooted leathertopped desk behind it a wall display of flintlocks and engraved antique rifles ran from floor to ceiling behind the desk sat billy vidal brighteyed and brushcut squarejawed and perfectly seamed his strongtea tan was set off nicely by an ivorycolored turtleneck under a white cashmere vneck no cowboy gear for the chairman of magna he was palm beach polished golfcourse fit his hands lay flat on the desktop manicured baby smooth dr delaware thank you for coming his voice didnt fit with the rest of him a hoarse wispy croak cracking between words i said nothing he looked straight at me with pale eyes held the stare for a while then said that was an icebreaker that fell flat his last words petered out to a lipsync he cleared his throat produced more laryngitic whisper sorry for any inconvenience youve been caused there didnt seem to be any other way any other way for what to arrange a chat between us all you had to do was ask he shook his head the problem was timing until recently i wasnt sure it was wise for us to meet ive been debating that issue since you started asking questions he coughed tapped his adams apple but today when you visited my sister you made the decision for me things had to be done quickly and carefully so once again ill apologize for the way you were brought here and hope we can put that to rest and move on i could still feel the chafe of the cuffs around my wrists thought of the copter ride mainlining fear while waiting for hummel and his golf cart fingers up my ass cute little dance son i knew my rage would weaken me if i let it take over move on to what i said smiling our discussion of what please doctor he rasped dont waste precious time being coy short on time are you very much so another staring match his gaze never wavered but his eyes lost focus and i sensed he was somewhere else thirty years ago he said i had the opportunity to witness an atomic test conducted jointly by the magna corporation and the us army a festive event by invitation only out in the nevada desert we spent the night in las vegas had a wonderful party and drove out before sunrise the bomb went off just as the skies lightened a supercharged sunrise but something went wrong a sudden shift in the winds and all of us were exposed to radioactive dust the army said there was little risk of contamination no one thought much about it until fifteen years ago when the cancers began appearing three quarters of those present that morning are dead several others are terminally ill its only a matter of time for me i studied his wellfed face all that glowing bronze dermis said you look healthier than i do do i sound healthy i didnt answer actually he said i am healthy for the time being low cholesterol excellent lipids a heart as strong as a blast furnace a few lumps in my esophagus removed surgically last year no evidence of spread he pulled down the collar of the turtleneck exposed a hotpink puckered scar delicate skin i develop keloid scars do you suppose i should bother with plastic surgery thats up to you ive considered it but it seems such a foolish conceit the cancers bound to return ironically the treatment includes radiation not that treatment has made much of a difference for any of the others he folded his collar back in place tapped his adams apple what about belding i said was he exposed he smiled shook his head leland was protected as always still smiling he opened a desk drawer took out a small plastic squeeze bottle and shot some kind of atomized spray down his throat he deepswallowed a couple of times put the bottle back reclined in his chair and smiled wider i said what is it you want to discuss matters that seem to interest you im willing to satisfy your curiosity on condition that you stop turning over rocks i know your intentions are honorable but you dont realize how destructive you could be i dont see how i could add to the destruction thats already taken place dr delaware i want to leave this earth knowing everythings been done to cushion certain individuals such as your sister isnt cushioning her what caused all of it mr vidal no thats incorrect but then youve seen only part of the picture and youre going to show me all of it yes cough but you must give your word that youll stop probing let things finally rest why pretend that i have a choice i said if i dont give you what you want you can always squash me the way you squashed seaman cross eulalee and cable johnson donald neurath the kruses he was amused you believe ive destroyed all those people you magna whats the difference ah corporate america as satan incarnate just this particular corporation his laugh was feeble and breathy doctor even if i did have an interest in squashing you i wouldnt youve acquired a certain aura of grace oh oh yes someone cared deeply about you someone lovely and kind dear to both of us not dear enough to stop him from erasing her identity i said i saw that someone talking to you at the party she wanted something from you what the pale eyes closed he pressed his fingers to his temples i said from holmby hills to willow glen five hundred dollars a month in an unmarked envelope doesnt sound as if she was that dear to you he opened his eyes five hundred is that what helen told you he produced another wheezy laugh wheeled his chair back put his feet on the desk he wore black silk corduroy slacks tan lambskin kilties with argyle socks the soles of the shoes were polished unmarked as if theyd never touched the ground all right he said enough shillyshallying tell me what it is you think you know ill correct your misconceptions meaning you find out how much trouble i could cause you then act accordingly i understand how you could see it that way doctor but what im really after is preventive education giving you the whole picture so that you no longer have any need to cause trouble silence he said if my offer doesnt appeal to you ill have you flown back home immediately what are my chances of arriving there alive one hundred percent barring acts of god or god pretending to be the magna corporation he laughed ill try to remember that one what is it then doctor the choice is yours i was at his mercy going along meant learning more and buying time i said go ahead educate me mr vidal excellent lets do it like gentlemen over supper he pushed something on the desk front the gun display wall halfrotated revealing a closetsized passageway with a screen door that he opened to fresh air we stepped onto a long covered patio supported by graybrown turnedwood columns and paved with rustcolored mexican tile thicktrunked bougainvillea rooted in clay pots wound their way around the columns and up to the roof where they spread straw baskets of donkeytail and jade plant hung from the rafters a large round table was covered with skyblue damask and set for two earthenware dishes hammeredsilver flatware crystal goblets a centerpiece of dried herbs and flowers hed been sure of my choice a mexican waiter appeared from nowhere and held out my chair i walked past him crossed the patio and stepped out into the open air the suns position said dusk was approaching but the heat was midday strong i stepped back far enough from the building to take it in entirely long low singlestoried textured mockadobe walls windows trimmed with the same graybrown wood used for the columns flagstone walkways cut a swath through an acre or two of lawn bordered by yellow gazania beyond the grass was dry dust and an empty horse corral past the corral more dust miles of it the biscuitcolored monotony broken only by clumps of aloe and joshua tree and paintbynumber splotches of ashen shadow and backing all of it the source of the shadows granite mountains majestic blacktipped knifeedged against a sapphire sky picturepostcard mountains so perfect they could have been a photographers backdrop my eyes swept downward to a particular spot on the lawn seeking out a wooden garden bench nothing but my memory placed one there anyway a posing spot two little girls in cowgirl suits eating ice cream i looked back at vidal hed sat down was unfurling his napkin saying something to the waiter as his wine glass was filled the waiter laughed filled my glass and left the former billy the pimp held his hand out to my chair i took another look at the mountains saw only stone and sand now the play of light and shadow on inanimate surface all the memories wiped out vidal beckoned i walked back to the patio he ate fiercely obsessively an impeccably mannered cobra striking at his food cutting it into tiny pieces and tenderizing it to purée before ingesting guacamole ostentatiously mixed tableside by the waiter using a rough stone mortar and pestle a salad of wild greens and marinated onions homemade corn tortillas newly churned butter barbecued swordfish steaks six kinds of salsa pork loin roast in some kind of sweet piquant sauce a chardonnay and a pinot noir he took pains to inform me were estatebottled at a sonoma winery run by magna exclusively for its own consumption a couple of times i saw him wince after swallowing wondered how much of his pleasure was gustatory how much appreciation that his mouth still worked hed accepted a second portion of pork before he noticed my untouched food not to your liking doctor id rather be educated than eat smile dice purée the human vegomatic where are we i asked mexico mexico he said is a state of mind someone witty once said that though for the life of me i cant remember who probably dorothy parker she said all the witty things didnt she cut chew swallow i said why did sharon kill herself he lowered his fork thats an end point doctor lets proceed chronologically proceed away he drank wine winced coughed kept eating sipped some more i looked out at the desert as it darkened to madderbrown not a sound not a bird in the sky maybe the animals knew something finally he pushed his plate away and tapped his fork on the table the mexican waiter appeared along with two heavy blackhaired women in long brown dresses vidal said something in rapid spanish the table was cleared and each of us was served a pewter bowl of green ice cream i took a taste cloyingly sweet cactus said vidal very soothing he took a long time with the dessert the waiter brought coffee flavored with anise vidal thanked him dismissed him and dabbed his lips chronological order i said how about starting with eulalee and cable johnson he nodded what do you know about them she was one of beldings party girls he was a petty crook a pair of smalltown hustlers trying to make it in hollywood not exactly major league dope dealers he said linda i always knew her as linda was an exquisite creature a diamond in the rough but physically magnetic that intangible something that cant be bought at any price back in those days we were surrounded by beauties but she stood out because she was different from the rest less cynical a certain pliability passivity i suppose someone in your line of work would look at it as a flaw i saw it as an easygoing nature felt she was the right woman to help leland help him with what become a man leland didnt understand women he froze up when he was around them couldnt perform he was far too intelligent to miss the irony all that money and power the countrys most eligible bachelor and still a virgin at forty he wasnt a physical person but every kettle has its boiling point and the frustration was getting in the way of his work i knew hed never solve the problem by himself it fell upon my shoulders to find a guide for him i explained the situation to linda she was amenable so i arranged for the two of them to be together she was more dr delaware than a party girl i said sexual favors for a fee sounds like something else he refused to be offended everything has its price doctor she was simply doing thirty years ago what a sexual surrogate would do today i said you didnt just pick her for her personality she was beautiful he said likely to stimulate thats not what i meant oh he sipped his coffee said tepid and rapped his spoon on the table three times the waiter appeared out of the darkness with a fresh pot i wondered what else was concealed out there he drank the steaming liquid looked as if someone had poured acid down his throat it took several moments before he tried to speak and when he did i had to lean forward to hear why dont you tell me what youre driving at her sterility i said you picked her because you thought she was unable to bear children youre a very bright young fellow he said then raised his cup to his lips again and hid behind a cloud of steam leland was a very squeamish man that was part of his problem not having to worry about taking precautions was a point in her favor but a minor factor a bit of messiness that could have been dealt with i was thinking of something a bit messier i said an heir born out of wedlock he drank more coffee i said whyd you think she couldnt conceive we did background checks on all the girls had them undergo complete physical exams our research revealed that linda had gotten pregnant several times during her youth but had miscarried almost immediately after conception our doctors said it was some sort of hormonal imbalance they pronounced her incapable of bearing children animal husbandry in reverse i said howd she do with old leland she was marvelous after a few sessions he was a new man what were his feelings toward her he put down his cup leland belding didnt feel doctor he was as close to mechanical as a human being could be ellston crottys words came back to me like some frigging camera on legs i remember thinking what a cold bastard he was even so i said patients and surrogates usually develop some sort of emotional bond are you saying none developed between them thats exactly what im saying it was like tutoring learning french leland received her in his office when they were through he showered dressed and resumed his business and she went about hers i knew him better than anyone and that wasnt much i never felt i had access to his thoughts but my guess is he saw her as another of his machines one of the more efficient ones which isnt to say he disparaged her machines were what he admired most what about her feelings toward him a moments pause a fleeting look of pain no doubt she was impressed with his money and power women are drawn to power theyll forgive anything in a man but helplessness and she also saw his helpless side so id imagine she viewed him with a mixture of awe and pity the way a doctor might regard a patient with a rare disease hed framed his words theoretically but the pained look kept pushing through the charmfaçade i knew then that linda lanier had become more to him than a harem girl on assignment knew i couldnt touch that theirs was purely a business arrangement he said cozy until brother cable stepped in the façade slipped another rung cable johnson was despicable when he and linda were adolescents he sold her to the local boys for money she was fourteen or fifteen thats how she got pregnant all those times he was pure filth one procurer damning another i said why didnt you consider him a risk factor when you set linda up as a surrogate oh i did but i thought the risk had been dealt with at the time i hired linda johnson was locked up at the county jail for theft facing a stay at the penitentiary as a repeat offender he was deadbroke unable to come up with ten dollars bond on a hundreddollar bail i obtained his freedom got him a job at magnafilm at an inflated salary the idiot didnt even have to show up for work the check was mailed to his rooming house all that was required on his part was staying away from her a very generous arrangement wouldnt you say not compared to a piece of the belding fortune the fool he said there wasnt an iota of a chance of his getting a penny but he was a compulsive criminal couldnt stop conniving enter donald neurath md fertility expert and meal ticket my my said vidal youre a thorough researcher yourself was neurath in on the extortion scheme he claimed not said they presented themselves as a married couple poor childless mr and mrs johnson he insisted he hadnt been fooled had sensed something wrong about them and refused to take her on as a patient but johnson convinced him somehow you know how i said a trade the porn loop in exchange for hormonal treatment for linda more filth he said i said still neurath knew too much you had to finish him off somewhere out in mexico not far from here id bet doctor doctor you give me too much credit ive never finished off anyone donald neurath drove down here voluntarily to offer information he owed money to loan sharks was hoping for payment i refused on the way back his car broke down or so ive been told he died of exposure the desert does its damage quickly as a medical man he should have been more prepared i said is that how you connected him to cables scheme no linda came to me saying she could no longer work with leland bearing a towhomitmayconcern note written on neuraths stationery in it he claimed shed contracted some sort of vaginal infection at first i didnt suspect anything everything looked bona fide i gave her ten thousand dollars severance pay and wished her well later of course i put it all together how did belding react to her leaving he didnt by that time he was feeling his oats testing out his newfound confidence on other women as many as he could get his hands on eventually he began to flaunt it beldings transformation from recluse to playboy the timing fit what happened next nearly a year later cable johnson called me informed me id better meet with him if i knew what was good for leland we met at some tawdry downtown hotel johnson drunk and gloating like a top dog strutting around very proud of himself he told me linda had given birth to lelands babies hed taken her to texas to do it now they were back and the squeeze was on vidal raised his coffee cup thought better of it and put it down oh he thought he was a smart one had it all figured out cuffing my shoulder as if we were old friends offering me cheap gin from a filthy bottle singing rude limericks and saying that now the johnsons and the beldings were going to be kinfolk then he told me to wait left the room and came back a few minutes later with linda and his little gifts three gifts i said he nodded triplets all that hormonal tinkering doing strange things to the egg increasing the chance of multiple birth common medical knowledge today but neurath had been ahead of his time port wallaces sole claim to fame i said jewel rae jana sue and poor joan dixie born blind deaf paralyzed the pathetic little thing he said some sort of brain damage the place he dragged linda to was primitive joan almost died at birth he shook his head closed his eyes she was so tiny not much bigger than a fist it was a miracle she survived linda carried her around in a basket kept cooing at her massaging her limbs pretending her twitches were voluntary movement pretending she was normal something like that would be tough for a squeamish man to take all three of them disgusted him hed always despised children the idea of triplets made him ill he was the ultimate engineer accustomed to machine specifications precision had absolutely no tolerance for anything that deviated from his expectations of course joans deformities were an additional insult the implication that hed taken part in creating something defective i knew him knew how hed react i wanted to keep all of it from him work things out in my own way but cable wanted it all right now kinfolk linda had held on to a key to lelands office she went there one night when he was working late brought the babies he shook his head the poor stupid girl believing the sight of them would ignite his paternal pride he listened to her told her what she wanted to hear the moment she was gone he phoned me and ordered me over for a problem solving session not that he wanted my input hed come to a decision all of them would have to be eliminated permanently i was to be the angel of death the babies were supposed to be killed he nodded all the villainy foisted on a dead man i said some good storm trooper carried out the order he drank hacked pulled a squeeze bottle out of his pocket and sprayed his throat i saved those babies he said only i could have done it only i had enough of lelands trust to disagree with him and get away with it i told him infanticide was absolutely out of the question if it ever came out hed be ruined magna would be ruined a pragmatic approach the only one he understood i pointed out that the babies could be given up for adoption in such a way that any link to him would be permanently obscured that he could draft a new will specifically excluding any blood relatives known or unknown from inheriting a dime at first he didnt want to hear it kept insisting the only way out was the unambiguous option i told him id carried out his assignments without questioning but id quit before carrying out this one and if those babies died i couldnt guarantee my silence was he prepared to eliminate me as well that angered and shocked him from childhood no one had ever told him no but he respected me for standing up to him eventually agreed to my plan nifty plan i said including a consolation prize for your sister it was just after henrys death shed sunk into a deep depression widowhood childlessness had been in seclusion since the funeral i thought having the girls would do wonders for her and shes not an imaginative woman would never ask where they came from never want to know was joan included in the deal no that hope couldnt have handled the corporation purchased a sanitarium in connecticut and joan was placed there she got excellent care in the process we learned about health care management ended up buying up several other hospitals new names new lives i said except for the johnsons was it you or belding who thought of the dope dealer angle that it wasnt supposed to happen the way it did im sure linda and cable would be comforted to know that he tried to speak nothing came out atomized his throat waited and produced soft tones dry as a death rattle it was never intended that linda would be part of it she wasnt supposed to be there was supposed to be out shopping she posed no threat with her brother out of the way she could have been dealt with i would have dealt with her but her car didnt work she was phoning for a taxi when things started to happen cable grabbed her the filth used her as a shield she was shot by accident no way i said she wouldnt have let her children be taken from her without a fuss she had to die you either knew that from the beginning or chose not to see it when you set up the bust that glitzy suite on fountain all the jewels furs cars were to lull her and cable into thinking belding was agreeing to their terms but both of them were dead the moment she stepped into his office with those babies youre wrong dr delaware i had everything arranged lets give you the benefit then and say someone rearranged your arrangement he gripped the edge of the table the look in his eyes overpowered the tan the clothes all that cultivated charm no he croaked it was a mistake her idiot scum brother killed her using her the way hed always done maybe he did but hummel and degranzfeld would have killed her anyway on beldings orders he was pleased with the job theyd done rewarded them with vegas jobs he said nothing for a long time something could it be real seemed to be eating at him devouring him from within he looked through me back into another time nonsense he said are you the father i asked another long silence i dont know then leland and i have the same blood type o positive along with thirtynine percent of the population nowadays there are precise tests what would be the point his voice rose cracked and died i saved them placed them in a good home it was enough not for sharon she ended up naked eating mayonnaise from a jar another plan gone wrong he closed his eyes grimaced getting older by the second it was for the good of both of them so ive been told sherry was a frightening child id seen the signs of violence in her from the time she could walk it worried me i wondered about a bad seed the johnsons came from a long line of miscreants eventually it became clear that hope couldnt handle both of them sharon was being persecuted battered it was escalating steadily something had to be done when sherry tried to drown her i knew the time had come but leland couldnt find out about it hed forgotten completely about them hadnt mentioned a word since the transfer i knew hed regard any change in plans as evidence that my way of dealing with the situation wasnt working would insist on doing it his way what did you tell him that sharon had accidentally drowned that set well with him his lips began to tremble he placed a manicured hand over his mouth to conceal the loss of control why banish sharon i said why not sherry because sherry was the one who bore watching she was unstable a loaded gun having her out there unsupervised was too risky for both of them thats not the only reason i said no hope wanted it that way she felt closer to sherry felt sherry needed her more punish the victim i said from a mansion to a dirt patch two retarded people as caretakers they were good people he said he began coughing and unable to stop shook his head from side to side gasping for breath his eyes filled with water and he had to hold on to the table for support finally he was able to speak but so softly i had to lean forward to hear good people theyd worked for me i knew they could be trusted the arrangement was supposed to be temporary a way to buy time for sharon until i came up with something else a way to wipe out her identity i said for her sake his whisper was harsh insistent id never have done anything to harm her hand to mouth again uncontrollable coughing he placed a silk handkerchief to his lips spit something into it excuse me he said then she had her mothers face so did sherry no no sherry had the features but not the face we said nothing for a long time then suddenly as if forcing his way out of a sentimental stupor he sat up snapped his fingers the waiter brought him a glass of ice water and was gone he drank cleared his throat touched his adams apple swallowed hard forcing a smile but looking drained defeated a man whod sailed through life in first class only to find out the cruise had gone nowhere id arrived at this place hating him prepared to stoke my hate but i felt like putting my arm around him then i thought of dead bodies a pile of them and said your temporary plan stretched to permanence he nodded i kept searching for another way some other arrangement meanwhile shirlee and jasper were doing a yeoman job amazingly so then helen discovered sharon made her a protégée began molding her in a fine way i decided nothing could be better than that i contacted helen we reached an agreement helen was paid not with money she and her husband were too proud for that but there were other things i could do for them scholarships for her children aborting a plan to sell off corporate acreage in willow glen for development for over thirty years magnas guaranteed to purchase any agricultural surpluses and compensate for any losses below a specified level not just for helen for the entire town paying them not to grow apples i said an american tradition he said you should taste wendys honey and cider our employees love them i remembered helens complaint they wont sell for all intents and purposes that keeps willow glen a backwater speck keeping shirlee and jasper and their charge away from prying eyes how much does helen know i asked her knowledge is very limited for her sake what will become of the ransoms nothing will change he said theyll continue to live wonderfully basic lives did you see any signs of suffering on their faces doctor they dont want for anything would be considered welloff by most peoples standards helen looks out for them before she came along i did he allowed himself a smile smug all right i said youre mother teresa so how come people keep dying some people he said deserve to die sounds like a quotation from chairman belding no answer i said what about sharon did she deserve to die for trying to learn who she was he stood stared down at me all selfdoubt gone once again the man in charge words can communicate only so much he said come with me we headed out toward the desert he aimed a penlight at the ground highlighting pitted soil mammalian clumps of scrub saguaro cactus stretching skyward about a halfmile in the beam settled on a small streamlined fiberglas vehicle the golfcart id visualized during my ride with hummel dark paint a roll bar knobby offroad tires a forwardslanting m on the door he got behind the wheel and motioned me in no blindfold for this ride i was either trusted or doomed he flipped several switches headlights the whine of the electric engine another flip and the hum rose in frequency we moved forward with surprising speed twice as fast as the bumpercar pace hummel had taken the sadist faster than id thought possible from an electric machine but then this was hightech territory the patent ranch we rode for more than an hour without exchanging a word sailing across stretches of chalky wasteland the air was still hot and grew fragrant a mild herbaceous scent vidal coughed a lot as the vehicle churned up clouds of fine clay dust but he continued to steer with ease the granite mountains were faint pencil marks on black construction paper he flipped another switch and made the moon appear gigantic milkywhite and earthbound not the moon at all but a giant golf ball illuminated from within a geodesic dome perhaps thirty feet in diameter vidal pulled up to it and parked the surface of the dome was white plastic hexagonal panels framed in tubular white metal i looked for the booth seaman cross had described the one hed sat in while communicating with belding but the only access to the building was a white door the basketcase billionaire i said a stupid little book said vidal leland got it into his head that he needed to be chronicled whyd he pick cross we got out of the cart i havent the slightest idea i told you he never let me inside his head i was out of the country when he cooked up the deal later he changed his mind and demanded cross fold up his tent in return for a cash payment cross took the money but went ahead with the book leland was very displeased another searchanddestroy mission everything was handled legally through the courts burglarizing his storage locker wasnt exactly working within the system did you use the same guys for the fontaine breakin his expression said that wasnt worth responding to we started walking i said what about crosss suicide cross was weakwilled couldnt cope youre saying it was a genuine suicide absolutely if he hadnt done himself in would you have let him live he smiled and shook his head as i told you before doctor i dont squash people besides cross was no threat no one believed him the door was white and seamless he placed his hand on the knob looked at me and let the message sink in cross had poisoned the well when it came to leland belding stories no one would believe me this day had never occurred i looked up at the dome starlight made it shimmer like a giant jellyfish the plastic panels gave off a newcar smell vidal twisted the knob i stepped in the door closed behind me a moment later i heard the buggy depart i looked around expecting screens consoles keyboards a flash gordon tangle of electronic pasta but it was just a big room interior walls sheathed in white plastic the rest could have come out of any suburban tract home iceblue carpet oak furniture console tv stereo components topping a record cabinet prefab bookcase and matching magazine basket an efficiency kitchen off to one side potted plants framed samplers apple drawings and three beds arranged parallel to one another as in a bunk room or ward the first two were hospital setups with pushbutton position controls and chromium swivel tables the nearest one was empty save for something on the pillow i took a closer look it was a toy airplane a bomber painted dark with a forwardslanting m on the door in the second a crippled woman lay under a cheerful quilt immobile gapemouthed some gray streaking her black hair but otherwise unchanged in the six years since id last seen her as if disability had so dominated her body it rendered her ageless she took a deep sucking breath and air came out in a squeak a waft of perfume filtered through the newcar ambience soap and water fresh grass sharon sat on the edge of the third bed hands folded in her lap a smile tissuethin graced her lips she wore a long white dress that buttoned down the front her hair was combed out parted in the middle no makeup no jewelry her eyes purplish in the light of the dome she fidgeted under my stare long fingers arms smooth as butter breasts straining against the dress silk expensive but it resembled a nurses uniform hello alex shirlee ransoms swivel table held tissues a hot water bottle a mucus aspirator a water pitcher and an empty drinking glass i picked up the glass rolled it between my palms and put it down come she said i sat down next to her said risen like lazarus never gone she said someone else is she nodded i said the red dress strawberry daiquiris her sleeping with your patients she shifted so that our flanks touched her she wanted to hurt me didnt care she was hurting others in the process i didnt know a thing until the cancellations started pouring in i couldnt understand it everything had been going so well mostly shortterm cases but everyone liked me i phoned them most of them refused to talk to me a couple of wives got on full of rage threatening it was like a bad dream then sherry told me what shed done laughing shed been staying with me had taken my office key and made a copy used it to get into my files picked out the ones who sounded cute offered them free followup visits and did them then dumped them thats the way she put it when i was calm enough i asked her why she said shed be damned if shed let me play doctor and lord it over her she placed her hand on my thigh her palm was wet i knew she resented me alex but i never imagined shed carry it that far when we first got together she acted as if she loved me when was that my second year of grad school autumn surprised i said not the summer no autumn october what was the family business that prevented you from going to san francisco therapy conducting or receiving my therapy with kruse nod it was a crucial time i couldnt leave we were dealing with issues it really was family business where were you staying his house id gone there looking for her watching kruses face split in two have a nice day it was pretty intense she said he wanted to monitor all the variables you had no trouble sleeping there i no he helped me relaxed me hypnosis yes he was preparing me for meeting her he thought it would be a healing process for both of us but he underestimated how much hatred remained she stayed calm but the pressure of her hand increased she was pretending alex it was easy for her shed studied acting some gravitate to the stage and screen interesting career choice i said it wasnt a career just a fling just like everything else first she used it to get close to me then again to target what she knew was dearest to me you then years later my work she knew how much my work meant to me why didnt you get licensed she tugged her earlobe too many distractions i wasnt ready pauls opinion and mine she pressed against me her touch felt burdensome youre the only man ive ever loved alex what about jasper and paul the mention of kruses name made her flinch i mean romantic love physical love youre the only one whos ever been inside of me i said nothing alex its true i know you suspected things but paul and i were never like that i was his patient sleeping with a patients like incest even after therapy stops something in her voice made me back off okay but lets not forget mickey starbuck who your costar checkup was that his name mickey all i knew about him was that he was an actor whom paul had treated for cocaine addiction back in florida ive never been to florida her she nodded i said who cast her i know what it looks like but paul thought it might be curative radical therapy working it through youd have to see it in context alex hed worked with her for years without much success he had to try something i looked away took in my surroundings hooked rug on the blue carpet the samplers spouting truisms no goddam place like home spaceship homey as if extraterrestrials had swooped down on a specimenhunt plundered middle america of its clichés when i turned back she was smiling a shiny smile too shiny like glaze before crackling alex i understand how strange all this must sound to you its hard to sum up so many years in just a few minutes i smiled back let my confusion show its overwhelming the dynamics how it all fits together ill do my best to clear it up for you id appreciate that where would you like me to start right at the beginning seems as good a place as any she put her head on my shoulder thats the problem there really is no beginning she said in the same disembodied voice shed used years ago to talk about the death of her parents my primal years are a blur ive been told about them but its like hearing a story about someone else thats what therapy was about that summer paul was trying to unblock me age regression age regression free association gestalt exercises all the standard techniques things ive used myself with patients but nothing worked i couldnt remember a thing i mean intellectually i understood the defensive process knew i was repressing but that didnt help me in here she placed my hand on her belly how far back could you recall i asked happy times shirlee and jasper and helen uncle billy told me you met her yesterday isnt she an exceptional person yes she is yesterday it seemed like centuries does she know youre alive she winced as if bitten hard tug on the lobe uncle billy said hed take care of it im sure he will what were you and he talking about at the party her she was forcing herself on me again dropping in at all hours waking me up screaming and cursing or crawling into bed with me and mauling me trying to suck my breasts once i caught her with scissors trying to snip off my hair other times shed arrive stoned or drunk on her daiquiris get sick all over the place lose bladder control on the carpet i kept changing the locks she always found a way to get in she ate pills like candy old scars between the toes was she shooting dope she used to years ago i dont know maybe she started again cocaine speedballs over the years she must have overdosed at least a dozen times i had one of uncle billys doctors on call twentyfour hours a day just for pumping her stomach by the day of the party shed really deteriorated and was trying to take me down with her kept saying we were going to be eternal roomies i was scared just couldnt handle it anymore so i asked uncle billy to handle it even after all shed put me through it was rough knowing shed be put away so seeing you there at the party really lifted my spirits a week before id been at pauls house and suzanne was doing the calligraphy for the invitations i saw your name on the list felt such a surge of feeling for you she took my hand and ran it down toward her mons i felt heat heaviness the soft mesh of pubic hair through silk i hoped youd attend she said checked a couple of times to see if youd rsvpd but you hadnt so when our eyes met i couldnt believe it destiny i knew i had to try to make contact she kissed my cheek and now youre here hello stranger hello i sat there and allowed her to kiss me some more run her fingers through my hair touch me endured it and kissed back and knew how hookers feel sweat broke out on my forehead i wiped it on my sleeve she said would you like water got up and poured me some from shirlees pitcher i used the time to clear my head when she came back i said was paul treating you for anything other than unblocking the past actually it didnt start out as real therapy just clinical supervision the usual stuff about how my feelings and communications style affected my work but as we got into it he could see that i had identity problems a poor sense of self low selfesteem i felt incomplete and guilty guilty about what everything leaving shirlee and jasper theyre darling i really cared for them but i never felt i belonged to them and helen even though shed basically raised me she wasnt my mother there was always a wall between us it was confusing i nodded that first year of grad school she said there was a lot of pressure being expected to actually help other people it terrified me thats why i broke down in practicum i guess down deep i agreed with what the others were saying felt like an impostor everyone feels that way at first she smiled always the therapist thats what you were that night my rock when i saw your name on the party list i guess i thought history might repeat itself i said before you met sherry before you knew about her did you ever fantasize about having a twin yes all the time when i was a child but i never gave much credence to that i was the type of kid who fantasized about everything was there one twin image that kept recurring nod a girl my age who looked exactly like me but was confident popular assertive i named her big sharon even though she was exactly my size because her personality loomed paul said i saw myself as puny insignificant big sharon stayed behind the scenes but she could always be counted on to help when things got rough years later when i took my first psych course i learned that kind of thing was normal kids do it all the time but i was doing it even into adolescence even in college i was embarrassed about it afraid id talk in my sleep and my roommates would think i was weird so i made a conscious effort to get rid of big sharon and finally grow up eventually i managed to suppress her out of existence but she came out under hypnosis when paul was probing i began talking about her then to her paul said she was my partner my silent partner hanging around in the background he said everyone has one thats really what freud was getting at with ego id superego that it was okay to have her she was nothing more than another part of me that was a very affirmative message and in autumn he decided to introduce you to your real silent partners she tightened the glazed smile took hold of her face again yes by then the time was right how did he arrange it he called me into his office said he had something to tell me that id better sit down it might be traumatic but it would definitely be significant a growth experience then he hypnotized me gave me suggestions for deep muscle relaxation transcendent serenity when i was really mellow he told me i was one of the luckiest people in the world because i had a real silent partner two partners actually that i was one of three triplets she turned faced me took both my hands in hers alex all those feelings of not being complete the attempt to fill the hole with big sharon had been my subconscious mind not allowing me to forget despite the repression the fact that id been able to talk to big sharon in therapy was a sign to him that id reached a higher level was ready to get in touch with my identity as one third of a whole howd finding out make you feel at first it was wonderful a wave of happiness washed over me i was drunk with joy then suddenly everything got cold and dark and the walls started closing in she wrapped her arms around me held me tight it was unreal alex unbelievably horrible as if someone was stepping on my chest crushing me i was sure i was about to die i tried to scream but no sound came out tried to stand up and fell began crawling toward the door paul picked me up held me kept talking in my ear telling me everything was all right to breathe slowly and deeply get my breathing rhythmic it was just an anxiety attack finally i managed to do it but i didnt feel normal all my senses were stuffed i was ready to burst then something came out from deep inside of me a terrible scream louder than id ever screamed before someone elses scream it didnt sound like me i tried to step away from it sit in the therapists chair and watch someone else scream but it was me and i couldnt stop paul clamped his hand over my mouth when that didnt work he slapped my face hard it hurt but it felt good if you can understand that to be cared for i understand i said she said thank you and kissed me again then what then he held me till i was calm stretched me out on the floor and let me lie there and put me deeper in hypnosis then he told me to open my eyes reached into his shirt pocket i can still see it he was wearing a red silk shirt and handed me a snapshot two little girls me and another me he said to look on the back hed written something there i did s and s silent partners he said that was my catechism my healing mantra and the photo was my icon hed gotten it for me to keep when in doubt or troubled i should use it fall into it then he told me to fall into it then and there and began telling me about the other girl that her name was sherry shed been his patient for years long before he met me the first time he saw me he thought it was her meeting both of us was a miracle miraculous karma and his goal in life since then had been reuniting us into a functioning unit a family how long had he kept her existence from you just a short time he couldnt tell me about her until she agreed she was his patient everything was confidential but to get her to agree he must have told her about you she frowned as if working on a difficult puzzle that was different ours was a supervision therapy he viewed me as a fellow professional thought i could handle it it had to start somewhere alex breaking the circle i said of course how did she react to learning about you at first she refused to believe him even after he showed her a copy of the photo claimed it was trick photography took a long time to accept the fact that i existed paul told me shed been raised without love had trouble bonding looking back i realize he was warning me right from the beginning but i was in no state to consider negative input all i knew was that my life had changed magically triplets the empty vessel filled two out of three i said yes a moment later i realized that and asked about my other partner he said wed gone far enough ended the session then he served me herb tea and a light dinner had suzanne give me a massage drove me home and told me to try on my new identity home i said who gave you the house paul did he told me it was a rental property of his that no one was using and he wanted me to live in it i needed a new place for my new life this one was perfect for me harmonious in synchrony with my vibrations same with the car my little alfa wasnt that a cute car it finally gave out last year paul said hed bought it for suzanne but she couldnt learn to drive a stick shift he said after everything id been through i deserved a little fun in my life so he was giving it to me it wasnt till later of course that i learned hed been serving as a conduit but he did put everything together so in a sense everything did come from him i can see that i said what happened once you got home i was exhausted the sessions had taken a lot out of me i got into bed and slept like a baby but that night i woke up in a cold sweat panicky having another anxiety attack i wanted to call paul was too shaky to dial the phone finally i managed to breathe myself calm but by then my mood had changed i was really depressed didnt want to speak with anyone it was like falling headfirst into a bottomless well falling endlessly i got under the covers trying to escape for three days i didnt dress or eat or get out of bed just sat staring at that snapshot the third day was when you found me when i saw you i went crazy im sorry alex i lost control she touched my cheek dont worry i said long forgotten what happened after i left i stayed that way for a while some time later im really not sure how long it was paul came by to see how i was doing he cleaned me up dressed me and took me back to his place for a week i did nothing but relax stayed up in my in a room there then we had another session even deeper hypnosis and he told me about the separation what did he tell you that wed been put up for adoption at birth and wrenched apart at three because sherry kept trying to hurt me he said it wasnt the right way to handle it but that our adoptive mother had problems of her own couldnt handle both of us she liked sherry more so i was given away shed taken pains to speak in an offhand voice but something raw and frigid had come into her eyes what is it i said nothing just the irony she lived like a princess all her life but her soul was impoverished i ended up being the lucky one did you ever meet mrs blalock no not even at the party why should i she was a name to me not even a face someone elses mother i gazed at the plastic walls of the dome and said nothing let my eyes rest on the husk in the next bed when did paul tell you about partner number two third session but there wasnt much to tell all he knew was that shed been born disabled was institutionalized somewhere someone filled you in uncle billy yes the handsome paternal lawyer after all these years you remember amazing trying to sound pleased but edgy as a matter of fact uncle billy always wanted to be a lawyer he even applied to law school but he got caught up with other things and never went when did he come into the picture the second time paul sent me home maybe a week after we parted i was doing much better putting things in perspective the doorbell rang an older man with a beautiful smile was standing there with candy and flowers and a bottle of wine he said he was the brother of the woman whod given me away he apologized for that said i shouldnt hate her though he understood if i did that she was an inadequate person but hed always looked after me both as an uncle and an emissary of my father she looked over at the empty bed then he told me who my father was i said howd it feel learning you were leland beldings heir not as strange as youd think of course id heard of him knew he was a genius and rich and it was strange finding out we were related but he was dead gone no chance for any connection i was more concerned with living ties she hadnt answered the question i let it pass how did uncle billy chance to find you paul had traced my roots and found him he said hed wanted to meet me for years had been unsure of what to say or do and stayed away out of fear of doing the wrong thing now that the cat was out of the bag he wanted me to hear everything from the source i told him i knew about sherry and we talked a little about her i could tell he wasnt fond of her but he didnt push it and i didnt challenge him i wanted to know about my other sister about my roots we sat there and drank wine and he told me everything how the three of us were the love children of mr belding and an actress whom hed loved very much but couldnt marry for social reasons her name was linda she died of childbirth complications he showed me a picture she was very beautiful an actress i said when she didnt react i said you look like her thats quite a compliment she said we were also miracle children premature tiny at birth and not expected to live linda became sick with septicemia but she never stopped thinking about us praying for us she named us just minutes before she died jana joan and jewel rae thats me and though we all made it joan had multiple deformities despite being rich and powerful mr belding was in no position to raise her or any of us he was painfully shy actually phobic about people especially children from what uncle billy described a bit agoraphobic as well so uncle billy had us adopted by his sister hed thought shed turn out to be a better mother than she did all these years both he and mr belding felt tremendously guilty about letting us go i told him paul was going to arrange a meeting with sherry and he said he knew then i asked if he could arrange one with joan so he and paul were working together they were cooperating he was evasive about joan but i kept pressing him and finally he told me she was somewhere in connecticut i said i wanted to see her he said there was no point she was severely disabled had no conscious mind to speak of i said not only did i want to see her i wanted to be with her to take care of her he said that was impossible she required fulltime care and that i should concentrate on my education i said she was a part of me id never be able to concentrate on anything else again unless i could have her with me he thought about that asked if i could take some time off from school and i said sure we drove straight to a private airport hopped on a corporate jet to new york then took a limousine to connecticut i know he thought the way she looked would change my mind but it only made me more resolute i lay down in bed next to her hugged her kissed her felt her vibrations when he saw that he agreed to move her out here the corporation bought resthaven and set up a private wing for her i got to interview attendants handpicked elmo she became part of my life i came to really love her loved the other patients too ive always felt at home with the defective if i had it all to do over again i would have spent my life working with them at home the only real home shed known had been shared with two retarded people a textbook insight but she wasnt getting it i said and you changed her name yes a new name symbolizes a new life both jana and i had been given s names i thought joan should have one too to fit in she got up sat by her sisters side and touched the sunken cheeks she goes on forever she said shes been a constant in my life a real comfort unlike your other partner that cold look again yes unlike her then a smile well alex im pooped weve covered a lot of ground there are a few other things if you dont mind pause for the first time since id known her she looked drawn no of course not what else would you like to know there was plenty but i was looking at her smile stuck to her without being part of her like a clowns makeup too wide too bright a prodrome early warning of something i ordered my thoughts said the story you told me about being orphaned the accident in majorca where did that come from a fantasy she said wishful thinking i guess wishing for what romance but the way you tell it the true story of your parents is pretty romantic why embellish she lost color i i dont know what to tell you alex when you asked me about the house that story came out just poured out of me does it matter after all these years you really have no idea where it came from what do you mean its identical to the way leland beldings parents died she turned ghostly no that couldnt then again the glazed smile how strange yes i can see why that would intrigue you she thought tugged her ear maybe jung was right the collective unconscious genetic material transmitting images as well as physical traits memories perhaps when you asked me my unconscious kicked in i was remembering him eulogizing him maybe i said but something else comes to mind whats that it was something paul told you under hypnosis then suggested you forget something that surfaced anyway no i there were no suggestions for amnesia would you remember if there were she stood clenched her hands held them stiff at her sides no alex he wouldnt have done that pause and what if he did it would only have been to protect me im sure youre right i said pardon the armchair analysis occupational hazard she looked down at me i took her hand and she relaxed after all i said he did tell you about the drowning which was pretty emotionally loaded stuff the drowning she said yes he did tell me that i remember it clearly and you told me and helen twisting and turning the truth like wood in a lathe yes of course i did you were the people i felt close to i wanted both of you to know she pulled away sat down on the opposite end of the bed bewildered i said it must have been a terrible experience being forced under water someone trying to kill you especially at that age the primal age she turned her back to me i listened to the arrhythmic hiss and squeak of shirlees breathing alex yes do you think lies are a combination of elements her voice was empty dead like that of a torture victim fiction combined with repressed truth that when we lie what were really doing is taking truth and changing its temporal context bringing it forward from the past to the present i said its an interesting theory then if you feel up to it id like to hear about how you and sherry finally met a couple of days after uncle billy visited me paul came by and told me she was ready back to his house yes he put me up in my room and told me to meditate be sure to get a good nights sleep the next morning he brought me down to the living room everything was set up with big soft pillows and dim lighting he told me to wait and left a moment later he reappeared with her when i saw her a jolt of electricity shot up my spine i couldnt move she must have been going through the same thing because both of us just stared at each other for a long time she looked exactly like me except shed dyed her hair platinumblond and was wearing sexy clothes we started to smile at precisely the same moment then we started giggling then laughing out loud threw out our arms and ran toward each other it was like running into a mirror a few minutes later and we were talking away as if wed been best friends all our lives she was funny and sweet nothing at all like paul had described not selfish or spoiled the way uncle billy had implied it was obvious she wasnt highly educated which surprised me because i knew shed grown up rich but she was bright and wellbred her posture the way she crossed her legs she told me she was studying to be an actress had already starred in one film i asked her the title but she just laughed and changed the subject she wanted to know all about grad school all about psych said she was so proud that i was going to get a phd we really hit it off discovering that we liked the same foods used the same toothpaste and mouthwash and deodorant noticing little mannerisms we had in common like this i tugged on my earlobe no she laughed im afraid thats all me did she talk about her home life not much that first time we really didnt want to talk about anything but us and she hadnt been told about joan yet paul said she wasnt ready for that so we concentrated on just the two of us we stayed in that room all day the first time i had a hint of anything negative was when we got on the topic of men she told me shed done lots of men so many shed lost count she was sounding me out wanted to see if i approved or disapproved i wasnt judgmental but told her i was a oneman woman she refused to believe that at first then said she hoped he was one hell of a man thats when i told her all about you for a moment a scary look came into her eyes predatory hungry as if she hated me for loving but then it disappeared so quickly that i thought id imagined it if id known better i would have protected you believe me alex protected us when did it start going bad her eyes moistened soon after though i didnt realize it at the time we were supposed to go shopping together but she didnt show when i got back to pauls house he told me shed packed her bags and left town without telling anyone that it was her pattern she had no impulse control not to worry it wasnt my fault she finally came back two weeks later in terrible shape bruised groggy unable to remember anything that had happened other than that shed ended up in a bar in reno from that point on thats what it was like drop in drop out fugue states drug abuse jana your dissertation that jolted her i said i read it i was interested in you whose idea was it it started out as a joke id just been through a rough month with her a couple of overdoses lots of verbal abuse and i was under pressure needed to come up with a dissertation topic or apply for an extension from the department my second one i was unloading on paul about how much she frustrated me how hard she was making it for me that it would have been easier to be her therapist than her sister he laughed at that said being her therapist was no picnic either we talked about the loss of control that comes from dealing with people like that then he said why didnt i put myself in the therapist role as a means of establishing some sense of control in the relationship and write it all down working it through paul said she owed it to me sounds like paul was angry at her too he was frustrated all those years and she kept getting worse deteriorating toward the end she was downright paranoid near psychotic paranoid about what everything the last time she came back the time she wrecked my practice she was convinced i was out to get her that i was revealing her personal secrets to my patients humiliating her it came from her own pain but she was projecting it onto me blaming me the way shed done years before tell me about that it was a long time ago alex id still like to hear about it she thought for a while shrugged and smiled if its that important to you i smiled back she said it happened after she got married to italian nobility a marchese named benito di orano whom her mother introduced her to ten years younger than her suave handsome heir to some sort of shoe company another impulsive thing theyd only known each other a week flew to liechtenstein and had a civil ceremony he bought her a lamborghini moved her into his villa overlooking the spanish steps paul and i hoped shed finally settle down but benito turned out to be a sadist and a druggie he beat her doped her up took her to the family palazzo in venice crammed her with dope and gave her to his friends as a party favor when she woke up he told her hed had the marriage annulled because she was trash then kicked her out literally she crawled back to the states like a worm burst into my office in the middle of a session screaming and bawling and begging me to help her i called paul both of us tried to calm her down persuade her to admit herself but she wouldnt cooperate and she wasnt a clear and present danger so there was nothing we could do legally she stomped out cursing both of us a few days later she was the old sherry again foulmouthed popping pills back on the road constantly on the move from time to time i heard from her middle of the night phone calls postcards that tried to be friendly once or twice i even drove out to the airport to see her between planes wed chat have drinks pretend everything between us was okay but her rage hadnt dissipated the next time she came back to la to stay she got close to me again then started in with her followup visits god i loved my work alex still miss it what brought things to a head the party she loved parties as much as i hated them but paul wanted me at this one ordered her to stay away she argued threw a fit he told her that both of us couldnt go and id be the one this was for psychologists professionals only a special occasion for him and he wouldnt see it ruined by her actingout that set her off she attacked him tried to stab him with a pair of scissors the first time shed ever gotten physical with him he overpowered her gave her a large dose of barbiturates and locked her in her room saturday night right after the party he let her out told me she looked calm was actually pleasant remorseful forgive and forget how did you handle the party i asked meeting mrs blalocks friends for them i was sherry smiling and looking sexy it wasnt that hard there wasnt much substance to her for all the psych people i was me the two groups didnt mingle at all and mostly i stayed with uncle billy magpies and swans forgive and forget i said but shed done neither she stared at me must we go further alex its so ugly shes gone now out of my life out of our lives and i have a chance for a new start she raised my hand to her lips licked the knuckles hard to begin without ending i said closure for both of us she sighed for you she said only for you because you mean so much to me thanks i know its hard but i really think its best she squeezed my hand i got your message on sunday i was disappointed but i could tell from your voice that it wasnt farewell you were nervous had left the lines open i didnt argue so i was thinking about whether to call you or wait until you called me to set up another date i decided to wait let you move at your own pace youd been on my mind all day and when the knock on my door sounded i thought it was you but it was her all covered with blood and laughing i asked her what had happened had she been in an accident was she okay and then she told me laughing what shed done the horror of it and she was laughing sharon burst into tears began shaking violently doubled over and held her head she didnt do it by herself i said who helped her she shook some more was it dj rasmussen she looked up tearstreaked mouth open you knew dj i met him met him where at your house both of us thought you were dead we came there to pay our last respects she tore at her face oh god poor poor dj until she told me what shed what theyd done id never known he was one of her conquests he was the only one she held on to i said the most vulnerable the most violent she groaned and straightened pulled herself to her feet and began circling the room slowly like a sleepwalker then faster and faster tugging her earlobe so hard i thought shed tear it off yes it was dj she laughed when she told me that laughed about how shed gotten him to do it using dope booze her body mostly her body ill never forget the way she put it i did him so hed do them laughing always laughing about all the blood how paul and suzanne had begged and poor lourdes so sweet leaving on her way out when they caught her coming down the stairs sunday was her day off shed stayed late to help tidy the house laughing about how shed tied them watched as dj did them with a baseball bat and a gun him thinking all the time that it was me he was doing it forme whod used him she ran over and sank to her knees thats what amused her the most alex that hed never known the truth all the time he thought he was doing it for me she took hold of my shirt pulled me to her to her breasts she said that made me a murderer too that when you really got down to it we were one and the same i helped her up then lowered her back to the bed she lay down curled fetally eyes wide open arms wrapped around her trunk like a straitjacket i patted her stroked her said she wasnt you you werent her she uncurled her arms and put them around me drew me down bathed my face with kisses thank you alex thank you for saying that slowly gently i drew myself away still patting saying go on get it out the therapists prompt she said then her laughter got crazy weird hysterical all of a sudden she stopped laughing completely looked at me then down at herself all the blood and started to tear off her clothes coming down hard realizing what shed done by destroying paul shed destroyed herself he was everything to her the closest shed ever come to a father she needed him depended on him and now he was gone and it was her fault she fell apart right before my eyes decompensating sobbing not playacting now real tears just wailing like a helpless baby begging me to bring him back saying i was smart i was a doctor i could do it i could have calmed her down the way id done so many times before instead i told her paul was never coming back that it was her fault shed have to pay no one would be able to protect her from this one not even uncle billy she looked at me in a way id never seen before scared to death like a condemned woman started in again begging me to bring paul back i repeated that he was dead said the word over and over dead dead dead she tried to come to me for comfort i pushed her away slapped her hard once twice she backed away from me stumbled fell reached into her purse and took out her daiquiri flask drank it slobbering and crying letting it dribble down her chin then out came her pills she took handfuls of them began gobbling them down stopping every few seconds to stare at me daring me to stop her the way id done so many times before but i didnt she lurched into my bedroom still carrying her purse stark naked but with the purse she looked so pathetic i followed her in she took something else out of the purse a gun a little goldplated pistol id never seen before my new toy she said like it got it on rodeo fucking drive broke it in today then she pointed it at me tightened her finger on the trigger i was sure i was going to die but i didnt beg just remained calm looked her straight in the eye and said go ahead spill some more innocent blood get filthier you worthless piece of scum then the strangest look came onto her face she said im sorry partner put the gun to her temple and pulled the trigger silence i just sat there looking at her for a while watching her bleed her soul pass out of her wondering where it was headed then i called uncle billy he took care of the rest my chest hurt i realized id been holding my breath and let it out she lay there gradually loosening getting dreamyeyed and thats all there is my darling an ending and a beginning for us she sat up smoothed her hair loosened the top button of her dress and leaned forward im cleansed now free ready for you alex ready to give you everything to give myself in a way ive never given to anyone ive waited so long for this moment alex never thought it would

way he feels about you lifes bound to be pretty luxurious no it doesnt have to be i dont need that money was never important to me not for its own sake or for the things it could buy that was her thing when she found out who she was she freaked out started screaming at uncle billy accused him of ripping her off and threatened to take him to court such greed she already had more than she needed she even tried to get me to go along with her but i refused that really made her vicious how far did she go with the threat not far uncle billy managed to calm her down how i have no idea but lets not talk about her anymore or money or anything negative im here with you in this wonderful place where no one can find us or soil us you and me and shirlee well make a family be together forever she came toward me lips parted for a kiss i held her at arms length its not that simple sharon her eyes went big i i dont understand there are problems things that dont make sense alex tears please dont play games with me not after what ive been through she tried pushing against me i held her fast oh alex please dont do this to me i want to touch you want you to hold me sherry killing kruse i said it wasnt about the party that may have been the final straw but shed been planning it paying off dj rasmussen for at least two weeks before then thousands of dollars priming him for the big job she gasped reversed her movements trying to free herself from my grasp still i held fast no she said no i dont believe that as bad as she was thats not true its true all right and you know it better than anyone what do you mean and all at once her face that flawless face was ugly ugly with rage empathic failure what i mean is that you set it up planted the seeds sent her a sixyearold dissertation and confirmed her worst anxieties her eyes went wild go to hell she twisted tried to free herself you know its true sharon of course it isnt true she didnt read she was a stupid stupid girl didnt like books and youre stupid for even saying something like that this is one book she would have struggled through because youd been priming her for it using the same techniques kruse used on you verbal manipulations hypnotic suggestions things you suggested to her while she was under then ordered her to forget about kruse and you his liking you better she was borderline from the beginning but you pushed her over the border the sad thing is youd gotten over there yourself first she snarled turned her fingers into claws and tried to sink her nails into my hands we wrestled panting i managed to get both of her wrists in one hand used the other to hold her fast let go of me you bastard ow youre hurting me fuck you let go how long did it take sharon to break her turn her on paul i didnt youre crazy why would i to clean things up get free get rid of someone you finally realized had been manipulating you instead of helping you what made you break finding the two of them up in her room doing what theyd probably been doing for years or maybe shed told you about it when you hypnotized her incest the worst kind daddy fucking her he was your daddy too and by doing it fucking you over no no no no no you slimebastard you lying fucking bastard no shut up get out you fuck you piece of shit the filth poured out of her the way id heard it pour out of her sister the look on her face that of the girl in the flame dress loathing me murderous i said two birds with one stone sharon turn sherry on kruse then wait for her to come for you youd been planning it for months at least half a year thats when you told elmo to get another job you knew resthaven was closing down because resthaven was something uncle billy had set up for shirlee and you were taking shirlee out of there to your new home you and me and shirlee makes three a new partnership no no thats fucking crazy youre out of your mind she had dj dangerous violent you said so yourself two against one id have been crazy to put myself in that kind of danger she fought one hand loose finally got a nail in and ripped downward i felt pain wetness shoved her away from me hard she flew backward the backs of her legs hit the bed and she sprawled panting sobbing mouthing silent obscenities i said dj was no threat to you because all along he thought it was you hed been makingit with you whod paid him to kill kruse sherry couldnt risk blowing that telling him hed been deceived and having him turn on her she had to take care of you by herself thought shed be able to surprise you but you had the advantage she stepped right into your trap and you were ready with your goldplated twentytwo she kicked her feet in the air waved her arms tantrum early trauma bad genes fucking bastard fuckdick slimebastard first you shot her i said then you poured dope and booze down her throat a good forensic analysis would be able to show shed swallowed all of it after she died but therell never be a forensic analysis because uncle billy took care of it along with everything else lies all lies you fuck i dont think so sharon and now youve got everything enjoy it i backed away from her you cant prove a fucking thing she said i know i said and made it to the door a gurgling roaring sound the only thing i could think of was a cesspool overflowing came from deep inside her she picked up the water glass shed gotten for me drew her arm back and threw it at me if it had hit it would have done damage i ducked it bounced off the plastic wall landed on the carpet with an ineffectual thud your right hand i said at least im finally sure which side of the mirror ive been looking at she whipped her eyes down to her hand stared at it as if it had betrayed her i left had to walk for a long time in the darkness before i stopped hearing her screams i heard the buggy before i saw it a nightmoth hum coming from somewhere to my left then headlights swept the desert like some prison searchlight washing over me halting its arc preserving me like a specimen in amber within moments it was at my side step in doctor vidals rasp only he in the drivers seat as i took my seat he ran his penlight over the blood on my hand the desert air had dried it to maroon grit superficial i said well take care of that when we get back unconcerned you heard everything i said constant monitoring is necessary he said she needs care watching you saw that for yourself youre a big fan of showandtell i said taking sharon to see joan hoping that would dissuade her putting sharon on display for me in hopes of shutting my mouth he began driving what makes you think i said that youll be any more successful one can only try he said we crossed the desert more stars had come out flooding the earth with icy light glazing it i said when did belding die years ago how many years ago before the girls were reunited is the exact date important it was to seaman cross this isnt about cross is it what was the diagnosis i asked alzheimers disease before the doctors gave us that we just called it senility a gradual nasty fade must have been a strain on the corporation yes he said but on the other hand we had time to prepare there were early signs forgetfulness wandering attention but hed always been an eccentric his quirks concealed it for a while contacting cross was the first thing that made me take notice it was totally out of character leland had always been obsessed with his privacy detested journalists of any sort a change in habits indicated something seriously wrong like the playboy phase that preceded his breakdown more serious this was permanent organic i realize now he must have felt his mind slipping away and wanted to be immortalized i said the things that cross described the long hair and nails the altar defecating openly they were true then symptoms the book was a fraud he said fictional trash we drove on i said convenient of belding to die when he did it spared him and you confronting sharon and sherry ever so rarely nature acts in benevolent ways if she hadnt im sure you would have figured something out now he can remain a benevolent figure for her shell never know he wanted to kill her do you think that knowledge would be good for her therapeutic i didnt answer my role in life he said is to solve problems not create them in that sense im a healer just like yourself the analogy offended me less than id have imagined i said taking care of others really has been your thing hasnt it belding everything from his sex life to his public image and when that got hard to handle when he started going for the night life you were there to assume executive responsibility your sister sherry sharon willow glen the corporation doesnt it weigh on you once in a while i thought i saw him smile in the darkness was certain he touched his throat and grimaced as if it were too hard to talk several miles later he said have you reached a decision doctor about what about probing further my questions have been answered if thats what you mean what i mean is will you continue to stir things up and ruin whats left of a very ill young womans life not much of a life i said better than any alternative shell be well taken care of he said protected and the world will be protected from her what about after youre gone there are men he said competent men a line of command everythings been worked out line of command i said belding was a cowboy never had one but once he was dead it was a different story with no one to churn out patents you had to hire creativity reorganize the corporate structure that made magna more vulnerable to outside attack you had to solidify your power base having all three of beldings daughters under your thumb was one big step in that direction howd you get sherry to back off from her legal threats quite simple he said i took her on a tour of corporate headquarters our research and development center the highest of hightechnology enterprises told her id be happy to step down and have her run everything she could be the new chairperson of magna bear the responsibility for fiftytwo thousand employees thousands of projects the very thought terrified her she wasnt an intellectual girl couldnt balance a checkbook she ran out of the building i caught up with her and suggested an alternative money more than shed be able to spend in several lifetimes now shes gone i said no more need to make payments doctor you have an extremely naïve view of life money is the means not the end and the corporation would have survivedwill survive with or without me or anyone else when things attain a certain size they become permanent one can dredge a lake not an ocean what is the end rhythm balance keeping everything going a certain ecology if you will a few minutes later you still havent answered my question doctor i wont stir anything up what would be the point good what about your detective friend hes a realist good for him are you going to kill me anyway have royal hummel do his thing he laughed of course not how amusing that you still see me as attila the hun no doctor youre in no danger what would be the point for one i know your family secrets seaman cross redux another book more laughter it turned into coughing several miles later the ranch came into view perfect and unreal as a movie set he said speaking of royal hummel theres something i want you to know hell no longer be functioning in a security capacity your comments on lindas death gave me quite a bit of pause amazing what a fresh perspective will do royal and victor were professionals accidents neednt happen with professionals at best they were sloppy at worst you brought me insight late in life doctor for that i owe you a large debt i was theorizing vidal i dont want anyones blood on my conscience not even hummels oh for gods sake will you please stop being melodramatic young man no ones blood is at stake royal simply has a new job cleaning our chicken coops several tons of guano need to be shoveled each day hes getting on in years his blood pressures too high but hell manage what if he refuses oh he wont he aimed the vehicle at the empty corral you gave the silentpartner photo to kruse i said the girls were photographed over there fascinating the things one dredges up in old attics why i said whyd you let kruse go on for so long at one point until recently i believed he was helping sharon helping both of them he was a charismatic man very articulate but he was bleeding your sister before he met sharon twenty years of blackmail of mind games he put the buggy in idle and looked at me all the charm had dropped away and i saw the same cold rawness in his eyes that id just witnessed in sharons genes the collective unconscious be that as it may doctor be that as it may he drove quickly stopped the buggy and parked we got out and walked toward the patio two men in dark clothing and ski masks stood waiting one held a dark piece of elastic please dont be frightened said vidal that will come off as soon as its safe for both of us youll be delivered safe and sound try to enjoy the ride why dont i feel reassured more laughter dry and forced doctor its been stimulating who knows we may meet again one day another party i dont think so i hate parties to tell the truth he said ive tired of them myself he turned serious but given even a slim chance that we do come face to face id appreciate it if you dont acknowledge me invoke professional confidentiality and pretend weve never met no problem there thank you doctor youve comported yourself as a gentleman is there anything else lourdes escobar the maid a true innocent victim compensations been made in that regard dammit vidal money cant fix everything it cant fix anything he said if it makes you feel any better during the time she lived in the states half of her family was wiped out by the guerrillas same death no compensation those who survived were tortured their homes burned to the ground theyve been granted immigration papers brought over here set up with businesses given land compared to life itself admittedly feeble but the best i can offer any additional suggestions justice would be nice any suggestions about improving the justice thats been meted out i had nothing to say well then he said is there anything i can do for you as a matter of fact there is a small favor an arrangement when i told him what it was and exactly how i wanted it done he laughed so hard it plunged him into a coughing attack that bent him double he took out a handkerchief and wiped his mouth spat laughed some more when he pulled the handkerchief away the silk was stained with something dark he tried to talk nothing came out the men in black looked at each other he finally found his voice again excellent doctor he said great minds moving in the same direction now lets attend to that hand i was dropped off on the university campus pulling the blindfold off i made my way home on foot once inside my house i found i couldnt tolerate being there threw some things into a bag and called the exchange to say id be going away for a couple of days to hold my calls any forwarding number doctor no active patients or pending emergencies i said no ill check in a real vacation huh something like that goodnight dont you want to pick up the messages that are already on your board not really okaay but theres this one guy whos been driving me crazy called three times and got rude when i wouldnt give him your home number whats his name sanford moretti sounds like a lawyer says he wants you to work on a case for him or something like that kept trying to tell me youd really want to hear from him my reply made her laugh doctor delaware i didnt know you used that kind of language i got in the car and drove away found myself heading west and ended up on ocean avenue off pico not far from the santa monica pier which had closed up for the night and darkened to a knurled clump of rooftops over a thatch of bowed pilings not far from the vulgar pacific but no oc vu on this block the sea breeze had taken leave the ocean smelled like garbage the street hosted beerandshot bars with polynesian names and dayweekmonth motels given a wide berth by the auto club i checked into a place called blue dreams twelve brown saltsmudged doors arranged around a parking lot badly in need of resurfacing the neon tubes in the vacancy sign cracked and drained of gas a pastyfaced bikerhopeful with a dangling crucifix earring manned the front desk doing me the favor of taking my money while making love to a slab of fried catfish and staring at a california raisins commercial candy and condom machines stood side by side in the shouldercramping lobby along with a pocketcomb dispenser and the california penal codes reflections on theft and defrauding an innkeeper i took a room on the south side paying for a week in advance nine by nine insecticide stink no gnats here a single narrow filmed window exposing a slice of brick wall turned mauve by reflected streetlight mismatched woodgrain furniture skinny bed under a spread laundered to dishwatercolored fuzz pay tv bolted to the floor a quarter in the pay slot yielded an hour of fizzy sound and jaundiced skin tones there were three quarters in my pocket i tossed two out the window i lay on the bed let the tv run down and listened to noise bass thumps from the jukebox of the bar next door so loud it seemed as if someone was being hurled against the wall in twofour time angry laughter and truncated streettalk in english spanish and a thousand undecipherable tongues canned laughter from the tv in the adjacent room toilet flushes faucet hisses movement cracks door slams car horns a scatter of sharp reports that could have been gunshots or backfires or the sound of two hands applauding and backing it all the doppler drone of the freeway an overland symphony within moments i was robbed of twelve years the room was a sweatbox i stayed inside for three days subsisting on pizza and cola from a place that promised to deliver hot and cold and lied about both for the most part i did what id been avoiding for so long had pushed away by chasing the inadequacies of others throwing down cloaks over mudholes introspection such a prissy word for scooperdips deep into the wellspring of the soul the scooper honed sharp and jagged for three days i went through all of it rage tears tension so visceral my teeth chattered and my muscles threatened to go into tetany a loneliness that i would have gladly anesthetized with pain by the fourth day i felt sapped and placid was proud i didnt mistake that for cure that afternoon i left the motel to keep my appointment a sprint down the block to the sidewalk paper rack the remaining quarter down the hatch and the evening edition was mine gripped tightly under my arm like pornography bottom left of page one complete with picture lapd captain charged with sexual misconduct resigns maura bannon staff writer a los angeles police captain accused of having sexual relations with several underage female police scouts while on duty resigned today after a police disciplinary board recommended dismissal the threemember board of rights panel ordered cyril leon trapp terminated immediately from duty and recommended retroactive loss of all lapd pensions benefits and privileges in accordance with what both trapps attorney and a police spokesman described as a negotiated settlement trapp agreed to register as a sex offender forfeit appeal of the boards decision sign an affidavit agreeing never again to work in law enforcement and pay substantial financial restitution including full fees for medical and psychiatric treatment to his victims suspected of numbering over a dozen in exchange no criminal charges are being filed an alternative which theoretically could have included indictments for statutory rape narcotics abuse sexual abuse of a minor and multiple misdemeanors the offenses to which trapp pleaded no contest took place over a fiveyear period during which he served as a sergeant in the departments hollywood division and may have continued while he was a lieutenant at the ramparts division and at the west los angeles division where he was promoted to captain last year following the sudden heart attack death of the previous captain robert l rogers while at hollywood trapps name also surfaced in connection with the burglary scandal in which police officers broke rear windows of stores and warehouses on their patrols tripping burglar alarms then notified the police dispatcher that they were handling the call the officers proceeded to loot the premises using police cruisers to cart away stolen goods then filed false burglary reports no charges were filed against trapp who was characterized by prosecutors at that time as a cooperative witness with regard to the current case trapp was accused of luring female scouts into his office under the guise of offering career guidance plying them with beer wine premixed canned cocktails and marijuana before making sexual advances allegations of fondling were made in thirteen cases with actual intercourse believed to have taken place with at least seven girls ages to though the board of rights refused to specify what led to the investigation of trapp a police source reports that one of the victims experienced emotional problems due to the molestation was taken for counseling and revealed to her therapist what had happened the therapist then informed the department of social services who contacted the lapd corroboration of the charges was received from several other victims however none of the girls was willing to testify in court leading the district attorneys office to conclude that successful criminal prosecution of trapp was unlikely when it was suggested that the settlement constituted a slap on the wrist for an individual who could have been sentenced to a substantial jail term the board chairman cmdr walter d smith said the department wants to make it very clear that it will not tolerate sexual misconduct of any sort on the part of any officer no matter how highranking however we are also sensitive to the emotional needs of victims and couldnt force these girls into the psychological trauma of testifying the boards action today guarantees that this officer will never again work in law enforcement and will lose every cent he has earned as a police officer to me that sounds like a pretty good deal trapps attorney thatcher friston refused to divulge his clients future plans other than to say that the disgraced officer is expected to leave the state maybe even the country to work in agriculture mr trapps always been interested in poultry farming now perhaps hell have a chance to try it i read it once more tore it out of the paper and folded it into a paper airplane when i finally landed the plane in the toilet i left the motel i went home felt like a new tenant if not a new man was sitting down at my desk ready to plow through accumulated papers when a knock sounded at the front door i opened it milo came in wearing his police id tag on the lapel of a brown suit that reeked of squadroom smoke glaring at me under black brows his big face clouded where the hell have you been out out where i dont want to get into it right now get into it anyway i didnt speak he said jesus you were supposed to be making a few calls doing the safe stuff remember instead you disappear havent you learned a goddamned thing sorry mom then when i saw the look on his face i did do the safe stuff milo then i disappeared i left a message with my service right very comforting he pinched his nose dr delaware will be out for a couple of daays unpinch where to honey pinch he didnt saay i said i needed to get away im fine i was never in danger he swore punched his palm tried to use his height to advantage by looming over me i went back into the library and he followed me there digging deep in his coat pocket and pulling out a crumpled piece of newsprint as he started to unfold it i said saw it already ill bet you have he leaned on the desk how alex how the fuck not now i said what all of a sudden its letsplayhideandseek time i just dont want to get into it right now byebye cyril he said

speedboats are revving trapps a very small part of it i said i just dont want to paint the whole picture right now he stared at me went into the kitchen and came back with a carton of milk and a stale bagel tearing off a chunk of bagel and washing it down he finally said temporary reprieve pal but some day soon were gonna have ourselves a little sitdown theres nothing to sit down about milo its like an expert once told me no evidence nothing real he held the stare a while longer before his face softened okay he said i get it no neat wrapup case of the lawenforcement blue balls you were angling for a love affair with little miss justice found you couldnt go all the way but hell you handled that kind of thing in high school should be able to handle it now that youre all grown up ill

up the system milo i appreciate that you care appreciate all the things youve done for me right now i could really use being alone yeah right he said see you later he left without another word robin came home the next day wearing a dress id never seen before and the look of a firstgrader about to recite in front of the class i accepted her embrace then asked her what had brought her back youre not happy to see me she said i am you took me by surprise i carried her suitcase into the living room she said i was thinking of coming down anyway slipping her arm through mine i missed you really wanted to talk to you last night and called the operator at the service said youd gone away without telling anyone where or for how long she said youd sounded different tired and angrycussing like a trucker i was worried charity time i said stepping back she looked at me as if for the first time i said im sorry but right at this moment im not going to be the man you want ive pushed it too far she said no its just that ive had to do a lot of thinking long overdue she blinked hard her eyes got wet and she turned away shit i said some of it has to do with you a lot of it doesnt i know you want to take care of me know thats important to you but right now im not ready for that couldnt accept it in a way that would give you what you want she slumped sat down on the couch i sat facing her said thats not anger speaking maybe some of it is but its not that simple there are some things i need to work out for myself time i have to take she blinked some more put on a smile that looked so painful she might have just carved it in her flesh who am i to complain about that no i said this isnt about revenge theres nothing to take revenge for in the end you did me a favor glad to oblige she said the tears began to flow but she staunched them no i wont do that you deserve better than that dont do the crime if you cant do the time right i extended my hand she shook her head bit her lip there was another man she said nothing serious old flame from college coffee and pie i nipped it in the bud but it came so close i still feel ive betrayed you i said ive betrayed you too she gave a low moan and closed her eyes who old flame from college is she are you still no its not like that never was like that she captured my head not my cock now shes gone forever but it changed me she walked to the end of the room folded her arms over her breasts and said nothing for a while then alex whats going to become of us i dont know a happy ending would be nice but i have a ways to go before im going to be much use to you to anyone i like you just the way you are like you too i said so automatically that it made both of us laugh she faced me i extended my hand she came back looked up at me we touched merged began undressing each other wordlessly fell back on the couch and made love there made sex competent seamless union born of practice and ritual so seamless it verged on incestuous when it was over she sat up and said its not going to be that easy is it i shook my head what is thats worthwhile she peeled away from me got up stood in front of the picture window backlit naked curls hanging down her back like a cluster of grapes the shops probably a godawful mess she said messages slipped under the door all those backedup orders go ahead i said do what you need to do she turned ran back to me lay on me sobbed on my chest we stayed together cheek to cheek before the restlessness set in then went our separate ways sharon kruse the ratman even larry enough problems between us to fill a textbook alone again i thought of mine all the unfinished business i dealt with it by taking the easy way out found a number in my rolodex and dialed fourth ring hello mrs burkhalter denise this is dr
