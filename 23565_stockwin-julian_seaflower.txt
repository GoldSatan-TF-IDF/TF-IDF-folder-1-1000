julian stockwin seaflower sea toast chapter i the low thud of a courtmartial gun echoed over portsmouth in the calm earlysummer morning the grim sound telling the world of the naval drama about to take place its ominous portent also stilled the conversation on the fore lowerdeck of the old receiving ship lying further into the harbour there thomas kydds pigtail was being reclubbed by his closest friend and shipmate nicholas renzi i wish in m bowels it were you kydd said in a low voice he was dressed in oddfitting but clean seamans gear like renzi he was a shipwrecked mariner and his clothes were borrowed a courtmartial would try the sole surviving officer and kydd who had been on watch at the helm at the time was a principal witness there was a muffled hail at the fore hatchway kydd made a hasty farewell and clattered up the broad ladder to muster at the ships side the larboard cutter bobbed alongside to embark the apprehensive witnesses in the curious way of the navy kydd joined diffidently with the petty officers even though with the death of his ship his acting rate had been removed and therefore he was borne on the books of the receiving ship as an able seaman his testimony however would be given as a petty officer his rate at the time the pleasant boat trip to the dockyard was not appreciated by kydd who gulped at the thought of crusty goldlaced admirals and captains glaring at him as he gave his evidence which might well be challenged by other hostile officers in fact recently it had not in any way been a pleasant time for kydd and renzi their return as shipwrecked sailors to the land of their birth had been met with virtual imprisonment in a receiving ship at a time of increasingly solemn news from the war it was a grave problem for the authorities how to announce the loss of the famous frigate artemis their response had been to keep the survivors from the public until a course of action had been decided after the courtmartial with the result that both kydd and renzi had not been able to return home after their long voyage as far as could be known their loved ones had had no news of them since the previous year and that from macao their last touching at civilisation the cutter headed for the smart new stone buildings of the dockyard the last half of the century had seen a massive expansion of capability in the foremost royal dockyard of the country and it was a spectacle in its own right the greatest industrial endeavour in the land as they neared the shore kydd nervously took in the single union flag hanging from the signal tower this was the evidence for all eyes of the reality of a courtmartial to be held here ashore by the port admiral the court would normally meet in the great cabin of the flagship but the anchorage at spithead was virtually empty admiral howes fleet somewhere in the atlantic looking for the french the marine sentries at the landing place stood at ease there were no officers in the boat needing a salute only an oddlooking lot of seamen in illfitting sailor rig there were few words among the men who obediently followed a lieutenant into an anteroom to await their call pointedly a pair of marines took up position at the entrance it seemed an interminable time to kydd as he sat on the wooden chair his hat awkwardly in his hand the voyage across the vast expanse of the pacific and the early responsibility of promotion thrust on him had considerably matured him and anyone who glanced at his tanned open face thick dark hair and powerful build could never have mistaken him for anything other than what he was a prime seaman his past as a perruquier in guildford town was now unimaginably distant abraham smith called a blackcoated clerk at the door the carpenters mate stood and limped off his face set kydd remembered his work on the foredeck of artemis in the stormy darkness men here owed their lives to the raft he had fashioned from wreckage and launched in the cold dawn light the clerk returned tobias stirk the big gunner got to his feet then paused deliberately and looked back at kydd his grave expression did not vary but his slow wink caused kydd to smile then he thought of the trial and his heart thudded thomas kydd kydd followed the clerk emerging into a busy room where he was handed over to another expecting at any moment to appear before the great court kydd was confused to be led upstairs to a much smaller room bare but for a large table at a chair on the opposite side was a senior official wearing a grave expression who motioned him to sit down a junior clerk entered and took up position at a smaller table thomas paine kydd kydd nodded too nervous to speak my name is gardiner we are here to determine the facts pertaining to the loss of his majestys frigate artemis the lawyer announced with practised ease your deposition of evidence will be taken here and examined to see if it has relevance to the case soon before the court perhaps he would not have to appear in court at all he might be released and allowed home but then reason told him that his contribution was a vital piece of evidence he and renzi had discussed their respective positions renzi was a selfexile with a wellborn past serving sentence for a family crime and had a more worldly view kydd had a stubborn belief in the rightness of truth and would not shift his position by an inch the result of his stand would be inevitable were you kydd on watch on the night of the thirteenth of april gardiner began mildly shuffling papers as the junior scratched away with his quill off to the side aye sir quartermaster o the starbd watch at the helm the man would probably think it impertinent of him were he to volunteer that as quartermaster he would never have deigned to touch the wheel that was the job of the helmsman he had been in overall charge of the helm as a watchstation under the officerofthewatch and as such was probably the single most valuable witness to what had really happened that night a pause and a significant look between gardiner and the clerk showed that the point had in fact been caught as quartermaster the voice was now sharply alert acting quartermaster sir very well gardiner stared at him for a while the grey eyes somewhat cruel his musty wig reeked of law judgement and penalty would it be true or untrue to state that you were in a position to understand the totality of events on the quarterdeck that night kydd paused as he unravelled the words the junior clerks quill hung motionless in the dusty air kydd knew that any common seaman who found himself afoul of the system would be lost in its coils hopelessly enmeshed in unfathomable complication renzi with his logic would have known how to answer but he had been asleep below at the time and had not been called as a witness looking up kydd said carefully sir the duty of a quartermaster is th helm an he is bound to obey th officerothewatch in this an stand by him fr orders that was ltenant rowley sir lines deepened between gardiners eyes my meaning seems to have escaped you kydd i will make it plainer i asked whether or not you would claim to be in a position to know all that happened it was an unfair question and kydd suspected he was being offered the option to withdraw gracefully from the hazard of being a key witness open to hostile questioning from all quarters he had no idea why i was never absent frm my place o duty sir he said quietly then you are saying that you can of a surety be relied upon to state just why your ship was lost the disbelief bordered on sarcasm sir there was a blow on that night but i could hear ltenant rowleys words every one he said with rising anger gardiner frowned and threw a quick glance at the clerk who had not resumed scratching i wonder if you appreciate the full implications of what you are saying he said with a steely edge to his voice kydd remained mute and stared back doggedly he would speak the truth nothing more or less are you saying that simply because you could hear lieutenant rowley you can tell why your ship was lost the tone was acid but hardening sir kydd finally spoke his voice strengthening we sighted breakers fine to windd he said and recalled the wild stab of fear that the sudden frantic hail there in the open atlantic had prompted ltenant rowley ordered helm hard aweather and gardiner interjected by that i assume he immediately and correctly acted to turn the ship away from the hazard kydd did not take the bait the ship bore away quickly off th wind but ltenant parry came on deck and gave orders fr the helm to go hard down gardiner struck like a snake but parry was not officerofthewatch he did not have the ship his head thrust forward aggressively sir ltenant parry was senior t ltenant rowley an he could but he was not officerofthewatch gardiner drew in his breath kydd felt threatened by his strange hostility the lawyer was there to find the facts not make it hard for witnesses especially one who could explain it all but he was right sir gardiner tensed but did not speak the truth would set matters right kydd thought and he had had an odd regard for the plebeian parry whom he had seen suffer so much from the dandy rowley he was dead now but kydd would make sure his memory was not betrayed ye should put the helm down when y sees a hazard that way th ship is taken aback he saw a guarded incomprehension on gardiners face and explained further so there would be no mistake on this vital point that way the ship stops in th water stops frm getting into more trouble till youve worked out what t do and you allege that lieutenant rowleys act to go away from the hazard was the wrong one gardiner snapped aye sir kydds certainty seemed to unsettle gardiner who muttered something indistinct but waited we sighted breakers next to looard an because ltenant rowley had come off the wind they were fast coming in under our lee an no time to stay about there was a breathy silence gardiners face hardened you are alleging that the loss of artemis was directly attributable to this officers actions there was now no avoiding the issue he must stand by his words which he must repeat at length in court or abjectly deny them yes sir he said firmly gardiner leaned back slowly fixing kydd with his hard eyes unexpectedly he sighed very well we will take your deposition there was a meaningful cough from the clerk gardiner turned slightly and something passed between them that kydd was unable to catch resuming his gaze gardiner added and in your own words if you please concentrating with all his might kydd told the simple story of the destruction of the crack frigate from the first chilling sight of breakers in midatlantic to her inevitable wrecking on an outer ledge of rock on one of the islands of the azores but he said nothing of the personal heartbreak he felt at the death of the first ship he had really loved the ship that had borne him round the world to so many adventures that had turned him from tentative sailor to firstclass seaman and petty officer he also omitted the story of the nightmare of the breakup of the wreck during the night and his desperate swim for his life among the relentless breakers the joy at finally finding himself alive those details would not interest these legal gentlemen thank you said gardiner and glanced at the clerk whose hand flew across the paper as he transcribed kydds words it seems complete enough his detachment was a mystery after the savage inquisition of before the clerk finished sanded the sheet and shuffled it in together with the rest yell need to put yr mark on each page he said offhandedly kydd bristled he had debated diderot and rousseau in the great south sea with renzi and never felt himself an unlettered foremast hand he dashed off a distinguished signature on each page you may return to your ship said gardiner neutrally standing kydd rose also satisfied with the catharsis of at last telling his tale we will call upon your testimony as the court decides gardiner added kydd nodded politely and left renzi sat on the seachest he shared with kydd they had lost everything in the shipwreck nothing to show for their great voyage around the world his friend was fashioning a trinket box from shipwrights offcuts and bone inlay to present to his adoring sister when he finally made his way up the london road to the rural peace of guildford nicholas youll be right welcome at home m friend y know but have ye given thought t your folks renzi looked up from his book his eyes opaque i rather fancy my presence will not be as altogether a blessed joy as yours will be to your own family dear fellow he did not elaborate and kydd did not pursue it the sensibilities that had led to renzis act of selfexile from his family were not to be discussed but kydd was aware that in becoming a common sailor renzi could only be regarded as a wanton disgrace by his wellplaced family renzi added casually if it does not disoblige it would give me particular joy to bide awhile chez kydd he didnt find it necessary to say that this would renew his acquaintance of cecilia kydds handsome sister kydd sighed happily i told em everything nicholas i say my piece afore the court an were on our way home his keen knife shaved a thin sliver from the lid rounding the edge renzi looked at his friend kydds account of his questioning was disturbing in his bones he felt unease yes indeed and we shall he broke off above the comfortable patter of shipboard noises a faint thud had sounded as of a lightcalibre cannon in the distance activity ceased on the lower deck as men strained to hear another thud eyes met random gunfire in a naval anchorage was unusual to the point of incredible some got to their feet faces hardening a move to the hatchway turned into a rush as a third shot was heard on deck all attention was on the harbour entrance officers on the quarterdeck had telescopes trained and tense chatter spread some men leaped for the foreshrouds to get a better view it was a naval cutter under a full press of sail flying through the narrow entrance of the harbour an enormous ensign streaming and some sort of signal on both shrouds a white puff appeared on her focsle the thump arriving seconds later despatches shes a packet boat stirk growled an goin rapful shes got some noos fer us mates he said with unnecessary emphasis the cutter raced along and made a neat tack about opposite the signal tower backing her single topsail she subsided to a stop and hove to her boat launched almost immediately it passed close to the receiving ship the single officer ignoring the shouted pleas for news echoing over the water it made the landing place and the officer hurried up the stone stairs he disappeared among the buildings while the boat shoved off again to lie off it was galling to know that something of deep importance was taking place within a stones throw and speculation flew about opinions ranging wildly from the french at sea on their way to invade to the death of the sovereign they had not long to wait a deeperthroated great gun probably from the fort more inland sullenly boomed out and a line of soldiers emerged trotting in a single line along the waterfront on deck the excited chatter died away another gun boomed but then renzi cocked his head the church bells are ringing it seems we must celebrate a victory more bells joined in and more from the halliards of the signal tower burst hoists of flags and the water became alive with craft furiously crisscrossing the harbour in exasperation men hung from the rigging watching the growing excitement ashore a receiving ships main purpose was as a floating barracks for the victims of the pressgang before they were sent out to their ship and had welltested means of keeping men aboard they would have to contain their frustration for now happily it soon became clear that boats were putting off to spread the news a pinnace sped towards them a midshipman standing perilously in the sternsheets waving madly indistinct shouting tantalised but soon it was close enough for the shrill words of the excited youngster to come through it was a great victory by admiral howe out in the stormy seas of the atlantic not three days before in a rush the boat was alongside and the midshipman flew up the side pelting aft to the quarterdeck to report the seamen lost no time in hanging over the side and getting their story from the boats crew the tale disjointed and wild but plain in its essentials admiral howe had been at sea for weeks knowing that a desperately needed convoy of grain was coming from america to relieve revolutionracked france heavily guarded of course the two fleets met at sea and a running battle over three days had culminated in a titanic clash on june and a crushing defeat for the french willing hands hauled on lines of flags as the receiving ship dressed overall her token fourpounders banging out to add to the bedlam all around a delirious show from a nation at the news of a great victory in a major fleet action at sea ashore the dockyard and the town were filling with people their shouts carrying faintly to the frustrated men who knew full well what was developing in the taverns and pothouses of the town but to their unspeakable mortification the artemis survivors were not allowed to join in the merrymaking and it was so easy to remember their own wild reception after their victory in a sea duel with a french frigate the first fight among equals of the war and they wanted to relive the euphoria there was nothing to do but stare longingly at the shore and endure a hard and bitter thing for men who had suffered as they the courtmartial flag remained at the masthead but kydd was not called neither was he the next day and when the flag was hauled down on the third day he shrugged and made ready to leave for home it was also the day that earl howe and his victorious fleet arrived at spithead the town erupted for the second time and enviously the artemis seamen watched as the liberty boats swarmed ashore at portsmouth point incredibly they were still being kept aboard renzis disquiet turned to unease this was neither humane nor sensible treatment for shipwrecked souls and did not make sense the loss of artemis would be overlooked in the delirium of the victory of the glorious first of june so there was no point in keeping the men from their families a boatswains mate appeared at the hatchway and pealed a call artemis hands haaaaands to muster aaaaaall the artemis haaaands muster in th waist with yer dunnage well bugger me days said stirk an the bastards ave remembered were ere there was a scramble for their pitifully few possessions kydds own fitting into one small bundle with lifting heart he tugged on his hat and hastened on deck into the evening sun hooked on below was a big launch manned by a subdued set of seamen he did not recognise an olderlooking lieutenant was standing at the tiller his mouth a thin line heyho mates and its bad luck t any who aint chirpin merry in one hour said one artemis his eyes shining got th gormy ruddles sittin in this hooker said another hefting his bag an the only thingll cure it s me comin alongside some willin piece wholl show a sailor the way home kydd grinned and after their names were marked off in the muster book he went down with the others into the boat renzi close behind they settled all along the centre between the rowers but there was no answer to their jocular barbs the crew of the launch were mute and serious and they kept their eyes in the boat facing aft slowly the happy chatter of the artemis hands died away under a sense of apprehension the boat shoved off the men at the oars pulling slowly but economically as if they had a long stretch ahead kydd looked at renzi in appeal he only shook his head suddenly a cutter shot out from the other side of the ship with a shock kydd saw that it carried a party of marines complete with muskets and accoutrements it curved toward them and fell in close astern the officer not glancing at it as the launch shaped course to parallel the shore the poxy shabs roared stirk in disbelief were bein turned over he stood up and grasped the gunwale try it n youll get a ball in the guts growled the lieutenant stirk stood rigid as a storm of protest broke around him it was not uncommon for ships returning from a distant commission for docking and refit to transfer their company bodily to another ship without the chance of liberty ashore but survivors of a shipwreck silence bellowed the officer youre under discipline you damned rascals and ill see the backbone of any who doesnt agree chapter the boat borne away at speed by an ebbing tide through the harbour entrance passed scenes and sounds of merriment ashore as the seamen of the victorious fleet gave vent to their feelings in the launch there was a grim silence just the creak of oars in their rowlocks and a regular hypnotic splash as they dipped into the sea kydd felt bleakness take hold a lump grew in his throat as his eyes took in the land so far and so much had happened on the voyage his sorrow left no room for rage altering to starboard after making the open sea the boat made for the gaunt shapes in the dusky light of menowar at anchor at spithead but not before they had passed close to the raucous revellers in the rickety old buildings of portsmouth point close enough to hear individual cheers and oaths kydds eyes fixed on the shore renzi tapped him on the shoulder and he looked around to see down the massive length of a gun shipoftheline they passed around the stern with its oldfashioned open gallery and kydd looked up in faded gold there was a big heraldic ribbon the name trajan was elegantly lettered inside bitterness welled up and choked him kydd gripped a rope at the edge of the foredeck and stared back at his homeland unwilling to let the fastreceding land disappear the seas lengthened as trajan met the first atlantic rollers coming up the channel sending men staggering the twodecker was soon clawing to windward as close as she would lie two other vessels astern and one ahead the land finally turned to a misty anonymity and vanished and the lump in kydds throat deepened i must declare myself truly gulled renzi said appearing at kydds elbow shaking out the chinckles in a light line for coiling kydd was supposed to be at work on the focsle but no one felt inclined to make a point about it the artemises were sadly illused was the general opinion and they were left alone to their misery kydd glanced at him gulled not th word id choose fr it mself he muttered renzi paused is the loss of the flying artemis so much on the public mind that we are all to be kept out of the way or is the fleet so in need of seamen that they press even the shipwrecked mariner no what we have is a political act a move to shield the reputation of one who should be brought to account instead and with the exercise of interest at the highest level rowley has been excused of blame your evidence is suppressed it is only a deposition and we we are an embarrassment his voice trailed off for kydds thickening anger was apparent on his face were shipped out t the caribbee to save rowleys hide his face white with anger kydd said harshly t the west indies fever i fear so but dear fellow it is also the spanish main treasure the richest islands in the world and glory too as we mercilessly seize the sugar islands from the french renzi winced inwardly at the last but kydd had to see some purpose in this twist of fate in this old scow kydds scornful words were heartfelt after the trim beauty of artemis the elderly trajan was all that renzi knew he despised a shipoftheline she was lumbering and massive her timbers old and decaying and she had bigship discipline masteratarms and corporals trumpeter boatswains mates and his previous rate as acting petty officer had not been accepted in trajan she had her full complement and no need of him he was now no more than an able seaman even if a topman and he had to sling his hammock with the rest instead of in the cosy privacy of a screenedoff petty officers berth renzi said nothing kydds words were powerful and true and could not be denied he had every reason to feel aggrieved howes great victory had released forces for the ongoing island invasions in the caribbean and trajan was on her way to assist in these what better way to be rid of an embarrassment his gaze lost itself in the tumbling waste of seas stretching to infinity ahead he tried to swallow his bitterness and went below the noon meal was a cheerless affair no grog this close to home small beer only on offer boiled with dandelion and herbs it had a bitterness that was intended to hide rankness but at least it was better than water from the cask which quickly grew stale and flat then stagnant after weeks at sea the beer would give out and they would revert to rum which was much preferred but for now kydds pot contained a thin brew that did nothing for his mood kydd pulled forward his meal the square wooden plate he remembered only too well from his first ship as a pressed man no pewter and crockery here he glowered at the mush of peas and oddtasting pork there was soft tommy taken aboard in spithead the bread only a couple of days old and useful for wiping up the last of his meal there would only be hard tack in the weeks ahead got yer watch n station then mate doggo asked his grogroughened voice uncharacteristically low his ugly monkeylike face was long and grim for as far ahead as could be seen kydd would have to perform his sea duties as assigned this morning in his partofship and watch and this could be onerous or a satisfaction depending on the character of those in charge and his quarters in battle this might have been manning the helm and therefore defenceless before the pitiless musketry of an opponent alongside or with the shipsmashing pounder cannon on the lower gundeck or any one of a number of other dangerous duties second o larboard maintopman said kydd gloomily fingering his bread an the fore magazine fr quarters to his great disappointment he had learned that renzi was in the opposite watch this meant that they would only meet for meals and the odd make and mend when they could sit together on the foredeck at work on their clothing in artemis they had been in the same watch and had spent many hours happily discussing life philosophy and other conundrums isaac larcombs pleasant open face creased could be worse cully topman aint a bad start he said renzi nodded but did not say anything aye and that means im in yer watch tom kydd looked across at the towheaded luke a ships boy from artemis he smiled but only briefly luke was eager and had come to admire kydd but he was no substitute for renzi kydd was slated to do his trick at the helm in the first dogwatch and felt immediately better after he had seized control at the manhigh wheel the familiar tug and thrum of the tillerropes with their subde transmission of the seas temper was medicine enough trajan felt ponderous but obedient to the wheel just a little weatherhelm not enough to be a griping calm and sure he warmed to the ship glancing up often to the weather leech of the comfortable old main topsail he tested how far he needed to meet each boisterous sea on the bluff bows and what she needed to correct the yaw induced when a sea passed at an angle down her length it seemed she had no real vices which would be verified or otherwise when the old lady was really put to the test he could look forward under her sails the whole length of the ship a sight he never tired of the lazy heave and fall of the deck the blue horizon dropping out of sight then emerging at a slightly different angle a continuous comforting satisfying motion he nodded and a smile broke through she couldnt be mistaken for a racehorse but as a homely old mare she was perfect watch yer luff growled the quartermasters mateofthewatch there was no need for his caution kydd had been completely in control of the situation and there was never any question of losing way by coming too far into the wind he glanced at the man squat powerfully built he wore rumpled clothing and a glower that triggered a warning in kydd aye he said to be on the safe side at the interchange the officerofthewatch looked back from his pacing kydd kept his gaze politely forward aware that he was under eye he had nothing to worry about and continued in his duty after a minute or two the officer came over youre one of the artemises are you not he asked it was not at all the right thing to engage the helmsman in conversation but this was an officer aye sir he said it would be understandable to keep his eyes on the weather leech of the mainsail trajan sailed on kydd sensed interest in the officer youve got a frigates touch at the helm i see that did not require an answer but it must have been apparent from his many light moves at the wheel instead of the more deliberate slower action of a shipoftheline what is your name kydd sir broke in the quartermasters mate firmly in direct charge of the conn the petty officer had every right to deflect any interference from his helmsman thank you coltard the officer said smoothly but continued to address kydd so you were in artemis around the horn sir said kydd briefly he wished the officer would go away at the helm quartermasters mate sir hmmm kydd caught the quick glance at coltard and wondered what it meant the stumpy petty officer flushed and looked dogged the halfhour trick was over all too quickly and kydd felt reluctant to hand over to the able seaman waiting the officerofthewatch contemplated him with a ghost of a smile and he stood down with a light heart kydd went forward along the moving deck to complete his watch ready to lay aloft as a topman at the mainmast the atlantics influence was becoming more marked the longer ocean seas sweeping up the channel and adding stateliness and a wider range to trajans movements he glanced up at the lessthanwhite canvas noticing patches in her sails and signs of hairy chafing in her lines running aloft as with duke william earlier they were cutting corners to keep the most valuable units of the fleet at sea portland was disappearing astern they would fetch torbay on this tack and from there rumour had it they would pick up the convoy to madeira and then the caribbean another surge of resentment swept over kydd this time dulled by resignation an heres ter pieces o eight an a right good frolic in port royal chuckled larcomb raising his pot his sally drew general approval and expressions lightened along the table frien o mine in daemon frigate was out there wi rodney in eightytwo an paid off in plymouth carryin home twelve guineas o prize money said the man next to larcomb with evident satisfaction at the prospect yair but i got three ol shipmates went out too an aint one of em come back yet doggo responded kydd put down his tankard but y can have fever anywhere he said cn remember in artemis we had th fever after roundin the horn n on our way home even did fr the captain aye but larcomb broke in earnestly look if yer gonna make fishmeat yer number is awritten down already no use wonderin about it he said s why not rest easy n take yer life as it comes t yer there were troubled looks but larcomb ignored them has anyone bin ter the west indies he asked it seemed none had and he lifted his pot renzi stirred it would seem that we are doing well in the caribbean we have taken martinique he said to general incomprehension a big island and wealthy he explained i believe our intent is to detach one by one the enemy islands from the french but if our ships are out there doin this invadin then the french will feel free to fall on england kydd said with spirit yet if we leave these islands to themselves the enemy will take them no the islands are a wellspring of english wealth and we must defend them renzis cool assessments were not to the taste of his new shipmates and the conversation faded auberon the first lieutenant was on deck the next forenoon for kydds next trick at the helm he took the wheel from a greyhaired able seaman and squared up the quartermaster of the previous watch hovered fidgeting with the traverse board and slate as the minutes lengthened and no one came to relieve him for gods sake whats the matter auberon said peevishly to him er avent had m relief he said hesitantly auberon stiffened you mean hes adrift he snapped with some hesitation the petty officer nodded awkwardly auberon showed him no sympathy you shall quit the deck only when properly relieved he growled and began to pace back and forth kydd felt the rising tension and kept a careful alertness the duty watch on the quarterdeck fell silent as time extended avoiding each others eyes trimming the sails and coiling down the lines from aloft carefully and quietly the watch was set to exercise loose and furl kydd noted the marked stability the ship showed on the helm even when the big foresail was dowsed and furled unbalancing the forces of propulsion then let free and sheeted in to take up again in the brisk easterly this was a seakindly ship a single bell sounded from forward sharp and clear instantly auberon rounded on the mateofthewatch pass the word for the masteratarms he ordered in a short while the masteratarms appeared he touched his hat to the first lieutenant sir to wait if you please mr quinn said auberon coldly kydd handed over the helm to his relief and went across to report to the captain of the maintop for his duties for the rest of the watch clearly the man did not want to miss anything and set kydd to rehanking the falls around the forebrace bitts nearby it was unfortunate for the absent man that the first lieutenant was on deck this was the officer next after the captain in authority and who more importantly had the responsibility for the watch and station bill detailing every mans place of duty a face appeared at the mainhatch wary and hesitant coltard came on deck as though treading on eggshells darting looks about him the rest of the deck watch busied themselves but made sure they were within earshot you sir snapped auberon his cocked hat was jammed on at an aggressive angle his arms thrust down behind him there was no question of what was to follow coltard touched his forehead aye sir his face was pale and set his hat passed nervously from hand to hand you are adrift sir as if to lend point to his words the bell forward sounded a sharp doublestrike an hour trajan rose playfully to a sea on the bow sending coltard staggering a few paces got gripin in the guts sir feel right qualmish if y please sir his voice was weak and thick auberons expression did not change you have attended the doctor he stated in hard tones there could be no answer if he had auberon would have had the surgeons morning report if he had not it would be assumed he was fit for duty this is the third complaint i have had of you sir what have you to say to that you rascal me belly it you have been taken in drink i believe and at this hour you shall dance pedro pee upon my honour coltard straightened but his eyes showed fear sir im a petty officer not masteratarms this was harsh treatment for a petty officer they had privileges that stood them above the common sailor yet coltard could no longer count on them discipline was above all quinn moved eight paces away then turned and faced coltard his foot tapped a black caulked seam in the decking there was no pretence at work now everyone turned inboard to watch coltard stared down at the black line of tar get a move on auberon snapped as though it were a high wire coltard stepped forward and within three paces had lost his footing again said auberon within seconds it was over and coltard stood dull but defiant mr quinn this man is fuddled with grog he is to be triced up in the weather foreshrouds to dry then he is to explain himself before the captain at six bells haaaaands to muster haaands lay aft to witness punishment reluctantly seamen ceased work to make their way aft emerging up from the gundecks dropping to the deck from the rigging they crowded on to the quarterdeck the officers stood above on the poopdeck looking down with grave expressions on the little party below coltard stood flanked by the masteratarms and the ships corporal his eyes darted among the mass of sailors if he was looking for sympathy it was hard to tell kydd caught his eyes and he responded with a sneer kydd started in surprise the awful words of the articles of war sounded out clear and final judgement was given coltards head fell as he heard his captain disrate him he was now a common sailor turned before the mast there was more inevitably coltard made no protest as he was stripped to the waist and seized to the grating by his thumbs with rope yarns kydd turned away his eyes as the marine drummer opened up on the poop a sudden stop and sweeping down and the boatswains mates catoninetails mercilessly slammed into the paleness of coltards back it brought only a grunt into the appalled quiet the second and succeeding lash brought no sound either coltard was going to take it all without giving his audience the satisfaction of a cry kydd stared at the deck and felt the skin on his back creep making his way below afterwards kydd could join in the general hum of jollity at the humbling of a petty officer it was clear that the man was so much in the thrall of drink that he had risked the lash to indulge his need it did not take much to surmise that his shipmates had tired of covering for him and that morning had left him to his fate before he had reached his mess a small midshipman tugged his arm able seaman kydd he squeaked breathless aye lay aft and attend the captain the reefer said importantly kydd stared at him this instant you dog the youngster shrilled kydd padded aft and made himself known to the sentry dare he hope inside the great cabin the captain sat at his desk the first lieutenant standing near him with papers ah kydd it was the first time that captain bomford had addressed kydd directly sir i understand you are one of the volunteers from artemis bomford had a pleasant urbane manner kydds heart leaped aye sir you rounded the horn i believe sir and you were quartermasters mate at the time acting quartermaster sir he would never forget that exhilarating but terrifying time in the great southern ocean the massive seas and sudden squalls slamming in from nowhere and duke william before that the first lieutenant exchanged looks with bomford yes sir the big gun shipoftheline and its memories were well behind him now no need to add that he had been on her books as a lowly landman and then ordinary seaman then i am sure that you will do well in trajan bomford said smoothly it is in my mind to rate you petty officer what do you think of that yes he had been right to hope a cooler voice intervened auberon would have primed bomford about the presence aboard of a suitable replacement well before the events of the morning kydd had no illusions about his good fortune nevertheless id like it well if ye please sir there was no suppressing the smile in what rate sir the captains eyebrows rose as he studied a paper quartermasters mate he met kydds eyes again if you do your duty strictly and diligently i see no reason why you should not rely on further advancement if the opportunity arises thank ye sir it was a priceless step then you are so rated the first lieutenant will arrange your watch and station carry on please kydd strode back down to the focsle with his news clutched to his heart and stopped suddenly he was now a petty officer he did not belong with the others his excitement fell away as he realised that all his messmates were now subordinate to him every one even renzi his particular friend he continued down to the gundeck but kept his announcement until after the noon meal when he quietly made his goodbyes he left renzi to the end his friend had taken the news with annoying equanimity hanging back with a slight smile while the others slapped his back and showed gratifying envy it was time awkwardly he held out his hand renzi took it with a firm handshake but said nothing kydd mumbled something and left right aft on the larboard side of the gundeck were the petty officers messes each was screened off with canvas a little world within a world kydd scratched on the entrance of his new home he was answered by toby stirk knoo youd waste no time agettin yerself a petty officers berth the hardfeatured seaman grinned with his experience he had been quickly entered as a quarter gunner and pulled him inside it was snug and well appointed with pewter messtraps and the inside of the screens were splendidly decorated with colourful painted nautical scenes this ere is thomas kydd shipmates wi me in artemis he was right taut hand o the watch is tom stirk said smugly his dark eyes glittering there was no one kydd would have preferred to serve the compliments stirks courage in battle and skill at the long guns was fabled he thumped his gear down on the table looked around at his new messmates and glowed with happiness chapter t aaaand hoooop the masthead lookouts powerful hail stopped all work on deck land ahoy one point t looard in the van of the convoy trajans lofty masts gave the best height of eye and they sighted barbados first a string of flags jerked up her signal halliards and news of her landfall spread fast around the eighty ships of the convoy it had been five weeks since they had left england with only a brief stop in madeira the men in the maintop engaged in the endless task of tarring down the standing rigging broke into excited chatter kydd listened from his position at the aft rail wheres thisn demanded larcomb his face animated the barbadoes in course said carby an older hand this ere is the first port o call fer the caribbean evry other o the islands are t looard includin the frenchie ones he added kydd watched the grey blur on the horizon grow in definition and broaden eager white horses hurrying towards the land whats ashore mate he asked carby he was unsure quite what to expect renzi had elaborated on the strategic importance of the sugar islands but that didnt seem to square with the hazy tales he had heard of pirates the spanish main and the infamous port royal especially the pirates were they still at large yair well nothin much ceptin canefields and blackamoors grunted carby yez cn get a good time at the punch shops an the ladies are obligin ill grant yer his lined eyes crinkled but don expect ter be steppin ashore like in portsmouth town cully within the hour barbados had transformed from an anonymous bluegrey sprawling land to a substantial island curiously weathered into small ridges and valleys all looking rather brown as they rounded the southwest tip kydd saw many windmills and tiny huts on the hillsides in a sea of bright green sugarcane one after another the convoy tacked around the point an endless swarm of sail that filled the sea as kydd stood by in the maintop for the evolution of mooring ship he made sure that carby was near to give a commentary there mates thats the lobsterbacks barracks an up there big place near th open bit you has th hospital yer goes in there wi the yellow jack n its a shillin to a guinea yer comes out feet first kydd gazed at the detail of the land resolving in front of him a wide bay was opening up past a large fort on the point and a small town nestled in the arm of the bay carlisle bay an bridgetown said carby in common with the other vessels they would not be entering the harbour their anchor splashed down noisily into the innocent bluegreen of the wide bay as cable was veered kydd worked at furling the big main course to its yard this furl would be concluded with a fine harbour stow and he was in place of honour at the bunt in the middle not at the yardarm it was some satisfaction for kydd to be recognised as a good seaman a yardarm furler and bunt reefer was what a mediocre sailor was called the best men always went to the outer ends of the yard for deepsea reefing and the complex centre of the sail for harbour furling kydd on one side and carby on the other clapped on the bunt jigger and brought the clews over each side of the mast in a neat pigsear then they passed plaited bunt gaskets to finish the beautifully even stow the captain of the maintop let them work on without orders kydds fine seamanship was now instinctive finally at rest trajan slowly turned to her anchor to face the warm gentle breeze which was all that remained of the ceaseless tradewinds of the open sea they had enjoyed over nearly the whole breadth of the atlantic here the waves were tiny only enough to sparkle the sea but a swell drove in to the beach in huge indolent waves a potent memento of a faraway storm a lazy heat descended on the motionless vessel the boats were swayed out from their seastowed position on the skidbeams in the waist and one by one they were placed in the water an indefinable warm fragrance came on the winds from the shore dusty earth unfamiliar vegetation and a tropical sweetness the first away was the captains barge with captain bomford and the first lieutenant looking uncomfortable in their dress uniforms the next was the longboat its sturdy bluff bow pushing the water aside as it made its way shoreward it would be returning with naval stores too valuable to be left to the local lighters even now putting off from the inner harbour moodily kydd watched the boats lose themselves among the throng of other watercraft beetling among the many anchored vessels and the shore he could see enough of the lands details to feel frustrated he wanted to know what a caribbean island looked like trajan creaked in sequence as a swell passed down her length accompanied by a lethargic rhythm of clacks and slatting from aloft as blocks and ropes ratded against the masts with the movement haaands to store ship kydds duty as quartermasters mate required his presence he took one last reluctant look at the shore already lighters were putting off from the distant quay with water big leaguer casks in rows he watched astonished as just two men fended off then began manipulating mighty polelike oars all of fifty feet long to bring out one of the heavy lighters to get at the hold it was necessary to open the mainhatch on each deck one under the other at the orlop the decking was taken up revealing the noisome darkness of the hold now made light by the strengthening sun coming down through the hatches kydd dropped down to the top of the stores the empty casks had to be cleared away to allow the full ones to lower down into the ground tier safely nesded bungup and bilge free in shingle ballast the stench was thick and potent the shingle had absorbed bilge water and the stink roiled up as it was disturbed in the heat it was hard to take and kydd felt a guilty pang as he scrambled above clear of the hold he wrote his reckoning on his slate all the haaaands clear lower deck ahooy hands lay aft the boatswains mates sounded distantly above kydd cursed this was not the time to be stopping work secure he growled at the questioning faces of his work party below the captain had returned unexpectedly and now waited patiently at the break of the poop flanked by his officers still roared the masteratarms conversations faded and the sound of shuffling feet quickly died away captain bomford stepped forward to the rail trajans i have asked you here to tell you the news there was silence at his words our duty to the convoy is done this was met with stony looks the slow progress of the convoy across the atlantic had been tedious now we are released for our true work he let the words sink into the silence we shall now sail for the french island of guadeloupe you will be happy to hear that his majestys arms have met with great success in the west indies we are taking the french islands from them one by one martinique st lucia and now guadeloupe we sail immediately on arrival all hands should be prepared for shore service however i do not anticipate much opposition trajan and the gun frigate wessex sailed unopposed into the sheltered arms of grande baie guadeloupe the sleepy island was oddly shaped to larboard a bulking rounded beast of land to starboard a low rumpled coastline stretching away the two forming an inward curve where they met the land dipped to a flat joining place sunsplashed and deeply green the land seemed all that kydd expected of an isle in the caribbean there were no wharves and shanty towns that he could see just verdancy and here and there the golden lines of beaches the heady scent of land on the brisk wind entered his nostrils immediate and exciting the anchor dropped and cable rumbled out motion ceased on the trajan but wessex continued on inshore from a small squat coralstone fort kydd saw white puffs appear close to the waters edge the puny guns seemed to have no effect on the ship which glided on kydd wondered how he would feel if positions were reversed here was the equivalent of an entire artillery battery of the heaviest guns of the army coming to punish the little fort there was no more gunsmoke from the fort kydd guessed that the gunners were fleeing the menace closing in but there was no time to watch he was in charge of one party of fifteen seamen under lieutenant calley and a masters mate he didnt know and they would shortly board one of the boats for the shore the sudden crash of a broadside echoed around the bay wessex had opened fire the smoke blew down on them quickly in the lively breeze hiding the frigate but the effects of the tempest of shot on the silent fort were clear heavy balls had torn up the ground sending huge clods of earth and rock fragments skyward tropical trees had fallen as if slapped down and a haze of dust had materialised a storm of cheering went up and the men tumbled willingly into the boats kydd and his party were assigned the forward part of the longboat and he pushed between the rowers to the bow his cutlass scabbard catching awkwardly he saw renzi board at the last minute he could not catch his eye at this distance and wondered what he was doing he was not a member of kydds party he looked back along the boat to the rest of his men boarding his heart raced but whether this was at the thought of meeting the enemy or anxiety at having his powers of leadership tested in such an alien arena he could not be sure the men seemed in good heart joking and relaxed comforting in their sturdy sea ways the boat shoved off kydd at the tiller bows swung obediently shoreward bringing the seas smacking solidly on to the bluff bow soaking him these seas would make landing difficult and if there were enemy waiting for them the smash of another broadside drew his attention wessex was concentrating her guns on the coast where the boats were headed and it would take a brave man to stand at the focus of such terrifying rampaging power kydd looked back other boats were converging together bobbing and surging in the boisterous seas a deepladen pinnace stopped and turned headtosea rainbow sheets of water flew over the side he searched the seashore immediately ahead but could not see any beach just endless vegetation coming down to the foreshore and dark reddishbrown coral at the waters edge the heartening roar of the frigates guns ceased and the ship lay offshore under backed topsails there was nothing more she could do for them trajans large cutter approached the landing place to lead the others it carried marines close in now it did not appear to be under fire but seemed to hesitate at the last minute it dipped and rolled in the energetic seas then turned to pass along the shoreline to find a better landing place in a flash the boat was seized by the riotous waves and thrown over in a tangle of oars and red uniforms yells of fear and despair carried across the water other boats came on some followed the example of the lighter pinnace which stretched out manfully to ground noisily on the dead coral in a surfing rush its men scrambled out but before half had made it the boat slewed broadside to the waves and also overturned the more seawise cast an anchor when still off the landing place and with bows firmly held seawards veered rope until they were in the shallows the disadvantage was that men dropped into feet of water and stumbled soaked and bruised long yards to the shore kydd had the sense to deploy his men in a chain to the tideline passing over their heads muskets and the small kegs of powder there was still no sign of opposition ashore military shouts sounded in the glades where the sailors were grouping my crew t me kydd called brusquely he mustered them carefully two missing should he tell someone to find them the man might get lost best to count on what he had curious glances came from those waiting for him to show indecision or worse responsibility was hard what was renzi doing in his party he frowned and turned to him why are you he began i was bored kydd took a deep breath this was no time to be enigmatic then i am for the nonce a bona fide member of your excellent party renzi said an ready t take my orders kydd retorted then regretted his tone but stubbornness kept him glowering but of course my dear fellow one of the missing men arrived grinning foolishly and showing obvious signs of the bottle tom ltenant calley wants yr report said luke who had managed to get ashore as messenger his wide eyes gazed trustfully at kydd thanks younker kydd said and looked around for calley kydd sir mustered complete he reported if renzi was so eager to be in his party he could make up the numbers very good kydd be ready to advance in one hour you will take flank calley looked distracted flank was some sort of tent or blanket for the officers kydd assumed we will storm gozier fort said calley quickly the one attacked by wessex he added impatiently seeing kydds expression he turned to an anxious midshipman effectively dismissing kydd as far as kydd could see they would be assisting the marines in the assault a useful mass of armed men coming in from behind they would carry the familiar weapons of the boarding party pistols and either a cutlass or a tomahawk with its blade and useful spike it would be just like carrying an enemy vessel by boarding no marching up and down like the army seemed to do he brightened at the familiar focus trajans ahoy calleys voice blared we go to meet the enemy to the fore advance three distinct lines of men began to move into the light wooded land the red coats of the marines visible ahead the columns diverged and wending their way through the undergrowth the lead men disappeared from view away from the sea breeze the warmth turned to heat sending up the smell of steamy vegetation the path was well beaten now and they plodded on steadily the man behind kydd suddenly gave a cry and dropped his musket it went off with a muffled report suffusing the ground with gunsmoke he danced about waving his arms frantically kydd stood rooted in astonishment then he saw a large hairy black spider with glittering eyes clinging to the mans lower arm suddenly it scuttled over his body the man fell to the ground and the spider leaped off then disappeared shamefaced and trembling the man rose as calley arrived in a lather of indignation the first sign of resistance appeared with a tiny white puff arising from the undergrowth ahead and the tap of a musket sounding faintly kydds mouth dried this might be the enemy returning after the sea bombardment angry and resentful in their thousands he gripped his musket nervously and slogged on knowing that the eyes of his party behind including renzi were on him first section will attempt an enfilade kydd had not noticed calley return thats you kydd he snapped taking off his cocked hat to wipe his streaming forehead his cotton stockings were streaked now with soft green and his blue coat hung loose sir began kydd in an enfilade calley snarled sarcastically the object is to bring the enemy under fire from the flank so much for blankets thought kydd we rake him you ninny kydd burned why hadnt calley used understandable sea terms from the first to rake the enemy at sea was to slam a storm of shot end on down the unprotected length of the vessel instead of into her heavy sides and was generally credited a battlewinner calley glared then collected himself the fort lies yonder a mile or so off he said gesturing at the dense undergrowth to the north you will move around to take him from the east but mark my words you are to take position only do not advance until you hear the redcoats trumpet that we are also in place he breathed heavily else you will be destroyed kydd led the way a seaservice cutlass was too heavy and cumbersome to do much about the thickening ground cover and he swore at first under his breath later aloud his musket over his shoulder in its sling slipped and banged him and he could hear his men muttering without warning the trees and vegetation dropped away to nothing kydd fell to the ground motioning the others to do the same they had reached a track crossing their course it was the ideal path for enemy coming down on them from the north but there was nothing for it he must obey orders and carry on eastwards he ran across the track followed by his party the other side was a dense wall of harsh greenery reaching skyward eight feet or more so thickly sown that it was virtually impenetrable it would be impossible to keep on their course kydd crouched and felt a rising tide of panic he would do his duty or die in the attempt but this what if they were going in the wrong direction were late betrayed the brave souls making the frontal assault who believed they would be supported to the east by kydds section give over frettin tom larcomb said kindly coming up to squat next to him larcomb had his jacket off knotted round his waist what say we takes a spell here mate no kydd snarled renzi loped up at the crouch kydd braced himself he neither wanted to justify himself to his friend nor discuss the philosophy of the situation should you await me here i do believe i can find an easterly path for us my friend renzi was looking northward with a keen gaze er o course kydd said caught off balance renzi left his musket and cutlass and sprinted off almost immediately he disappeared into the thick vegetation kydd waited debating with himself what to do if renzi did not reappear then his friend popped into view beckoning furiously sugarcane has to be harvested was my logic renzi chuckled as they hurried down a narrow break in the canefield to the east logic thought kydd dully it would have to be logic if it were renzi but his heart warmed to the way his friend had made it easy for him dye think a mile has passed fr us kydd asked as casually as he could as they moved along the endless unchanging track the assault could come at any time i would think so said renzi kydd felt annoyed again it was easy for renzi he was not in charge not only did kydd have to be in position to the east but when the trumpet sounded he had to know which direction to push forward or end up in the empty country while the real battle was being fought and won without him damn you he ground out renzi glanced at him no emotion on his face kydd looked away at least they were in position now the fort must be away to their left he hunkered down for the wait the others lay around some on their backs seeming uncaring of the coming clashatarms renzi sat hugging his knees and staring into space while kydd got up and paced the sun grew hotter they had no water as it was all expected to end rapidly one way or the other the minutes dragged on with not a sound apart from a bird that kept up a deafening racket it was agonising what was delaying the main assault kydd checked the priming on his musket again perhaps calley had received secret knowledge of a greater than expected french garrison and was waiting for reinforcements if that was so a rustling sounded on the other side of the wall of cane they were discovered and before the assault he would sell their lives dearly though kydd seized his musket and pointed it at the sound he sensed the others grouping behind him luke wheeled round the end of the canefield i bin alooldn fer you his face was wreathed in smiles as he ran towards kydd then he stopped and attempted a professional look such as messengers have when delivering their news er mr kydd im ter tell yer from ltenant calley ter report t the fort what hes in a rare takin frogs ran off afore we cd even get in position they did his face clouded an he says as how yer such an infernal looby as y doesnt know when the guns aint firin there aint a battle kydd gritted his teeth of course that was what had been niggling at the back of his mind no firing a quick glance at renzis blank expression told him that he had known all along that their advance on the fort would be guided by the sound of battle an he told the joey major that hed be a confounded prig afore he sounds the trumpet t advance jus ter oblige a parcel o thats enough o yer insolence m lad larcomb said reprovingly the party hefted their muskets and followed luke meekly to the fort flames flickered ruddily from the cooking fire the seamen had left the foraging and other arrangements to the marines who seemed well able to cope kydd nursed his cracked cup of rum as he sat morosely against the wattle wall of the chattel house staring into the flames it was not his kind of war this crashing about in the undergrowth not knowing what was going on real war was serving a mighty cannon on a surging gundeck the evening was pleasant the constant breeze from the ocean reliable enough but the ground all about was hard and dusty he scratched at a persistent tickle in his leghairs in the darkness then saw by the firelight that it was a busy column of ants he leaped to his feet in disgust theyd eaten a kind of spicy chicken that the previous owners of the house had thought they would be having that night it sat uneasily on kydds stomach reluctantly he pushed his way closer to the fire and settled down again on the stony ground it seemed like minutes later when boatswains mates and corporals roared about to rouse the huddled men kydd ached in the predawn darkness after his uncomfortable doze a thin overcast hid the halfmoon and the night was full of dull shadows kydd knew the plan in a general way they would push forward before dawn towards a much bigger fort fleur depee and fall upon it at first light it was hoped that the defenders would not expect such a rapid resuming of the advance pay attention you section leaders calley was indistinct in the poor light but his words came strongly kydd stood in the semicircle of a dozen men listening carefully we advance on the fort shortly there are two roads sections one and three will take the easterly the other sections the westerly the roads go each side of the fort now mark this the fort is on a slight hill and reconnaissance tells us that the brush has been cleared around to give a good field of fire therefore and i cannot emphasise this too strongly we will be bloodily repulsed if they are waiting for us the advance must take place in complete silence total silence do i make myself clear all traces of weariness and aching fell away as kydd took in the words for that reason the first numbered sections will be armed with cold steel only this will ensure that there are no accidental discharges of musketry and do you bear in mind always you are not to leave cover and advance over the open ground until the trumpet sounds then move very quickly if you please calley added drily kydd took his cutlass the blackened steel and grey oily blade sinister in the last of the firelight he remembered the first time he had used one with deadly force then it had saved his life but at the cost of the enduring memory of a young mans face sagging under the recognition of his coming death he fitted the scabbard to its frog and slid it on to his wide seamans belt experimentally he drew the heavy weapons greased length it fell to hand easily and kydd noted that the blade had been ground to a good point it could be relied on to sink through clothing and leather to the heart form up he growled at his section renzi was present although kydd was none the wiser about his action in joining his party he had been too tired the previous evening to do more than grunt at renzis solicitudes there had been no comfortable conversation they moved off in the lead were other sections they paced on rapidly kydd grateful for the easy going afforded by a road instead of clinging undergrowth the road forked kydds section took the lead to the right the road sank lower and its sides reared as they passed into a defile cut into a rise in the coral rock until even the least military of them realised that trapped as they were by the vertical sides of the road they were easy meat for any ambush kydd paced on his ears pricking his eyes staringwide his men followed behind in file it was no use trying to listen for strange sounds the tropical night was alive with unknown stridulations barks squeaks and grunts the road emerged from the defile and began to trend upward they must be approaching the prominence with the fort astride it he reasoned sure enough a curve in the road led out of the wooded fringing area and somewhere shortly ahead must lie the open ground and fort depee dead silence whispered kydd or or it seemed thin and pathetic against the reality of their situation but the men nodded and plunged after him off the road and into the woods it wasnt long before they came to the edge the crudely felled and levelled area ahead gave no cover open ground all the way up to the drab cluster of low buildings inside stout palisades it was still too overcast and murky to make out much back we wait fr the call kydd whispered it were best they were not at the very edge of the clearing in case a pale face in the night was seen from the fort they moved inward a few yards and settled to wait i cn hear began larcomb there was a rustle renzi moved up and looked around questioningly there he hissed it was a footfall kydd held up his hand for silence his heart thudded another footfall a rustling of foliage someone was entering the woods and heading towards them at the edge of action kydd teetered the movement stopped and kydd took a deep breath but then came the tinkle of urine on the ground in a dizzying moment of relief he touched the arms of larcomb and another seaman then pointed they nodded and rose soundlessly in a swift flurry they brought the man crashing down he was a young sentry who had laid down his musket to relieve himself out of sight of the fort he struggled hard but was pinioned securely larcombs hand clamped over his mouth the struggles spent themselves and the hapless man stared up kydd knew that renzi spoke french andwhispered to him harshly tell him hes our prisoner i rather think not renzi replied damn it do as i we have no men to spare to look after prisoners to give point to renzis words the youth struggled again three men were holding him down three effectives who would be greatly missed later you cant just renzi said nothing the young mans eyes bulged he seemed to sense what was being discussed and tried desperately to reach out to them bugger wants ter talk larcomb muttered hoarsely and looked up hesitating kydd shook his head there was too much risk renzis logic led one way pity and humanity another he gazed at renzi in despair renzi leaned across and extracted the bayonet in a steely slither from larcombs scabbard no breathed kydd held powerless in horror as the nightmare face returned the youth heaved and floundered his eyes frozen on the blade a rank unmistakable odour arose hes shit hisself larcomb croaked his voice thick with compassion make room renzi said kydd realised he meant larcomb to move aside enough to enable the bayonet to do its work larcomb did so his eyes down the boy ceased his struggle lay petrified and rigid renzi crawled over to him and raised the bayonet there was an inhuman squeal of such intensity that it sounded through larcombs tight grip then renzi thrust the bayonet firmly into the chest to the heart a dextrous halftwist and the blade was withdrawn the gout of bright lifeblood hopeless and final renzi wiped the weapon on the ground and handed it back to larcomb he looked up at the anguish on kydds face duty can often take a harsh disguise my friend he said in a low voice kydd tore himself away from the sight of the fresh corpse his mind a whirl of confusion nobody came to where he crouched and there was no relief to his emotions away to the left far in the distance a trumpet bayed its sound taken up by another nearer tom said renzi softly kydd pulled himself together with me he croaked he cleared his throat lets give em a quiltin then he broke out of the wood and stumbled up the rise towards the fort hearing his men follow others emerged all along the fringe of wood it seemed incredible that their drama could have taken place in such isolation they moved up the hill the forts palisades were topped with continuous gunsmoke in the soft dawn light and attackers began to drop the fusillade died away they had succeeded in their surprise there were not enough men on watch to maintain the reloading cycle for full defence something seized kydds mind in a fierce uncaring rage a point of concentration for his incoherent feelings his legs burned as he pounded on towards the focus of his madness behind him panted larcomb then kydd realised he had gone renzi was away to his right and all the others he assumed were somewhere close all the time the weakened enemy fire found victims the palisades rose up suddenly renzi appeared beside him he carried a rolled jacobs ladder and coolly hurled it up hooking it to the jagged top of the barrier faces appeared above then quickly disappeared musket smoke came in gusts the sound of the shots this time from behind him kydd seized the ladder and swarmed up other seamen had boarding axes and they were using them in the same way as they would to storm the side of an enemy ship the seamens agility told they were quickly into the inner square and throwing wide the gates for the soldiers before the confused enemy could group panting hot and aching kydd stood watching the fluttering french flag jerk down then rise again surmounted by a union flag a disconsolate group of french prisoners flanked by marines began their march into exile the last of the dead were dragged off and the wounded attended to the crisp sound of marching heralded the arrival of the light infantry with a mounted colonel at their head lieutenant calley removed his hat and awaited the colonel well done sir the colonel spluttered as he dismounted damme but that was a splendid thing blast m eyes if it werent the marines snapped to attention their sergeant needed no lessons in military honours the present arms was paradeground perfect yet these men less than an hour before had been storming the fort the colonel marched across and inspected them his gruff compliments making the sergeant redfaced with pleasure kydd felt awkward with his ragtag sailors but the colonel touched his hat genially in response to the individualistic salutes of the seamen in no way disconcerted by the sight of their direct gaze and seafashion rigs a fine body of men said the colonel to calley and twould infinitely oblige me sir if they were in my column for the final push on the capital by all means sir your orders calley replied within an hour the column was swinging along at a measured pace astride the road to pointe a pitre the capital soldiers four abreast in a serpentine column that stretched ahead of the seamen with fifes and drums squeaking and rattling a sergeant of infantry dropped back from the rear of the column and stared with frank curiosity at the seamen hoay the sergeant ahoy called kydd the hardfeatured man fell back to kydd still keeping step how long to pwun apeter kydd asked the man sized him up there was no clue for a soldier that might reveal his rank he was dressed as the others in his usual red and white shirt with short blue jacket and white freeswinging trousers kydd sensed wariness and added tom kydd quartermasters mate thats petty officer sarnt hotham clearly a petty officer meant nothing either to this army veteran who peered at him suspiciously from under his tall black shako the voice was deep and projected an effortless authority that kydd envied an these are m men kydd continued gesturing behind him at the cutlassadorned sailors the sergeants eyebrows rose kydd must be some sort of sergeant then ah yeah he said easing his stock saw yez take the fort frm yer front plucky dos mate feet rose and fell the rhythm of the march was hypnotic aye well how far dwe march afore hotham flashed a quick grin dont be in such a hellfired pelt ter get there m lad he boomed that theres th capital town o the island an the frogs aint about to give it up without a fight kydd said nothing the whole business of war on land was a mystery to him hotham mistook his silence for apprehension not ter worry weve drubbed th french in every other island cant see why not ere as well so wes three four mile out lessn an hour but then we comes up agin the battery commandin the townhe sucked his teeth as he ruminated we gets past that on this road mongseersd be hard put ter stop us then it was still midmorning when the column came to a halt at the sullen rumble of heavy guns ahead a flurry of trumpet calls echoing up and down the line bellowed orders and earnest subalterns hurrying on important missions had the column quickly deployed in line the seamen mustered together in the centre of the line they would have the road with a clinking of equipment a squadron of cavalry mounted on indifferent horses clattered off towards the battery which dominated the skyline poor beggars muttered a sailor how so said kydd o course theys bein sacrificed to see ow far the guns cn reach a single gout of smoke appeared at the embrasures of the battery and seconds later a thud came but there was no apparent harm to the widely separated horses they cantered further along the road now even at the suburbs of pointe a pitre stand to lieutenant calley ordered we march the reformed column having tested their advance resumed the march eyes nervously on the battery above the town they tramped along the road unopposed kydd looked at the deserted houses and neat gardens no sign of war just a sullen silence the squadron cantered back it seemed the battery had been deserted by the french and their other forces were in full retreat the empty town echoed to their progress only the odd dog or fowl left to dispute possession by midday the seamen were slaking their thirst in the fountain of the town square and the regimental fifes and drums were bringing in the soldiers it was an anticlimax but welcome for all that parties of soldiers were sent out to secure strongpoints the seamen were marched down to the neat harbour its white stone walls and redtiled buildings baking in the heat chapter the rain hammered down in a tropical burst of furious intensity kydd opened an eye lazily it was relatively dry aft under the awning of the trading schooner and he saw no reason to disturb his repose there was little that he and his two men could do until someone had found enough seastores to complete the refit not just of this little craft on the slipway but the larger brig alongside the quay further up the french had not dared to sail these merchant vessels out against the waiting english or had time to destroy them a steamy earthiness arose as the rain eased then stopped kydd took in the landlocked harbour the vividness of the colours after the rain holding him rapt the ladder at the side of the craft rattled and the beaming face of luke appeared he and renzi kydds men had volunteered for this task rather than return to trajan other seamen were working on the brig mr kydd luke called and clambered over the gunwale he had sheltered under the schooner on the slipway with renzi kydd grunted and sat up chucksll be down on us like thunder luke said cheerfully less we show we done somethin what said kydd grumpily admittedly they could find small things to do the departing french had slashed at the rigging but the reason why the craft had been slipped a strake or two stove in forward would have to await the shipwrights attention before the schooner took to the water again renzi appeared from under the round of the bilges and paced along the length of the craft on the hardstanding god only knew what he was thinking about mused kydd the smell of the schooners hull close to was pleasant the essence of the tar and preservatives heightened by the sun the underwater weed and barnacles produced an intense sea aroma younker get yrself down t toby n see if he needs ye kydd told luke he waited until luke was on his way to the brig then dropped overside nicholas he said might we talk renzi stopped and struck a dramatic pose slow glides the sail along the illumined shore and steals into shade the lazy oar soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs and amorous music on the water dies then gazing at the broad harbour vista he said do you not find that you think i am a weak looby that i did not settle th sentry kydd said bluntly renzi paused only for a moment before he replied no dear fellow i do not kydd opened his mouth to speak but renzi continued i observe that you are driven by the highest considerations of humanity most laudable but these are not entre nous always the ones to bear foremost in such a pass your humanity bears you on up false paths while the essential principle remains neglected in this instance kydd said stubbornly lifting his chin sve could in this instance the entire assault is put to the hazard renzi replied firmly there is no other course your duty is as clear as at the helm in a storm the moral courage lies in attending to the matter and without repine they paced together to the end of the finerun bow kydd stopped why did ye come ashore with me was it t play the nursemaid do i need a keeper renzi smiled do you believe that i would not be interested in the fate of my particular friend a stab of pleasure shot through kydd y must be green at m rate of petty officer he said gruffly on the contrary dear fellow i give you joy of it his smile was genuine my purpose in a ship of war is in the serving of exile not to top it the tyrant over my shipmates at that moment the boatswain and his two mates came round from the other side of the boat sticks in m craw he rumbled but yez are stood down fr the day he took off his hat and mopped his brow an i have a berth for yez yerll be livin wi a johnny crapaud n his family ell tell y where he added thumbing at one of his boatswains mates poxy frogs sneered luke scornfully not you skinker said the boatswain you comes along wi me it wasnt far from the dusty waterfront in fact it was a shop in a street leading off the quay in its neat small windows kydd saw tobacco pipes bone snuffboxes and rows of caddies disappearing into the gloom outside stood a small moustachioed frenchman his desiccated wife behind clutching spasmodically at him nah then fronswah these ere are yer guests fer now the tall boatswains mate said kindly kydd ere an renzi that one compree ah ouithe man said doubtfully the boatswains mate looked at kydd so i cn leave yer with em then kydd lifted his seabag aye weve nothing t fear frm these folks the sailor grinned and left the frenchman looked up and down the street nervously and made shooing gestures to the two sailors aez allez he said mais mon brave nous sommes began renzi in mellifluous french sparking a visible leap in the mans spirits jai lhonneur detre henri vernou et voici ma femme careful nods were exchanged after renzi had translated his wife began guarded rapid jabber at him but renzi turned to her bowed elegantly and murmured polite words her expression relaxed a little they threaded through the shop and arrived at the back in a large kitchencumsittingroom a rotund black woman froze in astonishment at the intruders but was sharply set about her business an external flight of steps took them to the upper storey the wife fiddled with a key and stood back to let them enter her eyes following them unblinking as a crows merci madame renzi said the room was small but snug a womans room it smelt of fragrances that made kydd feel his roughhewn maleness le diner est servi a sept heures precises vois voire cle ne la perdez pas she closed the door on them supper will be at seven you will be gratified to know renzi said there were two beds one an obvious extra turn n turn about kydd suggested for the original bed was the better one he chuckled the throw o th dice he ruminated b rights we should be in a dosshouse o sorts maybe there aint any in this town i have my suspicions as to the hospitality said renzi but would not be drawn the door led to an upper veranda that overlooked the street and with the jalousie windows made it acceptably cool it was infinitely preferable to the careless noise and drunken conviviality of a seamens boardinghouse they went into the kitchen and were ushered to places on either side of that of the head of the house who entered last a woman with a frosting of silver hair and an intelligent face was seated at the other end and at kydds glance gave a slight nod and a tiny smile the table was spread the wine was open in the centre of the table and the black maid stood by a warning glare from renzi was too late to stop kydd reaching for a stick of interesting bread which he crunched appreciatively rattlin good he said but was met with a chilly silence i do believe that the french set great store by the preliminaries renzi muttered kydd felt reproachful stares around the table seigneur nous vous rendons grace pour ce repas que nous nous appretons a partager the ancient words of the grace droned into the silence eyes lifted and there was an awkward pause et voici ma soeur louise said monsieur vemou reproachfully and his sister louise renzi murmured to kydd they turned down the table to the woman who inclined her head graciously and said plissed to mit you kydd gave a broad smile aye an we too er maam i ave been the governess an richer of french to ze english before oh said kydd before what at the slight frown this brought renzi said firmly pray let us not be accounted boors my friend the table sat expressionless renzi turned to louise madame your english does credit to your calling kydd let the conversation flow around him it passed belief the situation he was now in the french were a parcel of mad rascals who had murdered their king and now wanted to set the world at defiance but here he was on the face of it one of the conquerors of this island being politely entertained by them perhaps the food would be poisoned he glanced at renzi who seemed to take it all in his stride he had the attention of the whole table except madame louise whose quiet gaze strayed from time to time in kydds direction tom madame vemou wishes to know what it is like living in a boat prompted renzi keeping his face a study in restraint kydd opened his mouth but recoiled the task of rendering into polite talk the stern realities of life at sea beyond him renzis smooth flow of french however seemed to satisfy the table during the meal a tasty stew kydd tried to remember his manners he grinned inwardly thinking of what his mother would have to say to him in this alien place so far from home the watered wine was excellent medicine for the pork and beans and he began to relax hear tell tht france is a pretty place he tried the comment rippled out under translation but caused some dismay mystified he turned to renzi it appears my friend that none here has ever been to france kydd gave a weak smile to his amazement monsieur vernou who was well into his third glass of wine suddenly stood up scattering dishes he stabbed a finger at kydd and broke into impassioned speech monsieur vernou states that he is not to be mistaken for one of those regicides in paris who have brought such dishonour on their country who have brought ruin and shame to the land renzis polite manner was not best suited to the passion of the words monsieur vernou stopped and grasping the lapels of his waistcoat glared down at kydd in addition monsieur vernou wishes it to be understood that he is proud to be termed a béké which i understand to be of a class in some way superior to others the little frenchman was still in patriotic flow so kydd stood up too and said in a strong voice we never killed our king we yet honour him an we say god save th king he raised his glass and drained it from the end of the table the gentle voice of louise cut in we also msieur keed you are in ze company of rqyalistes you unerstand a rapid volley of french at monsieur vernou had the frenchman starting in consternation mais bien sur que dieu benisse sa majeste britannique all rose que dieu benisse sa majeste renzi returned the compliment and the table sat down to a happy babble i pray the lunacy on the streets of paris does not cross the seas to here renzi remarked in a low voice to kydd these good people will be its first victims the next few days passed in a blur of contentment for kydd the boatswain arrived with stores coils of good hemp rope six blocks to replace those weakened by tropical rot and oakum for deck seams the ships carpenter put in an appearance to tuttut over the sprung bow strakes and left with the promise that his mates would come later at the billet kydd setded into a pleasant domestic routine louise mended a shirtsleeve he had torn it was her room that the sailors now inhabited at family meals she had taken to sitting next to kydd her quaint english welcome when renzi engaged in his long conversations in french she would gently chide him on his manners which kydd found endearing if disconcerting less than a week later when the schooner had been brought to readiness but for the stove bow strakes they sat down to their meal and unwelcome news the french have made their move renzi murmured to kydd after the first excited flurry of talk had settled kydds mouth was full but he couldnt help saying this scran is rousin good eatin nicholas the ragout of fish had an elusive flavour of herbs french cooking was fast persuading kydd that the english did not have it all their own way in the culinary arts it could prove unfortunate renzi pressed whats afoot kydd asked mouth full they say there are rumours that significant landings have been made to the north of the island renzi said in a low voice louise overheard so a few soldier land we ave the protection of ze engleeesh sheeps and soldiers too monsieur vernou snapped some words my brothair he remind that we bike are many and will flock to the colour of bourbon france renzi dabbed his mouth these are landed from a frigate this implies that they are regular troops on a planned invasion by the revolutionaries he added for emphasis but you vill always prevail louise said that is not altogether certain renzi said carefully why do ye say that nicholas kydd said with some asperity consider trajan and the frigates are away attending to the reduction of san domingo they cannot come at our call immediately because they are headed by the winds and current the garrison here in guadeloupe is few we have sent perhaps too many soldiers to san domingo the royalists are no trouble and look to seeing out the larger war under our governance but they may prove unreliable if tested too far if the jacobins are energetic and well led it could be kydd turned to louise but her eyes were troubled so he didnt speak the following morning there was even worse news it seems that the terror in paris has come here at last renzi told kydd after listening to a fearstruck visitor as they prepared to leave for their work there was no need to lower his voice now there was a hubbub of frantic speculation a guillotine came with the frigate and it is doing its work out there even now renzi looked grave one hundred maybe as many as three hundred have perished in a night of blood this is serious news indeed a torrent of weeping and beseeching from the women greeted the sight of monsieur vernou in his ensign of reserves uniform he made an impassioned speech then marched out head held high the ladies clutched one another the royalists go to preserve their very lives now said renzi quietly kydd wandered out of the house in a daze if there was anything in what renzi had said the vernous were in grave danger he tried to suppress the image of louises gentle face his steps led him to the waterfront and as he turned the last corner he saw soldiers hey now said the sergeant coming out from behind a beached boat jack tar on land still still are replied kydd an you sarnt hotham you on yr way t stoppin the frogs at th landing hotham did not reply at first he looked about then stepped up to kydd and spoke quietly no mate were not nobody is see we just aint got the numbers to face em so many bein away in santa domingy so were fallin back on the town cn you hold em if they attack yeah dont worry an dont ye worry yrself kydd said stoudy navyll be sendin their fleet soon an thatll settle their account trajan and the others would make short work of whatever ships the french had if they were alerted and could make it back in time the new day developed into its usual tropical grandeur the royalist force marched out with english soldiers to meet the revolutionaries and that night the vernou family sat up late debating events kydd lay awake for a long time haunted by an image of louise strapped to a guillotine looking up at the blade he was awoken in the dark early hours by sounds from below there was a scuffle outside followed by a furious hammering on the door he leaped from bed and hurried below aware that he and renzi were the only men in the house cautiously he unbarred the door que dieu nous aide nous sommes condamnes a middleaged lady in mob cap cried as she pushed inside renzi close behind kydd tried to pacify her she thrust a paper at him renzi took a candle from louise who had just appeared and read the flickering light lit up his face from below the worst he said his expression as grave as kydd had seen the political leader of these revolutionaries whose name is victor hugues has made a proclamation which he has secretly posted throughout the town under cover of night kydd felt his bowels tighten he has stated in effect that the glorious revolution promised liberty equality and fraternity which applies to the slaves of this island all slaves are now free and owe no obedience to any béké from this moment on cest la fin de noire societe telle que nous la connaissons the woman moaned louise stood stock still pale and staring what does it mean kydd said but he knew the answer already he had no specific feelings about slavery he hadnt any experience of it but the effect of uncontrolled freedom on those who had been enslaved would have the situation spinning out of control renzi spoke quietly it means that with a single move of diabolical genius this victor hugues has turned the tables on us a large slave population now loose and in disorder is something no military commander can have in his rear we are finished there was a horrified silence as far as we know from the shop came the sudden sound of splintering glass and low animal growls kydd pushed open the door and in the breaking dawn saw figures clambering through the wreckage of the front window get back its not safe kydd called slammed the door and shot the bolt the terrified ladies hurried up the stairs while renzi searched for arms there were more sounds of breaking glass then quiet kydd eased open the door and saw that the shopfront was in ruins he crossed to the door and looked out into the street it was deserted but a plume of smoke billowed skyward a street away irregular sinister sounds broke the peace wed better stay with the ladies nicholas kydd called renzi joined him hark he said sharply holding up his hand kydd couldnt be sure but he thought he heard a sharp squeal against the silence it chilled his blood i thought shut up then from the top of the street came a boatswains call hands to muster exclaimed kydd he ran into the middle of the street and waved his arms the boatswains mate looked him over with a lopsided smile you kydd get yer men n their gear over to th town square we needs evry man cn carry a musket at kydds reluctance he snapped sharpish like lootenant aint waitin fer any wants ter dally he glared at kydd and left kydd looked back at the old shop the front sad and threatening how could he abandon the women at this time he stole a glance at renzi his friend was looking steadily at him his arms folded he looked away perhaps there was time to get louise and madame vernou away but the schooner was still unfit for sea and what was he thinking who was there to man any craft he could find and how would it be seen by others that he was running away from a hopeless situation to save himself there was no alternative he had his duty he stiffened what are ye waitin for nicholas lets get our dunnage their room seemed a fragile relic of gentler times louises fragrance soothing and poignant their seabags were stuffed in a trice but the two women were at the door the maid nowhere to be seen at the sight of their set faces madame vernou broke into weeping and louise simply stared neither accusing nor forgiving we thats t say we have t go kydd said awkwardly to his consternation madame vernou fell to her knees and clutched at him sobbing her words had no need of translation gently he disengaged her louise stood like a statue and on an impulse he tore off a button from his short blue seamans jacket and pressed it into her hand she took it raised it to her lips and kissed it kydd saw her eyes glisten we go now nicholas he said good just in time you go with mr jowett the lieutenant was harassed and fretful but his brow cleared at the sight of kydd and renzi the square was crowded with men milling about in anxious groups jowett turned out to be a masters mate of uncertain temper his men including kydd and renzi were formed up and the little band moved out they marched swiftly jowett eyeing the streets warily for trouble only the four marines had muskets where re we headed kydd asked the tattooed sailor next to him the man shifted the tobacco quid in his mouth and said with satisfaction ter th wharf ter get the brig t sea kydd hefted his seabag a dawning thought lifting his hopes yes they were turning into the last street and would pass the vernou shop mr jowett called kydd cn i check on m billet as was when we pass reluctantly jowett halted the band kydd knew he would be inclined to trust that a petty officer had good reason to delay the party now jowett would find he had two women passengers on the brig kydd called out to the family but no one emerged jowett hailed him peremptorily kydd went in hastily when his eyes became accustomed to the dark interior he noticed the charring on the steps to his room tiny wisps of blue smoke still spiralling then the blood trickling over the edge of the floor above the door darkened and jowetts angry face swam into his vision well spread some canvas an lets be goin kydd stumbled out and seeing his appalled expression renzi grabbed his arm too late kydd muttered he was too shaken to look renzi in the eye they trudged on kydd in a haze of grief the brig had been warped a hundred yards offshore and the wharf was filling rapidly with crowds of frantic humanity beseeching imploring and fighting to get passage on the vessel jowett established a secure position at the waters edge the marines making free with their bayonet points a boat was signalled ashore from the three men aboard when it arrived it became clear that the brig was in no fit state to sail under refit it had no need for sails they had all been sent down and kept somewhere ashore the strain was beginning to tell seamen snarled at each other and snapped at the weeping frenzied mob kydd found himself crudely brushing aside an old woman feeling her withered skin and frail bones her ancient face distorted with terror the sailloft was found and sails quickly stowed in the boat a flat thud sounded above the chaos then another gunsmoke wreathed a ridge above the capital theyre bombarding the town yelled renzi blood appeared in the mass of hysterical bodies as the marines wielded their bayonets more brutally the guns on the ridge spoke in chorus but where the shot went was not obvious the sailors boarded the boat in a rush making it pitch alarmingly the sails were taken out to the brig some seamen swarming into the tops others locating the halliards and lifts we go out under staysails an mizzen ordered jowett there was a ragged hiss and a thump a plume of water rose in the sea the cannon ball going on to smash a beachside hut to splinters theys shyin at us growled jowett time we wasnt here kydd felt an overwhelming urge to be back at sea where it would be calm and sane from the shore came distant screams and cursing the marines were having difficulty defending themselves jowett seized kydds arm get ashore send twenty of em out ter me twenty is all a ball slapped through the fore topmast staysail as it rose up on the stay now kydd threw a glance at renzi who was just descending from the mainshrouds and boarded the boat he took the tiller and headed for the chaos ashore swelled now by royalist deserters who had broken into grogshops the marines had fear in their eyes the mob was near uncontrollable the boat bumped up against the stone wharf and kydd fought his way up to the marines watch m back you lobsterbacks he yelled and took an oar into the crowd rotating it wildly to clear a space it gained a minute or two then what to whom should he award life to whom deny it one of the men on the oars came up courageously to help him together they held the oar as a barrier there around two rows back a mother and daughter they should go he pointed them out and beckoned under screams of rage from the others they forced their way under the oar and to safety kydds eyes darted around the greyhaired man with the proud but fearful expression a royalist officer doomed if he remained as the man came forward kydd noticed he was trembling so much he could hardly steady himself others the boat was filling fast a sharp crack and rending of timber some spar in the brig taking a ball there was no time to lose he made sure the oarsmen were clear the gunwales were only six inches above the water he would wedge himself into the stern kydd looked around at the crowd for the last time and with a shock saw louise on the fringes without stopping to consider the consequences he pointed and beckoned the mob howled and tore at her and she fell but rose and fought her way through kydd tried to think what her presence must imply whose blood had he seen at the house louise paused in front of him and he pushed her to the boat she clambered aboard over the transom into the place kydd had intended for himself the boat swayed nearly dipping the gunwales under its passengers screamed in fright there was no chance for him on this trip he watched the boat reach the brig as a cannon shot brought up a vicious plume of spray not five yards from it the people scrambled for their lives up the side and kydd noticed the line of the morning sun lengthening down the brigs hull her cables had been cut the fore and aft sails were shaken out and with the empty boat drifting free astern the brig caught the wind and put to sea lieutenant calley did not look up from his writing the faint tap of muskets sounded the french must be close his shirt stuck to him in the close heat of the small room and he muttered as he wrote kydd waited patiently they had made it back to the square and found it empty of friendly soldiery in fact empty of most inhabitants they had only found their way to this headquarters after a chance encounter with a hurrying party of infantrymen calley looked up kydd was shocked by the dark rings around his eyes and the evidence in his posture of extreme tiredness the town is in total disorder the french are approaching from the east there is no help for it we must yield the capital he spoke generally not at kydd but into his immediate front aye sir he said so much had happened since that predawn awakening the noon heat was dire in this room and he longed to be out in the steady sea breeze you er kydd calley seemed to have difficulty with his words we we must hold until trajan returns with er reinforcements the sweat prickled down kydds back what i want you to try to do is take your party to petit bourg our largest remaining stronghold i shall withdraw into the mountains of basse terre and yield up the capital and eastern half of the island to the enemy his head lowered god knows i have done what i can kydd knew better than to voice his anxieties ayeaye sir he said the ageold response to a naval order and made his exit outside the marines waited no file of men presenting arms just a group of three in dusty tunics bowed with fatigue but with muskets bright and gleaming why they should follow his orders he had no idea but he saw them straighten when he emerged looking to him in that moment he understood they needed from him that nameless quality that drove men on regardless through adversity and battle they were joined by five seamen were meetin our mates kydd said decisively at putty borg over yonder he added it had been pointed out to him earlier an anonymous huddle of buildings just visible across the bay on the rugged basse terre proper thats a fuckin long way off cully said an older seaman in measured tones the group fell quiet yr right fifty miles if its a yard kydd snapped so lets be havin ye there would be no rations no water until they made the safety of the fort but in fact it could be no more than five miles away on yr feet kydd barked the men stirred and got up in ones or twos marines get into yr line an lead off they shuffled into file and stood to attention staring ahead blankly as they always did right march away kydd shouted not at all sure of the form of orders to start men marching the marines after a moments confusion stepped out and the little band of men tramped off down the dusty road out of town kydd felt a swell of pride his men obeying his orders going on a military mission of importance some time later the gates of the small petit bourg citadel hove in sight for the footsore and dusty band security food drink and above all the warmth of company of their own kind halt this was not a welcome what had happened for a moment kydd thought that the french had reached here and were enticing them into a trap the fort ahoy shouted kydd party o men frm pwunapeter come t join he could now hand over responsibility for his men he felt a slight pang a different voice came from high above and kydd saw the shako of an army officer well done you men there was a pause and thehead and shoulders of the officer showed you should understand that we may have fever there was a stirring of alarm among kydds men and therefore you may not wish to enter sod it any place as vittles somewhere ter flake out said the older seaman coarsely hold yr jabber kydd told him briefly where else cn we go sir he hailed wouldnt advise you to remain here the officer called i expect an assault any hour kydds heart lurched yet i do know where there are more of you fellows you might wish to join them his tone became apologetic its all of twenty miles or so further along this road around the south part of this island fort mathilda silence i do believe you should make your dispositions soon the officer said and indicated across the bay to where they had come from pointe a pitre was now a bleak scene ruined gaps in rows of houses smoke from burning buildings the smell of devastation lay on the wind the bombardment had stopped which meant that the french were in possession of the town no choice is there mates he heard from beside him he remembered renzis way with logic and forced himself to think if they entered they would be safe for the time being but at the risk of yellow fever if they started on a march of twenty miles or more there was every chance that they would be overtaken by the french or they might make it without exposure to the fever the elements shuffled themselves in his head at vertiginous speed and came down on a course of cool certainty they would march on if there was a chance they could reinforce fort mathilda with some ablebodied men then their duty was plain we march he growled he hailed the fort again we go on sir chance o some rations an some water the officer removed his hat very commendable my man i will see to it his figure disappeared downwards there is a choice yer knows the older seaman confronted him his eyes fixing kydds were not in kilter fer a long piece o walkin so we as ter do what we must we gives it all away we got nothin ter worry of not like them royalists well get treated square kydds fist slammed into the mans stomach doubling him over the next blow took him on the chin knocking him to the dust where he lay sullenly feeling his jaw kydd turned back to the fort a bucket on the end of a piece of rope appeared in it covered by a grey blanket were army biscuits two cooked haunches of rabbit and a hand of bananas three canteens of water followed march kydd ordered they stepped off the fallen man left to catch up as they rounded a curve he saw the officer still looking in their direction the marines had a rhythm of marching that was relaxed and economic but the seamen were fast becoming tired and slow up there kydd said suddenly pointing at the sugarcane field they stared at him dully are ye thinkin of walkin all th way it didnt need much smart thinking to realise that canefields had carts for the cut cane and these would be pulled by horses or some other animal it was more difficult than it appeared don be daft one of the marines an exfarmhand chuckled and took the reins from kydds hands kydd surrendered them gratefully the single ox was placid but sure and the sugarcane cart jerked forward sprawled in the back were his men and he had provided for them before he fell asleep under the hot sun kydd felt a certain satisfaction fort mathilda was small but built securely into the rock of the coast a surprised lieutenant met them inside the gates and asked immediately about the situation in pointe a pitre then the little fort stood to awaiting the inevitable it wasnt long in coming rising dust clouds inland showed the approach of a substantial column but the satisfying sight of menowar coming round the point with trajan in the van settled their fate in a much more agreeable way chapter the deck of a ship at dawn was the most beautiful sight he could think of kydd decided even the swish and slop of the men swabbing the deck did not intrude the easy domestic sounds in the cool of the early morning were balm to his troubled soul the quality of the dawn light on the anchored ship was of a gossamer hesitancy a soft emerging of colour through grey the tropical sea began its transition from dark greyblue anonymity to its usual striking transparent greens and deepwater blue within the hour it would bear the hard glitter of the sun and this magical time would be dismissed into memory a sigh forced itself on him the land with all its brutal ways could now be relinquished for the sea the pure stern manly sea a smile broke through renzi had not yet returned to trajan from the brig of refugees but they would have much to talk about when he did the line of men had nearly reached the halfdeck the men on the poop had finished and were stowing washdeck gear stirk sauntered over to kydd dye fancy ter step ashore agen cully he said nodding to the palmstudded coast not a mile away the suns light playing stronger on the mass of deep greens and dark ravines of the interior wish t hell i could toby kydd said lightly had mself a thunderin good time ashore the women an all stirk kept his smile but his eyes searched kydds face did ear twas bad cess them crapauds akillin their own kind like they did kydds tone changed if they does only leaves less fr us his hands whitened on the rope he held and his face turned seawards bolderin weather to the noreastd he said firmly from the direction of the reliable northeast trade winds the clouds were piling up more than the usual wetseason rain squalls it would mean soaked shirts for all again that afternoon haaaands to unmoor ship at last out to sea away from the nightmarish memories from his position in the mizzentop kydd could see both accompanying frigates weigh and proceed a satisfying picture in the trade winds of the open sea trajan cast to starboard when she had won her anchor and followed in their wake when he came on deck after the midday meal for his watch at the conn the weather was clamping in on the quarterdeck kydd took position next to the helm and noticed auberons set expression he was gazing at the easterly horizon at the growing darkness a peculiar darkness in the clouds which had an ugly copper tinge there was also a swell that was out of keeping with the wave patterning a deepening driven swell that told of a mighty storm somewhere raging and lashing and it was from the northeast auberon rounded on the duty midshipman mduty to the captain and i would be happy to see him join me on deck he snapped bomford did not waste time appearing in his shirtsleeves and without his hat auberon merely indicated sir bomford paused for only seconds pass the word for mr quist he said quietly the sailing master knew these waters well the warrant officer deliberated for long minutes in my opinion sir it looks very like a hurricanoe he used a telescope to traverse the front of the approaching storm i cannot be sure o more cepting we must shape a more southerly course an run bomford looked at him sharply why southerly if you please sir in these parts if y faces into the wind then yell find the centre of the storm nine ten points on yr right hand an this means we needs t be athwart it directly there was no denying the quiet authority in the mans voice this was a man who had prevailed in the devastating hurricane that had decimated rodneys fleet in these very waters less than a dozen years earlier the master lifted an eyebrow and looked at the captain we cant outrun it whether were aswim on the morrow or no depends squarely on the winds gentlemen in the next few hours if the wind backs with gods protection were safe mauled an bedundered but well live if th wind veers very well bomford said a moments flash of uncertainty shadowed his face then he turned to auberon do you bear away to the southard and pipe the starbowlines on deck i believe we will clear away and batten down there had been other times in other ships when kydd had worked to snug a vessel down for dirty weather but this was different an apprehensive urgency was building a knowledge that their very lives could depend on the tightness of a splice the strength of a preventer details now were a matter of life or death as quartermasters mate kydd held allegiance in the first instance to the sailing master quist was calm but firm there would be nothing left to chance that could conceivably be met by forethought and diligence for the first time kydd saw extreme measures being taken at sea and he absorbed it all quists first care was to the rudder if it carried away under stress of weather they could easily broach to broadside to the deadly combers and the result would be inevitable they would be rolled over to their doom the little party made its way below to the wardroom flat aft on the gundeck there the true origin of control of the rudder lay the mighty twentysixfoot length of a tiller high up just under the deckhead connected by tackle and an endless rope up through the decks to the wheeldrum as kydd watched it creaked and moved with the motions of the unseen helmsman high above with its powerful leverage ready to sweep from one side of the deck to the other three seamen arrived with a spare tiller to lay along the deck kydds arms ached as he held up one side of the relieving tackles to be reeved if the tillerropes parted in furious seas these tackles would do no less than save the ship ask th boatswain t kindly step over lad quist told his messenger a solemn midshipman when they had regained the deck the boy darted off as master quist was senior to the boatswain who arrived without delay cn we have rudder tackles rigged dye think nathan there were chains leading up each side of the rudder from its trailing part they were unshackled and taken to the channel of the mizzen shrouds a strong luff tackle was applied its fall led into a gunport and the chain becketed up under the counter this was pure seamanship and kydd looked down thoughtfully while he worked above the noisy foaming around the rudder he had voyaged around cape horn and knew what heavy seas could do back at the wheel quist paused as a portable compass was lashed in place near the binnacle nodding approval he said and well have a quartermaster on th wheel and his lee helmsmans going t be his mate kydd would be experiencing his first hurricane from the helm mate to capple and well have weather cloths in the shrouds quist was considerate as well as competent these old sails stretched along the shrouds to weather would take some of the brutal sting out of the spindrift and blast coming in on the helmsman while they laboured kydd kept his eye on the ominous buildup to their larboard they were crossing the path of the storm rather than trying to outrun it a rationale that made sense to the master he would ask about the reasoning afterwards if there was an afterwards rolling tackles were clapped on to the big lower yards vicious rolling could have the heavy yards moving out of synchrony with the hull tearing sail and rigging the whipping movement would be damped with the tackles at the same time at the ends of the yards where the big braces pulled them round to meet the wind preventer lines were applied if the braces parted and the yard swung back it would probably take the mast with it like a felled tree it was hard continuous work but there would be no complaints double tacks and sheets rove storm canvas roused out fore main and mizzen storm staysails were cleared away and baggywrinkle mats seized on everywhere in the complexity of rigging there was a danger that cordage madly flogging in the bluster of the storm would chafe to destruction kydd took a last look at the vast storm before going below for his meal it stretched now across half the sky and labouring at her best speed as she was trajan was not going to escape the frigates were nearly out of sight ahead and would probably get away with a battering but the old shipoftheline would be facing the full force of the hurricane there was no chatter at the messtable all the petty officers knew the odds could bear witness to tempests around the world there was nothing to be said kydd met stirks eye there was an imperceptible lift to his eyebrow but beyond that the hardfeatured quarter gunner seemed unruffled he had been with kydd in artemis when the vessel had been racked to pieces on an atlantic rock and lived through many other dire times that he had never discussed kydd felt claustrophobic the hatches were sealed with tarpaulin over the gratings which were secured with nailed battens along the sides thus battened down there was no air movement and he felt breathless with a terrifying creaking along the whole length of the gundeck there was a massive unseen lurch to leeward ere she comes mates stirk said and got up kydd rose also he had an urgent need to be out on deck the pealing of the silver calls of the boatswains mates met him on the way up all haaaands all the hands ahoy all haaaands on deck haaands to shorten sail there was now no point in trying to get away like a fleeing animal trajan could no longer run and had to turn confront her pursuer then fight to survive reduced to topsails and staysails the captain wanted more first the topgallant and next the topmasts were struck on deck the lack of high canvas resulting in a different kind of movement an ugly whipping roll that felt sullen and resentful the sight of the truncated masts only reaching up to the fighting tops added to kydds unease the reliable trade winds fell away then returned but in gusts the energetic waves were falling over themselves and the first rain drove in coming in fretful squalls chill and spiteful capple screwed up his eyes at the onslaught and took up position at the weather side of the wheel motioning kydd to the lee side capple at th helm kydd to looard he called to the knot of officers on the quarterdeck looking gravely out to the spreading darkness in the northeast the wheel kicked under kydds hands the vigour in the seas was a reality and he watched capple closely as in turn the seaman watched the leech of the reefed topsail aloft it would be hours before he saw his mess again dyce no higher quist appeared from behind them studying the bellying canvas far forward the bows lifted and smashed down in a broad swash of foam as she came round now going more before the increasingly blustery winds which kydd gauged were already at gale strength men moved carefully about the decks the motion making it more of a controlled stagger there was still more to be done and kydd watched the carpenter at the base of each mast check the wedges for play the boatswain and his men stropping the anchors with extra painters to hold them securely against the tearing pull of the sea as the vessels heavy downward roll buried them once again in a roaring mass of foam braced against the wheel kydds muscles bunched and gave with the effort of keeping the rudder straight under the impact of the seas coming in from astern the shock of the impacts came regularly and massively and it was difficult to time their movements the first seas came over the bulwarks to flood the decks just as the horizon faded in white froth and spume torn from wavecrests but with a thrill kydd saw from the binnacle that the streaming blast of air was now from the north tending northwesterly it was backing as long as they could keep the seas then according to the master they would pass safely through this chaos of sea and air he looked across the deck to where quist stood alone buffeted by the stillincreasing gale his old dark tarpaulins plastered to his body he felt an upwelling of feeling for the man who held in his mind so much cool knowledge about this raging of nature and who under his feet kydd sensed a sudden rupture a rending crack and he fell to the deck the wheel spinning uselessly above him stunned he heard capple shout something about the helm before his wits returned and he realised the tillerropes must have parted the ship began to fall away but auberons voice came instantly bullying over the dull roar of the storm down the main hatchway tlelieving tackles get going y lubbers a bigger pitch than usual forced the bows at an angle to the sea and a comber crowded aboard in a mad welter of white crashing invading from up the hatchway came an indistinct shouting quist emerged grabbed kydds shoulder and hurled him down the ladder yelling that the tiller had broken in the rudderhead capple clattered down behind him they raced to the wardroom where a group of men stood staring at a wreckage of broken timber blocks and a mess of rope the whites of their eyes showed as the huge rudder thudded sideways uncontrolled against the counter and a thump of white spray shot up the rudder casing the deck canted steeply then reared up the other way sending men stumbling and gear sliding kydd hesitated but capple thrust forward clear that shitde forard he roared his finger stabbing towards two of the nearest men who jerked into action he pushed through the others to look at the rudder get th fuckin chocks he snapped at kydd the carpenter appeared panting chocks he agreed quickly and together the deck bucking like a horse he and kydd eased the first shaped piece of timber into the octagonal opening down which the massive rudder creaked and groaned th easy bit grunted the carpenter hold it there cully an ill scrag ye if y lets it go kydd held the timber wedge as if his life depended on it through the opening he could see the terrifying whitetorn confusion of seas hurtling up tilting then dropping like a stone the rudder stock swung over ponderously thumping and grinding into the rough chock under his hand with an appalling creaking capple and the carpenter tried to stuff the remaining chock into the other side but the rudder spat it out and swung back to thud against the ships stern kydd knew to keep his chock steady in place but his hands were perilously close to where he knew the rudder stock would return it narrowly missed crushing his fingers and this time the other chock slammed in true out of it gasped the carpenter and kydd pulled aside as he swung a big ironbound mallet in accurate crashing hits miraculously the rudder had now been jammed into its central position on deck they could use a trysail aft to bring the bows back on course the immediate danger was over spare tiller chips capple asked aye said the carpenter and inspected the immobile rudder head where the tiller had broken off inside second mortice he said decisively with relief kydd saw that the spare tiller could be fitted in a lower mortice and without being told he had the men hastily ranging the tillerrope and relieving tackles when the spare tiller had been shipped these tackles were clapped on and they had a fully working rudder once more it was amazing how quickly a neat seamanlike scene could turn into a picture of utter despair bedraggled ropes and anonymous timbers and wreckage and how quickly return to a shipshape condition merely by getting to the heart of the circumstance and doing what was needed he had seen capple do just that and acknowledged the lesson on deck again and at the wheel kydd saw that the winds had grown marginally less frantic were definitely more in the west there was no change in the vista of whitestreaked water horizontal clouds of spume flying over the surface huge waves crested tumbled and were blown downwind to spindrift the master paced down the deck past kydd who flashed him a grin quist stopped as if surprised in his thoughts good lad he said against the wind noise an if it stays as is were thrown clear o the blow betimes he smiled amiably and paced on so it was only a matter of time the old shipoftheline plunged on before the relentless wind the hours passed kydd remembered quists words earlier he mentally faced into the westerly wind and worked out that at nine points on his right hand the centre of the storm was passing somewhere out there in the wildness to the north he was relieved at noon and took the lee helm again for the last dogwatch with capple wind to the southwest by now his eyes were redsore with salt and his body ached for rest it seemed to kydd a malicious cruelty of the fates when the dread cry passed aft tland hooo i see breakers aheeeaaad lookouts forward had sighted land in their path large or small it was an appalling hazard for a vessel barely under control flying before the wind as she was images of the death of his lovely artemis crept remorselessly into kydds skull he shook his head and beat them back now trajan needed him wear ship we wear this instant auberon bawled kydd and capple threw up the helm and the vessel answered grudgingly it would be difficult to wear around with only the reefed course and staysails but it would have to be done the storm jib was thrown out at just the right moment and with violent rolling trajan turned about lie to mr quist auberon ordered as the captain appeared driven by the sudden change in motion tying to sir auberon reported while bomford studied the ugly dark line extending across the horizon well never claw off you know he said quietly gazing at the endless barrier of land ahead trajan lay over crazily as the low sails took the wind from nearly abeam bomford staggered but continued to observe then snapped his glass shut clear away both bowers we anchor the veering crew in the cable tiers needed no telling the cables would go to their fullest extent and in the stink and dread of the near darkness in the bowels of the vessel they readied the cable at the cathead in the bow the conditions for the seamen working to free the anchor for casting were frightful too kydds heart wrung at the white fury of the seas coming inboard receding to reveal the black figures of men resuming their fight first one anchor let go then the other the dead weight of the hempen cables even before the great anchors could touch the seabed heaved trajans bows around head to sea the effect was immediate taking the seas directly on the bow she pitched like a frightened stallion at one moment her bare bowsprit stabbing the sky then a fearful onrush of seas down her sides before a heartstopping drop downwards ending in a mighty crunch and explosion of spray at her bows kydd stood ineffective trajan was now held by her anchor cables meeting the hurricane headon and therefore his duty at the helm held no more purpose it gave him time to look back at the line of land which was nearer than he had thought the constant mist of spume on the seas surface had obscured the lower half of the band of hard black and he quailed a perceptible yank and quiver untold fathoms below the iron claws of an anchor had come to rest in the seabed the motion changed the high soaring of the bows was the same but after the lurch downwards in the hesitation before the swoop up the ship snubbed to her cable a disorienting arrest of the wild movement for a big ship off yer go then cock get somethin ter eat an ill see yer in an hour capple said kydd flashed him a grateful smile he had not had anything since daybreak with both hands on the wheel there was no way he could bolt the dry rations on offer stretching his aching muscles he followed the lifeline forward and fell as much as stepped down the hatchway tweendecks was a noisy bedlam of swilling seawater squealing of guns against their breeching and a pungent gloom his mess was deserted the canvas screens not rigged so he peeled off his wet shirt and helped himself to another from his dittybag which hung and bumped against the ships side condensation and leakage had soaked into the canvas bag and it was a sodden garment that he had to drag over his body he shivered but gave it no more thought in the messracks he fumbled around and came up with some seabiscuits he pocketed three then found a hard lump of cheese that he supposed had been left out for him munching the hardtack he glanced forward to where the patchy light of a clutch of violently swinging lanthorns played on dozens of huddled bodies he assumed they were marines and landmen hiding in the depths of the ship in the extremity of fear and exhaustion racked by panic and seasickness kydd felt a warmth of sympathy they were better off where they were out of sight of the heartchilling insanity of the storm he would go to them and try to say something encouraging the least he could do holding on to anything to hand kydd made his way forward in the noisome obscurity but then his senses slammed in the ponderous wrench at the beginning of the scend had disappeared and a comparatively smooth rise completed the movement there could only be one interpretation with a constriction of his stomach kydd knew that an empty cable was running now from the hawse as if in confirmation trajan gave a fishlike wriggle as she careered astern kydd spun round he hurried as fast as he could to make the upper deck pulling along hand over hand as he got to the base of the ladderway a combined twist and jerk told him that trajan had come up to her second anchor clear away th sheet anchor kydd heard the boatswain howl into the violence as he breasted the coaming and came out into the turmoil capple stared fiercely ahead to the foredeck where men fought and struggled at every plunge they disappeared from view under an avalanche of white water he noticed kydd coral bottom he shouted coral was a deadly menace it snarled and cut thick cables with razorsharp edges and normally was never chosen for an anchorage a few yards forward kydd saw quist he was yelling something indistinct but ended by stabbing a finger at kydd then pointing forward kydd grabbed the wet hairiness of the midships lifeline and hauled himself along the bucking deck to the starboard forechains joining the men at the sheet anchor there was no immediate need for this last anchor they had but they could leave nothing to chance kydd drew near and was nearly knocked off his feet by the green water sluicing aft a cable to the sheet anchor had already been bent and seized in storm preparations but anchoring in coral had not been foreseen keckling get goin kydd the boatswain yelled a coil of threeinch line was thrown at him it thumped heavily into his chest the seas roared against the side burying the channel the broad base of the shrouds fitted to the outside of the ship kydd caught his breath he knew they were telling him to climb over the bulwarks and down on to that channel to work at the stowed black mass of the sheet anchor and its cable he looked back resentfully at the row of men who looked gravely back at him they were older and more experienced but would be able to remain safely inboard then he understood he had been chosen for this job because he was a better seaman than they the realisation warmed him proofed him against the elements and witha jaunty wave he swung over the bulwarks and dropped to the channel it had crossed his mind to bend on a lifeline around his waist but if he was swept away then the sudden jerk at the end of the line might cut him in half in any case the light line would get in the way the seaglistening sides of the ship dipped slowly and kydd hung on grimly to the tarry shrouds the expected seas came first his feet thighs and then above his waist a rushing torrent bullying and jostling tearing at his hold on life it seethed around the lower rigging and fittings with a deep hissing and roaring then began to recede kydd snatched a glance at the situation his task was to apply keckling to the last yards of the cable as it came from the sheet anchor wrapping his lighter line and stout strips of canvas handed down to him tightly about the strands of the cable it was their only chance the keckling their sole means to protect this last anchor from the deadly sharp coral and keep the ship from driving ashore the sheet anchor was lashed outside the shrouds outside the channel and kydd was exposed to the seas edging around the aftermost shroud he stood on the iron curve of the flukes of the big anchor then swung to the channel and shuffled along trajan rolled the seas rose and battered and tugged at him he held the thick shrouds in a death grip pressing his face to their rough surfaces feeling their sturdy strength the seas fell away as the ship began a laborious roll upwards it was time to get to work kydd moved outboard of the anchor to the big ring beyond the stock he waited for the surging seas to return and subside then bent to begin the rope had a mind of its own snarling and writhing but kydd forced it round more seas but his work held and when the dripping cable appeared his keckling was still there he worked feverishly his arm hooked about the cable but such was his concentration that when the next sea came it took him unawares a momentary vision of the water within inches then he was submerged buffeted by giant forces while he hugged the cable a maelstrom of roaring in his ears he emerged bruised and gasping his eyes stinging a salty burning in his throat but he went on grimly his first sea friend bowyer a deepsea mariner of the very best kind came to mind and memories of lessons in the sea crafts and he responded every working of cordage and cable would be the best he could manage unexpectedly he felt a tug on his shoulder from above stirks hand came out and kydd was hoisted bodily over the bulwarks he sank to all fours with exhaustion hearing stirks murmured words of encouragement then noticed buckled shoes and silk stockings he looked up to see the captain gazing down at him then his slow nod of approval the second bower anchor gave way within the watch it was terrifying to see the speed with which they were carried downwind towards the hard line of the shore the sheet anchor however was ready and plunged into the sea almost immediately now down to her last big anchor trajans company were left with the bleak knowledge that if it parted then the ship would drive ashore not on a sandy beach but on the fringing reef a quarter of a mile offshore its presence betrayed by wild breakers slamming high into the air the vessel would break up fast on the massive coral heads and when men struck out for their lives they would be slashed to ribbons in the breakers the daylight ebbed and the deck filled with silent men staring across the seas to their last sight of the land kydd went below to find something to eat to bring strength to his weary body it was sheltered below the manic howl of the wind muted its wearisome plucking and battering no longer worrying at his body the mess was deserted again except for a small figure head bowed sitting alone at their messtable puzzled kydd approached it was luke a picture of misery he did not look up as kydd drew near hey now skinker light along some clacker fr a starvin mariner kydd said breezily luke didnt respond hows this messman fr the petty officers an cant find em some vittles kydd came to sit next to him the bass rumble of some loose gear slamming against the hull forward sounded ominous and loud luke said something in a low voice that kydd was unable to catch he leaned closer and saw that the boy had been crying he hesitated then put his arm round the lads shoulders luke tensed then swayed and rested his head against kydd hows this pipin the eye kydd said kindly not as would be fittin fr a sailor youll agree cuffin lukes muffled voice was certain mr kydd tnight i will be in hell at a loss for words kydd could only squeeze his shoulders i aint been t church much an that was only cos m mother made me he continued in stricken tones an an i lied t her see i said as id go off t work fer uncle jonathan away in hounslow an i didnt i ran off t sea kydd saw with guilty clarity an image of a dusty church a droning sermon and fiery words of sin sentence and torment luke lifted his face bright with tears and blurted i dont mean t be wicked when mr stirk gave me a grog i didnt drink it mr kydd i threw it away gods honour i did a moments hesitation and kydd withdrew his arm you are indeed a wicked dog and will probably have t answer for it he said thumping his fist on the table luke stared piteously at him but not this night he paused dramatically how dare ye have doubts about yr ship is she dismasted is the mainstay in strands dye see the captain in despair what sort o jabberknowl is it says were on our way t davy jones lukes face brightened but we has one anchor out only an kydds voice turned to thunder so now y questions m seamans skills y say that i cant pass a keckling without it falls off i should take a strap to ye younker a hesitant smile appeared and kydd pressed on first light an the windll have shifted two three points an then well up hook n make our offing he fisted luke lightly on the arm then itll go hard on any as were seen afore not havin trust in their ship a sniff a shamefaced smile and lukes cloud passed there aint much t eat mr kydd he said but ill find y some frm them shonky lubbers who dont want any he added waving at the helpless landmen forward kydd grinned i thank ye but ill take a turn about the uppers first he felt a guilty stab at the heroworship he saw in lukes face stuffed his pockets with anything he could find and returned to the upper deck in the last of the light he saw tossing white breakers the anonymous grey coast behind and then a desolate night clamped in he hunkered down in the lee of the bulwarks his feet braced against the loudly creaking carriage of a gun and pulled his jacket around himself the subliminal jerk of the anchor cable transmitted itself to him and he thought of the keckling deep in the sea his work the only thing standing between the ships company and their end in the loneliness of the night he worried for a minute whether the canvas parcelling under the keckling was sufficient but then decided that nothing was to be gained by that and drifted into a fitful doze on yer feet matey a boatswains mate with a darklanthorn was shaking him but not unkindly larbowlines t muster aching in every part of his body kydd staggered to his feet and lurched toward the quarterdeck almost invisible in the darkness there was no diminution in the windblast and the fierce motion of the sea was the same the officerofthewatch had his orders the hawse rounding would be inspected hourly the mateofthewatch would make his rounds halfhourly and the quartermasterofthewatch and his mate would check the hold for stores broken loose the rest would remain on deck on immediate call to the pumps as they opened up the forward hold in the orlop kydd noticed by the light of their lanthorn that capples eyes were red his face lined he wondered whether he himself looked as bad as he pulled aside the grating and dropped on to the casks immediately below he reached up for the lanthorn and held it while capple joined him the dim gold light reached out into the stinking gloom the noise of the hull working in the storm a deafening chorus of shattering cracks and deepthroated creaking as far as could be seen the stowage was unbroken kydd leaned over the side of the mound of casks to the ground tier in their bed of shingle and saw the sheen of water in the shadows then heard the hiss of water movement much like a pebble beach takin in a lot o water kydd called back hope chipss got a weather eye ont the pumps had been at work for an hour every watch he knew but that would be the seawater flooding the decks making its way to the bilges the red pinprick flash of eyes caught his attention at the periphery of his vision ratsre gettin restless he muttered in a heavy blow at sea rats usually found somewhere quiet to sit it out these were on the move kydd didnt know why but felt the beginning of fear im gettin another lanthorn tom mate capple said were goin to take a good look it was dangerous work the massive barrels over which they clambered moved at every violent roll opening a vicious cleft between them that would certainly mean crushed fingers or worse if they were trapped they worked their way down the ancient blackened timbers of the ships side noting the weeping of seams the visible working of frames and planking there was nothing up the other side there did not appear to be anything they could report but kydd felt that all was not well in the old ships bowels they returned to anchor watch on the foredeck feeling as much as seeing the catenary curve of the thick cable into the whitestreaked dark ahead and were soaked each time the thump of a breaker against the bows signalled another deluge at six bells an hour before the end of kydds watch they heard that the chainpump capable of moving tons of water an hour was now being manned continuously this was serious there must be a near disastrous ingress of water somewhere but the ships company was numb after hours of hanging by their sole anchor and the news had little impact all hopes were centred on the morning kydd could not go below at the end of his watch he crouched below the bulwarks again straining against the darkness to catch the first hint of light the anchor was holding that was all that counted at any moment it might silently give way and then after a few despairing minutes it would all be over for every soul aboard at any moment but the thought gradually lost its reality and therefore the power to terrorise him cold aching stupefied by the hammering wind kydd slowly realised that he could see as far aft as the hulking shapes of the boats on their skids he stood stiffly and looked out to sea what is it mate stirk said he had shared kydds vigil on the foredeck kydd turned to him dawn he said a smile transformed his face they gripped a rope and gazed out waiting for the wan daylight to spread across the windtorn seascape the land finally emerged but implausibly it ranged away at an angle we got a chance now me ol griff said stirk his eyes darkshadowed his face hollow show some canvas why well claw off in a brace o shakes agreed kydd during the night the wind had backed now no longer a dead muzzier there was a fighting chance that they could use the shift in wind to sail themselves out closehauled and in this way they would no longer be reliant on the single anchor they would be once more in the open sea the light of day spread it was now possible to see a jagged horizon which had been invisible the previous day and kydd knew that the weather was moderating all haaands the rest was impossible to make out but it was clear what was required hands to stations to set sail kydd went aft to the helm to await his orders bomford spoke briefly to his first lieutenant from all partsofship came the officers and petty officers in charge of their stations from the fighting tops the focsle the mainmast they were the ones who would hear what must be done and make it so the captain stood in the centre of the deck his officers straining to hear the petty officers about them you will know of the peril in which we stand i will not refer to it again bomford said his voice had a hard resolute edge that cut through the buffeting roar of the wind we will cast to larbd and proceed under closereefed main doublereefed storm jib and driver he looked keenly at the group you will see that this is very like a clubhaul the latter part and by this you will know that there is no going back there is but one chance kydd had never seen a clubhaul a manoeuvre reserved for the most desperate situations but he had heard of it a vessel caught on a lee coast would let go her anchor then continue to be blown ashore only to pivot around her anchor to face out to sea again it was a brutal manoeuvre but the sting was in what bomford was saying there was only one chance because when the vessel found herself headed back out to sea she had no choice the anchor cable had to be cut to enable the escape i will crowd on her all sail she will take bomford said by my sign to each in turn he specified which signal would apply to which sail for shouted orders were useless and i apprehend the chief peril to be if the main course is taken aback the captain finished and looked gravely at each man he then spoke gently but firmly i do believe before we go to put our lives at hazard it will not go amiss if we put our hopes and trust before he who disposes of all things a scatter of shapeless tarpaulin head coverings disappeared and bareheaded the men of hms trajan came together in prayer for a long moment there was silence as every mans thoughts soared to his loved ones and the chance of ever seeing them again kydds eyes lifted from the deck to your stations if you please said bomford quietly the light had strengthened it was possible to see well ahead to the open sea the yearnedfor goal but the line of coast was growing in clarity capple stood at the wheel his arms folded ready his was without doubt the single most vital task kydd snatched a glance if capple felt the pressure on him he gave no sign of it his eyes slitted against the wind watching the sails bent on gaskets loosened men gathering to hoist or dowse it was time one by one the stations waved an acknowledgement the men standing by in fearful anticipation out of sight on the deck below the boatswain would be standing with his foot on the cable as it left the hawse he would feel its live thrumming the tension in a direct line to the seabed when the ship had sail on had speed sufficient not only to meet the seas and beat them but to make real way then the boatswain would feel the vibration die away the cable deaden relaxed at last as the ship came up on the anchor then would be the time for the carpenter to step forward with his razorsharp mast axe and cut the cable helm the captain warned capple gripped the wheel kydd would follow every movement at the lee side his eyes fixed on the quartermaster the captain moved to the forward end of the quarterdeck and gave one last glance aloft then he acted the signal went out it was the storm jib to hoist and forward a tiny triangle of sail inched up hesitantly the white faces of the focsle party clearly visible as they looked back at the captain ready for an immediate countermand the wheel spun as the helm was put hard over they would use the effect of the seas seething past to help achieve a cast to larbd higher it rose flapping and beating with the wind dead ahead suddenly it took the wind board taut the strong sail in an instant had the bows dipping and the ship shying like a nervous horse this was the time of greatest danger before any speed through the water was achieved sheering across the wind and putting intolerable strain on their anchor another signal this time aft the driver a fore and aft sail on the mizzen makeshift reefing to show the smallest possible area kydd held his breath the sail flapped and banged then caught braced right around the mainyard was slung low in its jeers but the lee clew of the course appeared it grew and the first square sail was set a tiny corner on one side of the yard but yet a driving force nervously kydd snatched a glimpse at the white seas raging past the ship began to rear there was an uneasy screwing motion the captain was as rigid as a statue gripping a stay and staring fiercely ahead bomford gestured more sail showed at the main kydd could not be sure but felt that the motion was growing less jerky could it be that they were advancing on their anchor raising his arm bomford looked all about him then the signal to cut the cable to launch themselves into eternity or sweet safety kydd tensed and in the time it took the carpenter to hack through the great cable bomford strode quickly back to the helm suddenly the ships bow fell away from the wind no longer tethered she dropped away to leeward a massive roll sent men skittering across the deck a cross sea intervened and the ship lurched sickeningly kydd snatched a look astern they were drifting down on the land his hands gripped the wheel convulsively a growl from capple brought his attention to it they fought the wheel round together hard over to try to bring the bows back up to the wind the captain stood unmoving and kydd felt a pressure on the helm a strengthening glorious force that told of power and movement through the water he determined not to look behind at the land but couldnt help a prickling in his neck as he remembered the fringing reef which must be close now the bowsprit reared and plunged but it sawed a path in the sky that was unmistakable trajan was answering her helm kydd dared to hope a little more of the goosewinged main and the old ship heeled obediently in response the seas meeting her bow with energy and purpose minute by agonising minute yard by yard trajan clawed her way out to sea until at last there could be no more doubt they had won through all eyes were on the thickset carpenter as he emerged on deck to report the pumps had been at work for some time but it seemed that he had not found any specific leakage sir the barky is strained in her foreparts on account o the anchorin pulling and tearin at the riding bitts and clinches i cant say as i cn be sure how long afore she opens up aroun the cant frames she bein so mouldy deep in an all it would be the cruellest fortune to founder just as they had found life kydd felt resentment flare and wondered bitterly what renzi would make of it what philosophical edge might make it palatable there was talk of frapping putting turns of rope right round the hull and bowsing tight but this was impossible while the hurricane lasted the wind had backed further and as the hours wore on there was a discernible lessening of the violence a descent into merely a fresh gale but not enough just before kydds watch finished lookouts on the foreyard sighted sail far off and stormtossed but it quickly resolved into a frigate an english one as far as anyone could tell scudding before the outer edge of the hurricane show em our colours snapped auberon in reply a blue ensign jerked up the mast in the frigate proving her one of admiral jerviss leeward islands squadron bomford wasted no time signal her to lie to and attend on us when the storm abates he ordered and went below all the haaaands all haaands on deck lay aft shafts of sun glittered on the grey seas the wind nearly back in the northeast warmth beginning to spread the insanity of the past slipping away the men mustered on the upper deck to hear the captain again i will be brief bomford began it was clear he had much on his mind and he spoke curdy i am proud of this ship i am proud of you all that you have done your duty so nobly if you stand as valiantly against the enemy as you did against the might of the hurricane then we have no fear of any foe bomford seemed to have difficulty in choosing his words trajan will proceed now to antigua for survey and repair at the dockyard a bare day or twos sail away he waited for the indistinct murmuring to die away but i have to tell you that we as a ships company will be transported in the frigate back to barbados while this is done this time there were mutters of appreciation the small island of antigua could not bear the effort of keeping hundreds of seamen idle ashore for an extended period and therefore they would return to the main base with all its lures yet i would ask for volunteers to form a skeleton crew to sail trajan to her wellearned rest may the first lieutenant see the hands of those volunteering a tiny scatter of hands rose it was no contest antigua had nothing to offer that compared with the punch shops and entertainments of bridgetown anger rose in kydd trajan was now to be deserted by those she had borne so uncomplainingly through her time of trial he glanced about stony faces met his they were not going to give up their chance of a frolic kydd threw up his hand he at least would remember the old lady the volunteers were mustered on the quarterdeck his eyes resentfully on the deserting seamen kydd didnt notice bomford approach kydd it did not escape me the contribution you made to this ship and her preservation bomford had piercing eyes and kydd stiffened this was in the very best traditions of the service and show you to be an exceptional seaman i look forward to when we renew our acquaintance as a ships company and while i cannot promise in the particulars i have it in mind to recognise your worth with an advancement good luck and thank you chapter trajan ghosted over a shimmering sea her sail reduced so that without an anchor she could back topsails and heave to in plenty of time the low pretty island of antigua lay ahead basking in tropical sunshine a long sandy beach visible between two rocky points the dark stone of a fort stood at a height to the right and another one extended low down along a point to the left dashes of red along a crenellated wall obviously soldiers the sea was a deep royal blue so calm that only a slight swell marred its flat glittering expanse a boat under sail emerged round the point and turned towards them her bowwave white and sparkling on taking in the last of her sails trajan ceased her live motion and drifted the boat arrived and a deeply suntanned officer clambered up the side it took little time for the essence of the matter to be conveyed the ship would be prepared to enter english harbour it was out of the question to sail into the confines of the harbour the compact space that made it a firstclass hurricane haven made it impossible for a large ship to manoeuvre trajan would be warped in ropes were taken ashore by boat and secured to strong moorings embedded at strategic points and all hands of the skeleton crew manned the capstan the land came in on both sides but around the point it opened up at a prominence further down in the long harbour a cluster of buildings announced the location of a naval dockyard trajan was not alone the bulbous hull of a vessel careening dominated the other side and everywhere there were brigs schooners packets and a swarm of small fry but the gun trajan was easily the biggest vessel her grim sides towering above them all they hauled themselves further into the harbour the dockyard was to larboard and on a flat area to the fore a lofty mast bore a union flag that streamed gaily to the breeze as her commissioning pennant was not in evidence there were no naval ceremonies and within the hour trajan was alongside a dusky brown coralstone wharf kydd looked ashore the little dockyard town boasted imposing verandaclad twostorey edifices along wellmade roads at the root of the tiny peninsula was a long pillared structure with open sides topped with a wide roof a boat being floated inside revealed it as a shipwrights boathouse springs and breastropes applied trajan had officially arrived it was hot and dusty but the northeast trade winds resumed their cool streaming from over the surrounding hills all the same kydd felt grateful to be wearing a thin working shirt rather than the soldiers heavy clothing from trajans upper deck he could see into the busy dockyard black men considerably outnumbered others plodding along economically with their burdens a number of ducks and geese were fluttering and strutting about aint much stirk said mopping his brow with his red kerchief we goin rollickin ashore n not a sight of a regulargoin pothouse anywheres the closepacked dockyard buildings quickly fell away along what could be seen of the road meandering into the interior the canefields over the surrounding hills apart from the occasional windmill were innocent of anything manmade heard tell tht what y sees is all there is kydd said remembering the derisive talk in trajan when he had volunteered seems the navy is all in th north o the island an here just yr dockyard an the redcoats stirk gave a grunt of dissatisfaction and kydd hoped that they would not be long delayed a week or two to refit enough to cross the atlantic for a full docking in england then at last he would be able to go home there was a coming and going of officers and dockyard functionaries up the sidesteps from the quay but nothing to say what their future would be the young lieutenant in temporary command was not going to risk his situation by letting his men leave the ship they stayed aboard moodily watching the shore at four in the afternoon as the midday heat lessened a small party approached it was led by a man in austere black and as he stepped down on the upper deck kydd was struck by the nobility in his bearing the calm certainty in his features the party disappeared below whos that kydd asked why thats zachary caird yer master shipwright come ter survey said a local craftsman second only ter the commissioner in the dockyard is e one of the party reappeared on deck his working clothes marking him as a shipwright he brushed aside questions slipping over the side and into the dockyard he returned with a long cylindrical section auger and vanished below darkness was drawing in by the time the party came on deck again from their grave expressions kydd guessed that the repair would be a lengthy one any word sir he asked the young lieutenant after he had shepherded the survey team over the bulwarks yes said the officer offhandedly and we are to be condemned i believe kydd stared we we are strained and leaking in the hull and it is outside the powers of this dockyard to get us seaworthy enough to make passage back to england he removed his cocked hat and wiped his forehead as they have no dry dock here for a great repair we are finished it was being at anchor in a hurricane the strain and working at the bow too much for the ironsick old vessel he gazed away but its subject to confirmation by others but well you now know as much as i stirk had no doubts about their future the trajans are no more cully wese goin ter be sent quicksmart t barbados an the looard island fleet or its the jamaica squadron either way we gets no say atall which barky were goin ter ship out on kydds spirits sank it was hard to take renzi would probably not even know which ship he had been assigned to all his friends would be scattered and he would not see them again there was one other thing to add to his dejection he was now a quartermasters mate a petty officer in a strange ship he would have to work his way up all over again captain bomfords promise of advancement meant nothing the next day trajan was warped deeper into the harbour well clear of other vessels and prepared for destoring after the formality of a second opinion her guns would be removed and the process of hulking her would begin a large detachment of seamen was soon taken off for immediate passage to barbados a brigsloop took another six an armed schooner three a lastminute call from a passing gun vessel took the majority of the remainder to jamaica leaving a silent echoing ship and a handful of men kydd the lieutenant called mr caird has asked if i can spare a good hand to work with him ashore i told him we can get your gear the dockyard boat will be calling for you at six bells the dockyard kydds thoughts jostled and his first instinct was to object but then perhaps it would be interesting learning the internal secrets of so many different kinds of vessel he found himself responding positively but there was one left aboard to whom he must say farewell luke was stricken at the news bbut mr kydd you touched by his grief kydd fumbled for words knowing the dockyard boat would be alongside soon shall miss ye too skinker he said ruffling the lads hair but we does our duty an without gripin luke stared at him but didnt move as kydd turned and left the dockyard hoy was taking advantage of the trip by loading mounds of sails awnings cordage and other materials from trajan for return to stores kydd found himself wedged in with these as he settled down for the short trip the boat hoisted sail as they made their way to the dockyard landing place kydd looked back on trajan his ship her agedarkened sides the ugly truncation of topmasts the secrets of twenty years and the unknown thousands who had sailed in her he felt a lump build in his throat as she fell astern she slowly transfigured into yet another feature of the harbour an anonymous vessel in the distance with all reality of having been his home now faded he wrenched away his gaze a different kind of life was starting for him now the boat nosed in to the coralrock quay ending up neatly under a stout wooden crane where the single sail was dowsed wheres mr caird kydd asked the crew it seemed that he could be found at the boathouse kydd heaved out his seabag and started to head in the direction they had indicated then incredulous shouts came from the hoy he looked back and saw luke clambering out from under old sails be damned youre a wicked rascal to think on desertin yr ship like this kydd said hotly yr goin straight back aboard not wi us he aint we got other work tdo came a swift rejoinder from one of the hoys crew well how cn he not our problem mate kydd swore but saw the appeal in lukes big eyes his little bundle of belongings over his shoulder and knew that if he insisted he would be condemning the lad he swore again follow me y illlookin swab he growled and set out for the boathouse obediently luke fell into step behind the boathouse consisted of an extensive loft rested on lines of tall stone pillars below boats were floated inside then hoisted to the workshop floor the resinous aroma of timber lay strongly on the breeze that played through the pillars a clean welcome scent in the overall reek of a harbour mr caird stepped out from the storeroom at the back kydd recognised him at once as the master shipwright who had surveyed trajan thomas kydd whos been sent frm trajan for service ashore caird looked at him keenly what was your rate aboard again kydd was struck by the calm gaze the certainty in his manner quartermasters mate sir caird nodded if i may observe youre young for the rate are you not a series of flat thumps with a mallet sounded to one side kydd returned his look defiantly but of course you will have earned it caird added quickly you may need it have you had experience of men of colour taken aback by the question kydd paused there were no slaves in england and the only black men he had seen at sea were all free as he was not as y might say he said cautiously i have it in mind to employ you as a master of the kings negroes to take my shipwrights sidesmen in charge aye sir kydd said carefully to see theyre mustered at work each morning that theyre not in want of what they need but ye need to know ill not have them abused sir thoughts racing kydd murmured assent this was utterly beyond his expectations caird regarded him thoughtfully then his gaze slipped to luke who smiled up at him uncertainly and this is your servant caird said you are entitled of course as a master but we have our own you know caught offbalance kydd stuttered an acknowledgement cairds eyebrows rose well if you insist but he will have to share servants quarters ththank you kydd said not daring to look at luke hercules will show you to your lodgings i will see you at my office at four oclock if you please kydd followed the black man along the road past workshops and sawpits luke walking silently behind with his bundle they went through the dockyard gate and stopped at one of a row of small but neat twostorey houses in dis house youse in de top floor massa kydd opened the little wicket gate and stepped inside there was an external flight of stairs to the top storey the man looked once more at him then touched his forehead and left at the top of the stairs the door held a key kydd turned it and entered the small room smelt stuffy and unused there was a low bed a side dresser with a jug and little else kydd crossed the room and opened one of two doors to a tiny sitting room with armchair and table the other led to a snug veranda overlooking the hills beyond hey now kydd said with satisfaction so im t be a master an live in a house by late afternoon kydd had the place in order on the lower floor it seemed was the chief caulker now absent he would pay his respects later where do i go mr kydd said luke overawed by events why with th other servants o course kydd chuckled lukes face fell kydd couldnt keep it up but then again i cd have ye close at hand see t my wants at any time oh yes so i decides i want you to doss down here younker but mark you mind has proper respect fr yer master yes an i will mr kydd said luke seriously the office of the master shipwright was with the master attendant and commissioner right at the far end but the dockyard was compact and well laid out kydd was shown into the airy office caird sat at his desk his quill scratching busily he glanced up as kydd approached a minute if you please the room was extremely clean furniture well polished and ornamented only with a series of charts and halfbreadth shipyard models a christian devotional etching hung in the centre of one wall caird swivelled round please be seated mr kydd he said motioning to a cane chair on one side i am the master shipwright here as you know and my responsibilities are extensive it would be gratifying if i could rely on those the good lord sees fit to set under me he paused looking intently at kydd this is not always the case i am grieved to say the interview continued with a clear and unequivocal settingout of kydds new duties which were also carefully written down for him it concluded with a stern warning on conduct do you mark my words mr kydd i will suffer no man in my charge to corrupt himself by yielding up his body to drink and carnality should he so dishonour me i shall cast him out without mercy kydd was by no means a tippler he disliked the surrender of will involved in drunkenness and as to carnality he had not seen a female of any age anywhere aye sir ye need have no fears of me he said positively ah that is good your predecessor did grievously disappoint in this i wish you well for the future and we may expect your presence on the morrow at the boathouse later in the privacy of his room kydd studied the paper containing full details of his duties the kings negroes were slaves but superior slaves it seemed for not only did they have considerable skills but to kydds surprise some even had slaves of their own he would have a driver a foreman who would be responsible to him for the others and a line of responsibility to the yard boatswain yr pardon mr kydd said luke anxiously he stood at the door respectfully i cn have yer scran alongside should yer want it now kydd felt abashed he had not really meant it when he told luke he was a servant now the lad was taking him at his word on reflection however he realised that given the circumstances it might be the best thing thank ye luke i will kydd returned to his paper the kings negroes chief employment was as a skilled crew to assist shipwrights and riggers in major operations such as in heaving down ships for underwater repairs or replacing whole masts his would be the first party to board menowar entering harbour having been wounded in battle or savaged by a hurricane luke spread a small tablecloth on the sittingroom table without looking up he carefully laid a single place with pewter plate and knife and withdrew kydd finished the paper smiling to himself at the strictures on keeping his men sober and diligent the cool of the morning showed antigua in its best light delicate tints clarity of air and everywhere the sparkling translucence of the sea on the flat grassy area next to the boathouse kydd surveyed the kings negroes they returned his contemplation with stony indifference or looked away with disinterest big wellmuscled and hardlooking they were dressed in canvas trousers and buttoned waistcoat over naked skin some wore oldfashioned threecornered cocked hats others a bandanna unusually for slaves all carried a sheathed seamans knife an whos the driver kydd asked in even tones the men kept silent staring back at him kydd tried to sense their feelings but there was a barrier the driver he snapped if it was going to be this way so be it but then the hardestlooking of them pulled himself up slowly and confronted kydd the driver he said his voice deep and strong he regarded kydd impassively from under hooded black eyes his arms folded kydd looked at the others there was no feeling in their expressions they existed in stasis much like beasts of the field it appeared im kydd and im th new master he said there was no response no interest whats yr name he demanded of the driver juba he said what are their names said kydd they are t tell me themselves he added a flicker of curiosity showed in their faces nero grunted an older one kydd nodded and prompted the man next to him quamino an you kydd went on ben bobstay one by one he had a name from each he hesitated over whether to make a strict speech of introduction but thought better of it if ye does yr duty yell have nothing t fear frm me he said firmly and turned to greet caird who had just arrived i see you have mustered your crew already caird said fort shirley has signalled that rose frigate will be here this morning she has a sprung foremast which we shall in course replace he stopped to take a sheaf of lists from a waiting shipwright and scanned them quickly where are your roves sir he asked impatiently were you thinking to secure with nails his forehead creased and the shipwright cringed caird turned to kydd again we shall not need the sheer hulk the boatswain of the yard will rig sheers on her foredeck kydd had no experience of such skilled work and if he was expected to take charge the boatswain will be overseer said caird as if sensing kydds thoughts it only requires that you tell your driver the task he has done this work and you may feel sure that he knows what to do the gun frigate rose sailed in without warping even with minimal sail at the fore a fine piece of seamanship in the exuberant latesummer breezes she had suffered at the hands of the hurricane seawhitened timbers and ropes leached of their tar stoppers seized at places in her rigging the patchy wooden paleness of new repairs showing here and there but she rounded to and her sails came in smartly as if her company were conscious of their fortune in being spared by the fates the boatswain of the yard sitting in the sternsheets of the dockyard boat with kydd stared idly ahead the rowers pulled heavily towing two massive sheerlegs in the water to kydd it was strangely affecting to step over the bulwarks and be in a sea world belonging to others while the boatswain talked to the captain his eyes strayed to little things that would be embedded in the consciousness of the ships company the dogvane to point the direction of the wind and fashioned into a redpetalled rose the binnacle finished with a varnished boltrope the smart black japanned speaking trumpet also with a painted rose all these would be the familiar images of daily life at sea roses seamen looked at him curiously his small band of black men at his back what cheer mate said one wheres to go on th rantan spared from having to answer by the boatswains hail from forward kydd reported himself and his men you kydd get yr men out o the way fer now but ill want em on the cross spar afore we cants the sheers the boatswain said and turned to his own crew kydd stared at the scene with some anxiety the focsle was a maze of ropes and blocks laid out along the deck each side from when the topmast had been struck how it was possible to pluck the feetthick foremast like a tooth straight out from where it ended morticed into its step on the keel he had no idea juba did not volunteer a word he stood aside watching with a patience that seemed limitless and at the same time detached the boatswains men ranged mighty threefold purchases the sheaved blocks were each nearly double the size of a mans head the falls coiled in fakes yards long lesser tackles were made fast to knightheads and kevels and all was ready to bring aboard the sheers but then the boatswain stepped back his arms folded kydd saw why in a nice division of responsibilities it was men of the rose who manned the jeer capstan to take the weight then lower the heavy seventyfivefoot width of the foreyard indecently shorn of its usual complexity of buntlines and halliards the foremast now stood alone its wound clearly visible as a long bonecoloured fracture under the capstan bars which had been splinted around it kydd yr cross spar the boatswain called impatiently kydd had been too interested in the proceedings and was caught unawares but he swiftly rounded on juba cross spar he snapped stepping towards the sheers he looked fearlessly at the man who hesitated just a moment looking into kydds eyes then moved into action in low tones he called to the other negroes in words incomprehensible to kydd the men split into two parties and slid the fore topgallant yard athwartships then up against the splayed end of the sheers they stopped and juba looked up slowly kydd turned to the men at the crosspiece of the sheers and told them to pass the seizing like a throatseizing an not too taut the boatswain suggested aye said kydd happy with a newfound realisation no matter how complex and technical the task it could be rendered down to a series of known seamanlike evolutions the sheers were duly canted tilted up so the guys could get an angle to sway the sheerlegs aloft at the same time tackles at their feet held them firmly in place it was almost an anticlimax knocking aside the mast wedges freeing the partners and hearing the massive tackle creak as it strained in a vertical pull up on the mast which gave in a sudden and alarming jerk upwards there was suddenly nothing to do as the freed mast was angled and slowly lowered over the ships side to be floated ashore a fearsome thing that could spear the heart out of the frigate if it was accidentally let go kydd glanced at the motionless juba intrigued by the mans selfpossession unexpectedly juba allowed a brief smile to appear kydd smiled back and pretended to follow the progress of the mast over the side the softness of a caribbean evening was stealing over the waters when kydd was finally able to return to the dockyard the replacement foremast had needed work awkwardly placed along the deck of the frigate it had had to be held securely on trestles while shipwrights went to work with adze and angled mast axe as the chips flew the craftsmen held kydd in awe at their skill with such awkward tools he now knew a good deal more than he had at break of day and he felt happier than he had at any time since he had left trajan this was better than being a spare hand to whatever ship would claim him closer in to the dockyard he could hear the cries and laughter of the ships company of avenger a shipsloop whose bulbous naked hull was heaved right over for careening on the other side of the water these men would be accommodated ashore while their ship was in such a condition and were making the most of the relaxing of discipline taking their evening grog around the shore galley near the capstan house with raucous frivolity kydd eased into a grin at the familiar antics the injured mast could wait in the water off the masthouse for the morning and he could now dismiss his crew and get some supper well done m lads he said unconsciously regarding them in the same way as a party of seamen after a hard day too late the thought came that possibly he should treat slaves in some other way more at a distance perhaps however they did not respond and padded off silently together he couldnt help wondering where the shore galley manned luke was able to get a hearty platter for him complete with leaves of some mysterious local vegetable and he tucked in with a will it was hard to eat alone though with nothing but a candle and circling moths for company the conviviality flowing from the capstan house was hard to resist and kydd found himself strolling in the warm dark of the evening towards the sounds of merriment the open frontage of the low building with its three great capstans was a favourite place to gather in the growing soft darkness the lanthorns hung along the beams welcomed him in with splashes of golden light men lolled about taking a clay pipe of tobacco or drinking deep from their pots in timehonoured sailor fashion outdoing each other in sea yarns and remembrances kydd knew none of them but could recognise the types even though they were of another ship the hard confident petty officers in short blue jackets with brass buttons that glittered in the light of the lanthorns young seamen bred to the sea with an easy laugh and a tarry queue unclubbed so its plaited length hung a foot or more down their backs the lined old shellbacks whose sea wisdom it would be folly to question a man hauled himself up to sit on one of the capstan heads and his fiddle was passed up to him after a few flourishes he nodded to a handsome seaman with sidewhiskers next to him the man stepped forward and sang in a resonant tenor oh life is the ocean and man is the boat that over its surface is destind to float and joy is a cargo so easily stord that he is a fool who takes sorrow on board the wellknown chorus drowned the singer who affected vexation stumping around the capstan in high dudgeon kydd laughed heartily with the rest and raised his wooden tankard in salute sensing the mood the singer stalked to the front of the capstan and stood akimbo arms folded glaring at his audience the chatter died away expectantly a movement on the opposite side caught kydds eye one of the seamen had a woman under his arm a black woman kydd shifted his gaze back to the singer who leaned forward as though in confidence and there launched into the racy driving strains of the saucy arethusa come all ye jolly sailors bold whose hearts are cast in honours mould while english glory i unfold on board of the arethusa the sailors burst into song and kydd felt his cheeks glow with pleasure the singer bowed and accepted a dripping tankard kydd looked about him with a grin clinkin good singer is our dansey a seasoned petty officer grinned back at kydd rattlin fine voice agreed kydd are ye avengers then aye ben kittoe gunners mate the man replied taking a pull from his blackjack a dark tarred leather tankard kydd tom kydd quartermasters mate o trajan as was he said dye mean t be knackered poor ol lady kydd said and finished his pot bad cess so where are yez now got mself a berth as master what master o the kings negroes that is kydd laughed at the others curiosity he continued seem well enough at th work but wouldnt trust em on their own the numbers at the capstan house had diminished the galley had closed its hatches but kydd felt in no mind to break the mood kittoe stood up and waved his blackjack expansively come wi us fer a quick noggin mate the two walked back along the stone quay and into the copper and lumber house kydd remembered that it was here that the crews of ships being careened were quartered above the locked and darkened storerooms was the loft where copper plating for the underwater hull was pricked out to shape we got a good sort as owner kittoe grunted as they mounted the exterior iron stairs sees us right in the article of grog an such they entered one end of the loft was agreeably illuminated with lanthorns the light rapidly falling off into darkness at the other end of the broad expanse here mate take a muzzier o this he reached for a dark green bottle from his seachest and upended it in kydds pot the cloying aroma of prime west indian rum eddied up to trajan but fr our hurricanoe shed be out crestin the briny b now kydd said harsh laughter bayed from a group of sailors at their end of the loft they were seated around an upended tub playing cards and swigging hard from bottles kittoe allowed his face to go grave yeah to a barky as any haulbowlings cn feel proud ter own to they drank together kydd let the rum just burn his lips the evening might develop ye come frm england kydd asked nah avenger is taken frm the crapauds at martinico kittoe said briefly it was the way of it some clash at arms in these seas a tall woman appeared dressed loosely in colourful red she moved behind kittoe and slid her arms down his chest come kittoe man youse an me make jigajig she purred but her eyes were on kydd wide and lambent away wi ye sukey said kittoe but with a smile were talkin together yer silly biddy the womans hair was drawn back and had a hard sheen in the light a large polished mahoganycoloured jungle seed hung around her neck she fingered it regarding kydd speculatively grunts and cries from the darkness beyond left little doubt about what was going on and kydds senses prickled hey youse koonerman she said her voice low and throaty kittoe took up the bottle again and went to top up kydds tankard but only a few drops of rum emerged he snorted potboy look sharp were athirst a figure hurried over from the other side to attend them and came to a sudden halt luke kydd cried whatre y doing here it was not hard to guess here he could earn a few coppers the boy dropped his head as kydd laid into him you little rascal thiss not the place t find a fine young gennelman damn me if it is obstinately luke raised his eyes and said then what re you here for mr kydd there was a chortling from kittoe but kydd stood up face burning none o yr business now you get yself back aboard i mean return t our lodgings this instant y swab at the stubborn look on lukes face kydd knew there was no other course we return now y blaggard ill have no servant o mine corruptin himself with drink n carnality kydd pushed him out into the darkness and followed he cursed and swore under his breath he had had no intention of being saddled with the moral responsibility for another but in lukes case he felt a certain obligation show more canvas younker kydd growled an idea took shape he shied from it at first but it would meet the case splendidly he sighed hed thought hed left all of that behind in another life as they opened the little gate he rounded on luke have y made up m accounts yet lukes face dropped mr kydd y know i havent m letters damme i fgot said kydd with heat this means i have t spend my valuable time acopyin and figurin may have t get a proper servant me havin such responsibility now kydd turned his gaze from lukes pitiable expression and frowned grimly an that aint going to be easy hereabouts they went up the stairs then kydd stopped as though struck with a sudden thought there maybe is a way mr kydd said luke eagerly perhaps not youre a lazy rascal an wont i will so i swear right me hearty we starts tomorrow y hoists aboard yer letters at last yes mr kydd luke said meekly just before noon a rain squall stopped all work kydd and his crew hurried into the shelter of the boathouse while the downpour hammered into the ground and set a thousand rivulets starting towards the brown waters of the harbour i have been hearing good reports of you thomas said caird kydd looked around in surprise mr caird you have been teaching your servant his letters kydds face eased into a smile aye keeps him out o trouble betimes the scamp cairds voice softened that is what i thought it is the lords work you are doing thomas never forget it embarrassed kydd mumbled something but was interrupted if you are at leisure perhaps you may wish to dine this evening at my house we eat at six promptly noting kydds hesitation he went on i can well comprehend the godless depravity you are sparing the boy and confess from the start i had my hopes of your conduct the salt if you please my dear caird said to the arid lady at the other end of the table who kydd now knew was his sister isadore she nodded graciously with something suspiciously like a simper it was hard on kydd bad enough the enervating warmth but worse the starched tablecloth precise manners and formidable air of rectitude he searched for some conversation lukes not a shab really its just that isadore broke in unctuously and as a sapling is trained so does the tree grow she helped herself liberally to the cream sauce opposite kydd sat the delicate timid beatrice each time he looked at her she averted her eyes quickly disconcerting him she was a slight figure in filmy grey which added to her air of unworldliness she had been introduced as cairds daughter her mother long departed for a better world another akee beatrice caird said his voice tender thank you no more father came her small voice caird nodded to the hovering servant who gracefully removed her plates i see rose has her foremast ataunt now ventured kydd cairds eyebrows lowered in deference to the ladies thomas i make it a practice never to discuss at table matters they cannot be expected to know oh er i mean it is friday my friend on the sabbath beatrice and i go about the good lords business in this country ministering to his children do you not feel that it would lift your heart to accompany us struck dumb by the assumption of his godliness he noticed beatrice beaming across at him please do mr kydd she said meeting his eyes for the first time splendid said caird we shall call for you and your servant of course at six on sunday when he returned to his little house the lower part showed the light of candles the occupant was at home he started to climb the steps to his room but a throaty hail stopped him avast there cock come n show yerself it was the chief caulker his beefy frame seeming to fill the room he was slumped in a chair holding a bottle a black woman flitted about with a bowl has th mullygrubs he said burping whats yer name mate thomas kydd master o the kings negroes savin yr presence yez a young one fer a master howd yer come by it i had th rate o petty officer in trajan n when she was let go a cryin shame rumbled the man i was taken up b mr caird he finished are ye a goddammed bluelight sailor then demanded the chief caulker i never take th lords name in vain brother kydd said holding his hands in a prayerful attitude and hoping that his humble tone passed muster b gob i never said god rest ye mate an all that kydd smiled beatifically and made his exit pleased at his escape from future bibulous demands then he remembered his mothers firm and steely methodism the hours of boredom in church and winced sunday morning saw them both in best attireluke with hair slicked back and shirt painfully buttoned up kydd in his best stepashore rig feeling utterly out of place they waited outside the master shipwrights house broad square imposing built of stone the house reflected the importance of its chief inhabitant the misses caird emerged into the early sunlight closely followed by caird forbidding in black entirely black from oldfashioned threecomer hat to severe black breeches and stockings the whole relieved only by a plain white cravat kydd doffed his hat to the ladies returned by the unsmiling caird lukes hesitant touching of his forelock was ignored a dray rumbled grittily round the corner its load of what appeared to be furniture covered with an old sail the greyhaired old woman at the reins bobbed her head in glee at the sight of caird hallelujah glory be oh yest lord amen to that hepzibah caird said in a strong voice we have today joining with us in joyful prayer master thomas kydd and his servant hepzibah beamed at kydd then shall we proceed this day we pass by the plantation of mr blackstone beyond falmouth town caird handed up the ladies to the single front seat and climbed up himself taking the reins i would wish we had more commodious transport thomas you will have to shift for yourself in the back i fear kydd pulled luke in after him and the dray moved off as they clopped serenely through the dockyard kydd was glad of the early start there was nobody abroad to see him he looked at the swaying backs of the cairds and wondered at the wild contrasts in his life since he had taken to sailoring they wound out of the dockyard and were almost immediately in scrub and rocks over the higher ground behind the dray ground along hepzibah breaking into joyful hymns that of course it would be unseemly to join scattered houses merged into a township but the houses were mean wattle and daub small and muddusty falmouth said caird a negro village past the town the sea sparkling to their left they wound up into canefield country the heat was noticeably stronger as they topped the rise the sound of singing floated to them on the hot breeze finally they stopped at a crossroads in the shade of a wild tamarind tree of considerable size and age where people of every variety free and slave had gathered please to assist me thomas in rigging the assembly caird asked kydd courteously kydd complied lifting down chairs and an ingenious portable pulpit under the shy direction of beatrice these were set out under the tamarind tree when he had finished she turned to him with a timid smile and laid her hand on his arm thank you thomas shall we sit she guided him to the row of chairs in the front which kydd was uncomfortable to see was the only seating behind them the blacks squatted in the dust caird took his position in the pulpit looking stern and majestic his voice boomed out psalm eightyfour the eleventh verse the lord god is a sun and shield the lord god will give the grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly a warm roar of approbation and shrill cries of hallelujah lord resounded and the first hymn was announced and are we yet alive it was sung with true feeling in joyous counterharmony as she sang beatrices pale face under the muslin bonnet was pink with animation her grey eyes sparkling as she glanced at kydd the hymn despite the outlandish setting brought back memories of sundays in guildford his mother in her best clothes he in his onceaweek coat and breeches next to his father kydd recalled staring dully at dustmotes held unstirring in shafts of sunlight coming from the freedom of the outside world into the utterly still church that was well thomas it is our pleasure to invite you to our sunday dinner should you be at leisure caird had preached powerfully his sermon was strong on duty obedience law and sin but sparing in the matter of joy the sunday roast would not have shamed his mothers table even if the potatoes had a subtly alien bitterness the beef a certain dark sweetness once again opposite beatrice he tried to engage her in conversation thumpin good singing th negroes he said hesitantly beatrice flicked a glance at him but quickly lowered her eyes caird interjected they do so take joy in entering into the house of the lord he said should an assembly in england take such a joy it would be gratifying kydd had been impressed with their spirit his kings negroes in comparison to those he had seen today were morose should he not be perceiving their better parts appeal to their spirit yr pardon but i cant sort of cant get close to em if you know what i say your concern does you credit sir and therefore i will speak directly caird dabbed his lips and put down his napkin it is easy for us to feel sorry for the negro his condition his lot in life but we must not believe that in this way we are helping him kydd nodded not really understanding you will nevertheless find that i am the sworn enemy of any who illabuse their black people who grind them to the dust and then discard them he fixed kydd with a look of such fire that kydd was forced to look down meekly at the tablecloth but thomas in my heart i cannot pretend that they are of the same blood as you or i they are not kydd looked up in puzzlement the good book itself tells us that they are an accursed people genesis chapter the ninth tells how noah placed a curse on his son ham and all his seed from that day to this the black man is placed into subjection and scientifical studies do show this edward long a vile ranting fellow nevertheless forces us to confront the fact that they are really another species of man lacking vital parts that give us judgement and moral sensibility merely look upon them they are not of our kind kydd sat silent therefore my friend you really should not look to their natures for the finer feelings they are not possessed of any caird looked down then raised his face with a gentle noble expression for this it is my lifes work to minister to them to help them understand and be content in their duty and place in the world to bear their burdens in patience and through gods grace to aspire to his kingdom amen breathed beatrice it made things much clearer if they were a debased form of mankind of course he was wrong to expect much in the way of feelings but something still niggled an is slavery right kydd asked stubbornly caird looked at him fondly it does seem hard but you must understand that they need direction discipline to control the brutality that lies beneath slavery is a mercy it provides a strong framework in which they may learn to curb their natures he paused and looked at kydd directly it is not the slavery which is evil it is the manner in which some do enforce it there was time to spare the following forenoon the blanche frigate was due in for repair following a spectacular action against a heavier french frigate off guadeloupe rumours flew about that her captain had been killed kydd was keen to hear the full story remembering his own desperate battle in artemis blanche was delayed so kydd stood down his crew over at the boathouse with caird away in his office he had nothing to do but watch the shipwrights at work the craftsmen in the boathouse filled the space with the sound of their labour the oddly musical thonk of a maul the regular hiss of the try plane the clatter of dropped planks steam billowed suddenly from a long chest and a shipwright gingerly extracted a steaming plank carrying it to a halfclad boat another took one end and they eased it around the tight curve of the bow faying it to the plank below kydd could see that they were fitting it to at least three curves simultaneously by eye alone all along the open side of the boathouse a spar rested on trestles and kydd marvelled at the mystery of mastmaking how was it possible to create a perfectly straight perfectly round spar from a roughhewn length of timber it was all done by eye alone again he noted a straightedged batten was nailed horizontally to one end a pair of shipwrights worked together and another batten was fixed the other end sighted by eye to exactly the same level then mastaxe and adze were plied skilfully to produce a flat surface the whole length another pair of battens produced a flat opposite by the time they progressed to the octagonal they had a true workable approximation to a round kydd shook his head in wonder a sudden shout came from outside kydd ducked out and saw pointing arms the blanche had arrived all work ceased and men poured out to see the spectacle see there mates one man said pointing out of the harbour to freemans bay where the broken masts of a substantial ship showed above the lowlying point of land she has a thunderin good prize as blanche came to anchor opposite kydd could see that she was sorely battered a stump of mizzen not much more of her mainmast as she slowly swung to her anchor the stern came into view blasted into gaping holes the excited shouting died away at the sight particularly at her huge battle ensign still floating from her foremast but only halfway up caird strode down from the direction of his office where is your crew kydd and ill need you two he pointed to two shipwrights working in the boathouse and the blue cutter in the water directly with a chest of tools and the men the cutter was crowded but kydd relished his luck in being able to see things at firsthand he squinted under the loosefooted mainsail as blanche grew nearer and saw the frightful wounds of war her sails were torn with holes her sides pocked and battered by shot caird led the way up the side of the frigate to the upper deck where they took in the results of a harrowing longdrawnout grappling a trial of fire that had tried her ships company to the very limit subdued murmuring conveyed the essentials indeed the captain had been killed there was a prize lying to seaward which was in fact their opponent a french frigate a third bigger than themselves they clattered down the mainhatch caird needed to get a sight of the damage to the stern and any cannonball strikes between wind and water that might prove an immediate threat returning on deck they saw moaning wounded being swayed down into a boat wrecked equipment dropped into another and wearyeyed men staring at the shore she comes alongside by sunset caird said to an officer with a bandaged head i shall see the master attendant directly yer has the right of it mates capn faulknor an a right true sort e was gawd bless is memory said kennet a gunners mate from the blanche kydd dragged his upturned tub closer the better to hear him over the din in the capstan house we wuz openin gron bay in gwaddyloop aready ter spy in the harbour in th mornin when we sees this thumpin big french frigate acomin round the point he paused a seaprofessional audience could be relied on to get the picture now i asks yer this cant be much after midnight larbowlines as watch below n in their ammocks all peaceful like an then its quarters shipmates n as quick as yer like kydd could visualise the scene all too clearly drowsy watch on deck swapping yarns easy in the mind at the prospect of a spree ashore at the end of the cruise and then in a flash the reality of war and death in the balmy night capn dont lose a minute we goes at em clearin fer action as we go an its all goint be in th dark kennet looked about to see if he had their attention before he went on we pass the frenchie shes called pique we finds later on the opposite tack an we has a broadside at each other his voice lowered an thats when m mate lost the number of is mess he stared into his grog sam jones second capn o the foretop kydd stood up and gestured with his tankard heres t sam jones then mates an if we don remember him he wont have anyone else will in the willing roar that this brought kydd drank deeply remembering the emotions battering at him after his own battle experience the faces that suddenly werent there any more the worlds indifference that they had ever existed but they would continue to live in mens memories just as long as they were brought to remembrance like this he took another gulp kennet looked up at him his grim face softening at kydds empathy then continued but then we tacks about but pique shes t weather an wears ready to give us a rakin broadside but capn faulknor hes wise to em an we continues on t wear ourselves so there we was mates broadside t broadside fer two an a half hours thumpin it inter each other the cruel smashing match in the darkness dim battlelanthorns inboard leaping gunflashes outboard unseen horrors in the blackness it held the circle of rough seamen spellbound but then we shoots ahead pique as taken a drubbin ands at our mercy we turn ter rake her an finish it when our mizzen an mainmast both go by th board in a trice we runs afoul of her an she rakes us then she goes f board but were ready an send em screamin inter the sea kydd noticed that kennets eyes had gone glassy and his hand had a tremor these terrible events could only have taken place less than a single day ago pot he shouted against the hubbub and personally topped up kennets can then added to his own the rum had a potent fragrance so its a stalemate lads we drifts then runs aboard her agen by the bow but capn himself rushes forard an puts a lashin on our bowsprit t hold on ter the frenchman but an it grieves me t tell it he takes a ball frm a musket an falls there was murmuring all round kennet waited for it to settle then offered a toast to his captain which kydd could see was being repeated in other groups of seamen around him he raised his tankard in salute tears pricking at the bravery he had learned about that night lashin gives way we drift off firin all the time o course b now its comin on daylight n were dog tired bugger m days but we was knackered around him kydd saw bodies topple in the capstan house but whether from hard drinking or exhaustion he didnt know wind drops we fin ourselves stern to an no guns whatll bear cos we got no stern chasers no gunports even so what does we do then kydd couldnt think what the rum was deepening his emotions but doing nothing for his concentration well lads we heaves some twelvepounders around in th great cabin t face astern then after we puts men wi firebuckets on ea side he paused dramatically holding their eyes one by one an then we blasts our own gunports through the stern timbers there was no comment only shocked faces we then has em we pounds away wi them pair o guns one hour two not until we brings down their masts an finishes moren twothirds o their crew do they give up an then they strikes their flag a growl of satisfaction arose but no cheers too many sailors on both sides would never know another dawn kydd stood still he couldnt return to his dark silent lodging he felt a surging need for the sea the slam of excitement at the challenge of sudden peril the close companionship after shared dangers the kind of thing that had men rollicking ashore together there was fire in his blood the potboy hurried past but kydd stopped him and snatched a bottle which quickly went gurgling into his tankard he swung round and spied a couple of able seamen arguing together that scurvy crew ahoy come drink with me t the blanche mates as trim a frigate as ever gracd the seas barrin only th brave artemis chapter mr kydd you said y wanted ter see m work this morning wiout fail an here tis luke held out his copybook in the early light of morning the pages filled with spidery childish writing i done it while you was away last night he continued proudly he must have sat by the light of that single candle scratching away at his worthy proverbs right into the night thought kydd in spite of his fragile condition he was touched by the lads keenness show me he croaked the letters swam and rotated in a nauseating spiral thas well done luke kydd gasped and gave the book back he had never before had to pay such a price for a nights carousing he felt ill and helpless and despised himself for it it had been easy to be drawn into the wholehearted roystering of a sailor ashore but he realised there was a real prospect of sliding into a devotion to the bottle that so many seemed to find an answer to hardship and toil kydd levered himself up on one arm to his shame he found himself still in last nights stained clothes his resolve strengthened never to succumb again and he swung into a sitting position it was a mistake his face flushed and a headache pounded relentlessly it would be impossible to deal with the knowing looks of his crew to think clearly enough to head off trouble to face caird luke m boy he began he looked up to see the lads eyes on him concerned watchful feelin a mite qualmish this mornin think ill scrub round the vittles yes mr kydd luke replied quietly damn it doesnt mean you cant have any kydd flared then subsided in shame do ye go to mr caird an present m compliments n tell him tell him i regrets but i cant attend on him this forenoon as i cos i has a gripin in the guts thats all he collapsed back on to the bed and closed his eyes he woke from a fitful doze in the heat of the day and sat on the edge of the bed the nausea was still there and a ferocious dryness in the throat drove him to his feet in search of water he swayed and staggered drunkenly to the sideboard for the pitcher which he drained thirstily slowly and painfully he stripped off his clothes dropping them uncharacteristically on the floor then thankfully he curled up on the bed again in the afternoon no one came to commiserate and kydd knew that his story of sickness had been received with the contempt it deserved to be thought a common tosspot cut deeply luke arrived in the evening kydd had previously sent him away not wanting to be seen and now luke crept about the lodging as though in the company of a bear kydd swore at him and at the gruel he had thoughtfully brought the evening dragged on still no one enquired of him luke took to hiding as the illness ebbed so kydds headache worsened under the lashing of his irritability the night passed in a kaleidoscope of conflicting thoughts at last the light of dawn arrived to dispel the dark and its tedium he felt hot dizzy he needed water luke he shouted petulantly the sleepy boy appeared and to kydds astonishment his face contorted a harsh cry pierced the air and luke fell to his knees sobbing loudly what if this is yr joke kydd felt dread steal over him what is it younker he asked fearing a reply luke looked at him with swimming eyes he ran out and returned with a mirror ssee he stuttered kydd looked into it his face looked back at him the hideous jaundiced hue of his skin was more frightening than anything he had seen in his life it was the yellow fever they came for him at noon by this time kydd had vomited violently several times as if his body were trying to rid itself of the invading fever the fear of the dreaded vomito negro seized his thoughts and threw him into frozen horror he had seen soldiers carried to their graves by it in their dozens but in the way of youth he had always known it would be some other never him luke sat by his bed defying kydds orders to get away not caring at the likelihood of contagion kydds mind started to detach in and out of reality the bearers expressionless and silent lifted kydd on to the stretcher the naval hospital was full and instead kydd found himself at the door of the army hospital on shirley heights its austere grey lines unmistakable even in his feverish state the interior of the hospital was dark but gradually he could see rows of low beds one or two orderlies moving among them some victims lay motionless others thrashed and writhed a foul stink lay on the close air the putrescence of bodies giving up the fight moaning and weeping filled the consciousness numbing kydds senses he was placed on the ground while a bed was prepared a corpse was carried away in a blanket the ragged palliasse flicked over the top vivid with dried discolouring he was transferred the bearers never once betraying a flicker of interest they left the blanket rolled untidily at the foot of the bed and departed an orderly saw luke and ejected him irritably so kydd lay alone staring up into the void the pain sickness and despair creeping in on him it was here that he would meet his end not in some glorious battle but in the squalor and degradation of disease in this pit of terror his mind wavered and floated the wasted hours the unfulfilled hopes those who loved him trusted him emotion choked him kydd waited in the gloom for it all to end black faces jolting moving harsh sunlight kydd tried to understand the lift and bob of a boat he cried at the poignant motion lukes face looking down anguished he smiled up at him and was carried on into an airy space a woman took charge and gently but firmly removed all his clothes a clean smell of hyssop and soap he felt himself laid carefully on a sheet and the woman began to wash him he couldnt resist modesty had no more meaning and he drifted into a febrile no mans land he woke how much later he had no idea in a small room clean and well appointed next to his bed a woman kept up a lazy fanning smiling at him and on the other side luke sat keeled over in slumber who er what d ye now sah be still youse in mah hands mr kydd sah the woman said happily sis mary the talk woke luke who sat up confused a shadow darkened the door it was beatrice mr kydd she asked timidly aye said kydd with as much strength as he could thank the lord she breathed and stood hesitantly at the foot of the bed holding a lace handkerchief to her face when we heard you were sick we never thought er that is to say we were led to believe by false witnesses that your sickness had other causes her eyes dropped my father thought it best that you are cared for in a private way it is the usual thing you know she spoke more strongly sister mary has nursed many a soul to recovery ye need money fr this he said feebly beatrice smiled let us hear no more about that mr kydd you are in the lords hands and he will provide for his faithful servants her fingers twisted together i do wish you well it is not over yet but kydd could feel the fever diminishing and elation built at his escape he was ready to seize life again with both hands sister mary took gentle care of him seeming to know what he needed before he could express it she had an unvarying bright and sunny manner not bothered by the violence of his vomiting or kydds shameful need for a bedpan after each spasm she bathed his burning face whispering comforting words he couldnt understand the fever faded the vomiting grew less and kydd thankfully slipped into a sweet sleep on the morrow he would be on the mend he woke in the darkness of the early hours feeling strange and giddy a sharp bout of vomiting had him leaning over the bed he pulled back in and felt a warm wetness exude from his nose it stank and he wiped at it uselessly his hand came away darkstained in the semidarkness mary he croaked fearfully she was asleep in a blanket on the floor and didnt hear at first kydd called again in his nighttime panic hoarsely shouting her name when she came to him sleepily she saw his face and at once trimmed the light to full illumination she tore back the single sheet and stared at his lower body there was no sunny banter kydd looked down and saw oozing from his body orifices a slow fetid black bleeding he sank back sister mary set to work sponging him insisting he sat up in bed placing supports around him his vomiting was shorter sharper but now it was discoloured black and foul kydds thoughts became confused as the morning light strengthened he saw marys figure distort and swell he screamed and whimpered at times lucidity came a strange calm in which he could see and hear but not respond he heard lukes broken desolate weeping and a regular mumbling it took some minutes for his mind to register that it was beatrice at a distance praying cairds tall figure in its accustomed black loomed he spoke to kydd slowly but the words were gibberish as if he were saying them backwards his figure towered over kydd grim and foreboding smelling of sin and death deep inside kydd knew that he was dying but no one had prepared him for this terror this final process of separation from the world it was so unfair his was a young life that would live that would fight and win obstinately from deep within he claimed the last of his strength and in a final defiant act he turned on that which was killing him he struggled up facing the whirling light patterns that were all that remained of his world and screamed at it dimly aware that he had fallen out of bed he flailed and fought and at last stood swaying and victorious shouting and cursing at the foul disease challenging it daring it to do its worst fire jetted into his body and he exulted images came into focus the horrified faces of mary luke beatrice staring at him he laughed strength came to him he moved staggered fought and won his eyes clamped on the real world he would not yield up and in a dignified motion he turned and collapsed again on the bed i do declare we feared we had lost you mr kydd said beatrice dabbing her eyes kydd grinned levering himself to a better sitting position dye get me another o the lime cordials id be grateful the fever broken he was going to live and with a bonus having survived the yellow fever at its most virulent with no lasting illeffects he now had lifelong immunity from its terrors he looked across at sister mary quietly getting on with her work and felt a warmth towards her that surprised him with its intensity her homely face was inexpressibly dear to him now has luke been doin his words he asked in mockrough tones indeed he has beatrice answered primly i have set him some improving verses which he promises to complete for you this very night her eyes softened and welcome back thomas she said tenderly weakness forced kydd back into the pillow but he was content in a week or two he would be back in the world he knew lignum vitae the hardest wood we know said caird stroking the piece of smooth olivegreen timber you will see it as the sheave in every block aboard your ship and it grows right here in antigua there are some trees of that sort that we will see on our next sunday mission he added matteroffactly the rain slackened its furious assault but did not stop altogether the steamy smell of vegetation heavy on the air they would wait a little longer in the boathouse before going out to the newcaptured french cutter you might remark this heavy wood it is from the mastwood tree the one with the yellow flowers that the honeybee favours so and there the large pieces in the corner the anteegans term it black gregory and we use it much for its endurance the guns at the fort have their carriages wrought from its strength kydd nodded his thoughts far from indigenous trees his recent experience had thrown his perceptions of life and his place in it into a spin and he longed hopelessly for renzi to apply his logic to it all beatrice tells me you are progressing admirably with your servants learning caird said aye the younker does try that ill grant said kydd id be obliged if youd consider another matter caird said looking at him candidly sir in the matter of my stores peculation in a dockyard is an insidious evil consuming its vitals rendering the thief insensible to sin he paused eyeing kydd speculatively i would be most grateful if you could do me a service that strikes at the heart of this abomination he went on take this key it is to the stores office in the boathouse be so good as to enter it discreetly after work ceases and make a true copy of the days proceedings this will be compared to the one rendered to me directly kydd understood this way it would be easy to detect where and how defalcations occurred in the dockyard yes mr caird he replied pocketing the heavy key it was a simple matter just a couple of pages of shortform notes and figures kydd laid down the quill stretching he gathered up the papers and stepped into the early evening crickets started up and from somewhere on a nearby tree came the complacent wheekwheek of a treefrog as he turned on to the road to his lodging he glanced up a fine sunset was building but as usual it was obscured by the closein scrubby ridge overlooking the dockyard then something seized him this time he swore he would take his fill of the sight scrabbling at the crumbling rocks he clambered through the bushes to the top of the ridge there the full beauty of the sunset was in view only distant islands to include in the broad breathtaking panorama of sea and sky a scattering of low clouds hung far away about the setting sun tinged by the yellow gilding that radiated out kydd found a flat rock and sat to watch the sun sank lower the clouds progressed slowly from yellow to orange and began to stretch in delicate tendrils half across the sky the dying day converging on the central spectacle it held kydd in a trance the stark beauty entering his soul an upwelling of emotion took hold ufting his spirit to soar free above the world he had made a journey from death to life he would not waste his existence on vain striving or useless repine the surge of feeling brought a lump to his throat but no focus or resolution it left him ardent but confused when the smoky violet dusk had settled and the horizon had assumed a hard blueblack line he got up and stumbled back down the ridge the usual evening sights and sounds of antigua dockyard met him happy bedlam around the capstan house it was terrier sloop this time after a successful cruise to san domingo rather more genteel sounds of revelry came from the brightly lit officers quarters ahead from some sort of assembly in honour of the new major of fort berkeley but to kydds intensified senses it was the loveliness of the scene that impacted the most lanternlight was not merely a dim flame it was a wash of tawny gold the darkness was not evening it was a warm electric sensuousness the dark shapes of vessels at anchor had tiny golden stars of light about them this faraway lands darkblue presence hinted at mystery life and vitality tugged at him mercilessly a swell of hilarity came from the capstan house its open warmth held a strong appeal to kydd the warmheartedness of company of human interaction and he felt a sudden urgent need abruptly he turned on his heel and hurried toward the boisterous gathering curious glances came his way at first but the sailors quickly resumed their companionable roistering kydd stood irresolute doubts nagging at him but they were swamped by one overriding thought if he could not freely taste the delights of life then what was life for what cheer mateys he said loudly do ye have a glass as will allow me t hobanob with th terriers it was punch from a cauldron a swirling mix of rum pineapple and coconut it slipped down easily and as he had been unable to take strong drink for some time it went speedily to his head he looked round savouring the energy the vitality around him this was what it was to seize life yet as the rum took hold he felt somehow unfulfilled aimless restless how do massa keed there was no mistaking the low purr the woman fingered the polished dark bean she wore around her neck it lay against the twin swell of her dark breasts and a predatory gleam showed briefly in her eyes sukey kydd said feeling the impact of the lazy swing of her hips as she moved towards him she came very close and her musky feminine odour invaded his senses as she slowly reached out letting her hand slide down his arm to the tankard which she silently detached from his grip with a teasing smile the colour light and noise around him fell away as the centre of his vision was filled with one thing a focus at last for the burning thoughts that took his reason she half turned doan like th loft she pouted too many noise yo have a lodgin house or somewheres kydds blood roared yes he said thickly his drab rooms would now know something other than solitude but then he remembered luke would be there manfully at work with his quill and ink loyally transcribing his improving words frustration built into a sweet but driving pain there was no place in antigua that offered the privacy he knew he needed to cover his deed sukey let her eyes drop and teased at his shirt suddenly a thought exploded come on kydd mouthed pulling her away she feigned reluctance but her smile widened and they ran along the coral quay past the deserted seamens galley the silent twostoreyed canvas and cordage store the low joiners loft the boathouse was still and somnolent kydd found the door to the office and fumbled for his key sukey snuggled up behind him her hands sliding over his body confident and direct in their purpose the door creaked open into black stillness and he jerked her inside just remembering to lock it he smiled savagely they could be sure of their privacy now in the dusky light sukey came to him but when his responses grew fevered impassioned she pushed him away avoiding his hands he growled and she pouted then began undoing his shirt somehow contriving at the same time to lose her own red shift suddenly they were both naked their bodies slammed together giggling sukey pulled him to the floor taunting him guiding him his smile turned to a snarl his hands dug into her shoulders suddenly she froze her eyes wide open staring at the door panting kydd stopped baffled the lock turned and into the office stepped an indistinct figure with a lantern the room was filled with pitiless light that fell on their locked bodies there was a sharp intake of breath and the light trembled kydd came an outraged shout it was caird sukey pushed kydd off her frightened and quaking and scrabbled for her clothes which she held against her nakedness kydd didnt know where to turn in the sickening wash of shame and horror with a terrible intensity caird bit off his words may the good lord have mercy on your soul sir for i shall not kydd returned to his lodging dreading the dawn luke retreated shocked at his expression the next day was every bit as bad as he had feared caird was controlled but it was with a cold ferocity that tore at kydds pride his manhood leaving him shaking and in no doubt of his worthlessness he was told that his employment as a master was over in antigua and as of that moment he was no longer required in the dockyard and for your damnable depravity caird concluded your indulgence in lust to the hazard of your immortal soul sir i will see to it you go from this island you shall depart on the first kings ship that chances by pausing only to draw breath he stood and said by some wicked means you have ensnared my daughters affections she is at this time undone in her sensibilities you are a desperately wicked rascal and will very soon come to the sordid end you deserve go sir get you out of my sight go chapter the day kydd and renzi were parted had been a bleak one for renzi the brig gathered way making for the open sea in the bright morning renzi looked back from the tiny foretop he could just make out the red coats of the marines in the panic ashore and knew that kydd must be there too watching the vessel sail away leaving him to his fate on the crowded deck moans and shrieks arose from the french passengers at the realisation that they were on their way to safety but that their friends and relations ashore would probably soon suffer a cruel death only louise vernou stood quietly staring at the shore frozen in pity she held an object to her lips renzi saw that it was the anchorembossed button kydd had given her around her neck on a thin cord if kydd could escape from the clutches of the mindless rabble and keep the marines with him he had a chance but the situation was critical despite his cool selfpossession renzi felt his throat tighten they had seen so much together it was characteristic of war the arbitrary nature of its demands of blood and grief but he realised that he was not as detached from the world as he had thought jowett the masters mate in command stumped over and told him brusquely tell th frenchie bastards to go below t the hold renzi cajoled and threatened them and eventually had them crammed into it the main hatch was left open to give them sight of the sky square sail was set and the brig settled to a workmanlike beat to round the southern end of guadeloupe we cn make antigua in a day wi this lot we cannot fetch barbados without we find water n vittles jowett said we sets course fr st johns there was a dockyard in antigua renzi recollected and it was well fortified st johns was round the coast to the north but had the main naval presence the admiral commanding the leeward islands station and all the facilities for taking their cargo of newly homeless later no doubt they would go on to the dockyard all they had to do was cross the short distance to the island without encountering any of the french invasion fleet some hours later they had rounded the southern tip of basse terre and well snugged in on the starboard tack they began to slip their way north past the nowhostile anonymous greensplotched coast the distracted babble died away as the brig met the busy waves of the open sea responding with a lively roll that had the passengers in the hold huddling down a canvas awning was spread over the hatch against the frequent spray but there was no protest from below by the afternoon they had reached the northern coast of guadeloupe and began to stretch out over the sea to the bulk of antigua ahead jowetts face set to the northeast towards the buildup of cloud massing there he sniffed the wind distrustfully i mislike bolderin weather this time o the year this bein the season fr hurricanoes an all they would have no chance if it came to anything like a gale merchantmen were always looking to shave corners with the cost of gear sail hoooo the lookout in this small vessel was only forty feet up and his sudden bellow made renzi start he followed the outstretched arm and saw a foreandaft rigged craft emerging from a kink in the northern coastline not large but dismayingly warlike a second vessel appeared and the pair set course to intercept armed schooners muttered jowett privateers an we aint got a chance a seaman added in the absence of the bulk of the fleet at san domingo the french privateers were basing themselves back in guadeloupe issuing out to fall on any passing prey like corsairs they were savage and murderous don vex em moren we need mr jowett an older seaman advised staring at the two schooners leaning to their hard drawing sails we aint got powder fer our guns nor a full suit o sails so well never outrun em why dont we strike our colours now jowetts jaw set no we got a chance if they see us in antego we get help hold course the island was drawing nearer and hardening in definition renzi scanned the south coast for any indication that they had been seen and a ship was putting to sea in their aid halfway across it became obvious that the frenchmen would come up with them well before they could make antigua the white swash at their bows sparkled in the sun their sails hard and boardlike they were now close enough to show the sight of their crew clustered around their forepart the flat crack of a gun followed the sudden appearance of a puff of gunsmoke the leading schooner was making its intentions known renzi swept his gaze over the approaching coast even if they were sighted now help could not arrive before the privateers had done their worst a halfsmile appeared on his face logic ruled that he would be either dead or captured within two hours he folded his arms and awaited events then renzi saw the leading schooner suddenly surge round head to wind her sails shook until the vessel paid off on the other tack going before the wind away from them shaking his head in disbelief he looked about searching for a reason for the sudden retreat perhaps the headsails of a shipoftheline appearing around a headland a vengeful frigate from the south nothing the other schooner followed suit and under the incredulous gaze of the brigs crew the privateers were seen making for guadeloupe and their lair excited the sailors jabbered away looking for an explanation for their deliverance jowett seemed not to share their jubilation cos they seen that he said his arm pointed towards the northeast the cloud banks had extended across the sky and darkened its a reglar goin hurricanoe thats what yer sees we bears up fer english harbour said the helmsman nah we bin holdin course fer st johns an we cn never beat back to the eastd in time if we makes it ter antego west about well be in the lee o the storm jowett growled shut yer jabber we goes t st johns the brig was battened down tight it was hard on the unfortunates in the airless hold and if they foundered or struck on the rocks theirend would not be pleasant renzi cringed as he gave louise his assurances and asked her to calm her compatriots she did this without question quietly accepting imprisonment in the claustrophobic darkness they kept well clear of the breakers to the southwest of antigua but by the time the rockstudded danger of five isles was abeam the brig was bucketing and rolling in ugly seas only a league or so yelled jowett to the men on the yard they had come up with the little islet of sandy island off st johns and were now within a few miles of safety but that now seemed impossible for it lay in the teeth of the fresh gale hourly increasing in strength seamen gathered on deck the distant sight of the town no more than five miles ahead taunted and beckoned the little brig strained to her uttermost closehauled but could not lie close enough to the wind to fetch harbour a fizz then a sudden gout of choking smoke and a rocket soared up into the grey evening sky to explode high above jowett was trying to get a larger vessel to come to their aid but it was unlikely that any would risk putting to sea under the threat of a hurricane it was stalemate on this point of sailing they could only reach the rocky coast to the south where without charts or local knowledge they were sure to be wrecked or they could run with the gale but that was no alternative for the hurricane would grow and overwhelm them it was only a matter of time winds backin screamed a seaman as the wind shifted into the north and with it came a chance it would need acute judgement but at the right moment it would be possible to go about then beat down to st johns it was a desperate matter for they would be close up against the coast on one side and the battering storm on the other renzi watched jowett the thirty lives aboard were in his hands jowett stood facing directly into the streaming wind his nose unconsciously lifting in little sniffs as he judged its mood ready about he snapped the brig seemed to stumble as her bow came up into the wind renzi willed the plain little vessel to go through stays without complaint which she did and they lay over on the larboard tack every minute gathering speed in the blasting gale explosions of white heaved skyward from the seas pounding the rocks under their lee the clouds massing took on an ugly cast but st johns grew ever nearer soon they encountered the breaking seas over the bar at the harbour entrance and once inside the headland of hamiltons fort the waves lost their viciousness weary and weatherbeaten they headed directly for st johns town renzi survived the storm in the company of louise and the french in a stone warehouse worn out and emotionally drained he snatched what sleep he could with the insane howling of the storm outside in the morning he looked outside in the gusting winds and rain of the dying hurricane and saw their brig miraculously still alongside the wharf snubbing and rearing like a spirited horse but safe the time of trial had left renzi strangely depressed the lunacy of war was au fond the outworking of the crass irrationality that lay in the heart of unenlightened man but he knew that what lay on him was more personal at least kydd would not meet the hurricane at sea he was safe ashore but in what circumstances his helplessness in the face of the situation was probably the true reason for his dejection renzi realised moody and hungry he awaited events rather later a busy little man arrived from the civil administration to relieve him of his charges he left louise with no false hopes for kydd and when the goodbyes were said french fashion he saw the sparkle of tears in her eyes the brig was uncomfortable to work in her movement brisk and jerky but it would not need much to make her ready for the short voyage south again to the naval dockyard at english harbour in the afternoon renzi begged leave and went into town seeking a bookshop the well of contentment that might restore his balance three hours later he returned spirits restored his bag stuffed with gold another goethe for prometheus had awakened in him a grudging respect for the man a secondhand raynal the histoire des deux indes which had probably been the property of a french royalist and an interesting new work by the plutarchian robertson on conjectural history and most important a glorious find newspapers from england a bare six weeks old he exulted as he tramped back to the brig this was what it was to be alive at the gangway a crosslooking lieutenant was waiting jowett called down from the deck of the brig and the officer rounded on him are you renzi he huffed i am sir parleyvous le fronsay vraymont astonished renzi could only stare answer then if indeed you have the french mais bien sur questce que ca vous fait the lieutenant smiled in satisfaction that will do follow me without thinking renzi fell into step beside the man but was swiftly told fall in astern if you please the officers look of disdain caused renzi nothing but secret amusement a short walk took them to an imposing stone building a blue ensign and marine sentry at the door proclaimed it a naval establishment the marine slapped his musket to the present as the officer entered then winked at renzi the lieutenant paused play your cards right my man and your days as a foremast hand may well be at an end mystified renzi followed him down the passageway they stopped at a door the lieutenant knocked and leaned inside the man renzi sir he said send im in roared the unseen personage within rear admiral edgcumbe said the lieutenant softly and ushered renzi in the admiral sat behind a massive darkpolished desk his expression more curious than fierce so you has the french an a manner to go with it im told he mused looking keenly at renzi he slid across a piece of paper and quill write render to me your return affecting stores that are rotten renzi complied his hand flying across the page sure and fluent damme thats a splendid hand for a sailor grunted the admiral and looked up sharply are ye a forger er no sir pity first class with a pen y forger his head snapped up whats the county town o wiltshire sarum which is salisbury said renzi immediately it was a little too close for comfort his family were prominent in the next county and he had reason to remember the spires of old salisbury admiral edgcumbe smiled ah quick an sharp with it he said with satisfaction and leaned back in his chair flags he roared the lieutenant instantly poked his head inside the room this onell do get im in a decent rig an on the staff ayeaye sir see he doesnt run an have him aboard the packet in good time he bent his head again to his work thus dismissing both men by the evening it had become clear what was going on the admiral was newly promoted commanderinchief designate to the jamaica station and was due to sail shortly with his staff to take up the appointment he had been unlucky in the matter of fever it was damnably difficult to find good replacement staff at short notice and word about renzi had reached him just in time renzi would be a writer a form of clerk entrusted only with duplication of orders and unimportant matters but would prove useful with his good knowledge of the language of the enemy the lieutenant clearly felt that renzi had been plucked from an existence as a sea menial to a prestigious position with real prospects and should be grateful for himself renzi felt a lurch of premonition at the mention of jamaica but perhaps in the naval headquarters there would be no exposure and therefore little risk of confrontation a new life of petty politics at headquarters was not to his liking for he had deliberately chosen the sea life as the purest form of exile next day the packet swarmed with the admirals retinue renzi as a seaman knew precisely where to keep out of the way and watched with wry amusement the fluster and confusion as the pretty little topsail cutter put to sea a small frigate accompanied them as escort the pair foaming along in the freshness after the hurricane heading westward deep into the glittering blue of the caribbean sea the island of jamaica was raised five days later without incident an impressive bluegrey monolith appearing out of the morning on the distant horizon they had passed st kitts during the night and hispaniola was a disappointing low scrubby headland approaching then receding as with the favourable northeasterlies they headed direct for the southern coast of jamaica off morant bay they hove to a pilot schooner plunging and rolling as she sent across the kingston pilot and in turn took aboard the admirals flag lieutenant they would remain there for the night while warning of the arrival of their august passenger reached the capital overland it had been a pleasant if crowded passage the tedium of a sea voyage without duties brought renzi an unexpected pang of sympathy for the passengers he had previously scorned more immediately useful was the information he had gleaned from casual talking with the admirals staff in the west indies there was wealth more millions than he had ever suspected a river of silver and gold heading back to england from trade and its support but above all from sugar the plantation society the plantocracy had high political significance in london and lived like lords if the tales of high living were to be believed but with the great wealth there was another of corrupt and unscrupulous conspirators who infested every class he had met the first clerk mr jacobs a dry but astute man who weighed and measured each word before it was uttered from him renzi learned that they would be going not to the capital kingston but further inland to spanish town the administrative centre of jamaica and would be involved primarily in the necessary dealings of the navy with the civil administration it was not a prospect that pleased renzi morning saw the two ships proceeding sedately westward to the entrance of kingston harbour on the sheltered inner side of a low encircling spit of land miles long was the jamaica station of the royal navy a mighty gun shipoftheline four frigates sloops of war and countless brigs and schooners the admiral had transferred to the frigate during the night in order to make his arrival with all appropriate ceremony and in the light airs of the morning clouds of smoke eddied about the anchored as her salute crashed out at the sight of the frigates bunting the packet followed humbly in the wake of the frigate but when the bigger ship went to meet her brethren it passed across the bay to bring up noisily into the wind opposite a wharf at the end of a street in kingston town a heaving line sailed across and they were pulled alongside the hot sandy streets were alive drays filled with the trade goods of two continents merchants concluding deals in the broad piazzas processions of traders with their slaves following behind the cheery green and white of the houses was complemented by the gardens which differed wildly from the calm neatness of english cultivation here there were fruittrees coconuts tall palms and a riot of colour from vines there was little time for renzi to stand and stare mr jacobs was clearly discontented with the arrangements for transport the ketureens the ubiquitous jamaican gig sporting a gay raised sunroof on rods offered insufficient security against possible rain for the two chests of correspondence when this had been settled with dozens of negroes walking beside and an overseer riding ahead to clear the way of wagons and carts they set out on the flat road to spanish town after passing a great lagoon with vast reed beds they stopped at the ferry inn to refresh and change horses before the final run to the old town it is of an age i believe renzi said to jacobs as they wound along among the outer streets of spanish town it is founded by christopher columbus and settled by the dons captured by us in renzi would have to be content with that bare information but his mind expanded upon it two centuries of spanish indolence and fixed ways eventless years that were in stark contrast to the tumults in europe then the english had flooded in upsetting the staid times with their thrusting mercantile rudeness turning the old comfortable social certainties on their head the procession ground into a large square with imposing buildings that would not have been out of place in far castile one notable exception was a distinguished white marble edifice set between the two largest structures they disembarked in its shadow and to his surprise renzi saw that it was a splendid colonnaded statue of an undeniable sea flavour cannons rope and the sterns of fleeing enemy ships rodney explained jacobs of course renzi remembered admiral rodney had fought the french de grasse to a smashing defeat in a great fleet action some ten years earlier off guadeloupe as a result jamaica had been saved from french colonisation he looked around the square it had a slightly offended air as of an older gentleman put out by a younger man not fully recognising his dignity but the cool ochrepainted stone of the government offices was real enough there he would see out his working life for the immediate future these were his prospects he could envisage only a dreary vista of daily sameness in the months ahead the work was easy enough the endless round of returns reports minutiae of the fleet now lying at anchor it had to be victualled clothed repaired administered as renzi dealt with his tiny part of the steady stream he grew increasingly respectful of the scale of the operation tens of thousands of men the fleet as big as a county town a moving town that might be anywhere yet needing the same flow of all manner of goods in the main renzi was left to himself he often caught flashes of suspicion from jacobs but realised that these were because of his reserved indeed secretive nature his however was a circumstance of endurance of serving a sentence and he had no care of what his interim fellows supposed his thoughts strayed to kydd by now he would probably be a lonely corpse in upcountry guadeloupe or a prisonerofwar in a french vessel on his way to incarceration anything in the absence of any knowledge logic was useless and in sadness he forced his mind to other things the admiral did not live in spanish town his mansion was out of town in the cooler hills north of kingston and after several weeks renzi was summoned there admiral edgcumbe received him at his desk leaving him standing respectfully what do ye think o that he said thrusting a newspaper at him and jabbing a blunt finger at the top of one column it was a copy of the moniteur from paris not three months old and the article about the unstable now executed robespierre was interesting and significant renzi hesitated what was he being asked to do had the admiral sent for him merely to ask his opinion on a newspaper article by this sir i believe we find that the thermidor coup has established itself robespierre overstepped himself the committee felt threatened combined to overthrow him execute him and then belay all that what does it mean renzi resumed carefully it means that the terror in paris is spent the revolution is now controlled he paused the admirals intense eyes on his it would be reasonable to suppose that their attention is no longer distracted by the fratricide that they are now able to turn their attention outward to the larger considerations of the war perhaps even enough the admiral sat back with a loud grunt and now be so good as to tell me who in hades you are sir a fleeting smile forced its way on to renzis face may i sit sir you may the flinty eyes did not spare him deliberately renzi relaxed he crossed his legs and clasped them over the knee languid and confident a london beau manque you may believe i am a gentleman he said in tones he had last used in the company of the duke of norfolk the admiral said nothing but his gaze did not alter and you may also know that i have done nothing of which i need be ashamed you have my sacred word on that there was a humph my beliefs include a devotion to the rationalist cause i do not care for the comforts of the old thinking he straightened and fixed the admiral with a level gaze sir if i am to say more i must ask for your word as a gentleman that this will go no further than yourself he held his breath this was on the face of it a preposterous impertinence from a lowly clerk to a blueblood admiral you have it renzi gathered his wits the only course was to tell the truth any less would be detected instantly sir my philosophies compel me to satisfy their moral demands in a way that others might consider eccentric i find them sufficiently logical and consistent therefore when faced with a matter bearing on my personal moral worth i must answer for myself my father procured an act of enclosure there was grief and suicide occasioned by it for the sake of my conscience sir i am undertaking an act of expiation i sentenced myself to five years exile not to a foreign shore but to the lower deck of a manowar at first it seemed there would be no response then the admirals quarterdeck expression eased and a glimmer of a smile appeared a glass of madeira he growled and reached for the decanter renzi accepted thankfully the admiral looked at him speculatively he felt for a key and unlocked a drawer extracting a closelywritten piece of paper cast y eyes over this he said renzi took it and scanned quickly this is a letter from a monsieur neuf it is to his son i think the admiral nodded just so we took it frm a brig that thought it was going to france he smiled thinly and now it is not what i am exercised with is just how to spread half a dozen ships o force over a thousand miles of sea renzi met his ferocious stare equably but his heart sank he could see now where it was all leading and wanted no part of it sir i am a perfect stranger to dissimulation deceit and the other necessary qualities to make a spy and must decline in advance any such service the admirals eyebrows shot up what do you mean sir i wish you merely to exercise your intellects in the reading of any chance material bearing on intelligence the fates throw our way see if you can sight any clue any unguarded slip o the pen you know what i mean that is if y morals will allow of it renzi found himself quickly removed from the vast hall filled with labouring quilldrivers and sharing an upperfloor room with two others to his satisfaction they were uncommunicative and selfabsorbed and he found he could work on without interruption each morning a locked box would be opened in their presence and each would receive a pack of papers of varying size on most days renzi received nothing and then he would assist one of the others occasionally the admiral would call for him and he would find himself reading a letter pamphlet or set of orders there was a pleasing sense of discretion in the proceedings that considerably eased his mind at the odious act of violating the privacy of another it was a strange floating and impermanent existence and above it all hung the knowledge that at any time he could be brought into confrontation with his past to mutual embarrassment when it happened there was not a thing he could do renzi blue office if y please this was where petitions from the populace were initially heard he was generally included where matters touching the navy were involved taking notes in the background and making himself available if explication were needed he sat at his little table to one side readying his paper and ink leaving the bigger desk to jacobs mr laughton called the usher from the door renzi froze the man came striding in looking past the lowly renzi to jacobs who assumed an oily smile another loss laughton snapped this is insupportable sir sir you will recollect that the navy is much committed in the leeward islands damn your cant without trade this island is worthless and with these losses you will soon have none renzi kept his head well down and scratched away busily taking his notes the talk ebbed and flowed inconclusively jacobs stonewalling skilfully laughton snorted in frustration and rose suddenly so that is all you have to say sir he turned and stormed out without a glance at renzi who sat back in relief a few seconds later the door flew open again and laughtons voice sounded behind him be so good as to direct me to the revenue office he said in a hard tone mr renzi jacobs asked mildly there was now no further chance of evasion for the space of a heartbeat or two renzi stared down at his paper savouring the last moments of an uncomplicated life this way sir he said softly holding his head down to the last moment laughton gave way at the door and then as renzi quickly closed it behind him his eyes widened nicholas he gasped renzi looked up his younger brother had not changed overmuch in the years since he had last seen him a broadening of the shoulders an unfashionable sundarkened complexion the confidence we we thought you had laughton spluttered richard be so good as to walk with me a space renzi said hastening along the wide veranda to the steps that led to the gardens at the back of the building nicholas are you in distress of money laughton asked when they were out of possible earshot on the grass dear brother no i am not it were better the whole story be told rather than allow wild surmise if we could talk at length without interruption but you perceive at the moment laughton glanced quickly at renzi and gripped his arm in spanish town i have a certain weight you shall have your talk come they returned to jacobs laughton strode forward sir i find this er renzi has a certain felicity in explaining the naval situation to me i beg leave to claim his services for a few days to assist me to formulate a position is this possible sir jacobs seemed taken aback a new clerk of such accomplishment that both the admiral and the influential richard laughton were laying claim to his services clearly indicated that it might be in his best interests by all means sir he stuttered laughton gave a polite inclination of his head and gestured to renzi this way sir if you please the gig ground on over the bright sandy road with laughton himself at the reins past endless brightgreen canefields and black people on foot windmills and tropical duncoloured buildings were the only disruptions to the monochrome green for the nonce dear brother i would ask that you do not claim me as kin i will explain in due course renzi said a little too lightly richard glanced at him and nodded if that is your wish nicholas he said neutrally bringing the gig dextrously to the side of the road they sat patiently as an ox train heavily laden with barrels of crude sugar for the coast approached in a dusty cloud the yells and shrill whistles of the wagoners piercing the thunder of many wheels as they ground past the overseer raised his whip respectfully in salute to laughton the handle was like a fishing rod and the rawhide tail all of seventy feet long they resumed their journey turning up a neat road lined with what looked like gigantic pineapples blue red and white convolvulus blooms entwined among them penguin hedge laughton said and when the road straightened to a line leading to a sprawling stately homestead he added and this is the great house they approached between immaculate lawns and renzi saw the scale of the place grand and dignified a barelegged ostler took the reins as they descended from the gig stone steps and an iron balustrade led to a broad veranda and the front doors do ye wait for me a short time nicholas and i shall show you the estate laughton said taking the steps two at a time he pointed to a cane easychair as he strode inside which renzi politely accepted shortly afterwards laughton emerged now in a blue squarecut coatee and hessian boots and wearing a broadbrimmed straw hat they mounted the gig again and ground off over nine hundred acres an four hundred to work it quite sizeable all sugar laughton opened with just a hint of pride they passed a gang of fieldworkers trudging out to the canepieces men women children at renzis look he added each has his task even the piccaninny follows on behind and weeds the fields teaches em responsibility reaching a cluster of outhouses renzi heard a loud rumble and creaking around the corner he saw the open strawcovered busyness of a sugar mill the rotating rollers were fed with cane stalks in a crashing splintering chorus the mill workers did not raise their eyes from feeding the cane into the maw of the rollers a large axe with a glinting blade was hung on the mill frame laughton observed drily better a limb severed than being dragged into it was a complex operation a sugar estate and renzis concentration wilted under a barrage of details slaves gained skills ranging from fieldworker to muleteer sawyer driver and varied in origin from saltwater slave from africa to infant born on the estate the heat of the afternoon suggested they should return to the great house and they sank thankfully into the cane chairs on the veranda laughton heaved up his boots to rest them on the rail and clapped his hands sangaree he ordered of the whitecoated houseman the breeze of the tradewinds was deliriously cool and renzi relaxed you have done well for yourself dear richard he said looking at the rolling lands reaching to the horizon thank you nicholas it was father gave me my step as you know laughton replied he accepted his glass of sangaree and glanced carefully at renzi before he sipped the rosy liquid in wary silence the letter from home was scarce in details brother he began softly said you had disappeared after an argument with papa that was paraphrasing truth indeed the bullheaded obstinacy of renzis father to acknowledge any culpability in the ruination of ten families and the anguished suicide of the young hope of one was a direct contribution to his decision to take upon himself the moral obloquy of his familys act indeed so but in truth this is only the outworking of a decision i made he found it easier than he had feared richard was from the same mould as himself strongminded obedient to logic and sympathetic to firm resolve based on moral principles renzi finally ended it had been said his brother did not respond at first then he stood up looking away out over the estate he turned fixed renzi with an intense look and smiled you were always one to show the rest of the world its duty he held out both hands and i honour you for it another glass of sangaree was necessary before conversation could resume laughtons warm smile returned your name if you will forgive the impertinence renzi why nothing but an impenetrably obscure italian of another age he was unfashionable enough to value riches of the mind above that of the world and i have grown used to it he reached for the jug of sangaree and splashed more into his glass my dear fellow but you have been a sailor on the bounding main all this time you must have a tale to tell or should that be a yam it has been a life of some er variety agreed renzi but the conditions you were a common sailor and and still am brother a slight frown settled on laughtons brow just so then how could you bear the incarceration and daily hazard pray tell im interested renzi smiled at laughtons attempt to relate to his endurance i bring to your recollection brother that this is the serving of a period of exile and tolerability is not at question he paused then stretched in his chair however i may tell you i have had adventures ashore and afloat around the world that will keep me warm in memories for ever but you will ask what of the company the common seaman the brute beast of the field renzi faced his brother and i will answer truthfully that those who have not experienced the especial fellowship of the sea the profound and never articulated feeling of man for his fellow out there on the yardarm at the cannons mouth deep in the oceans realm they cannot know mankind in all its imperfection yet heroism he gazed into the distance there is time at sea to ease the mind to contemplate infinite truths and consider in their intimate detail philosophies and axioms to complete satisfaction you do not weary of the quality of your company at times i but i keep myself impervious there are ways to remain apart renzi said slowly and i have a particular friend he tailed off for with a rush came a vision of kydds face strong and uncomplicated which held both intelligence and humour he continued huskily but i regret he has met with he is probably dead he finished suddenly i do sincerely mourn with you said laughton softly he busied himself with his glass and said it would be an honour brother if you could sit at table with us tonight we generally meet on this night not in the formal way you understand but to talk together perhaps a cigar or pipe while we settle the business of the world his eyes flicked over renzis odd clerkly garb and there is probably a stitch somewhere i could give you should you feel the need to appear er inconspicuous he said lightly the cool night airs which breezed freely through the double doors and on through the large airy rooms of the house were agreeable to the guests as they sat down in the richly polished dining room gilbert might i present mr renzi an acquaintance of mine from england nicholas this is gilbert marston he is owner of the estate that borders mine to the west renzi inclined his head civilly at the stout gentleman to his left noting the shrewd intelligence in his eyes yr duty the man said gruffly in coffee are ye no sir alas i am here to visit only renzi said leaning back to allow a vast dish to be placed on the table i have my interests er in the country england that is ah marston sniffed at the dish strips of dried dark meat jerked hog y got to hand it to the blackies they cn conjure a riot o tastes another vast tureen arrived when the silver cover was removed it proved to be a mound of small delicate fish yet another came this was uncovered to loud acclamation see here renzi said marston eyes agleam this is yr jamaica dish royal black crab pepperpot the conversation swelled happily renzi noticed his brother gazing at him down the table thoughtful and concerned his expression brightened when their eyes met and he called you will require a quantity of wine with that pepperpot m friend allow me to prove we are not without the graces here in the caribbean he nodded to a houseman who in turn beckoned in a servant who pushed before him a neat cart to his surprise renzi saw that it seemed to be some sort of windmill which the servant rotated carefully to catch the night zephyrs a breezemill marston confided damn useful renzi saw that the mill drove a pump that kept up a continual circulation of water over bottles of wine in cotton bags ranged together in a perforated tin trough saltpetre an water uncommon effective it was indeed to taste chilled white wine in the tropical heat was nothing short of miraculous renzi caught a speculative look on the face of an officer in red regimentals have i seen you sir the man said slowly in spanish town was it not laughton put down his glass that would be unlikely sir renzi is heir to a particularly large estate in england i rather fancy he would hardly have occasion to call upon the army the officer bowed but continued to look at renzi sipping his wine thoughtfully i see cuthbert has been broke marston said to the table at large all he had was ridin in the catherine brig an she was taken off ocho rios lessn a day out a murmur of indignation went up for shame what is the navy about that it cannot keep our trade safe not even a piddling little brig marston bunched his fists therell be many more ruined afore they stirs emselves he growled too interested in the frenchie islands in the antilles all their force drawn off b that laughton frowned went to see the admirals office in spanish town the other day for some sort of satisfaction in the matter but was fobbed off with some damn lickspittle clerk the conversations subsided as the table digested his words an olivecomplexioned man with curiously neat manners spoke into the quiet in chambers they are saying that within the month insurance premiums will be out of reach of all but the grand estates a heavy silence descended to send a cargo of sugar to sea uninsured would mean instant ruination if it were taken the turtle arrived and renzi nibbled at the tongue and crab patties checking his impulse to comment on naval matters further down the table a grumbling voice picked up another thread trelawney maroons are getting fractious again renzi gave a polite interrogatory look towards marston who took up the cue maroons thats yr runaway slaves up in the cockpit country where we cant get at em damnfool governor about fifty odd years ago gave in t them signed a treaty they lives free in their own towns up there doin what they do but thats not enough they wants more an infernal impertinence another burst out wine with you sir marston exclaimed to renzi your visit should not be damned by our moaning renzi smiled and lifted his glass around the table talk resumed gossip local politics eccentricities the barrister politely enquired of him london consol prices fortunately renzis recent devouring of the latest newspapers had left him able to comment sensibly the claret gave way to madeira ginger sweetmeats and fruit jellies appeared and chairs creaked as they accommodated the expansive relaxation of their occupants the cloth was drawn and decanters placed on the table gentlemen the king intoned laughton chairs scraped as the diners scrambled unsteadily to their feet the king god bless him the simple act of the loyal toast unexpectedly brought a constriction to renzis throat it symbolised for him the warmth and good fellowship of the company to be had of his peers a blue haze arose from several cigars and the talk grew animated the evening proceeded to its end and carriages were announced i wish you the sleep of the just nicholas laughton joked as he stood with renzi at the door of his bedroom he hesitated a moment then turned quietly and went renzi lay in the dark the softness of the vast bed suffocating to one who had become accustomed to the neat severity of a seaservice hammock he stared into the blackness his thoughts rushing it had caught him unawares he had to admit and even more it had unbalanced him the sight of his brother and the memories this brought of home and above all the easy gaiety and reasoned conversation all conspired against his highminded resolution he rolled on to his side it was hard to sleep with the upcountry night sounds the long snore of a treetoad outside the jalousie window the chirrchirr of some large insect a nonstop humming compounded with random chirping whistling and croaking an insect fluttered in his hair he swore then remembered too late that it was usual to search the mosquito net for visitors first a larger insect blundered around in the confines of the net and he flapped his arms to shoo it out but felt its chitinous body squirming against his hand and threw aside the net in disgust but then he recalled the usual method of dealing with giant scorpions dropping from above hot wax from a candle there was none lit so he reluctantly draped the net again and sank back into the goose down there was no denying that he had enjoyed the evening too much and he could feel himself weakening it would not take much for an active mind to rationalise a course of action that would release him from his selfimposed exile such as the fact that with his dear friend no longer at hand to share his burden it might be thought excessive durance he would then be released free even to join his brother in the plantation morning arrived renzi had slept little but when he awoke he found that his brother was out on the estate when he was ready he presented himself at the dining room a tall black servant offered a chair and a small table outside on the veranda obviously following laughtons practice a breakfast arrived but nothing renzi could recognise ah dis callaloo an green banana sah he was advised by a worried buder renzi smiled weakly and set to the coffee however was a revelation flavoursome and strong without being bitter as he was finishing laughton came into sight astride a stumpy but wellmuscled pony he slid to the ground and strode over to renzi with an easy smile do i see you in good health renzi had never shied from a decision in his life and the moral strength to stand by its full consequence was deeply ingrained brother may we talk he responded quietly it was done although he knew he had made the only decision possible the resumption of his exile was hard and time slipped by in a grey dreary parade the probability was that he would not visit his brother again the contrast was so daunting day succeeded day in monotonous succession the work not onerous or demeaning but stultifying while on one hand he would never need to turn out into a wild night on the other he would not know the exhilaration of sailing on a bowline the sudden rush of excitement at a strange sail or touch at unknown and compelling foreign shores after the mornings work there was already a respectable pile dealt with and ready for signature he picked up the next paper another routine report a list of names and descriptions of new arrivals from somewhere or other available for local deployment his eyes glazed he would need to advise the appropriate departments separately for each individual a lengthy task sighing he put down the paper then snatched it up again it was impossible but the evidence could not be denied on the fifth row in neat copperplate was the name thomas paine kydd feverishly he scanned the line apparently a thomas paine kydd dockyard worker was being transferred from the royal dockyard at english harbour as surplus to requirements the odds against two men with the same name being in the same part of the world must be colossal but then this one was indisputably a dockyard worker and probably a bad one at that renzi knew by now the code for offloading a useless article on a mad impulse he stood up he gathered together the pile of papers hurried outside and found jacobs these are for signature mr jacobs i have been called away by admiral edgcumbe again he said and hastened away if he was quick he could ride on the noon mail and be at the naval dockyard in an hour or two chapter the boat skimmed over the spacious harbour on its way from kingston town to the naval dockyard at the end of a sevenmile sandy spit of land the palisades this was port royal the notorious pirate lair that had been destroyed spectacularly by an earthquake a century before but renzi had no eyes for this curiosity furious with himself for his impulsive and unreasoned act he was yet in a fever of expectation and hope that had no foundation in logic just a single name on a piece of paper he waited impatiently while the boat came alongside the wharf then swung himself up and strode ashore ignoring the closepacked victualling storehouses he followed the road through the sprawling ruins of the polygon battery the odd greyflecked sand of the spit crunching loudly underfoot as he passed the stinking pitchhouse and the bedlam of the smiths shop he had no real idea how to find his quarry the employment return had merely said that this man was a dockyard worker no indication of what type it would be useless to ask any of the dockyard men about a new arrival no one would know him over there was a rickety row of negro houses renzi had found that generally sailors got on well with slaves so perhaps he stopped dead an unmistakable figure was coming round the corner at the dockyard wall with his head down kydd renzi stood still noting the droop of the shoulders the preoccupied air he called softly avast there brother spare an old friend a glance kydd stopped as though struck in the face incredulity then joy lit his features he hurried over and shook renzis hand until it ached do ye leave me my hand tom it is the only one i have left on the right side renzi said port royal town was old a sea town with a gaudy past and its superfluity of sailor taverns gave pleasing choice for their reunion the early hour of the afternoon ensured they would not be disturbed and they selected the shipp inn on queen street it had a table in a bay window overlooking the calm of the inner harbour you are safe preserved renzi said with great feeling kydd looked up surprised oh yes twas nothin really ltenant calley told us t march out to putty borg on bass tair but there they had th fever so we went to t other side fort mathilda an were picked up b trajan renzi had shared too much with kydd to believe that this bare account was all there was to tell but it could wait youre in the dockyard line now he asked aye said kydd his brow creased but id give a bag o guineas t get back t sea how trajan was surveyed n condemned i had th chance fr a spell in a reglargoin dockyard and an i ran afoul of a bluelight shipwright seems m spirits were too who should say ardent with the ladies kydd explained without rancour renzi contemplated this he knew that kydd was not a concupiscent and signalled to the potboy the punch here is considered of the first class he offered thank ye no i had th yellow fever not a month past lost m taste fr grog lately then we have your lemonadoes rap cacaodrink a small beer will answer kydd said it was indeed satisfying to see kydd again and once more renzi realised that here was his only true friend he dreaded the parting that must come rebellion forced itself on his consciousness but he conquered it what are you about at the moment he asked unwilling to confess to his impulse in coming scullin about seems i have t wait for assigning kydd said moodily whatre you doin for yrself oh somewhat in the character of a clerk my small french is of value here it seems i labour in spanish town it was depressing the very thought shall we not view the ruins of the old pirate town he went on quickly i have a yen to see the very streets of captain morgan they walked along the narrow streets of port royal it was small and compact occupying the tip of the palisades and it didnt take long to discover that there was no trace at all of the notorious city ah dearie ye have ter unnerstan all tht was wicked and godless one arternoon jus ups and slides down inter the sea all th people fallin into great cracks in th ground an screamin an being carried ter their doom a judgement on em all the old washerwoman told them with relish theyre still dahn there she cackled they passed back along the other side of the spit seeing its inner prospect of the fleet at anchor in all its puissant presence the admirals pennant floating proudly atop the gun flagship renzi saw kydds forlorn attention on the ships as they paced along kydd stopped he lifted an arm and pointed to a small vessel anchored much closer in chocolate hole there he said like a yacht n with saucy lines if ever i get th chance t ship out again shed be m choice is she not overmuch small renzi teased be damnd t that shed be everywhere all over th caribbee never rottin at anchor n seein parts o the main where yr shipoftheline would never touch in a hunnerd years kydd went on an th best chance o prize money yell ever get shielding his eyes renzi tried to make out the vessel shes seaflower cutter kydd said in a low voice with a commander new promoted an he cant fin a crew he said finally tearing away his eyes an idea came to renzi in the wagon to spanish town a stupendous fantastic idea he elaborated and tested it on the rest of the way and during the night planned his move requesting the muster lists of all the ships in the fleet was easy they were filed together and no one questioned his sudden use of them for undisclosed purposes he sat down and started work scanning the names and making the occasional note the pack on seaflower was not large a swift riffle through the papers told the story well enough a tiny unrated vessel she was beneath notice and would be left far behind the sloops and frigates in the competition for skilled men he picked up the latest letter from her captain a young lieutenant in his first command a third piteous plea for hands she had been stripped of men while her previous commander was dying of fever and was at the moment unable to sail the signature was in the same hand as the body of the letter it seemed her captain had to write his own correspondence renzi smiled he picked up a fresh sheet checked his quill nib and started captain his majestys cutter seaflower the secretary of the cheque views with concern your letter to this office of the th inst concerning your sea readiness it has long been the practice on this station to render full returns in the form governed by commanderinchiefs fleet orders dated st nov which provides fully for the correct procedure your attention to detail on this matter in the future is most earnestly requested touching as it does on the effectiveness of this department in the carrying out of its duties as a closing paragraph he added almost as an aside attached a list of seamen to be sent into seaflower to answer your deficit of skilled hands your obed servant etc etc that should suffice now the usual to the dockyard commissioner answering the availability for employment return and directing the assignment of thomas kydd to seaflower quartermaster and the others they would be all of the same form and it should not take long he glanced at his notes and began his pen flying across the paper captain his majestys ship cumberland you are directed to detach tobias stirk gun captain for service in seaflowerwith immediate effect and the next concerning ned doud and another for doggo or william shea as he would appear on the ships books he finished the others then took the sheets across and slipped them randomly into the pile awaiting signature they would never be noticed by the hardpressed secretary to the admiral nicholas kydd yelled youd never believe i cant credit it im to be made quartermaster into seaflower he laughed why my felicitations to be sure renzi said smoothly joining his friend an toby stirk is t be her gunners mate kydd exclaimed in glee come an sup wi us at the kings arms stirk conspicuous in his usual red kerchief and gleaming earrings was holding loquacious court at the tavern table vividly describing the last moments of artemisto an admiring throng kydds heart swelled at the pleasure in his old shipmates faces the riot of noise was broken by a gleeful shout from the door tom tom kydd kydd stood to get a better view over the crowd to his delight he recognised doud the born seaman and purevoiced singer from artemiswell met ned m old shipmate warp yrself alongside cuffin he called doud pushed his way through closely followed by elias peats seamed old face they nodded in pleased surprise at stirk and doggo then eased themselves on to a seat what ship kydd asked were irresistibles mate doud said referring to the big out in the bay but the damnedest thing weve jus bin turned over inter that squiddy little seaflower cutter an stirk stared at kydd in amazement suspicious kydd turned to renzi who suddenly found the view from the tavern window over the harbour remarkably absorbing nicholas do ye know the most amazing coincidence this age renzi replied quickly especially in view of my own somewhat precipitate wrenching from the felicity of spanish town to the uncertain delights of this same vessel kydd reached out and gripped renzis hand m dear friend whatever had brought about their reunion he would not question it in the slightest particular could be a mort interestin mates said petit seriously hows that then doud asked petit the hoary old seaman could be relied on in the matter of seasense seafloweraint agoin ter be swingin around her anchor fer long ships like er are off doin all th jobs thats goin despatches carryin passengers escortin merchant ships not ter mention takin a prize or two doud frowned but yell have ter say shes small the smallest an if we comes up agin even a halfawake brigowar well be in fer a hazin leaning forward stirk gave a hard smile as a nipper i were in th trade outa folkestone knowing looks appeared around the table there was only one trade of significance so close to the remote fastness of romney marsh and the navy was always keen to press smugglers for their undoubted skills as seamen an i learned t have a care when the revenooers were out in th cutters so much sail on em like ter hide the ship fore n aft rig sails like a witch snug up to the wind you dont ave much ter worry of less yer gets under the lee of some big bastard his smile twisted an seafloweris right simlar t yer revenoo cutter petit nodded slowly just so toby but i reckon as we should get aboard mates else we chance t lose our berths if she sails in the boat approaching seaflowereager eyes assessed the qualities of the ship that was their future she was a cutter single mast with a dashing rake but an enormously lofty one and with a splendid bowsprit that was twothirds as long as the vessel herself should carry a damn fine press o sail said kydd noting the sweep of deck up to her neat stern her lines all curves and graces closer to there were loving touches her clear varnished sides were topped by one wale in black her attractive decorated stern a whorled frieze of gold on bluish green looked stylish and brave on deck the fittings were smartly picked out in red not s many aboard doud murmured under the awning aft there was a man in shirtsleeves watching them suspiciously with folded arms another was fishing over the side forward of the mast boat ahoy hailed the man under the awning it was obvious they carried no officers to pipe aboard but naval ritual demanded the hail no no kydd yelled back the correct response they swung alongside and kydd pulled himself up to the little quarterdeck and an impression of yachtlike neatness there was nothing to indicate the rank of the man awaiting them so kydd played safe touching his hat he reported come t join ship sir after a disbelieving pause the man turned to the young officer emerging from the companionway on deck new men sir the officer returned his salute punctiliously and looked eagerly at the men piling up the side he withdrew a paper from inside his light cotton coat are you the men sent by the admirals office sir the deck of seaflowerwas an entirely new experience for kydd only about seventy feet long she was galleybuilt and a comfortable twentyfive feet broad there were eight guns a side but these seemed miniature to kydd after a shipoftheline im lieutenant farrell captain of seaflowersaid the officer his voice crisp pleasant he surveyed the group and consulted his paper do we have stirk stirk stepped forward and touched his forehead this advice is to rate you gunners mate stirk farrell said what is your experience kydd glanced at stirk and suppressed a grin when farrell came to kydd he paused doubtfully ah quartermaster your experience is acting quartermaster artemisfrigate kydd told him firmly an that around cape horn he added in case farrell had not heard of the crack frigate and her fate farrells eyes widened kydd caught a look of incredulity on his face seaflowernow had a core of prime hands that would not be out of place in a top fighting warship let alone a humble cutter farrell turned to go a fleeting grin acknowledging his incredible good fortune carry on please mr jarman will assign your watch and stations the other man straightened jarman an im the master he looked guardedly at kydd the quartermaster was directly answerable to the sailing master in a manowar we now gets ter see what kinda swabs the seaflowers are doud said as they reached the forward companionway and went below into a large space extending well over half the length of the vessel well i stan flummoxed with the exception of a pair of seamen at a hinged table the space was deserted they looked up at the newcomers oo are you then one asked starting in surprise at doggos ugliness stirk pushed forward wheres yer mates his iron voice braced them and they rose warily to their feet we aint got none wese are all there is the man replied carefully farthing able seaman stirk yer noo gunners mate well who ave we got aboard then ah we has merrick th boatswain an a hard man is he ashore now jarman the master a merchant jack an oo else ralf farthing said turning to the other man cole reefer first trip an all only one midshipman kydd asked equating to a petty officer in authority a raw midshipman could be a tiresome trial up in the tops in a blow aye oh yeah cuddy snead as carpenters mate n thats it yer fergettin that scowbunkin cook nothin but a waste o space him couldnt bring a salt horse alongside wiout it climbs in the pot itself i see growled stirk all the men left aboard seaflower were her standing officers and these two they were not likely to get to sea very soon es goin ter have t press men said doud gloomily the pressgang could find men but they would be resentful unwilling and poor shipmates doggo shifted his feet restlessly doesnt ave ter be he snapped his grogroughened voice an impatient rasp how so mate asked stirk it was not often that doggo put in his oar yer recollects where we are he said mysteriously tapping the side of his nose it was well known that if anything it was harder to press men in the caribbean than it was in england alert to the wiles of the press they would be sure to find boltholes at the briefest hint of a pressgang ashore they all stared at doggo toby i needs you n kydd ter step ashore wi me er o course mate then we sees th capn an find out if b chance he needs a crew o prime hands farrell bewildered by an offer coming from the wickedlooking doggo to have a full ships company by midnight nevertheless agreed and seaflowerslongboat headed for shore where we off to cully stirk asked kings arms o course said doggo cracking a grin in just a few salty sentences he told of his plan kydd laughed in appreciation they entered the warm din of the tavern with a swagger stirks bull roar cut effortlessly above the tumult a gage o bowse fer the seaflowers as needs it y scrubs a few faces looked their way then resumed their talk get it in yer cuffin stirk told doggo loudly we sails afore dusk termorrow an not back fer a while a big seaman sitting close by in the packed tavern turned and laughed why y lookin fer some fat scow t look after like an then orf ter find someone wants ter send a letter somewheres he convulsed with drunken mirth another chimed in seaflowershe lost all er hands an cant find any t ship out in her she aint agoin anywheres she is now cock stirk said oh yeah where then said the seaman intrigued ah

parts watching now merchant seamen foreigners and privateersmen why if yer has dont tell em toby its fer us only said doggo an older seaman looked thoughtful and turned to his friends yair come t think about it elias petit gets turned out o diademan hes a knowing old sod somethins in the wind lads interest was now awakened a sharpfaced man suddenly became animated ere seaflowerthats the barky tht the admirals clerk got hisself transferred inter all of a pelt yeah said another so what does e know that gets him off his arse in spanish town n a berth in a squiddy cutter the older man gave a grim smile i reckon theres a reason all right a thunderin good one he waited until he had all their attention then said in hushed tones hes yer tiemate aint he kydd an you has a soft berth in th dockyard right an both of ye decides to skin out ter sea in a hurry not fergettint tell all yer mates cn only be one meanin yer has word theres summat at sea thats worth the takin somethin that yer

it out b ourselves now what we wants t know is y need any hands fer this vyge o yours kydd looked discouraging no petty officers just a few idlers an some foremast jacks is all grins broke out all around ill have a piece o that then the sharpfaced man said eyes gleaming how ill have a word wi the capn cant promise ye a berth but mark you not a word to him that y knows anything on yr life the riot that followed was only brought under some sort of order by stirk setting up in the corner and taking names for all the world like a farmers fair merchant seamen in hiding from the press even privateersmen crowded in all anxious to take their share of the expected bounty well within time seaflowerslongboat brought out a full and excited ships company and a sorely puzzled young captain was making plans for sea storing ship for seaflowerwas not on the vast scale of a shipoftheline with its tens of thousands of pounds weight of victuals water and naval stores to last for six months or more at sea a cutter was not expected to be at sea for more than days at a time there was a matter that kydd felt would make perfect his change of situation capn sir he asked of farrell at an appropriate time we now has a prime body o petty officers youll agree farrell gave a guarded assent an yr steward has to make shift fr the warrant officers too he does but what then cd i suggest sir we gets a ships boy t bear a hand i have just such a one in mind an besides he knows well how t serve a gun farrell considered we sail before dark he said kydd knew that released from temporary service as his servant luke was ashore glumly awaiting an unknown assignment hell be aboard sir kydd said crisply readied for sea seaflowerhad still one to join her company when in the late afternoon the windlass was cast loose and hatches secured doud made his move the boatswain touched his hat to farrell and reported sir all aboard save that mumpin toad of a cook he said still ashore farrell snapped the cook had been told to return with lastminute cabin stores for him if yer please sir doud asked humbly i got a mate as is a spankin good cook lookin fr a berth get him farrell said douds friend had entertained the old cook for hours until he was dead drunk and was now waiting with his seabag for the signal just as the topmen laid out on the yard to loose sail the windlass taking up the slack of the cable and kydd was standing at the tiller a black face wearing an infectious smile climbed over the bulwarks and the familiar figure of quashee stepped aboard he of the artemisthe legendary stargazy pie and his conweniences herbs and spices with him aboard they would not starve with a fine caribbean day promising a fair wind for the south and as happy a ships company as any seaflower made for the open sea they sailed south threading through the islets and shoals lying off the harbour through unruly seas kicked up by a forceful land breeze and into the wider caribbean it was there that they spread full sail letting the craft show her true breeding farrell had made it clear that he would not be reporting seaflowerready for sea until they had shaken down into an effective company worthy of trust in any mission at the helm kydd found himself working hard a tiller had the advantage over a wheel in that it was in direct contact with the sea with all that this meant in instant response but was without the damping and mechanical advantage of a wheel and tackle seaflower under her big driving mainsail and eager foresail and jib swooping and foaming at speed was as skittish as a thoroughbred horse kydd felt the hammering rush of the sea in the tiller and leaned against the pressure of the marked weather helm the trim of the cutter might need looking to going about was a dream unlike the minutes that even a frigate took seaflowershot around in a moment sheaves squealing seamen bringing in tacks and sheets hand over hand as if their lives depended on it an exhilarating ballet of sea skills the square sails were then set by this a topsail cutter had sailing options not open to her bigger brethren and kydd felt a stirring of excitement seaflowerleaned happily to her topsail and topgallant hissing along at a speed that sent a wake streaming like a millrace past the low deck edge right forward renzi was having a busy time taking charge of the headsails the distinctive huge sails spearing out ahead of the vessel it was a very different situation from the stately pyramids of canvas of a squarerigger and his cheerful waveto kydd was just a little harassed farrell stood just forward of kydd on the weather side of the deck his hands clasped behind his back feet braced against the lively movement his voice as he set the craft about her paces was crisp and authoritative jarman stood to leeward kydd sensed some reserve between the two men farrell gave his orders directly this left the master with nothing to do but observe but perhaps this was the captain trying the mettle of his company merrick the burly boatswain stompedabout sealower his eyes flicking aggressively this way and that his style was hard and uncompromising kydd had been lucky in his previous ships he knew no boatswain had really used his position to the sadistic limits possible that he had heard of in other ships stand down if you please said farrell formally to merrick ayeaye sir said merrick turned to stiles his mate who was fingering his silver call in anticipation and snapped hands turn to partoship fr cleaning belay that farrell interrupted secure the watch below and set a sea watch was my meaning significant looks went about farrell was going to stand by his men before the boatswain the last vestiges of sunset were fading over the hellshire hills as they picked their way back to port royal weary but satisfied this time they anchored close by the fleet farrell was clearly going to report his ship ready for sea an take a turn n clinch at that kydd ordered farthing he and stirk were going to make themselves as comfortable as possible below the senior petty officers berthed right aft within the large space below decks farthing finished the knittle line with a seizing and there they had a taut canvas wall screening off their space in leisure time they would paint the partition with some suitable scene mermaids perhaps or a lurid battle kydd surveyed the little space not as who would say oversized he murmured head bent under the low deckhead stirk grinned at him seaflowershes two hunnerd tons makes er a big un up agin them revenooers near three times their size he said appreciatively i say shes snug is all at sea a full half of her company would be watch on deck and at anchor in the balmy weather of the caribbean many would probably sleep there kydd swarmed up the narrow ladderway to the upper deck where a sizeable gathering was celebrating seaflowersprospects doggo was leaning on a swivel gun forward of the mast waving his tankard with an audience and in full flow a slightly built man with a leathery face and bright eyes listened kydd guessed that this would be snead the carpenters mate and on the other side was the lean figure of stiles without his silver call badge of office a friendly hail and renzi stepped on deck tip us some words mate petit called surprised muttering met this suggestion few present knew renzi and his odd predilections renzi stood still and thoughtful then declaimed into the velvet night majesticallyslowbeforethebreeze thetallshipmarchesontheaureseas insilentpompshecleavesthewateryplain theprideandwonderofthebillowymain a respectful silence and scattering of polite appreciation followed at which renzi coughed apologetically if it were in me to sing a hearty chorus i would rather but we have the prince of ballads himself aboard ned dear fellow entertain us doud flashed his broad white smile and rose handing his tankard to farthing he struck a noble pose and in a perfect tenor sang comecomemjollylads thewindsabaft briskgalesoursailsshallcrowd theshipsunmoordallhandsaboard thebarkyswellmanndandstord the drury lane ballad though confected by a landman was a great favourite and all joined in the chorus thenslingtheflowingbowlfondhopesarise thecanboysbringwelldrinkandsing whilefoamingbillowsroll kydd sang lustily enjoying the fellowship and good feeling luke brought another pot the lad was growing and now affected a red bandanna tied round his head like a pirate with a smile that wouldnt go away at the edge of the crowd kydd noticed the wideeyed young midshipman cole and further away the shadowy figure of the captain both drawn to the singing in the warm darkness something told kydd that he would be lucky to experience an evening quite so pleasurable again chapter captain farrell returned from the flagship before ten the next morning and immediately called the sailing master to his cabin overheard the word swiftly went out the barbadoes wi despatches snarled patch a privateersman his shipmate alvarez appeared next to him his olivedark face hostile doggo glared at him stow yer gab cully yer doesnt think the ol man is agoin ter let th world know now do ye but kydd caught his quick look their tavern story might be recoiling on them and gulled privateersmen would be hard to handle capn knows what hes doing he said harshly jus be sure you does haaaandsto unmoor ship the boatswains bellow reached every part of the cutter kydd cast off the beckets securing the tiller in harbour and tested the helm through a full sweep it was his duty to take the vessel to sea then when sea watches were set he would takethe conn and oversee the duty helmsman for his trick at the helm strong running backstays were needed to take the massive driving force of the enormous gaff mainsail two linked tackles were rove for this and unique to kydds experience the forestay had its own deadeye and lanniard secured to the stempost both together in taut balance one by one stirk had doggo and his party moving about the guns sixpounders a respectable armament for a mere cutter eight a side and with swivels forward as chase guns a cry from forward showed the anchor cable thick and dry for weighing and farrell in full blues consulted his watch the anchor was atrip the captains arm went up the saluting swivel forward went off with a spiteful crack and in the smoke both the foresail and mainsail rose swiftly the steady northeast trades forcing the men at the mainsheets to sweat as they trimmed the sail to the wind at the same time as the waisters brought in the foresheets seaflowerresponded immediately with a graceful heel falling off to leeward momentarily before surging ahead kydd felt the rudder firm and under jarmans muttered direction shaped course westerly to round the end of the palisades they slipped past the fortifications and the dockyard then port royal itself not a soul ashore apparently interested in their departure and made a competent gybe to place themselves comfortably on track for the open sea the jib was hoisted and conformable to the fair wind from the larboard quarter her topsail was set seaflowerquickly left the harbour astern when they had cleared the hazardous cluster of cays to the south they went about and headed along the coast for port morant sea watches were set and kydd yielded the tiller to the helmsman he took up the slate hanging on the side of the tiny binnacle and checked the course and details that the sailing master had scrawled in this small ship he would have to maintain the conn himself nobody to peg the traverse board no marine to turn the sandglass at the end of a watch he stepped back and saw patch finish coiling the fall of the topsail sheet with a careless thump the privateersman cast the coil on the deck against the bulwark and made to leave incensed kydd shouted and pointed at the untidy twists patch saw him but deliberately turned away kydd moved fast knocking aside another sailor as he confronted patch take that lubberly shittle and belay it right he said in a hard voice tangling coils were a hazard on any deck but besides that kydds seamans pride was offended at the slovenly sight patch stared at him contempt in his dark eyes kings ship ways on a fuckin cutter ye must be now patch paused kydd was not getting angry his voice was iron his control icy drawn by the raised voices the boatswain approached from behind patch who failed to notice him merrick watched and waited with a slight smile kydd did not lower his gaze before the casehardened bigger man do ye take a bight and belay that fall he repeated patch looked again in kydds face something passed between them and patch moved he bent and picked up the rope his eyes never leaving kydds as he obeyed grudgingly kydd paused then walked back to his watch position in just a few hours they hove to off port morant and collected a satchel of despatches then resumed course they would reach the eastward tip of jamaica in only an hour or so then would keep clear of the offshore banks before shaping course for the leeward islands with no sign of an eager combing of the sea for an expected prey there was a definite edge to the messdeck chatter at dinner kydd and renzi kept the deck to avoid questions stirk and doggo found something to do with the sixpounders but it was clear there would be an accounting soon gun practice was piped immediately after the noon meal the hardbitten seamen making childs play of their weapons farrell kept them at it and just as morant point drew abeam he ordered that live firing would take place seaflowersdecks were cleared and the pieces manned kydd took his place at the helm and silence fell as all eyes turned to farrell at that precise moment the quiet was split by an urgent hail from the lookout on the crosstree sail hoooooabove the lowlying point could be seen first the topgallants and then the topsails of a squarerigged vessel and shortly after the barque slid into view at least twice their size and a sinister black she quickly spotted seaflowerand her length foreshortened as she turned to intercept ready about farrell snapped his telescope up searching her masts for a flag they slewed round and closed the distance farrell seeming to have no hesitation about closing the larger vessel there was an apprehensive quiet about seaflowers decks shes a twentyeight at least lads doud murmured saw her ports several faces popped out of the forehatch and gazed over the blue seas to the blackhulled vessel the barque altered her heading to a broader angle it served to show her gunports opening all along her hull cannon rumbling into place at each still there were no colours aloft a cold trepidation came over kydd the worst situation with the banks to seaward and the unknown craft closing in to weather give her a gun stirk farrell said quietly a sixpounder crashed out forward sounding toylike after a frigates s there was a minute or twos delay as if the stranger was amused at the small ships presumption before a flutter of colour at her mizzen peak appeared shaking out into the stripes and stars of the united states thank gawd laughed farthing i thought we wuz in fer a hazin the barques sheets eased and she braced around slowly to diverge clearly not deigning to dally with an englisher relieved chatter broke out along seaflowersdeck sir if y please jarman had not joined in the general relief and took farrells dollond glass ah as i thought theres no yankee i know of wears a red cap n petticoat breeches sir shes a frenchie farrell snatched back the telescope and swept the barques decks only jarmans suspicions and a careless french sailor had given the game away brail topsails he snapped under foreandaft sail only seaflowersped towards the enemy she fell off the wind a little and her intention became clear to pass close astern of the other vessel to send her puny balls smashing through the unprotected stern and down the length of her enemy stirk raced from gun to gun fortunate to be at quarters they were at the ready but farrell roared larboard firing to larboard this was away from the enemy kydd was baffled by the order then the barque responded the united states flag whipped down arid the french flag rose to replace it in jerky movement at the same time the vessel came around sharply into the wind to stay about well before seaflowercould come up to deliver her blow the bluff sides of her antagonist were swinging around on the other tack to parallel the little cutter and present her full broadside kydds throat constricted a crushing weight of metal would be slamming into them in seconds he glanced at farrell who to his astonishment wore an expression of ferocious glee we have you now mr frenchman he roared triumphantly the barques swing had been a mistake farrell snapped ready about lee oh and seaflower pirouetted prettily to leave her with her larboard guns laid faithfully on the barques stern they passed close enough to see pale faces over the taffrail and sails slatting in confusion as no doubt orders were being angrily countermanded there was nothing to miss the line of windows at the stern gallery dissolved as gun after gun on seaflowersdeck crashed out the balls brutal impact causing ruin along the length of the enemy kydd felt a furious exaltation it was the first smoke of battle he had smelt since the great frigate struggle between artemisand citoyenne the last gun banged out and seaflowerwas past with her crew cheering madly the guns were served but there was a new peril a squarerigged vessel would back topsails and stay where she was battering the helpless victim into submission but with her foreandaft rig there was no way seaflowercould do the same she continued on her course her only hope to get out of range before the enemy could recover but the black hull was already turning seaflowerlay over under her press of sail but there was no escape kydds hands sweated at the helm but he was tied to his place of duty and must stand and take whatever fate had in store for him the enemy broadside came but in ones and twos paltry puffs of powder smoke the thin crack of fourpounders and a whole gundeck of cannon staring silently at them caught em on the hop goin about growled stirk in disgust they got the yeller fever an cant man the guns someone shouted kydds mind raced this was no explanation for smallcalibre guns jarman smiled shes a mongseer merchant jack puttin on a show he said with satisfaction it was a pretence the open gunports sported only quakers wooden imitation guns that could not fire her bluff was called the tiny seaflowerhad not run for her life as intended and had dared to attack incredulous shouts and cheers broke out while the trim cutter closed in exultantly on her prey damme fr a chuckleheaded ninny but that was rare done patch said lowering his cutlass to finger the quality of the cordage on the deck of their prize knoo the exac time shed weather th point and was there awaitin he continued admiringly keeps it to imself he does an four hours out we has a fat prize the french sailors sat morosely on the mainhatch while farrell and the sailing master inspected below decks it was a matter of small hours to escort the prize back to port morant the talk was all on the astonishing intelligence their sagacious captain must have had and happy anticipation of prize money to claim later farrell did not appear affected by his fortune he appeared punctiliously on deck at appropriate times in the ships routine courteous but firm in his dealings with his ships company and considerate and businesslike with jarman and merrick who stood watches opposite each other seaflowerseemed to respond with spirit square sails set abroad and her prodigious foreandaft canvas bowsed well taut she slashed purposefully through the royalblue seas at a gallop her deck alive with eager movement by the last dogwatch deep into the caribbean kydd joined renzi at his customary pipe of tobacco on the foredeck ignoring the occasional spatter of spray they sat against the weather cathead the better to see the gathering sunset astern renzi drew an appreciative puff at his clay pipe and sighed this prime virginia is as pleasing to the senses as any i have yet tried kydd was knotting a hammock clew his nimble fingers plied the ivory fid he used for close work the intricate net of radiating knittles woven into a pattern that ostensibly gave a more comfortable spread of tensions but in reality were a fine display of sea skills he had never caught the habit of tobacco but knew that it gave renzi satisfaction and murmured something appropriate were right lucky t take the barque he said patch had been considerably mollified and was now warily respectful of kydd just so said renzi gazing at the spreading red display astern yet i believe our captain must be much relieved aye we could not have taken a real pepperin from such a one kydd raised his voice against a sudden burst of laughter from the others enjoying the evening on deck renzi smiled a captain of a vessel charged with despatches endangers his vessel at his peril but his bold actions may be accounted necessary with shoals under his lee and the enemy to weather doud says as hes a hellfire jack an sent into seaflower for the gettin of prizes fr the admiral kydd said possibly but a humble cutter maidofallwork but did not david prevail over the disdainful goliath kydd grinned youve done well for yourself my friend who would have thought it a quartermaster and so quick only a cutter is all kydd said but his voice was warm to direct the conn of a ship of war was a real achievement for any seaman letting the fragrance of his tobacco wreathe about him renzi mused tom have you given thought to your future kydd looked up surprised future why its here inseaflowero course he stopped work and stared at the horizon then turned to renzi if you mean t better myself then y understand im now a quartermaster an as high as i cn go any higher needs an admiralty warrant an i dont have the interest t get me one he had spoken without bitterness next shipll be bigger an after that who knows quartermaster o some shipotheline will do me right well his broad smile lit up his face as he added y cant work to windard o fate so my feelin is be happy with what i have renzi persisted captain cook was an able seaman to begin with my friend and admiral benbow kydds voice softened in respect aye but theyre great men an i you sees mr cole the boatswain is a mason doggo whispered looking around fearfully the midshipman opened his eyes wide and leaned forward the better to hear it was hard on young cole the only midshipman aboard and no highspirited friends to share his lot but he was a seriousminded lad who wanted to excel in the kings service i have a greatuncle a freemason too he said in a slightly awed voice do yez good ter get the bosun an you like this doggo held two fingers together an hell put in a powerful good word fer you t the captain cole nodded gravely i see that but how well the masons have this secret sign wot they use to signal ter each other doggo looked furtively around the sunlit deck like this he said and held up his open hand to his face thumb to nose and the fingers all spread out awkwardly cole imitated him doggo pulled his hand down roughly not now someonell see now mark what i say its terrible important yez do it the right way or ell think yer mockin the masons blinking in concentration cole listened yez waggles yer fingers like so an then yer waits fr its the proper thing fer masons to then prtend ter be in a rage just sos nobody cn accuse em of being partial to their own kind doggo paused to allow it to be digested an then mark me well if y please yer waits fer the show ter blow over an thats when y makes yer salute both hands all yer fingers at once later in the watch cole had his chance wheres that idle jackanapes roared the boatswain from the group of men aft preparing to send up a fairweather topgallant sail lay aft this instant y lubberly sod cole sauntered aft with a confident smile merrick drew breath for a terrible blast but cole boldly looked him in the eye and made the first sign the boatswain staggered as if struck god rot m bones you bloody dog damn your impertinence so help me i merrick paused for control the enormity of it all robbing him of breath in the appalled silence the seamen looked at each other with horror and mirth in equal proportion cole saw that this was time for the salute and bravely brought up both hands and waggled smartly the boatswains eyes bulged and his hands clawed the empty air when the explosion came it was very terrible jarman looked at kydd speculatively his cabin was tinythere was not really room for two people but there was nowhere else to speak in private kydd he said and paused as if reluctant to go on kydd waited patiently kydd im the sailing master n youre m quartermaster this did not need an answer jarman levelled his gaze what im asayin is not fr other ears dye know what i mean kydd shifted uncomfortably if jarman was sounding him out over some spat with another he wanted no part of it seeming to sense his unease jarman hastened to explain jus a precaution y understands nothin t worry of he said no harm keepin an eye t weather like kydd maintained a wary silence the master picked up a book of navigation tables i been to sea since i was a kitling an ended up mate in an indiaman i know the sea ye unnerstands t get to be master o seafloweri has to be examined by th brothers of trinity house fr this rate o vessel a tough haul kydd wondered where it was all leading he had no problem with the masters competence but then remembered the reserve between him and the captain was he feeling insecure needing kydds approval surely not jarmans voice dropped kydd strained to hear against the hiss of sea against the outside of the hull its like this an please hear me out th capn an please t know i mean no disrespect is a young man an did all his time in a vessel o size never in a small un y knows that in a big ship ye can make all the blunders y like an theres always someone to bring y up with a round turn but a small hooker kydd kept his face blank this might be the first step on the way to a courtmartial for mutiny as i said youre my quartermaster an directly responsible t me this looked grave was jarman trying to secure loyalty to himself consider if y please the capn an me are the only ones aboard that cn figure our position th bosun never learned now i could say as how im a mort disturbed about we bein carried off b the fever but id be lying see this is m first ship as master an anything goes awry then itll be me t blame i dont see as how i should give best if it comes t an argyment over the workings farrell as captain had a duty to seek the sailing masters advice only and could entirely overrule him jarman wanted a witness but what possible use was kydd so id take it kindly if ye could jus think about if youd like to learn how to do the figurin yrself kydd sat back in disbelief but he quickly responded it was a great opportunity not the slightest use in his position but id like it main well mr jarman he said but how will i learn jarman eased into a smile dont ye worry in the merchant service we has no truck wi piearsesquared an all that no time he tapped the book of tables its all there ye just takes yr sights an looks it up i learned it all in a short whiles only farrell nodded approval when jarman brought it up at seven bells if you think it proper mr jarman therefore at noon on the quarterdeck of seaflowercouldbe seen the amazing sight of the captain the master the midshipman and kydd preparing to take the noon altitude midshipman cole as usual borrowed farrells gleaming black and brass sextant while kydd gingerly took the worn octant wielded respectfully by jarman afterwards the master as was his duty took cole aside to examine his reckoning and drill him in the essentials kydd hovered to listen now every point of half th surface of the earth is projected frm the centre on to a tangent plane at some point calld its point o contact but th plane o the equator when projected frm the centre on to a tangent plane itself becomes a straight line while the worried cole tried to commit the words jarman turned to kydd now what we have there is a great circle nobody sails a great circle we only steer straight or th quartermasterothewatch would be vexed what we really does is alter course a mort the same way once in a watch or so an that way we cn approximate yr circle there was more and unavoidably it needed books renzi took an immediate interest to snatch meaning from the celestial orb to gather intelligence of our mortal striving from heavenly bodies of unimaginable distance and splendour now that is in pursuit of a philosophy so sublime with hispaniola to larboard they took a southeasterly slant across the width of the caribbean the trade winds comfortably abeam and in accordance with kydds shaky workings shadowing the real ones raised the island of st lucia and its passage through to the open atlantic ocean the windward island of barbados lay beyond kydds shipmates accepted his privileged treatment with respect he was one of their own daring to reach for the one thing that set officers apart from seamen it was a rare but not unknown thing for a foremast hand to take part in the noon reckoning although in the usual way all officers results were brought together for consensus while those of lesser beings were ignored the ruleofthumb principles used in the real world informed by jarmans utilitarian merchant service experience kydd absorbed readily enough it was really only the looking up of tables what was more difficult was the bodily technique of using the heavy old octant to shoot the sun against the exuberance of sealowerssea motion a combination of tucking in the left elbow lowering the body to make the legs a pair of damping springs and leaning into it and kydd soon had the sun neatly brought down to the horizon with a sure swing of the arm the underpinning of mathematics was beyond him though renzi had the sense to refrain from pressing the issue there would be time and more in the lazy dogwatches to make intellectual discoveries and kydd would benefit by the more relaxed explorations besides which it was only the hapless cole who was under pressure he would take his qualifying examination for lieutenant within the year off cape moule to the south of the island the boatswain shielded his eyes from the glare of the sun on the calm blue seas the wind had dropped to a fluky zephyr have ye news of st lucia sir he asked the island changed hands with the regularity of a clock and the green and brown slopes could now be hostile territory around the point an enemy cruiser lurking farrell grunted swinging his glass in a wide sweep over the hummocky island across the glittering sea of the passage to the massive dark grey island of st vincent just fifteen miles to the south i dont think it signifies he said finally we will be past and gone shortly in the light airs seaflowerrippled ahead towards an offshore island and then the open sea kydd watched the course carefully the tiny breeze was dropping and their progress slowed the big foresail shivered and flapped and the bow began to fall away watch y head he growled to the man at the tiller cant old er the pigtailed seaman grunted his thigh stolidly pressuring the tiller hard over we lost steerage way sir kydd told farrell with the wind so light the heat clamped in a clammy allpervasive breathlessness seaflowerssails hung lifeless idle movements in the odd catspaw of breeze blocks clacked against the mast aimlessly and running rigging sagged kydd looked over the side without a wake the sea was glassy clear and he could see deep down into the bluegreen immensity sunlight shafting down in cathedrallike coruscations jarman broke the dull silence we have a contrary current hereabouts sir he said heavily seaflowerlay motionless in the calm but the whole body of water was pressing inexorably into the caribbean carrying the vessel slowly but surely back whence she came t would be one n a half two knots that was the speed of a man walking and even within the short time they had lain becalmed they had slid back significantly against the land a bare hour later they were back at the point where they had begun their passage a few welcome puffs shook out the sails died then picked up again a tiny chuckle of water at her forefoot and seaflowerresumed her course heading once more for the offshore islet once more the fluky wind betrayed them and they were carried back again t the south asked the boatswain no said jarman moodily watching the coast slip back cant beat to weather in this an if we goes south we have t claw back t barbados after unspoken was the knowledge that a french lookout post might be telegraphing their presence even now to port castries and any manowar that lay there any improvement in the wind later could bring a voracious enemy with it a darkling shadow moving on the seas surface reached seaflowerand the welcome coolness of a breeze touched kydds face and stayed constant again the cutter moved into the passage but this time the land slipped by until they had made the open ocean and were set to pass the little islet i believe we may now bear away for barbados farrell said with satisfaction but his words were overlaid by an urgent shout from the crosstrees saaailhoooothere was no need for a bearing by chance occluded by the islet at the same rate as their advance the sails of a squarerigger slid into view heading to cross their path brigowar snarled merrick there would be little chance against such a vessel and with the wind gathering the further they made the open sea it favoured the larger craft farrells telescope went up and steadied i think not mr merrick to quarters this minute but the merchant brig was not ready for a fight and struck immediately to the savage delight of seaflowers company they entered bridgetown with a prize in tow sweet medicine indeed to muted grumbles seaflowerwas ordered to sea immediately the niceties of adjudicating shares in prize money between the admiral whose flag seaflowerwore and the admiral in whose waters the capture took place would have to be resolved before the sailors saw any and in any case the vice admiralty court would have to sit first as they put to sea again after storing busy calculations were taking place in a hypothetical but blissful review of personal wealth merchantmen so we don see head money petit grumbled farthing pulled up a cask to sit on an gun money neither kydd arrived down the hatchway and joined in yere forgettin that a merchant packet has cargo thats t be included y loobies gun money and head money were inducements to take on an enemy manowar but the value of a merchantship cargo would normally far exceed it he paused for effect dye know we return to port royal but if we fall in wi the corbeauprivateer were t take her as a privateer counted as neither a merchant ship nor a manowar there was no realprofit in an action and even if they did encounter her a privateer was crammed with men and would make a fierce opponent could never meet up wi her y never knows kydd said cheerfully collecting his rain slick and going back on deck it was a maddening combination of sun and sheeting rain and farrell would be on deck shortly to set the course seaflowernow sported a pair of chase guns in her bow and carriage guns at that instead of the swivels of before admittedly they were fourpounders only but a threeinch ball slamming in across the quarterdeck could cause real discomfiture in a quarry stirk was eager to try them but they were crammed in the triangle of bow forward of the windlass and the bowsprit beside his gun crews could not rely on the usual recoil to bring the gun inboard for loading they must reload by leaning outside exposing themselves to enemy sharpshooters know anythin about this corbeaukydd asked stirk he straightened from his gun and wiped his mouth patch says as how shes a schooner not yer squiddy trader but a big bastard eight ports a side guess at least sixpounders hunnerd men who knows farrell appearing on deck put an end to the speculation mr jarman be so good as to shape course northabout st lucia northabout sir repeated jarman in puzzlement please said farrell with some asperity hes chasin the privateer cos hes worried she wont find us croaked the helmsman out of the side of his mouth northabout would place them between st lucia and the large island of martinique a favourite stalking ground for the more lawless afloat they reached the southern end of martinique in the midst of another rain squall curtains of white advancing over the sea under low grey skies the wind suddenly blustery and fitful while it passed afterwards there were the usual wet and shining decks as they emerged into bright sunlight but crossing their path directly ahead was a schooner a big vessel one that could well mount sixteen guns and carry a hundred men she instantly put up her helm and went about slashing directly towards seafloweras if expecting her presence her foreandaft rig robbing the navy craft of the best advantage her superior manoeuvrability hard a larbd farrell cracked out they were sheering off not to retreat but to gain time the schooner followed downwind in their wake her two lofty masts allowing nearly twice the sail of seaflower there would be no stately prelude to war no pretence at false colours the two antagonists would throw themselves at each other without pause or pity aboard seaflowerthere was no fife and drummer sounding hearts of oak no hammocks in the nettings no marines drawn up on the poop instead there were men running to whip off the lead aprons from gunlocks and gun equipment was rushed up from below rammers handspikes crows match tubs tompions protecting the bore of the cannon were snatched away and seaflowers full deck of sixpounders were run out farrell waited then turned seafloweron her pursuer right around she swung her broadside crashed out into the teeth of her foe the smoke swifdy carried away downwind leaving a clear field of fire for her chase guns which cracked out viciously in a double fire first blood to seaflowerthought kydd exultantly as he centred the tiller it was however a new and unpleasant experience standing unmoving at the helm knowing that he was certainly a target for unknown marksmen on the schooner he glanced at the vessel there were now holes in her sails but no lasting damage that he could see seaflowercompleted her turn her other side of guns coming to bear but the schooner was already surging round to bring her own guns on target the two ships opened up almost simultaneously kydd heard the savage tearing passage of cannon balls and was momentarily staggered by the displaced wind of a near miss through his feet he felt the bodily thud of a shot in the hull the sound of its strike a crunch as of a giant axe in wood the smoke cleared the schooner certainly the corbeauwas racing along on the opposite tack to seaflowerher outer jib flapping free where the sheets must have been shot away her decks were crowded with men farrell reacted instantly hard astarbd he ordered they would stay about and parallel the schooner but corbeauwas there out to windward she had the weather gauge she could dictate the terms of the fight firing was now general guns banging up and down the deck smothering gunsmoke blown down on them obscuring points of aim seafiowersown guns were served with a manic ferocity its a poundin match shouted the boatswain to farrell better that than let those murdering knaves board us farrell replied coolly lifting his telescope once more kydd could see little of corbeaua few hundred yards to weather but could feel the injury she was doing to seaflowerhe worried about renzi guncaptain of one of the forward sixpounders if it came to repelling boarders he would be with the first of the defenders probably going down under the weight of greater numbers but if a sudden shudder and simultaneous twanging from close by made kydd grip the tiller convulsively the cause was ahead of him there the weather running backstay had taken a ball and was now unstranding in a frenzied whirl kydd instantly threw the helm hard over sending seaflowerdown before the wind farrell saw what had happened and rapped out orders to ease away sheets to conform to the change in direction the running backstays were vital sinews in taking the prodigious strain of seaflowersoversize mainsail without which the mainmast would certainly carry away with the asymmetric forces playing on it the stay now had some relief but for how long mr merrick but the boatswain was already calling for a rigging stopper shading his eyes and gazing up to where the final strand was giving way the lower part of the stay fell its blocks clattering to the deck leaving the upper length to stream freely to leeward corbeau had been caught unawares but now fell in astern in pursuit the sudden silence of the guns from her bowon angle allowing the victorious yelling of the enemy seamen to come clearly across the water the fighting stopper a tackle with two tails would be applied to each side of seaflower wound drawing the stay together again to be tautened by heaving on the tackle but so high was the wound that someone would have to climb to the ratlines in the face of the storm of shot and musketry merrick took the hank of rope and blocks the lengths of seizing and without pausing draped them around his neck and swung up into the shrouds sir jarman was pointing to the little islet not a quarter of a mile ahead he seemed to be suggesting some sort of hideandseek around the island farrell stroked his chin one hand forward he said common prudence with coral about and well keep in with the island until we are to leeward then kydd eased the tiller snatching a glance astern the schooner thankfully had no chase guns but she was clapping on every stitch of sail and was gradually closing on seaflower jarman went forward with the lookout staring intently into the water ahead and indicated to kydd with his arm where they should go musket balls occasionally hissed past and one slapped into the transom but the real danger would be when corbeaureached and overhauled them with the size of her crew aroused to an ugly pitch the privateer would be merciless kydd clamped his eyes on jarman they were up to the island and now began to round its undistinguished tip the schooner must have sensed their desperation for she continued to crowd on sail her crew clearly visible on her focsle the glitter of edged weapons catching the sun as they waved them triumphantly shes slowing farrells incredulous gasp came shes shes taken the ground corbeausashore kydd snatched a look over his shoulder corbeauwas untouched motionless on the course she had taken she had misjudged the offshore reefs and her deeper keel had become firmly wedged among the coral heads seaflowercurved round but corbeaulay unmoving god be praised we get t live another day muttered a voice an angry shout sounded from above merrick had passed the seizing on the upper length of the stay and was demanding the rest to be hauled up to him they had the luxury of dowsing sail while the operation was completed corbeauadiminishing image in the distance the jury stay rigged they could then beat a dignified retreat ready about ordered farrell we finish the job he said firmly they carefully returned on a track that kept the bow of the schooner towards them he hailed stirk grape seaflowershortened sail to glide in within a hundred yards then put up the helm and let go the stream anchor forward and kedge anchor aft they came to a standstill but were now in a position to adjust cables to aim her entire broadside to bear on the unprotected length of the big schooner with terrible deliberation stirk went from one gun to the next sighting carefully and touching off an unstoppable blast of mankilling grapeshot into the hapless vessel it took until the third gun before activity was seen in the corbeau they were launching their longboat that will do stirk farrell called kydd was struck with farrells humanity in allowing the enemy to abandon ship without unnecessary killing and felt ashamed of his own bloodlust give y joy on yr prize sir jarman said with considerable respect renzi seaflowerscaptain ordered the longboat do ye take possession of our prize grinning kydd watched renzi climb into the longboat with his crew but they were only halfway across when the first wisps of smoke arose the boats crew lay on their oars and watched blue smoke bursting into flame as tarry ropes caught spreading the consuming blaze to the upper rigging a crackling bursting firestorm turned the schooner into an inferno the shape of her hull only just perceptible in the flames the climax came when first her foremast and then her main crashed down in a gout of sparks and the rapidly charring ruin forlornly settled to the reef corbeaus crew watched silently lined along the shoreline they were still there when seaflower brought her longboat aboard and sailed away barbados asked jarman they had been cut about it stood to reason they refit the beady eyes of snead the carpenters mate announced his presence on deck sir he said touching his shapeless felt hat weve taken a ball in midships an takin in water the clinker build of seaflowers hull was proving its worth the strake where the ball had entered would need replacing but the rest were sound how bad farrell asked can swim awhiles said snead but she cant take a blow dockyard said merrick snead looked at him and nodded jarman turned to farrell antego he said without hesitation antigua a couple of days only thank the lord said farrell but kydd flinched of all places chapter english harbour shimmered under the noonday heat it was quite the same as kydd remembered the beauty the rank effluvia the calm solidity of spacious stone buildings here it was that he had nearly ended his existence on earth here it was seaflowercame to anchor a few hundred yards off there were hardly any ships in harbour only a small sloop alongside at the capstan house without her upper masts signal flags mounted seaflowersmain topgallant peak kydd knew what they were asking and determined to be elsewhere when caird came aboard for his survey uncaring of the still clammy heat building below decks in the absence of a clean seabreeze the boatswain ordered the platforms in the crew space overlaying the hold taken up kydd as quartermaster had the task of restowing their stores firkins of butter barrels of salt beef hogsheads of water over to one side of seaflower in order that the damaged strake could be lifted clear for repair when the master shipwright made his survey unaccountably the cutters quartermaster was not free to accompany him but from his busy job shuffling the masters charts kydd was able to hear through the skylight a strake twixt wind and water a trifling matter came cairds voice as we have so few to care for at this time my party will attend on you presently indistinct words came from farrell and caird replied no i do not believe that is necessary our riggers will perform the task we have skilled hands among the kings negroes youll find a bumping on the hull told kydd that the dockyard boat was putting off he waited a little before coming on deck the shipwrights punt would be making its way out soon and there were some he would welcome to see again but in no circumstances would he venture ashore farrell did not go ashore either curiously kydd saw him in the shade of the after awning his attention seeming to be on the nondescript sloop tied up off the capstan house farthing said quietly old ships thats patelle its frm her that he got his step capn o seaflower a distant boom sounded kydd looked automatically to shirley heights the army post high up on the point smoke eddied away strange sail had apparently been sighted far out to sea signal flags appeared and were answered in the dockyard minutes later a boat under sail left the shore and headed directly for them kydd hoped that it wasnt a french squadron out there english harbour was particularly helpless now with only one warship their own available to meet them four strange sail sighted hailed a seaman in the boat an patelle unable ter shift farrell stiffened secure the vessel mr merrick he rapped do you and mr jarman remain aboard i am going ashore stirk you and kydd attend on me in the longboat reappearing in full uniform farrell saw kydd and stirk in their comfortable loose shirts and snapped jackets at the least please they tumbled down the hatchway and kydd grabbed at his blue jacket with the brass buttons that marked him a petty officer what dye think toby kydd asked slipping it on dunno stirk said flady and they bounded up the ladderway farrell took the tiller and they rapidly pulled ashore the bowman hooking on at the stone steps while they landed it was close by the admirals house but the absence of the appropriate flag showed it had no occupant mounting the steps in a hurry farrell bumped into a clerk who is the senior officer eyebrows lifting in astonishment the clerk replied the commissioner is with captain mingley in st johns at the moment sir then sir who is in command may i ask the clerk paused as if to take his measure sir in the absence of captain mingley that would necessarily be the senior officer afloat is captain fox still with the patelle he is at st johns at the same courtmartial then who is in command patelleis under the temporary command of one of her lieutenants farrell followed by the clerk entered an anteroom on the ground floor and glanced about i shall set up headquarters here desire the shirley heights garrison to send an officer to attend me here for an immediate councilofwar the clerk looked affronted but at stirks grim look quickly left a sergeant of marines shortly appeared and gave a crashing salute sah with his local knowledge kydd helped to pull things together and within the hour a captain of the royal scots fusiliers was in respectful attendance meanwhile farrell had the marine messenger busy with orders to the officer commanding shirley heights it would be of some service to me should you see fit to begin heating shot as of this moment guns mounted on the commanding heights above the harbour could send redhot shot among invading ships my compliments to the commander of patelleand he is to send her longboat mounted with a swivel to lie at grapnel in the entrance to the harbour there was a small number of marines less the usual number of sick but the army was in some strength in forts at shirley heights and blockhouse hill barracks at monks hill and the ridge held an unknown number of soldiers depending on how many had fallen victims to the yellow fever would it be enough sah yes sergeant farrell looked up from his desk the man looked ill at ease farrell frowned what is it man sah yes said farrell impatiently get on with it sah lieutenant powell o the patelle says er ltenant powell tol me that es unable ter comply with yr orders sah farrell rocked back in his chair do i understand you to say that lieutenant powell is unable to send his ships boat out the sergeant hesitated er its like this sah ltenant powell says as ow he er dont recognise yer orders like everyone in the room froze the dockyard clock ticked heavily where is the officer now farrell asked finally the sergeant still rigidly at attention said tightly dont rightly know sah farrell opened his mouth but kydd broke in you mean t say hes in the capstan house do ye not the sergeants eyes swivelled to kydd could be kydd went on carefully sir seems th ltenant is enjoyin an evenin jug didnt quite understan yr orders farrell gave a wintry smile as it happens i know mr powell the smile vanished send word to the master of patelle that lieutenant powell is to be confined to his cabin immediately the sergeant saluted and left hastily stirk looked meaningfully at kydd but said nothing another languid sunset was on its way but there was tension in the air have my orders been carried out farrell demanded the unknown four sail at last sighting were lying becalmed fifteen miles away the focus of attention was now narrowing to this vexing insubordination oil outside the sergeant of marines beckoned furiously to kydd yer ltenant powell y knows about im an farrell no said kydd guardedly the sergeant pursed his lips well see they was both lootenants in patelletgether but hated each others guts somethin wicked now i got a bad feelin about this i has goin to end in no good atall fer anyone kydd looked at the sergeant intently is powell confind no see its the sailin master hes bin drinkin with he added an now well yer jack tars are gettin upset at their capn being taken in charge like an one of the dockyard men approached with a strange expression yed better give this t yer officer lads he said holding out a document kydd took it it was written orders for the disposition of soldiers to the dockyard and it was signed powell lieutenant royal navy senior officer of ships in english harbour for the time being sergeant shouted farrell from inside has lieutenant powell been confined in accordance with my orders kydd entered and touched his hat to farrell no sir an i think you should see this farrell read it and stood his face white sir he said to the army captain you will oblige me by taking a file of six soldiers and placing lieutenant powell under arrest the captain barely managing a salute collected his shako and made to leave and kydd added farrell please to accompany him in the event he goes aboard a ship outside in the gathering dusk kydd watched while the army officer formed the men into line then had them crashing to an order arms then shoulder arms the word was getting out and figures were beginning to emerge from buildings to line the roadway into file right tuuurrn by the right quick maaarrrch kydd fell in behind the officer but felt a fool tagging along behind the quickstepping soldiers the little party wound along the roadway kydd feeling every eye on him chattering died away as they approached they turned the final corner to the flat coralstone area between the capstan house and the ship alongside spectators crowded around the capstan house but the space was left clear as though it were an arena for some future duel along the deckline of patelle her ships company crowded and there was an ugly buzz of talk shot through with angry shouts partyyyy halt the redcoats clashed to a standstill there were two gangways from patelle to the stone landing one forward for the men one aft for the officers kydd indicated the after brow to the army captain but before he could proceed a man who looked very like a boatswain stormed down in hot confrontation damn yr blood but i know why yere here he said and ye cant have him behind him hostile eyes glared in the sombre gloom lanthorns were brought and hooked into the rigging their light casting a theatrical glow over events in the name of his majesty i order you to yield the person furious but indistinct shouting sounded from inboard it brought an immediate answering roar from the seamen on deck and a sudden burst of activity fall back on the redcoats the army officer said breathlessly to kydd and hurried to stand next to the stolid file of soldiers from the forward brow the ships company of patellepoured forth armed with boarding weapons naked cutlasses boarding pikes and tomahawks kydd stood firm but a feral terror of the pack dug into his mind as the angry seamen surged about them bystanders scattered then formed a cautious semicircle around the fray by a trick of the light kydd caught sight of juba in the crowd of onlookers motionless arms folded he wondered for a moment if he should appeal for help then thought of what it might mean if he were denied the seamen surrounded the party and began jostling thumping with the heel of their cutlasses hoarse cries urging the soldiers to run away one toppled forward under a blow the army officer swung round and ordered shrilly load with ball at the cry the crowd began to scatter in disorder the sailors spread out and hefted their weapons if the soldiers opened fire they would be instantly set upon but kydd knew that the soldiers would do their duty without question the end was therefore inevitable and the shouts and cries died away into a breathless silence as all waited for the final spark distantly the sound of the measured tramp of menatarms sounded it swelled and a column of marines appeared at its head was farrell in full uniform the men came to a halt and farrell strode purposefully to the centre where is lieutenant powell he demanded the sailors fell back unsure if by that you mean your superior officer i am here came a strong resonant voice at the head of the brow a short but wellbuilt man in loose shirt and breeches came down his face was robust but lined the marks of hard drinking on him as the two men met the others fell back you have your orders sir why do you not comply farrell snapped because because you know well enough damn you charles farrells tone hardened you are under arrest poppycock you know as well as the whole world that you are junior on the lieutenants list to me and therefore i am your superior officer powell squared away and now you do take my orders or kydd was appalled by the immutable rule of the navy the lieutenant whose date of commission was even a day earlier was automatically the senior officer it even applied to admirals and powells claim appeared to be legitimate farrells eyes flicked to the mass of silent seamen powell caught the look and snarled i have only to say the word and these good men will sweep away your youd shed good blood in such a cause farrell exclaimed in astonishment then stiffened i am your superior officer because i hold the kings commission as commander of a kings ship you are acting commander only now are you prepared to obey orders powell folded his arms no you are in contempt of naval law sir kydd tensed all it needed was for powell to shout an order and the stones would be drenched in blood farrell did not pause your pistol sir he asked of the army officer never taking his eyes from powell the captain fumbled at his slung leather pouch and handed over the heavy weapon farrell took the pistol and cocked it aiming at the ground do you now comply with my orders sir he asked in an icy monotone if you seek to affright me sir you have failed the pistol came up the dark cavity of the muzzle directly on powells chest for the final time sir lieutenant powell do you accept my authority and obey my orders in peril of your life both men stood rigid you wouldnt fire charles that would be sir demanded farrell in a steely hiss since you ask no the pistol blasted out the ball taking powell squarely in the chest a sudden crash of sound in the awful stillness it filled the air with a hanging cloud of gunsmoke and flung powell back in a limp huddle nobody moved all held motionless by the horror of the moment farrell lowered the pistol he turned to the army captain sir i surrender myself to you as senior officer and consider myself under open arrest the soldiers hands were shaking as he tried to make deprecating gestures farrells face was set controlled i do demand a courtmartial on my conduct at the earliest moment seaflowerdid not rate a coxswain and captain farrell chose kydd as his personal attendant in his subsequent trial in st johns kydd was thus witness to the solemn spectacle of a courtmartial and was present as his captain returned to the room to see his sword on the table hilt towards the court had unanimously ruled that farrells conduct was justifiable in the face of lieutenant powells actions which amounted to mutiny and lieutenant farrell was most honourably acquitted an when the president o the court says the words his face didnt change one whit said kydd to the throng in the crew space jus bows n thanks em all cool as you please he had been impressed by farrells bearing his calm replies to barely disguised needling about his earlier relationship with powell as lieutenants in the same ship and equally his return to seaflower in his place kydd thought that he would perhaps have celebrated a trifle but that was not farrells way without delay they put to sea newly repaired and bound for port royal as kydd pulled out the charts to exercise plotting a route jarman smiled and said well hows yr danish then taken aback kydd didnt know what to say jarman tapped at the chart first island you comes to after weatherin st kitts he said st croy danish these forty years very peaceable but capn wants t call on em fr some reason there was a growing friendliness between them and kydd benefited in the learning of his sea craft jarmans plainthinking explanations were the rock on which he was able later to elaborate the whys from the hows and give body to his knowledge it touched kydds imagination this reduction to human understanding of the inscrutable vast restlessness that was the sea to be able to bring a world into compass on a single chart the legendary sights he had seen on foreign shores all rendered tactile and biddable to the will of man when i learned m figurin it was always the three ls lead latitude n lookout an no more jarman told him an that is not t say they should be cast aside these modern times but now we just adds a fourth longitude longitude the deep respect jarman accorded the two chronometers gave kydd a feeling for what a fearsome thing sea life must once have been no sure knowledge of their place in the trackless wastes of ocean a starless night a rocky coast and it might be sudden death in the darkness the gleaming brass and enamel devices were a true miracle of mans achieving now when it became local noon and the suns altitude was taken he knew for a certainty that in guildford if he could transport there instantly the big old clock overhanging the high street would be solemnly showing four oclock in the afternoon they raised the island of st croix late in the afternoon a low grassy seaside so much like parts of cornwall as to be astonishing this transformed into the usual lush rainforests further along but the helm was put up and they came to anchor to seaward of an island to the northeast we approach christiansted in the full light o day farrell said it was prudent the danes were a proud nation and touchy of their honour they were neutral but could throw in their lot with the jacobins at any time they lay offshore to seaward out of sight of the main island and snugged down for the night the sunsets golden tendrils faded to a deep blue and then soft darkness and without a moon the stars glittered fat and tremulous after supper kydd and his shipmates repaired to the upper deck with their grog making the most of their unaccustomed inactivity kydd settled next to renzi who was enjoying a pipe of tobacco and stirk sat on the mainhatch amazin that stirk mused the black calm sea stretched into impenetrable darkness on each side but the slap and chuckle of water around seaflowerscable was soothing to a sailor puts me in mind o mounts bay stirk went on not as id want ter be reminded why so someone asked stirk sat back against the mainmast and ruminated cos o what happened while i wuz there he said finally what was that cuffin the voice persisted well mates if yer wants to know the full story i warns yer its a tough yarn but i tell yer its as true as yr mainstay is moused stirk teased cast loose yer tongue matey an invisible voice urged spread more sail another said luke scuttled up and squatted under stirks feet agog to hear the yarn right ill fill and stand on stirk agreed when i was a younker i was in another trade he began kydd hid a smile reglar run frm st marlow ter penzance in brandy had a shipmate aboard name o cornish jack livd nearby now he was a right frolicsome cove always in wi the ladies an he snares a real spruce filly kitty tresnack she wuz called trouble is shes married see to old man tresnack oo owns a sizeable tin mine didnt stop em hed step off soon as he knew ow back aboard last minute n all the time off in the hills wi this kitty stirk gave a snort that some might have interpreted as disapproval he comes back aboard jus as were about t sail but theres noos seems old man tresnack goes down wi a fever n dies real quick so cornish jack cant wait t get back n marry kitty but when we does make port agen he finds is intended in clink arrested fer murder of er usband they as the trial an shes found guilty sentenced ter ang cornish jack cant believe it e sleeps outside the prison walls till the day shes due ter be choked off he asks permission to go with er to the scaffold they agrees an on th day he goes up ter the gallows oldin er and and when its time e clutches er tight the rope goes around er neck an she asks im solemnlike you will jack gets uneasy but says i will she then goes calm and its all over fer er stirk paused for effect and continued after that kittys ghost wuz seen twice three times or more on the road btween penzance an hayle an cornish jacks a changed man goes pale n thin never laughs terrible change if y knew im at th tavern e was eard ter say she gives me no peace follers me everywhere we all knows oo she is just a year after this cornish jack was back at sea wi us an in the focsle he then finally tells what it was they said on th gallows she made me swear that on this day one year more at midnight id marry er see not bein able to get wed in th flesh she would in th spirit an thats where it gets right scareful we bein in our ammocks n jawin together it all goes quiet like thats when we ear these sharp small steps on the deckhead comin frm forrard he goes white as chalk an gets th trembles they stops right above where jack as his ammock his face goes mad wi terror but he drops ter th deck and makes is way topsides we rushes t follow but jus in time ter see im leg it over th bulwark ter throw imself in th sea stirk took a deep breath and said in a low voice we catches only a couple o white faces in them black waves so elp me an then es gone the long silence following was stirks satisfying reward from seaward christiansted turned out to be a cosy settled piece of denmark in the caribbean all creamcoloured buildings with red roofs before lofty hills inland at the sight of seaflowers ensign a warning gun thumped from fort christiansvaern marked on the chart as in want of repair obediently seaflower rounded to let go her anchor outside the reef and awaited the boat putting off from the town the danish officer boarded quickly his glance taking in the clean lines neatness and loving detail that only a sailors pride in his ship could evoke lojtnant holbaek the man said in crisp military tones hisred tasselled blue uniform looked odd on the deck of a royal navy cutter farrell advanced with outstretched hand welcome aboard his majestys cutter seaflower er loytnant he said holbaek shook hands turning meaningfully to jarman farrell said loudly loytnant holbaek takes back to christiansted the best wishes of his britannic majesty for prosperity and peace and our hopes that the jacobin upstarts will soon be swept from the seas mange tak kommandor thenk yo holbaek said with a clicking of heels he seemed to brisde a little under the curious stares of sealowers sailors an my packet of course farrell handed over the sealed package which holbaek quickly slipped inside his uniform the dour officer did not seem inclined to linger so farrell handed him over the side with profuse expressions of regard and the boat pushed off now we shall proceed course for port royal mr jarman crusty bugger was stiles judgement he had been invited in with the petty officers notwithstanding that as boatswains mate his was probably the least popular job aboard so far there had been no call on his services with the catoninetails a tribute to the sense of harmony that farrell was achieving the noon meal was well under way rum sweet in the glass the morning exercise at the after sixpounders had been particularly impressive and the light breeze was sending seafloweralong at a relaxed pace the seas with barely a swell or more than a stipple of waves doggo poked his head inside the canvas screen which by nowhad its full quota of mermaids and davy jones painted on it and announced might like ter come topsides could be a bit of a todo brewin on the horizon to windward a tall pillar of smoke hazy and pale with distance rose straight up ship afire said doggo blundy then nodded significantly aft at the captain and merrick in urgent conversation detaching himself farrell called to kydd bear up for that fire kydd ordered the helm over seaflowerobediently turning towards it was dead to windward in the teeth of the light breeze and even with seaflowersforeandaft rig she could lie no closer than four points off the wind before the luff of her sails began shivering and she lost way the deck fell quiet it didnt take much imagination to think of what must be happening in the unknown ship the visceral terror at the flames rampaging the bravery of those on board then mortal despair taking hold jarman reached the deck and quickly took in the scene kydd opened his mouth to comment but jarman held up his hand keenly sensing the wind direction kydd noticed farrell watching him closely as well the vessel would know by now that they had been seen and their hearts would be leaping but all would depend on how speedily they could reach the scene a bridle for bowlines on the topsails may answer sir jarman said at last an kydd will bring her more by th head by restowing jarmans order meant sending a line to the forward part of the square sails to haul them even more flat to the wind and shifting provisions and water barrels towards the bow to deepen the stem to give more bite kyddhastened below grabbing hands for the task which was soon completed on deck he was joined by renzi a nice problem renzi murmured shielding his eyes to make out the approaching details aye said kydd the ship afire was dead into the wind how to get to her to tack towards of course but the problem lay in whether to do short but direct boards and much tacking about or long fast boards with few delays in tacking but considerable distance to each side of the goal given the constant of time necessary to go about jarman compromised on sevenminute legs the breeze was frustratingly light but even so the disastrous tableau came gradually closer every glass available was on the harrowing scene has a sea anchor over th stern yair keeps er poop inter the wind flames dont reach em see it blaze at th mainhatch give er lessn a dogwatch afore she goes up altogether kydd took a telescope and trained it on the smoky ruin the flameshot vessel leaped into sharp focus he could almost hear the devilish roar of the fire the sharp banging and crackling of timbers in hopeless conflagration there were dark figures against the flames jerking and moving but the main body were massed on the as yet untouched after end of the vessel kydd swept the telescope along it was impossible to say which nationality the ship was or even what species it was get th longboat overside urged some seaflowerwas now only a mile off but the wind was so soft and light that the cutter only made a walking pace through the calm waters longboat stand by for launching warned farrell but avast lowering we have to be closer seaflowerwas still just faster than men could row the towering pillar of smoke darkened the whole area tongues of flame an angry wild orange against the smoke as kydd stared at the ruin the stern fell off the wind the line to the seaanchor had given way he whipped up the telescope in sharp detail he saw the after end of the vessel sag away to leeward and the fire leap up triumphantly dark figures fell into the sea as the flames advanced on the poop the calm seas around the stern became agitated flickers of white in dark flurries puzzled him for a moment until he understood survivors in the water were being taken by sharks his hands shook as he held the telescope with a sick horror he saw the remaining figures on the poop hesitating between being burned to death or eaten alive by sharks one by one they toppled into the water or danced insanely before crumpling into a briefly seen dark mass in the flames seaflowrcurved smoothly into the wind and her longboat splashed into the water kydd watched as it pulled towards the hulk now no more than a blackened wreck a dying ember the hideous twitching around the stern was now irregular and the desolate stink of the fire drifted down on them the boat reached the still smoking hull and circled around it returned with a pitiably burned corpse werent none made it sir the bowman said sofdy we cn give em a christian burial like no they stay with their ship they go together tom mate whispered the carpenters mate plucking kydds sleeve come an ave a squiz tweendecks wondering at sneads peculiar air of anxiety kydd followed him down the forehatch below chasing aside seamen at the galley snead lifted the access grating to the forward hold and dropped inside listening intently in the musty gloom satisfied he hauled himself out tell me what y hears he said his lined grey eyes serious kydd let himself down as quartermaster he had the stowage of the hold but that was in port or calm waters now in this increasingly boisterous sea wasnt the time to be rummaging among the big water barrels or tightly tommeddown stores he hunkered down in the cramped space and listened carefully bracing himself against the cutters roll nothing at first but then he heard over the swish of sea on the outside of the hull an intermittent sibilance as quiet and deadly as a snake in time with the roll came a sudden rushing hiss which for a seaman had only one meaning weve sprung a plank somewhere on th waterline takin in water fast snead looked at him peculiarly yair but when i sounds the bilges aint any water what none kydd asked it was peculiar to a degree the rushing hiss returned with every roll and at this rate the water should be at least a foot deep in the lower hold dont like it cully snead grumbled what say you n i as a word wi the capn heard o this happenin to a cargo o rice swells when its wet it does merrick said jarman stroked his jaw nothin stowed below that i knows of like that he said slowly but theres some kind o something thats soaking it up fast no chances we heave down and get at it from the outside farrell said with finality i believe islas engano will answer kydd was relieved a small cutter like seaflowercould easily find an island to beach between tides and get at the hull planking from the outside and in this case the sooner the better they raised the island late in the afternoon because the leak was getting no worse in fact the vessel was still mysteriously dry they anchored in its lee to wait out the night a passing rainsquall spattered and then deluged the decks only the disconsolate lookouts fore and aft remained the rest were snug below in the free discipline of a cutter there would be no pipe down hammocks or other bigship ways and now at anchor was a time when a sailor could relax no fear of an all the haaands to send him on deck no sudden coursechange requiring the vessel to tack about instead the sewing housewife the gleefulness of dice play the scrimshaw the endless letter lanthorns spread a warm golden glow in the crew spaces and the hum of his shipmates conversation was a reassuring backdrop to kydds thoughts renzis musings about his future had awakened possibilities that were unsettling it seemed that renzi believed he was destined for something beyond quartermaster that could only be masters mate which required an admiralty warrant he watched stirk throw a double trey at the dice with a roar of satisfaction did he concern himself with times unknown unforeseeable circumstances himself in twenty years of course not kydd setded back in his hammock and listened to the drumming of rain on the deck above grateful to be dry and warm the rain eased then stopped kydd slipped into drowsiness unperturbed by the noises of his shipmates pastimes and merriment sure of himself and the world he had made his own a soft dawn revealed their island to have a long sandy beach suitable to heave down seaflowerand get at the leak kydd had tried to localise the sound of inrushing water but bafflingly it had died away as they anchored the cutter gently grounded on the sand of the beach and was brought broadside to in the gentle waves snead waited in the longboat while lines were secured to her mast taken to a tackle on a sizeable palm ashore and back to the windlass snead only needed to see the waterline region and it took little effort to achieve the required cant to one side taint this side he called from the boat after going the length of the cutter seaflowerwas laboriously refloated and rotated for a survey of the other side with the same result a perfectly sound hull only one thing left t do kydd muttered they would have to rouse out the entire contents of the hold to put paid to the mystery a long and tedious process starting from forward the first of the stores were brought out and laid against the after end of the crew space kydd saw that the men were well positioned in chain to pass up the provisions and turned to go he was stopped by an incredulous shout god rot me come ere mr kydd hurrying over to the fore hold kydd looked down a seaman was standing and pointing to what he had found in the close stowage of the hold it was a substantialsized cask with its head knocked in and in it was the remains of what it had contained peas dried for stowing a sea of seven hundredweight of hard peas and as the ship rolled the peas had swished from side to side in the smooth barrel sounding exactly like the hiss of inrushing water they made good sailing in clear conditions and secured a morning landfall on the oddlooking island of alto velo off the southernmost point of hispaniola we will take the inside passage i believe mr jarman said farrell inspecting the stretches of low flat land to the north and the peaked dome of alto velo to the south the swell increased as they approached a peculiar angled swell that felt uneasy over to the northwest a serried rank of sharppeaked mountains appeared out of the bright haze whitetopped and distant kydd growled at the helmsman when the seaflowerstopsail fluttered his eyes flicking astern to check her wake it was straight the everreliable trade winds were slowly but surely backing it was not the fault of the helmsman winds backing he called to jarman just so said the sailing master those mountains t weather his mouth clamped tight and he glared generally to windward we have the current in our favour mr jarman farrell said mildly sir the swell angled more and met a southgoing counterpart that had seaflowerwallowing in confused jerking in the cross seas unfriendly green waves slopped and bullied on to her decks sluicing aft to wet farrells shoes they passed through the passage the wind backing so far that seaflowerhad to strike her square sails entirely once through the predominant westerly current and northeasterly winds reasserted themselves and the way was clear for the final run to jamaica but for one thing a brigofwar five miles ahead across their path her two masts foreshortening as she altered course purposefully towards them chapter be damned said merrick as he came up from below and saw the vessel the meeting was most unfortunate having emerged from the island passage seaflower was prevented from going to windward by the lie of the land and to bear away to leeward would favour the bigger canvas a brigsloop could show we put about an return sir jarman asked immediately there was no dishonour to fly before a vessel probably carrying half as many guns again as they farrell turned on him angrily what do you conceive is our duty sir to run at the sight of every strange sail jarman grunted well we clear for action mr merrick farrell ordered seaflower kept on her course westward towards the brig and girded for war all eyes were on their opponent the brig seemed nonplussed at seaflowers aggression and fell off the wind somewhat kydd took the tiller feeling the willing restlessness of the craft and even through his own anxieties he felt for the lovely cutter and what she must suffer soon the enemy brig was longer than they and therefore could array a greater broadside being squarerigged with the ability to back sails she was more manoeuvrable in a clinch seaflowers chance lay in her speed and nimble handling much would depend on kydds steadiness at the helm a gun thudded on the brig and a large battle flag unfurled at her mizzen peak there would be no preliminaries they would grapple and fight and the contest could well be over within the hour the brig yawed to starboard this brought her broadside to bear it thundered out but at more than a mile it was a ragged display balls skipping wide on each side merrick grinned too eager b half a greenhide capn i shouldnt wonder theys sixes and fours n we has all sixes stirk said with satisfaction kydd did not share his confidence they had sixpounders but only eight to a side the brig resumed an easy close haul knowing that seaflowrmust close and endure their wrath before she could swing about and bring her guns on target stirk be so good as to set your pretty ones to work farrell said with a grim smile clambering over gear to the eyes of the ship stirk hunkered down and sighted along the black iron of his fourpounder chase guns they were an older pattern and were not fitted with gunlocks over the priming he held clear a glowing piece of match and when satisfied with his quoin and at the right point in the pitching motion his hand went down and they spoke with a ringing crack kydd stared intently at the brig but stirk scrambled over the heel of the bowsprit to the other chase gun to repeat the exercise while the first was reloaded again the sharp report gunsmoke temporarily obscured her but when it cleared the brig showed in some confusion don know what they wants ter do farthing observed he was behind kydd standing ready if kydd fell in battle the brigs square yards were at odds with each other it looked like someone had shied away from the balls slamming across her decks and had tried to bear away but then a more experienced hand had intervened to send her back it was hard for seaflower to have to wait to come up before they could reply with their own guns told yer its a right green hand there merrick said and looked at farrell ease sheets no need to rush at things the captain said smoothly seaflower slowed and stirk kept up his gunplay the brig yawed and let go another broadside but the little cutters head on profile was much too narrow a target and all it achieved was to give stirk a broader aiming point seaflower tacked about to open the range once more her own broadside crashed out as she spun about a french one not eventuating as they were in the process of reloading stirk resumed his punishment taking time to lay his weapon ifn she had chase guns th same as we merrick reflected abrupdy the brig loosed a broadside then turned away before the wind and retired derisive yells erupted in seaflower the brigs plain stern presented itself as she turned in retreat the shouts became an urging to close and finish the vessel with close raking fire kydd glanced at farrell who was studying the brig through his dollond glass he seemed not to hear the crews jubilation but then spoke to jarman she wishes us to close she is much the bigger we keep our distance as if to add point to his words the brig flew up into the wind and her guns fired some of the balls coming uncomfortably close seaflower took immediate opportunity to slew round and return the compliment in kind if y please sir jarman had the chart i believe she means t round cabo falso an head fr french waters the nearest port he can find there ah thatd be er port des galions small but has a mole fr the sugar trade any fortifications do you think always some kind o unpleasantness at th end o the mole jarman ventured looking at merrick aye sir if she gets inshore o the mole we ave ter give it away i fear merrick said farrell remained pensive the brig was too big to take on directly they were being drawn away from their proper route to jamaica and there was a possibility that a french manowar was lying in port des galions that really did know his business straightening he made up his mind we let stirk have his amusement for a little longer if he brings down a spar we reconsider but if the brig makes port we let her go the rest of the afternoon was spent with periodic banging from the bow in a wash of powder smoke kydd and others spelled the greygrimed and redeyed stirk in his task the considerable swell angled across and seaflowers motion became a complex combination of pitch and roll behind the breech the sighting picture was jerky and swooping and having to use a portfire instead of the instant response of a gunlock and lanyard made the job nearly impossible makin it a mort uncomfortable for em stirk said hoarsely he gulped thirstily at a pannikin of vinegar and water beyond cabo falso the land trended northwest and within less than thirty miles they entered the french waters of san domingo the brigs course then shaped unmistakably for port des galions a faroff thin scatter of buildings amid palm trees and verdure there was no result yet from the chase guns which were now uncomfortably hot and radiated a sullen heat but stirks crews worked on the mole could be made out a low arm extending out to enclose a tiny bay with a sandy spit on the opposite side and no sign of any other vessel within give er best mate said farthing as the brig prepared to enter the little harbour and safety and farrell prepared reluctantly to tack about and retire well give em a salute as we go farrell grunted seaflowerstood on for a space then put her helm up turning for a farewell broadside but it was what the vengeful brig had been waiting for she yawed quickly and at last had the whole length of the cutter in her sights her guns crashed out a storm of shot whistled about seaflowersplintering crashing slapping through sails and ending the life of seaflowers only midshipman cole had cheered with the best of them when the brig had turned tail and his fist had been upraised when a ball took his arm off at the shoulder flinging him across the deck stupefied he tried to raise himself on all fours but failed rolling to one side in his own blood farrell himself winded by the passage of the ball lunged across to the mortally wounded lad and held him gently as the life left him he remained still as seaflowers own guns answered his head fell and when he looked up there was a murderous expression as his eyes followed the brig past the end of the mole to the inner harbour and safety obedient to his last command seaflower headed for the open sea but farrell slowly got to his feet and breathed heavily do you mark my words well make them pay for this day for half a day seaflower sped out to sea farrell pacing thoughtfully at times disappearing below with the sailing master towards evening a plan had been hatched that farrell laid before seaflowers company that afternoon around the mainhatch the port consists of a narrow point of land with a mole on the other side like an arm enclosing a harbour the brig will undoubtedly be alongside the inner face of the mole now it were vain to think of carrying her in a direct assault in the open the longboat can bear but fourteen men this is not sufficient he paused then smiled but we have a chance i mean to borrow a sugar lighter from further up the coast this is how the joggaree the raw lump sugar is carried to the port to be shipped out these are mean and unworthy craft having but one masterly quality they may carry concealed as many stout men as we choose this lighter will approach the entrance but it will be a sad parcel of lubberly rogues who try to bring her in i have no doubt she will run afoul of whatever unfortunate vessel is lying alongside a restless murmuring and then grins broke out followed by hearty chuckles farrell held up his hands for silence we still have a use for the longboat with her fourteen men it is landed before dawn on the far side of the point the boat is dragged over the sandy point and therefore launched inside the harbour where it may fall upon the enemy from a quite unexpected direction this time there was silence it was broken by farthing who shouted an its three cheers fer capn farrell mates one two six an a tigerrr farrells smile of pleasure was unexpectedly boyish it is the custom in the royal navy on hazardous duty to call for volunteers kydd found himself coxswain of stirks longboat and renzi was detailed for the lighter to assist with the french language nearly the whole of seaflowers crew would be involved in the venture but five needed to be held back to keep the cutter at sea i must request mr merrick said farrell that you remain to take the charge of seaflower therefore sir this is monstrous unjust the boatswain protested you do me dishonour im sure mr merrick you will always do your duty in the best traditions of the service the longboat was lowered from seaflowerwhen darkness fell the quartermoon would last for half the night and then would set making it easy for the longboat to see its way to creep in to the seaward side of the point in seaflowerhands were raised in farewell as she made off to the north to find the lighter disappearing silently from view in the subdued moonlight the boat hissed to a stop on the sandy beach fourteen men around the sturdy craft quickly had her up the beach and out of sight in the greenery stirk motioned to them to conceal themselves while he and kydd went forward to reconnoitre it was absolutely quiet a light susurration of breeze gentle and soothing and no sign of human presence on the dry sandy landscape sharply contrasting black shadows on silver light made it hard to pick a way the task was to get the boat over the point and in position to launch just before dawn they chose a low saddle sand with small rocks and little vegetation it was harder than it looked to drag the heavy boat across the small gnarled scrub with feet stubbing on rocks and sand stirks whispered two six heavyyyyybecame monotonous and hypnotic but they made good progress and well before time they were on the other side among the fringing shrubbery near the waters edge and opposite the mole the moon had set in the early hours and it was difficult to make out the dark mass of the brig across the darkling waters but there were the two pinpricks of lanthorn light in the rigging to mark her out they rested waiting for daybreak it was very quiet only the odd night noise from the small town around the curve of the bay the plop and splash of fish muffled curses at the coolness and restless movement from fourteen men a blue edge came to the darkness it would be light soon arriving with tropical swiftness stirk called them together now mates wes got a good chance if we goes in fast an i means fast i want ter see yez stretch out on the oars like yerve never seen an up er side like monkeys wi their arses on fire there was an impatient muttering the men had been picked for the job and were more than ready as the light strengthened features emerged in the clarity of the morning the mole the brig and movement along the length of the mole kydd tried to make out what was happening a trumpet cut into the morning a thin baying at this distance but its significance was undeniable there was a force of soldiers of unknown size on the mole kydd knew that everything had changed he looked to stirk stirks tough expression was set and his voice became grave this is alookin hickey our shipmates is standin into hazard they don know theres sojers awaitin for em he stared across at the soldiers forming up and his jaw hardened were goin ter take em b surprise the crapauds he sighted along the line of beach a couple of small fishing boats were drawn up nearby but otherwise it was clear along to the town a mile or so away we pelts along through th town and takes em from th inside wont know what hits em an thisll make em take their eyes off of the capn while he cuts out th brig he glared around the group of seamen as if daring comment kydd could see the peril that farrell would face coming out of the dawn to find too late the soldiers ready to fall on his band it couldnt be allowed to happen stirk was right to take action but a frontal assault on soldiers it was courageous but against armed troops in their own positions no they would have no chance except to sacrifice themselves in the hope that it would not be in vain the emotional switch from exhilaration through apprehension to dogged acceptance was cruel a quiet voice announced there they is the low bulk of a sugar lighter crept into distant view from the north they were committed farrell had no idea of the soldiers and when he saw them closer to he would probably press ahead rather than let down his other party kydd forced his mind to go cool there had to be a diversion to take attention from farrell to themselves but did it have to be a full assault could it be toby kydd said stirk swung about to face him might be we cn do it another way from stirks compressed lips and glittering eyes kydd knew that he was keyed up for what had to be done yeah i cant see one cuffin kydd persevered an alternative was forming in his mind look we dont have t go at em front on we cn just stirk stepped up to him kydd we do it the way i said he snarled in case yerve forgotten im in charge aye toby kydd replied carefully youse in command right enough just sayin that we dont have e take breathing heavily stirk grabbed his shirtfront by both hands then he spoke slowly and savagely kydd i didnt reckon on it but youre a piggin shy cock kydd was aware of the circle of silent men around him but felt a rising anger an youre fuckin blind why dont you want t hear of somethin else stirk released kydds shirt slowly lets hear it he said finally his eyes held kydds unblinkingly kydd tried to bring a lucidity a logical sequence to his ideas as renzi always did weve got to get the frogs t pay attention to us right look away frm the lighter get worried about us we cn do that we launches th longboat an has a go at the brig thats yer idea said stirk incredulously not yet see the longboat is chasin one of the little fishin boats who o course are screamin fr help frogsll be wantin t see if they cn make it across to them stirks brow creased best part is well if you were them soldiers what would ye think an indistinct murmur came from behind but kydd pressed on youd think that this fishin boat is just escaped cos the english were invadin th town frm the other side an youd want t get there sharpish doggos rough voice came from the left so th soldiers get flustered n rushes off ter deal with it leavin it clear fr the seaflowers yeah stirk hesitated but the lighter was in clear view and would begin its final approach shortly a small smile appeared and he mocksaluted kydd whats yer orders then mate kydd wasted no time we six in th fishin boat he said indicating the nearest five men wait fr us t get afloat an get after us we get aboard t the forard you lay off until capn comes up an we all go at it together the light was stronger before they broke cover to take the small boat kydd thought of something strip off or theyll see we aint frenchies they whipped off their jackets and shirts naked to the waist right mates were mortal scared o the english we are lets away shouting hoarsely the sailors raced to the fishing boat waving arms desperate to make the safety of the brig the little boat was rushed into the water and with farthing and doggo at the oars it thrashed in a panicstricken course across the harbour kydd kept looking astern nervously urging the men on as an afterthought he tied his striped shirt to the single pulley line and hoisted it as if in distress to the top of the stumpy mast stirk performed his part perfectly raging like a bull at the edge of the water he threatened and menaced with a cutlass until the longboat could be launched it took the water with a splash and a fierce and bloodthirsty crew tumbled aboard to go in deadly pursuit of the poor frenchmen a scattering of pops sounded soldiers knelt on the mole taking aim at the longboat in little danger at that range kydd thought of the naked steel lying concealed in the bottom of his boat a warriors rising bloodlust made his heart pound at the end of the mole the lighter seemed to hesitate kydd ground his teeth if it didnt arrive soon to do its part his theatrical performance would fail the few figures on the lighter seemed to dispute together then the long sweeps began again and the ungainly craft careered around the end of the mole bumping and scraping in a shocking parody of seamanship a shouting on the mole drew his attention with a burst of triumph kydd saw that the soldiers were turning into file and trotting back along the mole presumably to defend the town events moved quickly the longboat sheered off under the threat of a swivel gun hastily manned in the brig leaving the fishing boat to reach safety they reached the forechains laughing frenchmen urging them up kydd watched the lighter out of the corner of his eyes seeing renzi berating quashees hapless bulk at the tiller while farrell jumped on his hat in exasperation the french leaned over the bulwarks offering hands to help but kydd played for time yelling incomprehensibly he pointed at the exhausted oarsmen and gestured for a ropeladder by this time the lighter was nearly upon them shouting angrily men from the brig jumped to the stonework of the mole with bearingoff poles and fenders as it threatened to drift across the brigs bows kydd knew that the time had come the lighter thumped violently to lock across the brigs forepart seaflowers huzzah for the king shouted farrell and swung himself up into the bowsprit of the enemy a storm of cheering rose from all around the frenchmen an unstoppable stream of seamen boiling up from concealment in the lighter kydds wildly excited men swarming up the forechains and stirks longboat racing to board by the stern they had minutes only before the soldiers found they had been fooled the french sailors recovered quickly from their surprise grabbed pikes and weapons from their readyuse positions around the mast and rushed to the sides of the vessel kydd landed on the deck of the brig and was immediately met by a sailor in a red cap who jabbed a long boarding pike at his face kydds cutlass blade went up and deflected the lunge keeping pressure on the haft until he was close enough to grab it with his left hand and yank the man offbalance the grey steel of kydds blade then thrust forward and took the man in the stomach he dropped to his knees grabbing at the pitiless steel kydds foot slammed into his face as he wrenched the cutlass free a pistol banged somewhere and kydd felt the violent passage of the bullet past his ear seconds later the pistol itself crashed into the side of his face hurled by its owner kydd crouched instinctively at the pain the swish of a blade sounded above and his head cleared he thrust up with his cutlass at the mans extended armpit with a howl of pain he dropped his weapon and fell to a foetal position a foot kicked into kydd across him an english sailor was being hard pressed by a bull of a frenchman kydd stabbed upwards into the unsuspecting mans bowels bringing an inhuman screech and the mans blade clumsily and brutally down on his back a burning line of pain opened but a second later the man was skewered by his original opponent heaving himself to his feet kydd snatched a look at the man he had saved his eyes were wild and unseeing as he turned back to the fight from aft a wave of men advanced kydd braced himself and turned to face them his head thumping and his back a cruel redhot bar of pain but thesewere stirks men and in a startlingly short time the deck was cleared farrells voice sounded loud commanding men dropped to the mole axes rose and fell on the mooring ropes a warning shout came soldiers were racing back along the mole many soldiers the ropes fell free and the axemen scrambled aboard the lighter swung away and drifted into the harbour more shouts from farrell and men were in the shrouds racing for the yards kydd staggered pain and nausea swamping his senses he sank to his knees retching into the slime of blood the brigs foresail dropped and flapped impatiently before taking the wind the vessels bow began to open clear water next to the mole the soldiers seeing this came to a stop and knelt to fire at the brig but their hard running was not conducive to good shooting and their balls whistled past harmlessly others made a charge against the brig but were decimated by the quarterdeck swivel gun cracking out above plied by english seamen the brig parted from the mole more sail was set and while kydd held his head on his knees they victoriously put to sea to rejoin seaflower ye had us a mort worried m friend coming in so strangelike kydd told renzi remembering the stopstart dispute he had seen on the lighter he was lying stomach down on the main grating of seaflower renzi gently applying goose grease to the angry weal down his back renzi paused it was not the best of times to be seeing a pack of soldiers waiting for us were we betrayed he resumed his soothing strokes then the captain sees our longboat chasing fishermen his comments on undisciplined rabble disobeying their orders were a curiosity to hear please believe but then i recognised your shirt hoisted up the mast and we understood as i should have kydd said crossly the treatment hurt and his head throbbed broken skin and a dark bruise extending out from his hairline were where the pistol had struck the surgeons mate had been dismissive of the head wound and in kydds opinion hamfisted in his ministrations to his back he brooded but by raising his head just a little he could see the fine sight astern of the french brigowar lifting and bobbing his prize money must now be growing significant and the prize agent would soon have golden guineas to hand out this was a happier thought what would he and renzi enjoy ashore on the proceeds seaflowerwas only hours from port morant she would soon make her number to the small naval station there and all the world would then know that saucy seaflowerhad been lucky again mr kydd lukes eager voice broke in on his thoughts capn desires yer should attend on him if ye should be at leisure t do so he recited the odd phraseology set warning bells ringing warily kydd got to his feet for a moment he wondered whether he should put on a shirt he had received dispensation while his wound was still sore and decided that this still held he went down the after hatchway to the captains minuscule cabin farrell was seated at the tiny desk he turned and held a sheet of paper this is my despatch to the commanderinchief to be landed at port morant farrell found the right place and read but as we approached a body of soldiers hitherto concealed from us became evident i was minded to abandon the venture were it not for the clever ruse of thomas kydd coxswain of the longboat and quartermaster in seaflowerhe caused his party to be split one part of which went ahead in a fishing boat in the character of a craft under pursuit by english seamen the other part in the longboat that followed the action was most successful surprise being complete the soldiers were lured away from their place by the supposition that a landing in force was under way in the town the brig was carried at slight loss farrell could easily have claimed that kydd was acting under orders kydd glowed at the tribute being mentioned in despatches was an unusual honour renzi looked at him oddly at the news but said nothing on the matter of where they would celebrate he smiled secretly and assured kydd that he would not be disappointed were he to trust him to find somewhere for such an insignificant manowar as seaflowerthere was no manning of yards in honour from the ships of the fleet when she entered port but the enemy brig demurely astern so much bigger than seaflower was proof enough of their prowess there wasno real need for the elaborate sailhandling when curving so prettily around to anchor under the envious eyes of the fleet but it was another chance to show the world what kind of manowar the seaflowerreally was within the hour farrell had returned from his call on the admiral bearing deeply satisfying news seaflowerwas due for refit and her people could rely on two weeks at least of liberty ashore the vice admiralty court sitting at kingston had duly condemned their barque as prize and they had tickets on the prize agent for a gratifying amount kydd considered his ticket there was the choice of parting with it now suitably discounted to a moneylender in town or cash it for the full amount later when the prize agent could be cajoled into drawing on account he would see what mysterious entertainment renzi had in mind first he hoped it would not be a curious pile of stones or the residence of some worthy poet tom mate yez has a letter stirk handed over a folded and sealed packet an thats fivepence y owes me fer the post cully kydd took it gingerly the writing was small and well formed a feminine hand he frowned then his expression cleared this was from cecilia his sister the date was only five weeks earlier and with pleased anticipation he took it forward to open and read in privacy he broke the wafer it was a single sheet closely written as usual she wasted no time and went straight to the point kydds eyes widened he read quickly and stared outwards it seemed impossible he found renzi searching in their seachest for a suitable kerchief in his blue jacket with the white whalebone buttons he looked ready for the delights of port royal the messdeck was rapidly emptying for there was every incentive to get ashore to make this a time to remember the seaflowers were going on the rantan kydd waited until they were alone and held up his paper yed never have guessed it nicholas but heres a letter frm cecilia i pray she is in good health renzi said perfectly in control kydd grinned aye she is that m friend an can you believe it she is here in kingston renzi stood quite still aint it prime kydd laughed here listen to this my dear brother i found how i might write a letter to you and i have news that will make you stare you may offer your felicitations thomas for you see i am to be wed kydd paused to see the effect on renzi his friend had always got along well with cecilia and kydd knew he would be pleased oddly renzi stared back at him with unblinking eyes shrugging kydd went on peter is a very amiable man and he has the most wonderful prospects i met him at one of mrs darytons assemblies oh yes she wishes to be remembered to you and of course dear nicholas but what i really want to tell you is that peter is going to jamaica to be undermanager of a sugar plantation youve no idea how happy that makes me it will only be a few years and we will set up our carriage and a little time after that we will be rich and i will look after mama and papa but i am going too fast i have to say that we have an understanding peter will return to jamaica and next month i travel with jane rodpole you remember the one at school with the long hair and hopeless giggle she goes to jamaica for the same reason we will take lodgings together until kydd broke off so y sees she must even now be in kingston nicholas we have t find her an celebrate all together chapter kydd and renzis appearance smart manowars men attracted some curious looks in kingston town sailors rarely left the more direct pleasures of port royal for the commercialism and bustle of kingston across the harbour from the palisades it was not hard to find the newcomers there were streets of hostelries providing rooms for merchants travelling army wives and the like and with rising excitement kydd found himself outside one of these the door was opened by a mistrustful housekeeper kydd shyly enquired about miss kydd the woman agreed to see if she was in to two sailors but firmly closed the door on them while she did so the door opened again a young lady with laughing eyes hair whirled in a tight bun in deference to the heat looked at them both do i fin mself addressing miss jane kydd enquired holding his hat awkwardly in his hands you do sir might i ask she looked puzzled butthere was a barely repressed animation that was most fetching thomas kydd cecilias brother her hands flew to her mouth an my particular friend nicholas renzi she bobbed a curtsy in return to renzis studied bow but her eyes were on kydd wide and serious cecilia is out at the moment she said quietly but if you are at leisure you may wish to await her return kydd grinned widely thats kind in you er miss jane he said she flashed a smile but it disappeared quickly they eased past the discouraging gaze of the housekeeper and were ushered into the front parlour kydd sat on the edge of a faded chintz chair ye must be happy fr cecilia i believe he began jane lowered her head for a moment and when she spoke it was controlled formal it were better she will tell you about it herself mr kydd he felt the first stirrings of alarm but suppressed them an i got word that you will be hearin wedding bells yrself miss jane she bit her lip and replied for two months hence an awkward silence developed and kydd glanced at renzi who sat opposite his expression had that frustratingly impenetrable quality which kydd knew concealed his understanding of a situation that he himself could not grasp tea arrived the china rattling on the tray they sipped decorously in their sea rig the little graces seeming incongruous kydd caught a furtive look from jane a look of frank curiosity and he wondered what the girls had discussed concerning him there was however something about the present situation that was not right a rattling at the front door had jane recovering her poise this is your sister i believe she said brightly and rose to her feet oh cecilia she called you have guests my dear footsteps sounded along the passage and the door opened kydd advanced to meet her and faltered to a stop it was cecilia but the pale drawn face the black dress and veil his smile faded uncertain how to continue he hesitated thomas cecilia seemed to wake a small smile breaking through as she threw back the veil how wonderful a little of the old spirit came through my you look so handsome in your sea costume her eyes strayed to the livid bruise on his head oh she said faintly jus a wound o battle he said she approached and hugged him with controlled passion the wound on his back making him gasp cec what is it he blurted out oh i declare ill be late for my dancing lesson jane said please excuse me i must rush cecilia noticed renzi standing unmoving in the background oh nicholas she said warmly how good to see you renzi inclined his head but stayed where he was impulsively cecilia crossed to him and embraced him as well nicholas your complexion is like a red indians not the thing at all at home she said when cecilia turned back to kydd her expression was rigid brittle it is only the ten days i have been here in jamaica thomas but kydd pulled her towards him and held her tight while sobs racked her neither noticed renzi slip from the room its so so unfair she wept he was so happy to see me and a week later hes in his grave er what on wednesday he had dreadful pains and sickness and by sunday the tears were all the harder to bear for their brevity and harsh depths i was with him until im so sorry fr it cec truly i am if it were the yellow fever and she was involved in his nursing then the end would have been unspeakably hard to bear cecilia dabbed her eyes and looked away there was now only the emptiness of destroyed hopes kydd released her and said gently cec youre here in jamaica with nothin any more have ye any means of course she said but would not look at him directly kydd was stabbed with pity he knew his sister was strong and independent and would rather die than admit to any weakness but a single woman without substance far from home have ye any plans theres nothin t keep you here she glanced at him if you mean what do i next then i will attend on jane for her nuptials of course kydds mouth opened in amazement but she looked at him with fondness that is to say my dear brother that i crave time to think to put this nightmare from me you do understand kydd let a small smile show there was time enough for brother and sister to get together later he felt doubtful but blurted out nicholas an i we were on our way t kick up a hullabaloo on account of our success in seaflower i know ftnot feelins spry but if yed like to thank you both i hope youll forgive me but i need to be alone for just a little while her sad smile touched him deeply then he remembered here cec if y please he brought out his prizemoney ticket do ye see yr jack tar is a foolish wight ashore they say sailors get money like horses n spend it like asses id take it kindly if ye could look after this fr me takes th temptation away shelooked at him steadily then kissed him y presents it at the prize agent when hes got word frm the admiralty sign on th other side an be sure the mumpin rogue doesnt chouse ye renzi was waiting outside and they fell into step as kydd told him of the conversation renzi listened and nodded gravely cecilia was right she needed time to herself for the moment to settle her feelings therefore there was no reason why they shouldnt carry on with his original plan brother there is someone that it would give me the greatest of pleasure that you should meet kydd looked at him curiously and it requires that we go upcountry in a ketureen on broad street they found one the driver at first disbelieving that two sailors wanted to head away from the delights of the port ony dese sugar pens dere nuthin else koonermen they made spanish town before noon the ketureen waited on the grand parade while renzi impressed kydd with the sea splendours of the rodney memorial the noble portico of the kings house and the rio cobre of columbus they dined at a roadside stall on rich yellow akee salt fish and bammy bread before resuming their journey by late afternoon they had reached may pen where they took the road north renzi felt that the time had come could no longer be deferred my dear friend his hand lay on kydds arm do you listen to what i say kydd looked at him the personage we will stay with tonight is my brother richard kydd kept his silence he is a gentleman of some consequence in this island i may say and is an ornament to the family renzi stared into the distance he knows of my resolve in the matter of my moral judgement and respects it dare i ask it it would infinitely oblige should you feign ignorance of my true position kydd agreed solemnly then i will touch on another matter one which is perhaps the more delicate of the two renzi glanced at him before speaking do you not take offence dear friend if i point out that in the article of polite formalities you are as yet untutored natural he watched kydds expression tighten but these of course are an accomplishment obligatory only on those with pretensions to genteel society renzi continued carefully yere saying im goin t shame you to y brother kydd growled not as who would say renzi muttered the ketureen clattered on over the sandy rutted road and renzi thought perhaps he had gone too far in fairness it had to be said that it was really for kydds sake that he had felt it proper to bring up the subject in order that kydd himself would not feel uncomfortable in polite company rather than for any selfish motive of his own cecilia had rapidly acquired a natural affinity with the formalities of gentility as was the way of women but her brother while absorbing the deepsea mariners fine qualities of courage humour and sturdy selfreliance had also absorbed their direct speech and impatience with soft shore ways in many ways it would not be a kind thing to do to him kydd glowered staring obstinately away but then he recovered yr in the right of it nicholas he sighed fr you only but what it will be very agreeable to me if you keep station on myself mark my motions and do the same and you will not be so very far from success aye kydd said briefly in the sugar field they were passing there were women with baskets on their heads gay in red and yellow some weeding others scouring the stubbled ground a snatch of singing came floating over the distance kydd looked out brooding then he turned torenzi and said firmly be s good as t give me a steer on y manners when its time fr vittles nicholas why its not so perilous dear fellow renzi said with great satisfaction he would now provide a clear and seamanlike course to follow perfectly suited to a plainthinking sailor their ketureen arrived at the great house and the two travellers were made cordially welcome a fine surprise nicholas laughton declared his delight obvious and a distinct pleasure to make acquaintance with your friend back from the dead he said looking at kydd keenly would it inconvenience renzi asked with the utmost politeness were we to beg the loan of attire perhaps more in keeping with the country but of course dear fellow the days that followed were a haze of impressions for kydd the vast fields of sugarcane whose harvest would end at some point as pungent royal navy rum the slow daily round of field work with the lines of slaves moving across the fields the younger ones bringing up the rear weeding and clearing with their own pickney driver it was utterly at odds with kydds world laughton was a fine host and at sundown always joined his visitors on the broad veranda for easy conversation your visit is most welcome nicholas but i fear not at the best of times he mentioned one evening weve been sadly inconvenienced in our trade by these devilish predators youll find the navy not popular here renzi hastened to change the subject and of your maroons are they as cantankerous unsatisfied as last you spoke worse theyre more or less in open revolt now he stared out over the fields they want more land for emselves which plantation is going to give it to them theyre rambling about at night causing general trouble had two cows taken and another with its throat slit its unsettling my fieldworkers who know theyre only over yonder he said gesturing towards the tumble of hills and mountains to the northwest just visible in the dusk thats what we call cockpit country and there the maroon is untouchable and its only a short ride away he took a long pull at his drink dont forget were only some thousands with an enslaved population of around a quartermillion concentrates the mind dont ye think fortified by his courteous acceptance by laughton kydd was able to face with equanimity the prospect of a social occasion an informal dinner of the usual sort seated opposite renzi he prepared nervously to do his duty th currant sauce if y please was kydds first daring foray into polite society it was passed to him without comment and reassured he looked around furtively at the members of the table the olivecomplexioned lawyer further down caught his look and nodded pleasantly taken aback kydd had the presence of mind to raise his glass in salute as he placed the glass down again he became aware of the fierce glint of eyes diagonally opposite marston the man growled and lifted his eyebrows in interrogation er kydd he said carefully not knowing if handshakes were the thing at table and deciding that it would be safe to do nothing got th look o the sea about ye said marston when it became obvious kydd was not going to be more forthcoming aye yr in the right of it sir marston smiled can always tell which ship renzi broke in smoothly thomas is with me gilbert come to see where sugar comes from damn fine place to see he started then twisted round in his seat to the lady on his left if youll pardon th french m dear she nodded shyly laughton was at the head of the table his wife at the opposite end near kydd er mr kydd she called decorously do y not feel a trifle anxious out on the sea what with all those nasty pirates an french privateers she helped herself to more of the succulent river shrimps in salt and pepper kydds own mouth was full with the spicy jerk but he replied manfully not wi the navy t look after pah marstons face lowered and his eyes slitted ive lost three ships tween here n san domingo an its disgraceful the navy still aint come up on em if i was their admiral i tell you at the other end of the table laughton frowned outside there was some sort of disturbance the talking died away high words sounded and a flustered butler entered bowed to laughton and whispered urgently laughton put down his glass quietly gentlemen it seems that the trelawney maroons are abroad tonight his chair scraped as he got to his feet a mill is afire the room broke into a rush of talk stap me but theyre getting damnation uppity dye think god preserve us its a general rising wheres the militia the blaggards laughton took off his jacket and carefully laid it on the back of his chair in his evening shirt he acceptedhis sword and belt from the butler as calmly as he had accepted his dinner clothes earlier i wont be long gentlemen but in the meantime pray do not ignore the brandy and cigars kydd sensed the assembling of men in the rising tension outside marston stood up richard dammit you cant go on yr own dear fellow laughton held up his hand firmly no gilbert this is my plantation i shall deal with it he turned and left don like it not one bit of it marston rumbled nor do i said the lawyer you know how they work set an outbuilding on fire then when all attention is on that they fall upon the great house the ladies stayed close together chattering nervously the men pacing around the room puffing cigars kydd looked through the open windows into the warm darkness he glanced at renzi who was talking quietly with the butler renzi looked across at kydd and beckoned discreetly i do believe we should stand sentrygo around the house i have asked for weapons these turned out to be large ugly blunderbusses with their flared muzzles a strong deterrent to any kind of unrest i will take the north side if you would be so good as to patrol the south renzi suggested the rest of the room watched respectfully and as they left there were low calls of encouragement from the other men outside away from the bright glitter of candlelight and silver it was impenetrably black the darkness was the more menacing for its total anonymity and kydd felt hairs prickle on the back of his neck from the windows of the great house houseboys looked outfearfully there was a movement behind him kydd wheeled around it was marston come to keep ye company he said breathing heavily kydd muttered thanks but at the same time he didnt want to worry about having someone about him on whom he could not rely marston however fell into step next to him get worked up they do marston said his cigar laying a thick fragrance on the night air have this obeah man kind o witchcraft calls it voodoo they does what he says under fear o death cn they fight asked kydd i mean in the reglar way against soldiers he continued to pace slowly looking out into the night marston nodded vigorously damn right they can you can depend upon it but not as youd say they disguise emselves as trees with leaves an all jumps into life in our rear devil take em not for nothin they calls it land o look behind kydd thought of juba the driver of the kings negroes on antigua if he and his kind were to set their faces against the forces of the crown he could not be at all certain of the outcome he remembered the opaqueness of character the difference in jubas expression of humanity was it so hard to understand a resentment a striving to be as other men from the darkness a group of figures emerged laughton easily recognisable at their head he saw kydd and waved thank you thomas there was no need but i honour you for it shall we rejoin the ladies it seemed the alarm was over kydd handed over his blunderbuss and he and renzi reentered the brightness of the big dining room to murmured words of approbation laughton resumed his chair at the head gentlemen he raised a glass and drank deep the ladies could now withdraw gracefully leaving the men to their blue haze brandy balloons and conversation somethin has to be done marston said forcefully theyve broken their sworn treaty the damned rascals if they take it into their heads to come down from the hills all together its up with us wed never control a general mutiny military is here an i hear theyre even sending us a general the announcement did not seem to mollify snorts of derision were heard around the table despite the presence further down the table of an officer in red regimentals he didnt comment but a confident smile played across his face as he enjoyed his cigar so whats goin on eh james the officer paused for a moment yes he drawled quite true general walpole is expected daily an with how many damn soldiers the smile widened not so many i understand whats so funny damn your whistle its hell be bringing much more effective reinforcements than soldiers blast m eyes youre speakin in riddles man this is not for public knowledge gentlemen so keep it under your hat no soldiers instead cuban hunting dogs a baffled quiet descended enjoying the effect the officer elegantly lifted his brandy half the size of a man these brutes are trained up by the spaniards for mankilling can pitilessly run to earth anything on two legs in the worst country the hardest climate a runaway slave stands no chance at all and neither will these maroons kydd felt for them all their advantages of knowing the country blending with the landscape melting into the scrub rendered useless at a stroke we send the dogs in we can smoke em all out from their hideyholes finish em for good at last the roar of merriment that followed was heartfelt but kydd could not join in he turned to the lawyer is it so necessary t take such hard ways with th poor beggars he asked the man frowned are you not aware that these sugar islands are the richest lands in the world that if we lost their yield for any reason it would of a certainty mean the collapse of the city a run on gold our ruination as a nation just when we are locked in battle with the greatest threat to our civilisation ever there could be no answer to that but kydd felt a stubborn need to have his misgivings laid to rest but slavery where is yr rights there the lawyers eyes turned stony if we had no slaves then may i ask where do you think that the free men to take their place thousands tens of thousands will come from no white man will come of his free will to labour in the sun the black man is eminently suited they would have no employment were it not for this but do you propose sir to abandon the islands sail away leave them to the french throw away six generations of development the contempt in his voice was illconcealed kydd knew in his heart that renzi would sadly concur it was a matter of simple logic besides which he was a guest and would not embarrass his friend with an argument of course not sir that was never in question he said all too rapidly the remaining days of their stay passed until the time came on the last evening to bring it all to a conclusion laughton arrived late for the sundown glass flopping wearily into his rattan chair there was little talk as the sangaree splashed into the glasses each man with his own thoughts laughtons wife joined them but left discreetly at the solemn mood kydd broke the silence saying civilly yr sunsets are capital in this part o the world laughton looked up a tight smile flashing briefly there are many things here which a distracted mind would find pleasing he sat back and looked directly at kydd it does not take a deal of penetration to see that you are a particular friend to nicholas you have shared too much of life together for it to be otherwise therefore i conclude that he has confided in you in short you know of his decision and the noble impulse that generated it i am his brother as you are no doubt aware and tonight i ask you very sincerely if you will intercede with him ask him to accept my offer of an honoured place here indeed to include your own good self and see out these tumultuous times here together kydd was surprised he had no idea an offer had been made he glanced across at renzi whose expression was as usual inscrutable i do thank ye fr the fine offer for mself but must say no kydd said firmly but as fr nicholas no renzi said quickly and stared intensely at his glass kydd waited but there was no further elaboration renzis face was set in stone the chirrofa cricket sounded in the dusk immediately joined in a chorus by others a clatter and laughter sounded faroff in the chattel houses and the breeze played sofdy about them laughton put down his glass then i think i have my answer nicholas he said softly but one moment he rose quickly and went inside a short time later he emerged with a dusty botde and crystal glasses which he placed on the marquetry table then set to carefully opening the bottle let us make this last night as agreeable as we may he poured the deep gold liquid into crystal the darkskinned buder arrived with a candle and each man held his glass armagnac the elder pitt was a boy when this was bottled laughton said lightly i give you fortune may she treat you as a lady chapter it was good to see seaflowerat her moorings across the harbour at the palisades looking yachtlike at that distance kydd and renzi gave a cheerful wave soon they would be aboard in their familiar berths and life would carry on as before kydd caught the strong clean whiff of linseed oil and freshly tarred rigging as he swung over the side to the deck the most obvious sign of the work the dockyard had done on his ship he moved over to the tiller its arm had been replaced and in good english ash he noted with satisfaction it had a flexibility that absorbed the direct shock of seas coming in on the quarter which could be a tiring thing for a helmsman heyho the travellers douds cry came from forward where he was leading the fore preventer stay to bring its upper wooden heart to the lower right in the bows kydd wandered up keen to hear the gossip what cheer cuffin an have ye any news b chance doud gave a knowing smile passed the lanniard loosely through the two hearts and tied off before straightening we has a new owner he announced importantly does we indeed kydd said with interest looking around for renzi but he had gone below an what happened t capn farrell may i ask been an got his step you calls him commander now cock he stepped aside to let his two men finish bowsing in on the lanniard and added in course hes too grand fer this little barky gets a sloopowar or some such i wouldnt wonder in the matter of prize money alone seaflowerhad become a valuable unit for the admiral and her captain had proved he was lucky in this regard with a larger ship he could do even better do we know then whos to have seaflower we dont but were gonna find out this afternoon doud said due aboard three bells i heard wese t priddy the decks an set all ataunto kydd slapped douds arm and hurried below to shift into his loose seagoing rig the master was visibly pleased to see him ye know our new capn mr jarman asked kydd i do ltenant swaine admirals staff comes aboard at three bells kydd was puzzled by his laconic reticence but put it down to disappointment at the departure of the patrician farrell are we ready fr sea he enquired as quartermaster he was responsible for stowage of stores jarman told him in full detail in essence within a day they could be ready for whatever task seaflowerwas called upon to perform renzi seemed a little preoccupied when kydd passed on the news of the name of their new captain all kydd could learn for him was that renzi had seen lieutenant swaine on the admirals staff in spanish town at three bells seaflowerwas ready for her new captain with her boatswains mate stiles in his hat with the ships name picked out in gold on a red background and luke the sideboy complete with white gloves standing at the ships side jarman as senior stood waiting on the tiny quarterdeck in his best uniform with merrick close at hand they waited it was a grey day the rain catching them unawares at one point and the muggy heat afterwards was a trial and still they waited at five bells merrick went below and luke sat on the deck kydd was not required but he joined others standing about curious to see their new commander at seven bells as the lateafternoon sun put in an appearance there was a stir on the shore a dockyard wherry put off a single occupant in the sternsheets jarman growled a warning and the side party reassembled the boat bumped alongside and an officer in cocked hat and sword stepped aboard a piercing single blast from stiles greeted him until he read his commission this officer was not entitled to be piped aboard jarman removed his hat and stood attentively lieutenant swaine to be captain of this vessel said the officer formally aye sir said jarman william jarman master and might i present mr merrick bosun swaine lifted his hat briefly to each then stepped quickly to the centre of the deck pulling out a parchment in a monotone he read himself in the sonorous phrases rendered flat and uninspiring by the lack of inflection and speed of their delivery but it was sufficient lieutenant swaine was now indisputably captain of hms seaflower carefully folding the parchment he placed it back inside his coat for a moment his eyes passed over the neat decks of the cutter then he turned to jarman carry on please but he made no move to go to his cabin instead he stepped over to the side of the deck the wherry had not shoved off but lay alongside and swaine stood at the deck edge with a frown deepening on his face merrick hastened over to the side with a mumbled apology it was the last thing to be expected that the captain would be off ashore just as soon as he had come aboard i desire that the longboat call for me at the careening wharves at nine no make that ten have you trusties enough to man merrick flicked a glance at jarman before responding stolidly were all volunteers in seaflowersir very well said swaine after a moments pause merricks piercing call of piping the side sounded as seaflowersnew lieutenantincommand now entitled to special attention went ashore means nothin mate said stirk he must ave engagements ashore like stiles was unconvinced an did yer see is coat lace was tatty as a whores petticoat n brass buckles must ave a light purse kydd bridled not everyones flush in the fob as we he said three prizes wi our name on em more t come what we want is a good square hand who cn show us the way to a few more stirk lifted his drink and sank it with a grimace somethin about the cut o his jib sets me teeth on edge i just dunno yair somethin slivey about im stiles agreed wouldnt like ter trust hes on yer side kinda thing you would grant however that the man should have a chance to show something of himself before judgement is passed renzis words only produced a restless grumbling the two double strikes of ten oclock sounded from on deck not yet back aboard stiles said not allowed ter sleep out of is ship is he he added needlessly kydd disliked the way the talk was headed and made his excuses jarman had the deck but responded to kydds cordial conversation with monosyllables staring at the pinpricks of light ashore where port royals taverns continued their raucous trade kydd made to leave but jarman said softly do you kindly remain with me id be obliged is there anythin amiss mr jarman nothing you cant help b being here uneasy kydd kept the deck with jarman seeing the lights douse on other ships and the shore lights wink out one by one it was after midnight when the longboat returned and in it were two passengers jarman lifted his hat to the captain who was followed by a figure that tripped as it came over the bulwark and sprawled headlong shit came a voice as the figure picked itself up midshipman parkin swaine said in a surly tone rounding on the lad he snaded damn your eyes an youre a useless lubber before making his unsteady way to the after hatchway a muffled roar for a steward had jarman exchanging looks with kydd seaflowerproceeded to sea the next day after completing stores kydd took the helm himself keeping a wary eye on swaine to his relief swaine seemed content in the main to leave the direction of the vessel to jarman indicating his desires in grunts the new midshipman was useless large and rawboned he seemed disinclined to join in with the seamen in their hard work at the running rigging of the huge sails but on the other hand threw anxious beseeching looks at the boatswain or others when called upon to take charge seen it all before mates murmured doggo at the shroud batten lashings tradesmans son reefers been wished on im b some tailor es got debts with he yanked at the cordage viciously it could go either way depending on how far the captain shielded the lad they tacked about when clear of the cays to the south and shaped course to round the east of jamaica for the small naval base of port antonio on the north coast they made the customary stop off morant bay to pick up packets and bags this was easier than carrying them by mule over the almost impassable blue mountains inland shaking out their sails they rounded the turbulent morant point before sunset and headed northwestward past the red cliffs of sail rock this will do mr jarman growled swaine sir said jarman puzzled manchioneal bay good enough holding id have thought we anchor for the night no sense in risking a night passage inshore when we can arrive early tomorrow swaine looked narrowly at jarman ayeaye sir jarman said his face blank the anchor went down off the muddy river between the reefs the stream flowing fast from the recent rains seaflowerswung to her anchor facing into this and the cutter stood down sea watches kydd dropped down the fore hatchway to the hubbub of the messdeck on one side patch was holding court men clustered around his table as kydd approached he looked up resentment and anger in his face he spoke to alvarez but his eyes were on kydd so wheres our piggin prizes comin from we lie with our hook down all th time this aint work worth a spit all hardlyin an no purse at th end of it were nothin but a parcel o scrannypickers farthing muttered some says as how wes a judas boat now sittin like this we aint a chance others joined in kydd waited patiently for them to make their feelings known by longhallowed custom of the sea seamen in their mess were free to voice their grumbles to each other short of mutiny or sedition it subsided as kydd had known it would but when he resumed his way forward to the petty officers mess the privateersman pushed to his feet locking his gaze on kydds his hand dropped to his knife kydd froze the knife came out then in a vicious onehanded movement the blade flickered from his palm and thudded into a deck beam between the astonished men of the opposite messtable pinioning a hapless cockroach the talking died away in an edgy silence the reality was that they were only a kings cutter whose duties were mainly despatches and reconnaissance their prizes before were a lucky chance and not to be relied upon patch was not the only privateersman aboard kydd realised it could get ugly if their captain if y askin to have yr blade cropped i can oblige ye kydd said mildly his hands dropped loosely to his side but he tensed any hasty words from patch now and hed see him in irons there was no other way at the sudden quiet the canvas screen of the petty officers mess at the end of the messdeck suddenly pulled back whats th gripin mate stirk called nothin toby shipmates talkin catblash is all kydd said loudly but he continued to stand watching patch slowly the privateersman unwound and turning away his gaze moved to retrieve his knife kydd followed him with his eyes then continued on gettin worried they cant see us takin prizes with this owner he said briefly accepting a pot from renzi inside their mess an aint that the truth said stiles lifting his tankard in disgust hell be akissin his dear ones just this minute if y believes young luke kissing his dear ones loves is bottles so much hes a kissin of em every day stiles grated stirk gave a brief smile then leaned forward other ways yez cn get a taste o gold these parts the others leaned forward to hear yair wasnt it in the caribbee yer capn kidd buried is treasure nearly a million in gold n jools an guarded b ten dead men an never found till this day eyes gleamed in the lanthorn light then he turned to kydd now then cully stirk said yer must know somethin about it e bein kin an all kydd smiled terrible great pirate i grant ye but no kin o mine he comes frm scodand n the kydds are frm the south an he has an i in midships where we have a y embarrassed he added an im the only one the first one that is t follow th sea in the kydd family an a right shellback you is turnin into ifn i says so stirk said warmly clearing his throat renzi attracted attention a great pirate i have to disagree he was only a merchant an investor of wall street which is in new york no seaman he but he married a lively lady and bethought to go aroving one voyage only and his crew is so dissatisfied with his conduct they set him ashore stranded in antigua renzi grinned at kydd but he gets another ship and continues and finds an east indiaman which in course he captures with a great treasure a simpleminded creature he sails straight back to new york but takes the precaution first of burying the treasure nearby to bargain with in case he meets trouble for his actions it didnt work and he pays with his life at tyburn tree the treasure is still there my dear friends but somewhere close by new york not here in the caribbean i do regret stirk growled aye but y had some real pirates hereabouts take calico jack mates stiles began lures an irish lass ter leave er usband fer a life apiratin together they takes a scowegian hooker an in it theres this other lass so he has this anne n mary too an they are the equal ter any in bein ready ter board and the cuttin of throats stirk broke in but in th end as ye knows calico jack wuz turned off at tyburn but is women both on em pleads their bellies and says he werent no fighter lets em all be captured the thoughtful quiet was broken by renzi not all came to a bad end he said take henry morgan you musta eard o im while you wuz clerkin in spanish town stirk chuckled indeed said renzi and you can say in truth that we are here today because he was the one who secured jamaica as our caribbean centre for trade top class as a freebooter as you know took campeche just in order to seize fourteen prizes in one go and there was so much plunder after the sack of panama that spanish pieces of eight were legal tender in jamaica for years afterwards kydds shipmates became preoccupied it was not beyond the bounds of possibility that spain could join in the present war the old times return morgan came back to jamaica prompted kydd yes when it was peace with spain he retired to england but it was war again and the king thought he was best placed of all to know the caribbean and appointed him governor of jamaica with an eye to its defence and a fine fist he made of it too sad really he missed the buccaneering life and spent much government time in the port royal taverns lifting a glass with his old shipmates thats when port royal was at its most lively a rousing good time guaranteed for any seaman he drank himself to death and within three four years a mighty earthquake finally sent most of port royal into the sea lets raise a pot to capn henry morgan wiping his mouth stirk said loudly if y wants a reglarbuilt pirate then m granddaddy can tell ye he saw blackbeard imself back in queen annes day only scared th piss outa him comes swarmin aboard black beard wi ribbons an all this slowmatch strung through alight n smokin away roarin and shouting carries four pistols an a eavy cutlass aint none can stand against him colonies see their trade go somewhere else so they puts a kings ship on to his tail sloopowar lootenant maynard thats it hides is crew below while blackbeard boards then takes em th ltenant meets blackbeard face on n isnt shy theres this great fight the two on em but maynard wins and sails back t port wi blackbeards head adanglin from the bowsprit fer all to see the anchor was won the next morning in a sullen rain squall hissing and lashing at the men on the windlass and sending seaflower in a skittish whirl around her moorings when the anchor finally tripped the cutter was facing inshore into the swollen river current emerging to carry her seaward at the same time the wind strengthened from the sea prevailing over the current and seaflower duly drifted towards the shore not three hundred yards distant sheet in the main y bastards it was the first time kydd had heard jarman swear as he gave orders to carry sail aft with sheets afly forward the cutter would rotate to face the sea under the leverage of the big after sail what belay that you dogs yelled swaine his eyes were red and hair plastered down his face by the rain what are you about sir he threw at jarman before screaming down the deck let go anchor the men forward were making ready to cat and secure the anchor shank painter and were totally unprepared the windlass taut and the cable on the pawl the gawky parkin had charge of the operation and floundered god rot me bones spluttered merrick and thrust forward hastily but the situation was already in hand douds furtive bringing in of the main sheets had given force enough for the bows to swing swaine seemed to ignore his previous order with the promise in the bows swing carry on then mr jarman he said testily handing the deck to the master never seen such a dogs breakfast doud muttered under his breath but not quietly enough you sir swaine rounded on him damn your sly ways i heard your vile words y think to slander your ship do you bosun do you gag this infernal rogue kydd watched with growing anger as stiles found an iron marline spike which he forced between douds teeth securing it in place with spunyarn the quarterdeck fell quiet at the manifest injustice doud would wear the gag until given leave to remove it seaflower made the open sea and shaped course for port antonio some small hours away there they landed their packets and bags and took on two slim packages before resuming their voyage to st kitts and thence barbados kydd thought it an unworthy spite that swaine did not have the gag removed until after the noon meal and the grog issue in the way of sailors doud would later enjoy their sympathy and illegally saved rum but that was not the point a fine northeasterly had them bowling along the familiar passage south of hispaniola and by evening they had the precipitous knife shape of cape rojo abeam up spirits was piped but there was not the usual happy hum on the berthdeck as the grog was measured out the popular doud was well plied with good cheer but all the talk was on the captains character watchondeck turned to there was not a lot for them to do in the steady sailing weather and they hunkered down in the warm breeze doud made himself comfortable on the mainhatch gratings and looking soulfully at the stars began singing softly his voice coarsened with rum tis of a flash frigate la pique was her name all in the west indies she bore a great name for cruelly bad using of every degree like slaves in the galley we ploughed the salt sea so now brother shipmates whereer ye may be from all fancy frigates id have ye steer free too late doud recognised the dark figure of swaine looming and scrambled to his feet do y wan the second verse he said truculently to his captain swaine didnt answer at first then he bawled mr merrick down the deck to the helm aye sir said the boatswain hurrying to the scene whats this that you have a man on watch beastly drunk a thick edge to the words betrayed the captains own recent acquaintance with a bottle but there could be no answer to his question there was a fine line to be drawn between the effect of the usual quarterpint of spirits and that of more swaine turned back to doud i came to tell this rascal to hold his noise but i see this seize him in irons and i shall have him before me tomorrow we have no irons in seaflower said merrick expressionless then shackle him to the gratings right here you fool swaine hissed at seven bells of the forenoon the following day the ships company of seaflower mustered on the upper deck kydd saw the sanctimonious expression on swaines face as he gave a biting condemnation on drinking the inevitable sentence came twelve lashes and be very sure i shall visit the same on any blackguard who seeks to shame his ship in this way kydd felt a cold fury building at the mans hypocrisy doud was stripped and tied to the main shrouds facing outboard stiles came forward slipping the ugly length of the cat out of its bag he took position amidships and experimentally swung the lash then looked at swaine bosuns mate do your duty there was none of the panoply of drumbeat and marines just the sickening lash at regular intervals and the grunts and gasps of the prisoner seaflowers company stood and watched the torment but kydd knew that a defining moment had been reached the fine spirit that had been seaflowers soul was in the process of departing his messmates cut doud down and helped him below on deck swaine glanced about once to meet sullen silence and stony gazes the cutter sped on over the sparkling seas but the magic was ebbing kydd felt her imperfections slowly surfacing much as a falling out of love the suddenly noticed inability to stand up below the continual canting of the decks with her foreandaft rig the discomfort of her small size he pushed these thoughts to the back of his mind parkin was mastheaded at three bells for rank boneheadedness but at the beginning of the first dogwatch it was stirk who ran afoul of the increasingly illtempered swaine told to flat in the soaring jib he turned and ambled forward his scorn for the uselessness of the order only too plain you bloody dog raved swaine contemptuous swine but ill see your backbone at the main shrouds tomorrow silent contempt depend upon it mr merrick shackled on deck stirk was a pitiful sight not so much in degradation but in the sight of a fine seaman brought to such a pass merrick carefully avoided the side of the deck where stirk lay but stiles merely stepped around him in the morning he would be the one to swing the cat on stirks back and there was no room for sentiment in a boatswains mate the evening arrived and with it a convenient anchorage off an island south of hispaniola seaflower immediately swung on her anchor to face into an offshore current of quite some strength and as soon as the longboat was placed in the water it streamed astern to the full length of its painter ready with its oars aboard for any lifesaving duty holding should be good even so jarman told kydd sand an mud because o the river yonder swaine disappeared and after securing the vessel at her moorings supper was piped it would be a dispiriting meal thinking of stirk kydd winced as he heard rain roaring on the deck overhead the berthdeck filled as men chose its heat and fug over the deluge above leaving the luckless lookouts and stirk the only ones topside what cheer luke kydd said when the lad brought the mess kid of supper luke didnt look up his bowed head sparking concern in kydd hows this he tried again but the boy didnt respond luke ol cuffin are you he called me names mr kydd no call fer that luke said in a low voice his eyes were brimming he had served the captain first so there was no need to know who it was had taken it out on this willing soul fr shame o course kydd said softly but a good sailorman knows how t take hard words frm his officers luke stared back obstinately but he called me it aint right what e called me he turned and with great dignity left i seen bilge rats worth moren he the shonky fuckster doggo growled renzi said nothing but stared at the table kydd tried to lift the mood if things got worse seaflower could easily turn into a hellship theres no one seen him with a frenchie in sight could be hes a right tartar he gets a smell o prize money dont talk such gooseshit cully stiles said wearily the table lapsed into a morose quiet and the wash of talk outside on the larger berthdeck became plain patchs voice came through loud his tone bitter i teu yer we flogs up n down the caribbee in this ol scow yer aint never goin ter feel a cobb in yer bung again yair but someone began patchs tone rose in contempt drops hook fer the night never eard o such shy tricks we choked up inter this squiddy cutter the neverceasing background babble rose and fell and kydd pictured the pugnacious seaman glaring wildly about blast me eyes if it dont stick in m craw nothin but this fer ever there were sounds of scuffling and mess traps falling to the deck then alvarez calling where ye goin camaradd topsides ive had a gutful wait kydd met renzis eyes it can only get worse said renzi slowly kydd knew he was right seaflowers captain was alienating his own ships company treating them as some necessary evil in his own problem kydd agreed no chance o this one gettin a promotion out o seaflower he added the probability was that he had been given the command of a lowly cutter to satisfy some byzantine relationship of obligation knowing that he would not be put to the test so easily seaflower would gradually decay from within her heart and spirit wilting and fading under the disinterest and neglect of her captain it was intolerable that the willing and exuberant soul of their vessel was to be wasted so a discordant sound it might have been a muffled shout thumping jarred kydds ear against the general noises it seemed to originate from on deck if the lookouts had failed to see an approaching attack in time kydd scrambled to his feet somethin amiss on deck renzi did not move but looked up with a dry smile i can conceive that toby stirk may well be a trifle restless no one else seemed to have noticed as he forced his way aft kydd had no idea what would he would see on deck and his mouth went dry as he mounted the ladder it was dark and he stopped short of emerging on deck while he blinked furiously trying to pierce the murk it had stopped raining but the deck was wet and slippery he caught movement around the stern but could not detect any other as he climbed out on to the upper deck he hurried aft to where bumps and thuds sounded and nearly fell over the lookout who was on all fours trying to pick himself up kydd looked around hastily in the longboat were patch alvarez and two others patch had his knife was sawing at the painter kydd shouted and the chorus of snarls and laughter from the boat as it fell away left no doubt as to what they intended the oars came out and it disappeared quickly into the night what is it puffed merrick appearing next to him deserters kydd replied skelped th lookout an took the longboat who patch alvarez n a couple of others desertion was a continual worry for the navy a good seaman could greatly improve his wages in the merchant service or do even better by shipping out in a privateer theoretically it could be punished by death or worse flogging around the fleet but practical considerations usually led captains who recovered men to treat the offence lightly rather than lose a good hand but swaine get below an tell the captain merrick muttered without another boat there could be no pursuit kydd went down by the after companion and knocked at the door capn sir he called there was movement inside and the unmistakable clink of glass what is it came a hoarse reply through the closed door sir the longboats been taken b deserters at first there was no response then swaines angry face appeared deserters did y say deserters he pulled on his coat the thick odour of drink in the tiny cabin turned kydds stomach vile set o lubbers ill have yr livers at the gangway tmorrow try me like this the diatribe continued until swaine had made the upper deck where he staggered upright poxy crew thiss an aggravated offence an ill see you all at th yardarm so i will he shrieked into the darkness to his disgust kydd saw that swaine had on his naval officers coat but no breeches lurching along the deck forward swaine continued until he came to stirk still shackled to the mainhatch grating don ye dare cross my bows li that y scowbunkin brute he snarled kicking viciously at stirk who recoiled against the blow it threw swaine offbalance he flung out an arm to seize a shroud batten but missed and fell headlong into the sea the current carried him swiftly down the side of seaflower splashing and choking a line was thrown but swaine was in no condition to snatch it and within seconds he was disappearing into the dark astern the knot of men stood paralysed there was no boat to go to the rescue and nervous eyes turned to the boatswain we has to get under way an go after him merrick said shaken jarman appeared drawing on his shirt no we have blashy weather an coral under our lee no time t be standing in t the land in the dark y misses m point merrick said in a stronger voice and with a peculiar emphasis i says we have t get under way mr jarman jarman stared at the boatswain then his face turned masklike and he replied o course we must it was madness but there was a chilling reason for the dramatic play each of the warrant officers was acting a part knowing that every word and action would replay at the court of investigation that was certain to come haaands to unmoor ship stiles pipe was made in a complete and appalled silence the deck filling with apprehensive men no good would come of this night that much was clear but they would go through the motions all night if need be at noon the next day seaflower sombrely reversed her course after spending all night and the following morning searching for her captain his body was never found at port royal jarman and merrick both went to the flagship they swiftly returned and with them a lieutenant and file of marines seaflower was effectively under arrest the court of inquiry was over almost as quickly as it was convened the overwhelming number of witnesses made it so and it became clear that their evidence concerning swaine came not as a complete surprise kydd felt a pressing need to be out of seaflower ashore and somewhere different and when it was learned that the new captain would not be appointed for some time he lost no time in suggesting that he and renzi call on cecilia the housekeepers disapproving look was just the same but when cecilia hurried to the door kydd was amazed thomas my dear she cried gaily how sweet of you to call she kissed him soundly then noticed renzi with a bob and dropped eyes cec you look so er in rousin trim kydd said awkwardly and indeed there was colour in her cheeks her eyes held their usual sparkle and the warm vivacity of her nature shone through yes dear life must go on must it not she said quickly and you thomas are you not the picture of good health it was established that the men would stay for an evening meal cecilia quickly took charge i shall invite jane of course and i want you to meet her betrothed its so exciting dinner would be in the front parlour due to the unexpected number of guests and kydd helped the frosty housekeeper with the table as cecilia laid places and bustled about she told kydd and renzi her news lady charlotte thats the wife of lord frederick stanhope met me at mrs burchells rout the idea of a kydd meeting a noble lady socially was astonishing its the very place to meet people here in the colonies you know thomas it would never do in guildford would it her infectious laugh made renzi smile then she went on her manner a fetching mix of youth and sophistication and youd never guess she wants me to be her companion when they go travelling kydd said the expected and renzi murmured encouragement and she concluded with what looked suspiciously like a pout who knows who i may meet on our travels why there are gentlemen in this part of the world worth millions they sat down to table with only the barest discussion as to seating janes intended was a young ensign of foot in regimentals and quite at a loss when confronted with a requirement to sup with a brace of thoroughbred sailors wine er gentlemen he said stiffly thank you renzi said he twirled the glass elegantly before a candle i do find the margaux a martyr to travel this colour has a pallid quality perhaps not your foremost era kydd dabbed his lips with his napkin those weeks upcountry had not been wasted he raised his eyes and said unctuously yr claret is a sensitive flower o course fr mself a hardy burgundy would be more t my taste he added easily id recommend a chablis were we t be granted a breezemill in the cooling but yr very good health sir it was worth the pain of all renzis patient efforts just to see the expressions around the table chapter i names kernon said doud an i dont think were goin ter have the same kind o grief frm him he finished his seaming of the jib and bit the thread sides he sets me up as yeoman of the storeroom he added with satisfaction this made him a man of influence of some moment in the small ship for he was in charge of the boatswains seastores give y joy ned said kydd hed only been back on board an hour or two and there were definite signs of improvement about seaflower doggo smiled grudgingly o course we lost s many men b deserting capn just has to fin senior ands frm somewhere renzi came up on deck what cheer mate said doggo an whats the griff renzi acting as clerk to the captain would know ships secrets im not so certain that i should allow captain kernons confidences to become public property he said frowning kydd caught his quick wink publick wes yer backbone o the ship has t be in on th noos so we cn plan things out like cmon tell us what yer knows doggos hoarse wheedling brought a grin to kydds face renzi leaned forward and said earnesdy this must not get out its of the first importance to the future of this ship we understands mate said doggo eagerly ship is under sailing orders yeah we knows that and tonight renzi halted looking dubious yeah well it involves your own good self you understand strike me dead clap on more sail n get on wi it tonight but were so shorthanded doggo drew a deep breath but before he could erupt renzi ended that youre to lead a pressgang pressgang doggo spluttered kydd grinned broadly and thomas kydd is to assist him the grin vanished it was now years since kydd had been a victim of the press in the frigate artemis there had been no pressed men in her famous voyage around the world and since his lucky rescue from the dockyards to seaflower he had had no contact with pressed men now seaflower had to fall back on impressing hands from wherever she could where re we raidin do y think doud asked it was wellnigh impossible to attract good seamen to a kings ship in the caribbean there were too many betterpaid berths competing merchant ships commanded good rates to man ships for the atlantic run and privateers could rely on the lure of fat prizes kingston town id wager said doggo his face alive at the prospect of the entertainment port royalll be awake up ter the pressgang i cant do it nicholas kydd muttered into his grog at the noon meal i knows about it is all he finished lamely regarding him steadily renzi appreciated that kydd was exploring his feelings and needed to talk so pressing men is an unmitigated evil he said coolly i didnt say that kydd retorted some would say its nought but slavery so whats t do if theres not enough t man th fleet kydd said heatedly then he subsided youre turnin it all around as usual nicholas but you cant argue with me that tearin a man frm his family an all is a fine thing dammit renzi lifted his pot and said before taking a pull at his grog then may i hear what it is you propose in its place kydds slow smile was his answer and renzi grinned back so we are overborne by logic it is a disagreeable necessity while we cannot find any other means therefore you shall do your duty tonight as is your bounden obligation at an hour before midnight sealowers pressgang formed up on the waterfront of kingston town do ye mark what i say merrick said ye knows the rules no violence if they tries ter run tip em a settler on th calabash he seemed unperturbed by the contradiction but nodded at the nervous civilian next to him this ere is a sheriffs man come t see fair play plans were laid the sign of the mermaid would be their victim away from the centre of the waterfront and it was hoped to take hands from a merchant ship carousing after a long hard voyage across the atlantic the boatswain would stand back and allow doggo experienced at the pressgang to lead in when all exits had been covered kydd eased his broad belt with its cutlass this would only be drawn if things grew ugly and then there would be an accounting to the shore authorities the main persuaders the party carried were stretchers from the longboat the narrow lengths of wood against which the rowers braced their feet a brief memory of the horse and groom three years ago in guildford flashed by when sailors of a pressgang had burst in to change his life for ever but he had secretly to acknowledge that there was no question as to which life he now wanted so lets get under weigh grunted the boatswain and they padded off at the trot a few latenight citizens out on the street stared at the sailors and there were scurries in the shadows without speaking merrick indicated their positions outside the welllit seamens tavern from within a riot of noise surged and fell cackles of laughter and rumbles of conversation showing they were not expected but the operation would not be easy this was no gathering of unsuspecting rural lads the boatswain winked at doggo who threw open the door and thrust inside so whos fer a life on the rollin sea an we cn even save yez the trouble o payin yer reckoning he grated into the falling silence his stretcher tapped slowly in his palm a female screech pierced the blue haze the fuckin press there was instant pandemonium tables and chairs scattered as men leaped to their feet in their race for freedom into the chaos poured the seaflowers kydd right behind doggo sprang after one likely fellow and seized his collar managing to avoid a wildly swinging fist the man faced him glaring and panting now cully yr taken fair n square at this the man charged head down none too gently kydd tapped him on the head with his stretcher and he fell to all fours around them the scrimmage died away there was no contest between a sober determined pressgang and their fuddled victims merrick strode into the taproom looking pleased at the sight of the eight they had secured well boys its a life in the navy fer youse now but im remindin yer y cn still enter as a volunteer one of the eight saw the inevitability of the situation and accepted the offer but the others threw bitter looks at the seaflowers and stayed mute kydds man got to his feet slowly murder in his eyes two seaflowers began to hand him outside but at that moment there was a scuffle at the entrance and a dishevelled woman appeared heavily pregnant looking around wildly two ragamuffin children clutched her skirts wideeyed with fear no she shrieked when she saw the man not m billy you cant god save us leave im she threw herself at the feet of the boatswain her sobs harsh and piteous now then mdear yr husbands off t join seaflower y as fine a manowar as ever swam merrick stuttered clearly put out by the womans emotion one of the captives pushed forward god rot it leave jus billy cundy yer brute yer has enough the two children rushed to cundys side and clung to him crying brokenly leave us m billy an look on these innocents oh god what shall i do the woman sobbed into her pinafore and patted her belly meaningfully merrick shifted uncomfortably this is all very distressin i cn see that perhaps well stretch a point in th case of yr billy boy oh sir if yer cn see yer way clear the bantlingsll pray fer yr soul every night she tailed off when doggo and two others descended the stairs with two more prospectives still in their night attire what cheer sally doggo said with a grin taking in the scene he crossed over to her and the womans eyes widened fearfully with one hand he seized her wrists the other he forced up her skirt she screamed in outrage but doggo withdrew a large cushion which he flourished aloft still up ter yer tricks then y saucy tomrig her hands turned to claws as she flew at him but doggo held her at arms length until her struggles subsided take im out said merrick annoyed at being caught out but the mood in the taproom had changed rapidly from laughter at the deception to a very real anger billy cundy whipped round to the others they aint about t take billy boy wiout they has a fight an if we get took one b one its all over wi us our only chance is a fair fight all together he threw himself at kydd and they went down together the tavern exploded into riot lanterns were caught and doused screams and hoarse curses mixing with the splintering of furniture in the gloom kydd landed a punch on the side of cundys head but was enveloped in a beery bearhug this allowed his wife to sit astride kydds back while she seized his hair and yanked it back agonisingly a barrelling body abruptly relieved kydd of her weight the tears in his eyes clearing kydd set about subduing cundy but the riotous diversion had attracted others from outside and the pressgang found itself outnumbered the boatswains piercing call of belay sounded urging them to retreat while they could cundy nose bloody but still full of fight laughed coarsely in kydds face kydd saw red he pulled the man to his feet and hooked him by his torn shirt aye but yere with us cully fending off flying bodies he propelled the man to the door where two seaflowers secured his thumbs behind his back with spunyarn the boatswain brought a charging man to a sudden stop with an efficient straightarm blow and giving one last look around left kydd and his prize following outside a crowd was gathering menacing the sailors who looked anxiously at the boatswain move he said harshly the sheriffs man was nowhere to be seen surrounding their victims the seaflowers bullied them off down the street screaming women throwing dirt after them while gleeful children ran alongside the tumult settled only when they boarded their boat and shoved off small pickins fer our troubles grumbled one sailor for all the sore heads and bloody noses there were only three men to show cundy the volunteer and one other the remainder of their catch lost in the roughandtumble this would hardly count in the need to replace the deserters who had taken the first opportunity to run after the cutter had made port mates it aint over yet an i has me spies out doggo said hopefully but it was a long pull back to seaflower in anticipation of a haul of pressed men she had anchored with the fleet and its regular pinnace rowguard so you has information the boatswain said doubtfully an reliable answered doggo youll unnerstan i has t sweeten m man after like we will said the boatswain shortly th press musters at three bells this forenoon kydd reserved judgement on the wisdom of a raid in full daylight they headed off not for kingston but to port royal scornful jeers met their landing and taunts followed their progress through the shabby streets here we is doggo said with a frown he consulted his paper his tipoff turned out to be a coopers yard near the dockyard wall with the usual twostorey living quarters within this yer information said merrick contemptuously the seaflowers were in strength doud stirk and stiles ready for anything but looked illatease at the risk of being made a laughing stock doggo looked confused but rallied well ave prime manhuntin here mr merrick me man says as how therell be nine top hands restin quietly after a long vyge an all unsuspectin be sure on it seamen took up positions and the pressgang entered the yard some coopers knocking down barrels into their constituent staves for better portability at sea looked up doggo pushed through them to the twostorey dwelling and thrust inside kydd and the others following close behind three women in the front parlour paused in their darning of coarse sea stockings but there were no men anywhere the sailors swung out to the stairs on the outside of the house and clattered up bursting into the first bedroom they found should ye be wantin a dose of the yellow fever yere welcome said a doctor easing a poultice on to the poor wretch writhing in pain the sailors whitened and left hurriedly gingerly they entered another bedroom but this one held an old woman rocking in her chair and her daughter at a large cradle stap me but youve led us a rare dance mate snarled merrick to doggo the women looked on quite as if they were used to having their privacy invaded by hard seamen with cudgels and cutlasses the daughter smiled demurely at kydd who blushed even stirk seemed abashed his big hands shifting awkwardly aaah he said and crossed to the cradle to pay his respects the daughters smile disappeared and the old lady stopped rocking aah dear liddle diddums stirk stretched to tickle the infant under the chin then straightened abrupdy be buggered an thats th biggest baby i seen in m life he wrenched away the covers revealing a lithe lad with all the muscular development to be expected of a firstclass topman the youngster leaped up only to be collared by a laughing stirk the old womans race to the stairs was astonishing to see but in vain and the daughter had no chance with kydd take her he told a nearby seaflower toby i got a feelin the yellow jack next doors goin to recover a mort sharpish there would be no danger for kydd if he were wrong for he of course had lifelong immunity the women darning had broken for the street but had easily been rounded up under the dumbfounded gaze of the coopers in the yard dont ye give no mind t us kydd called as they passed but merrick stopped he turned to face the coopers they went back reluctantly to work under his gaze but the boatswain did not move on his unblinking stare seemed to make the workers nervous they had finished knocking down the barrels to staves and now should take up tools to shape the raw wood of a cask head but they shamefacedly tailed off come along wi me then my little lambs the boatswain said captain kernon could not have been more of a contrast to seaflowers previous commanders a grey cautious lieutenant he smacked of reliability before initiative his words to the ships company on reading his commission were careful and considerate but were notable more for the do nots than the do this seaflower left port royal with her pennant streaming bound for the spanish main across the width of the caribbean but to renzis disappointment it seemed they would not be touching on the vast continent to the south with its lure of amazing wild creatures and history of blood and conquest instead as kydd explained having studied their passage plans with jarman they were to reconnoitre aruba an island off the mouth of the vast gulf of venezuela a dutch island renzi said with interest are they not our friends kydd remembered hazily that the united provinces had been one of the first to declare an alliance with britain in the feverish times in the days following the guillotining of the french king i believe not renzi said ah so chance o plunder stirk growled not as who would say renzi continued if you remember the french invaded last year and we now must call their country the batavian republic so its french again we cannot say i saw recently that william the fifth who is your stadtholder of holland has crossed the channel seeking refuge at king georges court he still rules or so we must accept i think it an imprudent commander who makes the assumption that his possessions are for their plundering they are our allies asked kydd in disbelief it is safe to say that they are neither our friends nor our enemies i rather fancy that our enterprise is one of prudent enquiry spying said kydd judicious reconnaissance the ship sailed on knifing through the slight swell southward and kydd felt contentment build seaflower seemed to realise this and lay more snugly to the quartering wind the hiss of her passage always at the same eager pitch but rising and falling in volume kydd sent the helmsman below for an early supper and took the helm himself letting the recurved tiller press against his hip with the slight weather helm out to starboard a fine sunset promised he and renzi would probably sit on the mainhatch gratings and see out the dogwatches in companionable conversation muffled laughter eddied up from below as supper was served at the mess tables the watch on deck sat forward little to do but spin yarns and watch the night steal in reluctantly kydd gave up the tiller to the relief helmsman and murmured the handover mantra to the quartermasters mate relieving him together with the slate of course details luke arrived with a plate of supper and he joined renzi forward the golden sunset spread gradually and silently to a vast scarlet spectacle an unfolding heavenly splendour perfectly unobstructed to the far bounds of the darkling seas it was not a time for idle talk and the two friends took their victuals in appreciative silence when luke came with their grog pots renzi took out his clay pipe and prepared it letting the fragrance of the smoke drift away until it was whisked into nothing by the higher stream of air above the bulwarks little enough chance of a prize he said idly at first kydd didnt reply then he gave a small smile and still gazing at the copper ball of the sinking sun said but ye have other things in y sea life nicholas a sight better than town or country alike these troubling times aye said kydd his eyes still on the majesty of the sunset nicholas ive been thinkin over what y said before he said slowly about betterin mself he eased himself to a more comfortable position i own that it would be very agreeable t see mself in a gunroom as masters mate an in course o time to take m ticket with trinity house as sailin master is that idle dreamin do ye think a master in the royal navy was as high as it was professionally possible for a seaman to go he had his own cabin and advised the captain himself kydd was a natural seaman having the skills and rare combination of moral courage in a decision with an instinctual understanding of the sea yet he was only a few years into the seaservice but that by fortunate coincidence in some of the most testing regions of the globe it would not be impossible indeed it is not given the time and opportunity dear fellow renzi smiled who knows this war is spreading like a canker over europe and its dominions soon england will be wanting every man of skill and enterprise to man its fleets your course is set fair for the greatest things kydds secret smile did not escape renzi you may find it happens sooner than you expect he added shifting uncomfortably kydd hesitated then said rattlin good news from cecilia she meetin this lady stanhope an being rated companion dye think shell make a good un in turn renzi paused inasmuch as she values politeness above all things a quality her brother is only now achieving yes she has the vivacity or we might say the liveliness of wit that the position requires he said drily when the smoky blue of aruba island rose grand and distant in the shimmering sea the next day seaflower shortened sail and altered away to stand off and on until night stole in mr jarman i will not risk the vessel by closing on oranjested kernon announced jarman looked uncomfortable this was taking caution to the limit a cutter like seaflower had reconnaissance as one of its main purposes and risks had to be taken the harbour might well have a larger warship ready to put to sea in chase but this was an acceptable part of their duty i have it in mind to despatch the longboat to oversee the port kernon continued this was hard on the boats crew but would reduce the risk to seaflower i will need a steady hand to command one with the sea knowledge and the skill to navigate the boat there and back to the rendezvous kydd stepped forward and touched his hat sir i have m figurin an can do this kernon said nothing ignoring kydd and continuing to regard jarman gravely itll be me who takes th boat o course sir jarman said calmly youll have yr chance in good time lad please be s good as to assist the captain sir kydd is a fine quartermaster and knows his charts i leave him with ye thank you mr jarman i knew i could rely on you kydd please to wait on me presently with the charts we approach the island at dusk the reality was more perturbing than kydd had imagined the sea details to be won from the austere lines of a chart the bearings tide sets implied wind variants inshore were exercises in imagination compared to the reality on deck a moonless night the longboat bobbing alongside being boarded by jarman and four men who must push off into the blackness and trust that seaflower would be in exactly the same position for their return the quiet faith of others in his powers this was the true end of his sea learning a barricoe of water was passed down they would be holed up for a day in the craggy hills overlooking the port and would rendezvous the next night there was little chatter and when jarman was ready he climbed into the boat settled his hat and ordered bear off forard give way together the boat slipped into the darkness and out of human ken kydds farewell wave faltered when jarman did not look back seaflowers sheets were taken up and she surged ahead safely out to sea on a fixed course at a calculated time she would reverse her heading and run down the line back to this position in theory the wind dying or freshening and her speed over the ground would be different an unsuspected current in these heated tropical seas roiling to the surface at rightangles to their course would displace her bodily from her intended track even the shape and strength of waves at different aspects of the hull would result in a deflecting kydd watched intently as the watch prepared to launch the logship this triangular float would be cast astern with a logline to measure the ships speed kydd himself held the twentyeightsecond sandglass and when the logship had exactly reached its mark he instantly inverted it and stared at it by the small light of a darklanthorn the logline whipped away from the roller held above his head by a seaman until kydd saw the last sand grains slipping away stand by he growled the glass emptied nip he bawled and the point reached by the logline was noted the number of knots tied at equal distance that passed out with the line would give the speed directly while his crew hauled in the wet logline kydd chalked in the speed on the slate and set about worrying over the wind direction kernon was cautious but considerate he treated kydd like a master consulting and discussing allowing kydds concerns but meeting them with his greater experience the next day wore on and the evening drew in now was the testing time whether the miracle could take place of a conjuncture in the dark out at sea of the two craft in the last of the light as they headed in once more kydd yet again took bearings of the headland and single islet that he had selected as his seamarks additionally using jarmans octant to determine their angle laterally fixing their position by triangulation the geometry was not onerous but still intimidated kydd and he was grateful for renzis easy way with the formulae he was only just beginning to see them not as some kind of machine that took in raw ingredients and out the other end came a neat and finished product now he could with renzis insights dimly discern the elegance and fine reasoning behind them the moonless night was impenetrable the soughing breeze and shipboard noises reducing awareness to a narrow circle of perceptions the boat might be either in their path or passing blindly by mr merrick said kernon consulting his fob watch there was fumbling in the gloom and sparks flew in the wind a red glow and fizzing then a blinding blue light issued from a wooden tube held aloft by a seaman the acrid smoke caused kydd to choke but the ghostly blue radiance shone out into the night in a goblin splendour and threw the vast mainsail into a stark pale relief the tube spluttered busily and hissed pouring towers of cloud downwind each man on deck motionless and bathed in the unearthly light deck hooo the cry from forward was quickly followed by the challenge booooat ahoy and a faint cry from out in the blackness seaflower altered course and her company was made whole once more their welcome at port royal was puzzling a lowly cutter returning from her servile duties yet before she had taken up her moorings her number was hung out importantly on the flagship summoning her captain and a pinnace pulled energetically from the shore barbados an not a moment t be lost the dockyard functionary said with relish lord n lady stanhope an one other kydd recognised the name with a start and before captain kernon returned from the flagship cecilia was aboard gazing warily about her something about her manner repelling kydds greeting the boatswain called tersely for kydd as the senior hand responsible for stowage of the hold do you consult miss er cecilia concernin the passage o the noble gennelman he ordered cecilias eyes flashed a warning as she drew herself up that is kind in you mr er kydd this way miss kydd mumbled holding his hat awkwardly and led the way to the broad midships cecilia thomas please cecilia hissed i cannot acknowledge you as kin you must understand that it were best that we stay at a distance if you please she looked around warily it is not often fortune smiles on such as we and i will not allow this opportunity to slip through my fingers kydd smiled bleakly while cecilia continued and besides youve no need for concern on my behalf i rather like lady stanhope shes kind and good she looked at him with a touch of defiance but more a plea for understanding kydd straightened with a grin then miss cecilia wed better be about yr masters business his sister was gratifyingly practical it was urgent that lord stanhope reach barbados as soon as possible to take ship for england on a matter of some high diplomacy the details of which would be disclosed no doubt to captain kernon on his return there was no expectation of special treatment it was known that seaflower was a small but fast vessel best suited for the purpose and cecilia had personally seen that their baggage would not exceed four seachests in all they themselves would board only when seaflower was ready the wherry with the chests arrived at that instant and kydd tasked off three seamen to rig a tackle and sway them aboard kernon returned in some degree of distraction giving immediate orders that his day cabin and bedplace be turned over to his noble passengers arrangements for others to be put in train in due course seaflower had to be stored for the passage and her extra passengers and kydd was hard put to plan the stowage and as well take in private stores required en voyage a polite message came off from the shore enquiring whether four pm would be a convenient time to board cecilias approval of the cabins and kydds report on stowage allowed kernon to send a civil reply a great honour my lord kernon said very politely lord frederick stanhope was a thin man with oddly black eyebrows against his snowwhite hairand a slight stoop his eyes were penetrating thank you captain for accommodating us at such a notice stanhope replied his voice was soft but clear his wife looked every inch the grand lady and kernon visibly shrank at the duty of greeting her sir i will show you to your cabins he said with a bow but lady stanhope cut him off with a flourish of her gloved hand nonsense im sure cecilia knows the boat by now you have much more important work to do tempus fugit captain cecilia moved up silently on cue kernon took the hint and without delay the boatswains mate was pealing his call haaands to unmoor ship seaflower readied herself for sea kydd took position at the conn and heard a last interchange as cecilia helped lady charlotte down the nearvertical ladder below young lady i was travelling in boats before you were born do not fret so seaflower weighed in late afternoon and breasting the tide slipped along the colourful palisades to the untidy clutter of buildings at the tip port royal and fort charles then gybed for the passage south ifn ye pleases the boatswain rumbled indicating to the interested party emerging on deck that they were to occupy the more spacious midships area kydd had used some forethought a grinning doud stood by to warn the noble group should the mainsail boom decide to traverse the deck in an untimely fashion they emerged into the open sea past reefs and islets which jarman took delight in pointing out gun cay salt pond reef drunken mans cay turtle heads all well known hazards to kydd who remained alongside the helmsman with a sharp eye his gaze strayed occasionally to cecilia who stood at ease with lady stanhope clearly enjoying the experience seaflower lifted gently to the broader swells of the caribbean when kydd was free to hand over the conn but it was passing strange to see his sister in such a context jamaica became an anonymous patchwork of green and brown and kernon approached stanhope we strike south first m lord in the central caribbean we shall not be annoyed by corsairs or privateers we then alter to th east and should make landfall in barbados in no more than three or four days for agreeable to your request i shall bend on all sail for a fast passage thank you captain stanhope answered courteously now my wife is wondering would it be convenient if perhaps we supped on deck rather than in the cabinnot that our accommodation is in the least objectionable he added hastily of course sir said kernon with a wrinkled forehead this was not an easy thing to achieve in a lively cutter however might i take this opportunity to present petty officer renzi whom i have detailed as your personal aide and master luke who will be your servant renzi stepped forward the elegance of his small bow incongruous in his plain seafaded seamans gear he did not look at cecilia my lord he said quietly lady stanhope smiled then glanced at her husband who had a preoccupied expression what is it frederick she asked curiously stanhopes face cleared nothing m dear he said lightly under the interested gaze of the watch on deck a table was brought up from the masters cabin to be lashed into place next to the main gratings and both cabins were deprived of chairs so supper could then be spread could i suggest the veal and ham pie and cold tongue m lady cecilia said standing by eyeing lukes efforts with the cloth and cudery doubtfully and the orange custard will not keep of course charlotte lord stanhope extended an arm to his wife and politely helped her to her place which in keeping with other seaservice furniture was compact and neat oh mr renzi would you be so good as to open a hock for lord stanhope said cecilia looking at him through her eyelashes lady charlotte watched the evening sea hiss past from her chair and sighed how wonderful frederick just we two again she turned to cecilia and smiled sweetly my dear cecilia on this small boat we simply cannot stand on ceremony be so good as to join us at supper blushing cecilia took her seat to the side and glared secretly at the grinning luke a glass with you my dear said stanhope she accepted graciously careful not to look at the waiting renzi standing silently in the shadows abreast the fore windlass lady stanhope leaned forward her face alive dont look now dear girl but i do believe that youve made a conquest of that handsome sailor at the back of the boat unable to resist cecilia snatched a glance and saw kydd looking at her along the length of the deck from the helm i i shall beware milady she stammered they made good time and before noon the next day had shaped course eastwards to barbados the trade winds coming comfortably from the beam jarman came on deck with a serious expression sir th glass is dropping oneeighth inch since port royal an still going kernon considered his brow furrowing the reading now twentynine an threefourths im not happy sir but is this not your usual for these waters kernon seemed unwilling to face the implication lord stanhope will not look kindly on any delay mr jarman sir but kernons face was troubled as he returned to his guests lady charlotte and cecilia thrilled at their leaping passage they were standing right in the bows gripping a stay mesmerised by the rush of glittering sea lord stanhope near the helm remained preoccupied should the weather turn out for the worse we may have to delay m lord kernon said hesitating stanhope turned but did not speak that is we face a blow of sorts across our path which could be you will make the right decision of course captain bearing in mind the urgency of my mission which i now feel obliged to point out is of the utmost moment for the safety of england as if to underline the point he drew out his fine watch and consulted it i understand my lord kernons grey features set in worry and he trudged off along the deck within the hour the horizon across their path subtly changed in character to the low band of silver and dark grey of the familiar rain curtains there was now added a trace of menace a tingeing of the clouds with tiny subliminal amounts of copper verdigris kydd had seen this before and reacted at a primal level sir we must return t port royal jarmans forceful plea beat at kernons resolve while seaflower plunged on gaily with her sails flat the taut rigging harping musically we must put about now sir anxious looks were now being directed aft by seamen who knew of the animal savagery of sea scourged by giant winds kydd stole a look at the helmsman and was comforted by his stolid performing of duty we put back to port royal kemon announced it was a measure of his worry that he omitted first to consult stanhope ease sheets and we take in the topsail bear off t leeward and set course um nor nor west he seemed easier having made a decision seaflowers speed fell off and the ladies looked aft curiously if you please ladies kernon called he explained to the group what had to be done lord stanhope frowned but said nothing and cecilia darted a quick look at her brother kydd spoke quietly to jarman in trajan we could never outrun a revolvin storm we worked out its position an then it was tear away in the safest direction fr us jarman nodded aye but in such a cockleshell we needs to go further these tropic storms are monsters an go at such a gallopin pace its not only th centre we needs to worry about its where theyre headed we plots the centre every hour an works out a path where its going an hope t god to outwit the infernal beast the ugly skies loomed frighteningly quickly the ladies stopped their marvelling and stared soberly at the massing hideousness astern fear struck at the sight of what nature was bringing out from its sack of terrors on deck seamen secured as best they could the cutter was dead before the wind and slashed ahead at an insane rate like a hunted animal trying to flee a carnivore but the bearing shifted slowly but surely about the starboard quarter a rainspot spattered the folded chart that jarman had brought from below the tiny dots inside circles were their plot of the path of the storm marching across from the east and curving north this is th worst fr us jarman murmured his face had a strange detached calm that struck a shaft of icy fear through kydd that devil will go between us an port royal theres no returning there now they struck south every sail drawing then southwest into the vague direction of the reefstrewn interior of the western caribbean anything to keep from the path of the rampaging monster by the dogwatches the vast dark roiling masses of cloud had reached overhead and the wind had turned edgy and fitful a presentiment forced itself on kydds mind born of his sea knowledge his increasing empathy with the deep this was going to be the time when it would claim its price for that understanding a hard price that he knew might be his life and then he thought of cecilia and felt a hot misery sir if you could go below it would ease our worries at this time kernon said distracted lord stanhope looked about to demur but lady stanhope took him by the arm we are together frederick never forget that we will see this through with each other my love she kissed him come you shall read to me captain any news of course my lady they turned away arm in arm cecilia paused for a moment looking into kydds eyes he felt helpless in the face of emotions that women seemed to meet with such nobility her eyes dropped and she went to him clinging soundlessly for a long time tell me when she said in a muffled voice the lump in his throat prevented kydd answering but he squeezed her hard the cutter lurched under a spiteful gust haaands to shorten sail they could not run any more cec he could think of nothing to say and she pulled herself away and staggered over the deck to the after hatchway one last long look and she disappeared below to face whatever unseen madness was in store lifelines rigged fore and aft square sails struck lines prepared for trapping pumps checked there was not much they could achieve in their little ship kydd remembered the violence of a hurricane from the decks of a ship ten times the size in this they would not survive but they could meet their fate with courage and dignity they lost dead reckoning when the horizon closed about them in a welter of white from now on they might be anywhere flying endlessly from nowhere into nothing in the cruel and uncaring storm kydd remembered a true storm being painted by his first sea friend so long ago it was seared on his memory comes a time when yer knows that theres a chance yer might not live sea jus tears at the barky like it was an animal no mercy atall bowyers irongrey deepsea mariners appearance had reassured him then but now the moaning wind turned to a banshee ululation driving spray into kydds face with a stinging spite that made it almost impossible to see merrick levered himself aft shouting in the ear of every seaman he could find in turn he came to kydd it was the closing act the last remaining scraps of sail would shortly be torn away and with it any control over their fate seaflower was going to stream a seaanchor this was a drag on a line over the bows that would bring them around bows to the sheeting chaos the final move kydds part would be to bring them up into the wind at the right moment after which his role as quartermaster of seaflower would no longer have any meaning the tiller had relieving tackles seized to its end kydd could dimly perceive crouched on the deck the hunched bodies of the seamen who must haul on these through saltsore eyes in the screaming wind he made out the jerking figures of those working in the bows seas smashed in burying them under white torrents a hand waved kydd sensed the seas then flung his arm at the larboard men they hauled and fell staggering and fighting at the tackle but the bows came round into the blast the scrap of canvas met the wind endon and flogged itself to death in an instant but seaflowers bow remained headed faithfully into the tempest it could not last at the point when sky and sea were unrecognisable apart the seaanchor gave way seaflowers bows rose like a frightened horse then fell away in a sickening wallow the vessel now free of any constraint kydd was aware that beside him merrick was fumbling he was casting loose his lashing his lifeline the boatswain clawed his way forward a hopeless heroic thing for seaflower it seemed was now more under water than above nearly to the focsle he was taken by a wave clinging to the side he was mercilessly battered by the waterfall until his grip was broken and he was dragged into the rage of sea kydd caught sight of him only once as he sped past the boatswains face a frozen rictus of puzzlement as he went to his death a numb unreal feeling crept over kydd paradoxically insulating him from the insanity intellectually he knew that once the blast caught seaflower broadside on she would roll over perhaps once twice then all life in her would be extinguished all the struggling all the care the pity all would be over then a dark lump intruded itself into his vision clawing across the deck to him in these last moments left to them he pulled cecilia to him her lovely dark hair now plastered across her skull the dress a torn and useless rag he felt her trembling violently as he passed his lifeline around them both and gulped at the sheer unfairness of it that such an innocent should suffer a sailors lonely end seaflowers bow swayed off wind instantly the blast took her and she staggered beaten she began a roll her high side caught more of the hurricane and the roll increased faster and faster kydd hung from his lifeline as the leeward seas rushed to meet them he turned to cecilias upturned face and pantomimed a huge breath she seemed to understand but then the seas engulfed them both in a roaring endless finality that was strangely peaceful they could no longer hear the murderous hurricane he felt cecilia struggle in the dreamy underwater peace he knew that she was drowning he bent his head and forced his breath into her mouth and prepared for his own end but suddenly he was aware of a whipping hectoring worry at his skin they had come upright and the wind was clawing at him once more seaflower now had her stern towards the wind the roll would return when they passed the midpoint it was the moment between life and death a surreal halfway existence that allowed for the sight of the bow surging up at an impossible angle fleeting dark shapes flicking by poking above the rushing seas the tidal surge paused deposited seaflower gently among stormtossed coconut palms then retreated the cutter was held rock solid in the arms of the land chapter in stupefied immobility kydd waited the long night not daring to slacken his lifeline or loosen his grip on cecilia the winds howled unceasing the fabric of the vessel trembled and shuddered but seaflower was immovably high and dry among the palm trees which whipped furiously in the outer darkness a wild dawn crept in with it came a true appreciation of what had happened the improving visibility showed them a good two or three hundred yards inland quite upright held there by the densely growing palms of some unknown island their small size had enabled them to surf over the offshore reefs and be carried safely ashore a deeper hulled vessel would have grounded and been smashed to flinders seaflower had brought them through safe and sound tears pricked at kydd cecilia stirred her eyes opened and he saw to his astonishment that she had been sleeping he didnt trust himself to speak but cecilia said something he bent to hear against the dismal moan of the wind thomas please dont think to speak of this to mama she does worry so they laughed and cried together in the emotion of the moment and kydd loosened the cruel bite of the lifeline the fore hatchway opened a head popped out to look around and untidy bundles around the deck began to stir kydd moved his limbs and stared out at the ruinous scene where was renzi a wild fluctuation of feeling was replaced by overwhelming relief when his friends features came into frame at the after hatchway and doomed to death though fated not to die renzi said with great feeling cecilia got to her feet futilely trying to smooth her torn dress in the still blustery winds pray excuse me gentlemen i fear im not fit to be seen in polite company she smiled at renzi and lowered herself awkwardly down the hatch movement was now general about the stranded cutter kernon appeared and jarman there was an attempt to reach the sodden ground beneath by rope and after an exchange of shouts kernon was lowered by a tackle followed by snead and his bag of tools renzi stretched and groaned immured in those infernal regions waiting for anything this i will not relive ever again i would rather it were ended by my jumping overboard than endure that once more while the gale moderated to strong winds seaflower came to life an absurd and outofkilter existence but life her company assembled on the ground among the ragged tossing palms they looked up to the naked bulk of their ship and gave heartfelt thanksgiving for their deliverance then blessed naval discipline enfolded them the first act was a muster of all hands remarkably few souls lost but a number had tried to drink themselves into oblivion then the vessel was stabilised with shores there was no shortage of palm trunks lying flattened and splintered ideal for the task lord stanhope had suffered a fall in the storm and now lay injured tended by lady stanhope other unfortunates had broken bones cracked ribs but they were young the noble lord in his seventies was facing an uncertain future initial scouting had established that the island was an undistinguished lumpy specimen of some indeterminate miles around and as far as it was possible to tell uninhabited springs of water had been found and goat droppings promised fresh meat immediate dangers over it was time to take stock your best estimate of where we are mr jarman kernon asked sir both chronometers did not survive th storm this was bad news latitude was easy enough to determine given a sighting of the sun but longitude was another matter and i do not carry tables o the kind that i cn work a lunar i see said kernon it was fundamental to the strategics of their plight that they knew their position and his frown deepened jarman took a deep breath as far as i cn judge an this is before a good observation o the sun we are t the south n west o jamaica distance i cannot know he paused then continued there are no islands in th central caribbean but many in the west the path o the hurricanoe was from th nor east but you will know their path often curves north or not sir this is my best estimate south an west o jamaica kernon contemplated it for a moment then turned to snead the ship nothin that cant let er swim but we aint agoin to see that wiout help he pointed at the two hundred yards of dry land down to the sea anythin the size of a frigate cn tow us off but fer now in the rude shelter where he lay stanhope stifled a cry of pain desire renzi to attend me if you would my dear he whispered his wife knew better than to object when they returned he said firmly charlotte i wish to speak to mr renzi alone stanhope looked up at renzi with the ghost of a smile we have met i believe he said in stronger tones in different circumstances as i recall renzi did not recall but there was no point in denying it it was the merest chance that brought together a foremast hand and a peer of the realm but it had happened your father is no friend to the government as you must agree but i have always believed his son to be made of straighter grain his smile faded and he winced at the pain you will have your reasons for decamping from your situation i have no doubt they seem sufficiently persuasive to me my lord it would be my honour to be privy to them it was an impertinence but stanhopes penetrating eyes held his unblinkingly this was no idle enquiry renzi felt that deeper matters hung on his reply concisely and with the least possible detail he spoke of the moral decision leading to his period of exile stanhope heard him out in respectful silence thank you renzi my supposition was not in error he paused clearly recruiting his strength for a higher purpose i shall respect your position completely and with all discretion and may i express my deepest sense of your action thank you my lord it serves to reassure me of what i am about to do he bit his lip levered himself up to his elbows and looked directly at renzi it is of the first importance the very first i say for me to reach england the reason is that i have intelligence of certain actions planned by the spaniards to do us a great mischief immediately war is declared war of course it is planned to move against us once certain matters are in hand but you can be assured that war is imminent renzis mind raced spanish possessions ringed the caribbean and a whole continent to the south and he could think of a hundred mischiefs possible against unsuspecting islands i have no despatches it is too dangerous he looked soberly at renzi i am not sanguine as to my personal survival and it is a heavy concern to me that my intelligence die with me renzi said nothing but feared what would come i must now make all particulars known to you under the strictest confidence that you can conceive renzi yes my lord a loathing of dissimulation made him unfit for the role of intelligence renzi knew but there was little he could do to avoid this duty it may happen that i am able to reach england deo volente but if not then i do require that you make known your intelligence to mr congalton at the foreign office by any means you can contrive i will he coughed once and lay back every day lost racks at my soul what are our chances of an early return to civilisation do you think sir this is something for captain kernon to disclose but i should not be hopeful of a speedy resolution stanhope groaned whether in frustration or pain it was difficult to know nevertheless do you please attend now the essence of this spanish plot is satisfied with his immediate steps in the situation kernon strode across the clearing to lord stanhopes shelter to see renzi emerging is lord stanhope at liberty to see me he asked i do believe he will be more than happy to do so sir said renzi but you will be aware that he is considerably out of countenance owing to his indisposition kernon entered removing his hat sir do you wish a report on our situation thank you i have good news kernon began we have found two springs of water and there are goats on the island we shall neither starve nor suffer want of water in large this amounts to an inconvenience only my lord but our chances of rescue captain equally good im happy to say the master believes us to be somewhere in the southwestern caribbean this means that we are on the sailing route taken by the logwood traders of campeche and also the hide droghers of honduras it is only a matter of time before we are sighted and port royal alerted of our plight in any event at this moment i have no doubt they are combing the seas for you our vessel is unharmed and we have only to wait tor how long sir kernon considered i am confident that within a very few weeks we shall be found a month or two at the most damnation the vigour of his response brought a flinch at the pain captain i have every reason to desire an early return you must believe can we not use the boat kernon looked shocked i do not recommend such a course of action at all my lord the hazards are many and here we may comfortably await our rescue without risk what hazards why sir where would we go without we know where we are if we sail north in the expectation that jamaica is there and miss it we face a hard trip to cuba if to the northeast we may fetch up against san domingo and a french prison yes yes but it is possible but most inadvisable captain kernon i want you to understand that i must make the attempt my lord prepare the boat sir i will not be denied if you insist i do you will need seamen to navigate i shall myself command you must remain with your ship and so must your only other officer is there no other who can figure a course the effort was draining his strength he grew pale there may be kernon said reluctantly and passed the word for seaflowers quartermaster when kydd appeared he said i cannot order you to do this kydd but are you able to undertake to navigate in a boat voyage to the nearest inhabited place as determined by mr jarman i am sir kydd replied seriously the decision taken it was short work to manhandle the longboat to the sandy foreshore the seas were still up but would almost certainly be navigable in the morning the longboat was eighteen feet in length and could carry fourteen men with its eight oars on the sand it seemed large and commodious enough but kydd knew that launched into the vastness of the sea it would magically shrink it would be rigged for sailing a common practice for wide harbours and brisk winds slooprigged with a single mast and runner backstays but with an extensible bowsprit that would allow it to hoist the two headsails of a cutter as seamen padded down with the equipment and began erecting masts tightening shrouds and shipping rudders kydd looked thoughtfully at his first command at the very least he would heed navigating gear jarman and he had held conclave for a long time reasoning finally that the safest assurance of a civilised landfall was to the southeast the coast of the continent of south america a guaranteed unbroken landmass across their path that had a scattering of spanish settlements continuously along it renzi had been unusually positive that in his opinion the spaniards had not opened hostilities and that the high status of their passenger would compel immediate assistance a boatcompass would suffice to keep a straight track but jarman pressed his cherished octant on kydd ye could be grateful t run a latitude down he said youll be able t return it when yr done stores for a voyage of up to a week were found renzi came down the beach with a small package we need food for the spirit as well he said packing it up under a convenient thwart youre coming kydd said with pleasure and why not to leave you to enjoy the wonders of the new continent while i remain idle this is asking too much kydd grinned suspecting that renzis motives came at least in part from the knowledge that kydd would need a watchkeeping relief at the tiller doud had volunteered to work the sails and could always sleep between activity but there would be no rest for the man at the helm more than that he knew he would be thankful for real intelligence and cool thought to assist him if it came to decisions that might mean life or death could we perhaps contrive an awning for lord stanhope we can take our rest sitting athwart renzi suggested the beam of the longboat was nearly six feet and with sails as padding they could lie quite comfortably braced around the sides of the boat at first light kydd was down at the longboat checking every line and fitting the awning sewn during the night was tried and declared a success as was the sliding stretcher hanging below the thwarts it was time kernon and lady stanhope accompanied lord stanhope down to the boat their faces set and grave cecilia followed with lastminute comforts for the men while stirk carried the heavy water barricoes himself my darling charlotte bent to her husband and whispered to him while others averted their eyes stanhopes reply was sad but resolute no my dearest grant me this only that of all things i will have the confidence that you are safe from harm i must go alone and with gods grace we shall prevail her hands squeezed his then let go we must put you aboard now my lord said kernon sounding choked the boat was drawn up at the waters edge the tumbling seas looked colder and more inimical and glances seaward showed that kydd was not alone in his feelings stirk came up shuffling his feet in uncharacteristic awkwardness yere a chuckleheaded sawney as ever i saw tom but i honours yez for it he said in a low voice keep lucky cock an well step off on a spree some time it seemed that the whole ships company of seaflower was gathered as lord stanhope was placed tenderly in his stretcher his wife stood motionless her stricken eyes fixed on her husband cecilia pushed forward i shall go with him she declared firmly he needs care kindly wait while i fetch a few necessaries its thats impossible miss cecilia said kernon scandalised nonsense i will accompany his lordship you know that i must if he is to be of use to any on whatever mission this is that requires so much urgency lady charlotte clasped cecilia and began softly my dear impatient cecilia told her quietly i know we are in the very best hands lady stanhope do not concern yourself any further on our behalf we will be quite safe she hesitated a moment then said gently you see kydd is my brother thomas lady stanhope arrangements concluded stout hands were applied to the gunwales and the boat entered the still whitedashed waters rearing and bobbing cecilia was handed aboard doud heaved himself into the bows and kydd and renzi took their places aft a signal to doud had the foresail soaring up the stay and while kydd setded in the sternsheets with the tiller renzi cautiously showed main canvas to the brisk wind a lurch to leeward and the boat started seaward a bumpy swooping scurry until they crossed the outer breakers then the sea winds took hold and they lay to the blow heading for the open sea kydd thought only then to look astern to see the dots of people lining the diminishing shore the scattered waving the forlorn bulk of seaflower in the midst of the battered palms he held up his hand in farewell and saw a flutter of kerchiefs in return then turned forward his face hardening in resolution cecilia was doing something for lord stanhope and renzi was busy tying off on the lines doud stepped carefully around them at his approach kydd steeled himself for bad news but doud grinned down at him from a midship thwart hanging on to one of the shrouds he gave an exulting whoop and began singing farewell and adieu to you spanish ladies farewell and adieu you ladies of spain for weve orders for england you boldeyed and lovely but we know in a short time well see you again to cecilias evident delight all the sailors took up the refrain well rant and well roar like true british sailors well rant and well roar all on the salt seas until we strike soundings in the channel of england from ushant to scilly tis thirtyfive leagues at noon cecilia by unspoken concession took charge of provisions and each in the boat received a ships biscuit surmounted by cold tongue and a pickle the wine was recorked after a splash of bordeaux flavoured the water ration agreeably and a morsel of seedcake completed their noon meal an overcast sky still prevented a noon sighting but a steady southeasterly course was not hard to sustain and with the winds coming more abeam they made good speed towards evening the sea had moderated the sun finally emerged and the wearisome jerking motion settled to a regular swelling surge cecilia made lord stanhope as comfortable as was possible and the boat sailed on into the night the seamen aboard used to regular watches had no difficulty in falling in with the rhythm but a pale dawn revealed a holloweyed planksore cecilia without a word renzi reached for the awning he loosened its end lifted it up and secured each corner to an opposite shroud miladys toilette he murmured and clambered aft followed by a suddenly understanding doud sir you are too kind cecilia croaked and without meeting anyones eye vanished behind the improvised screen the plash of water showed that she was making good use of her privacy later in the morning a cultured cough from amidships drew cecilia to lord stanhope should you be so good as to tighten these bandages i am certain i may sit which would give me the greatest satisfaction since it has always been my practice to look the world in the eye at noon to kydds gratification the sun was bright and beneficent he took a sighting carefully and after due consultation with the tables he turned to the chart with renzi here somewhere along this line o latitude thats where we are of a surety nicholas cecilia could not contain her curiosity she crowded into the sternsheets with them her eyes searching eagerly for meaning in the chart pray where are we tom you are so clever it looks a perfect conundrum to me well sis we are somewhere here he said with a sweep of his hand across the chart along the known line of latitude oh she said kydd added if only wed a longitude we cd tell exactly where we was yes we must not be accounted lost added renzi we have but to extend our southeasterly heading and we shall be quite certain to end our voyage on the coast of south america cecilia looked at him with round eyes are the natives fierce there she asked fearfully i rather think they have been tamed by the spaniards by now dear lady renzi replied the low rambling coastline of the continent emerged out of the haze of noon the next day sending the seamen feverishly to their chart but it would be no easy fix and they closed the coastline with some trepidation my lord you see that we have made landfall at an unknown point renzi explained and should we be too far east we will encounter the dutch wiout our longitude sir we cannot know kydd added cecilia was in no doubt yes you can and very easily the men looked at her incredulously so simple you go and ask where we are from one of your natives it was simple the boat kissed the sand of the unknown land on a small rockstrewn beach raw red cliffs leading up to a profusion of greenery alive with the noise of animals and birds cecilia and lord stanhope were helped out staggering around at the change of sensation and where then will we find an accommodating native of these parts renzis answer camefrom further up the beach in the form of a barking dog belonging to a figure standing watching them i shall speak with him said lord stanhope kydd waved and hailed with a foretopsailyardahoy bellow hoay ahoooy there the man approached as he moved a small boy hiding behind him became apparent dressed almost as a miniature of himself with a wide straw hat and a gaily coloured poncho cecilia was entranced i do believe he has never seen the english before his dark brown weathered features were a mask of uncertainty the mans black eyes flicked from the boat to the two wellbuilt seamen and then to cecilia the little boy clinging fearfully to his cloak buenos dias senor the eyes swivelled to lord stanhope por favour puede informarnos donde nos encontramos the others waited impatiently while the exchange continued at one point the man pointing along the line of foreshore to the right ah that settles it said stanhope we are within spanish territory and cuerda grande lies just four milliaria beyond the two sailors dived for the chart there exclaimed kydd his finger jabbing victoriously at the spot the others came over agog to hear the news hmm quite a way further east than i thought said kydd see this is barranquilla an here we have your hollanders he added indicating islands not so very far away perhaps this man can say if war is declared cecilia asked he has no knowledge of any war stanhope replied but then i doubt he knows of much beyond his village i cannot take the risk we must confer gentlemen the men clustered around the chart cecilia sat down on a rock and luxuriously splashed her feet in the clear sea kindly show me the essentials of our position if you please aye m lord here we are near halfway along th caribbean coast o south america port royal is here he indicated to the northwest of the chart an barbados here to the east and how far to return to port royal in the longboat m lord if necessary hmmm this is not lessn five hundred miles but with the noreast trades abeam about three four days stanhope was thoughtful renzi looked up with an apologetic smile i will earn cecilias eternal loathing but duty obliges me to point out that we are perhaps six days from barbados if we continue but if we return to port royal the vessel we take there must necessarily retrace our course meaning a total time of around twelve days even a fortnight this we press on i believe yes my lord might i suggest her brother be the one to inform cecilia a jabbering from the little boy to his warily curious father brought attention back to the man if we have coins perhaps we can persuade him of some fruits renzi suggested cecilia was delighted with what was brought not only fruits but corn bread dried strips of meat and four eggs we shall dine right royally before we face that odious sea again she vowed and set renzi to building a fire claiming the boat baler as her cooking pot kydd saw braiding in the sand along the beach and knew at that spot there would be water the two barricoes would be full when they left more than enough for a sixday voyage as cecilias soup laid its irresistible fragrance on the air he bent his mind to the job in hand nicholas we need t clear the dutch islands an as well keep away frm the coast shipping do ye think we should run down the degrees line o latitude to the windard islands i do dear fellow but i worry that we are sadly at risk if we cannot fix our longitude for the barbadoes after passing through the islands should we ignorantly sail past into the empty atlantic aye youre in the right of it m friend but i have an idea kydd assembled his thoughts carefully do we not now have at this moment complete and certain knowledge of our position our longitude in fine yes and when we sail this is lost but what if we conjure our own chronometer do y ask lord stanhope if we cn borrow his fine watch i take m noon sighting right here in th usual way when the sun tells us its exactly midday kydd paused significantly this is then our noon at this longitude which we do know an if i am not mistaken in m reasoning i pray humbly i am not then we know frm this the exac time we are here ahead o greenwich noon at the rate of one hour for every fifteen degrees you are of course completely right so we subtract this time an set th watch to our greenwich noon and by this we have a chronometer an frm now on the difference between our local noon and this watch gives out yr exac longitude renzi who had seen it coming nevertheless joined in the general applause you are indeed in the character of a magician right enough no matter that the watch was a poor substitute for the precision of a real chronometer it would nevertheless put them well within sighting distance of their goal and if it did that then it was all they could desire apart from some fardistant flecks of white there was no indication that they were crossing a major sea highway in a world with privateers and pirates no ship would be inclined to indulge their curiosity and they sailed on unmolested into the empty seas of the central caribbean routine set in the scrupulously doledout rations the morning squareaway that kydd insisted on douds neverfailing evening songs and most crucial the noon sight it seemed a fragile thing indeed to entrust their lives to a ticking watch a frail artefact of man in the midst of effortless domination by nature yet in itself a token of the precious intelligence that could make man the master of nature it was the first thing to be stowed safely beneath the thwarts when the rain came down thick hammering tropical rain tied to the tiller for hours at a time unable to go to shelter kydd endured the rain teemed down on his bowed head his body his entire being the incessant heavy drops became a bruising torture after a while and it took real courage to keep to his post the others crouched together under the slackedoff awning just the regular appearance of a hand sending a bright sheet of water from the baler over the side from under the lumpy canvas it was trying afterwards as well from being comprehensively soaked to a brazen sun warming rapidly the result was a clammy stickiness that had clothing tugging at the skin in a maddening clinging heaviness cecilias appearance from under the old sail showed that she had not escaped patches of damp had her distracted plucking at her sunfaded dress and trying to smooth her draggled hair she was in no mood for conversation with the men mile succeeded mile in a nearinvisible wake that was a perfect straight line astern the dying swell of the storm petered out into a flat royalblue immensity of water prettily textured by myriad dark ripples from the warm and pleasant breeze then the sun asserted itself there was real bite in the endless sunshine now a heat that was impossible to escape but on the fourth day a milestone was reached the meridian of west it was time to leave their eternal easterly progression and shape their course to pass through the windward islands chain and direct to barbados the empty sea looked exactly the same but the filigreed hands of the watch mysteriously said that not only had they passed the dutch islands safely astern but that the several island passages that were the entrance to the caribbean sea were now only a couple of hundred miles ahead say no more than a day of sailing huzzah cried cecilia and doud stood tall on a thwart and sang of england and sweethearts to the uncaring sea and sky they had adequate water the food was now a monotonous hard tack soaked in water tinged with wine cheese of an heroic hardness and a precious hoard of treats dried meat strips cut into infinitely small pieces to suck for minutes a time dainty cubes of seedcake and for really special occasions one preserved fig between two with a whole one for the helmsman of the watch the boat lapsed into a silence rapt expressions betrayed minds leaping ahead to another more congenial plane of existence the clean fragrance of fresh linen in a real bed surcease for body and spirit what would be the first thing to do after stepping ashore and then the wind fell from a breeze to a zephyr from that to a playful soft wafting around the compass and then nothing the longboat ceased any kind of motion the sails hung lifeless with only an occasional dying twitch and the heat closed in blasting up from the limitless watery plain a hard blinding force that could be felt behind closed eyes the awning seemed to trap a suffocating humidity beneath it but the alternative was to suffer both the unremitting glare reflected from the pondlike sea and the ferocious heat from a nearvertical sun time slowed to an insupportable tedium rooted to their places on hard wood for an infinity of time the slap and trickle of water the only sound the choking heat their only reality it was a trial of sanity doud lay in the v of the bow staring fixedly ahead stanhope sat under the awning against the mast with renzi opposite cecilia lay in the curve of the lower part of the boat and kydd still sat at the motionless tiller his mind replaying a quite different nightmare the shrieking darkness of cape horn the baler was passed from hand to hand a scoop of seawater poured over the head gave momentary relief but the sticky salt remaining only added to the misery water precious water it was no longer a given thing life or death was in the two hot wooden casks in the bottom of the boat and when they were broached eyes followed every move of the person drinking their tiny ration of tepid rank fluid i fear we have a contrary current kydd croaked after the painful duty of the noon sight only a halfknot or one but nobody spoke the idea of being carried back into the caribbean a thought too cruel to face as the afternoon wore on water in its every guise crept into the brain tricked itself into every thought tantalised and tempted in a way that could only call for wonder at the creativity of a tortured mind still the implacable sun glared down on them sending thoughts fluttering at the prison bars of reality desperate for any escape from the torment time ground on then astonishingly the sun was on the wane a languorous sunset began full of pinktinted golds and ultramarine sea and still no wind renzi crawled over to a thwart and drew out of his package a small book my friends he began but his voice was hoarse and unnatural and he had to clear his throat we are at some hazard ill grant but these words may put you in mind of another place another time what we may yet the curfew tolls the knell of parting day the lowing herd winds slowly oer the lea the ploughman homeward plods his weary way and leaves the world to darkness and to me now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight and all the air a solemn stillness holds oh nicholas nicholas cecilia wept she moved to renzi and hugged his arm while the measured burnished phrases went on until renzi could no longer see the text night fell they lolled back and gazed at the vast starry heavens as they drifted in perfect calm beneath but bodies were now a mass of suffering from the aches of unyielding hardness everywhere and the sight for them held no beauty the night progressed the moon travelled half the sky and still no wind then in the early hours an inconsequential puff from nowhere had the sails slatting busily kydd heaved himself up from the bottom of the boat where he had been lying and looked across the ebony black sea glittering with moonlight a roughening of texture in the glassy sea away in the distance had his heart hammering it approached flaws and ripples in a darting flurry that came nearer and nearer kydd held the tiller in a death grip fearful with anticipation and suddenly they were enveloped in a brisk breeze that sent the longboat heeling then in a joyful chuckling of water they were under way again croaking cheers broke out but the breeze dropped their speed fell away and then the wind picked up even stronger than before in a glorious thrusting urge the winds held into the morning with a steady breeze from the northeast the heat was under control eagerly the midday ceremony with octant and watch was anticipated with little patience for kydd took the utmost pains to ensure his workings were unassailable finally he looked up from the frayed chart im grieved t say it but i was wrong he said but the staring eyes that looked back at him made him regret his black humour that is th current it wasnt as bad as i thought in fact he paused dramatically and pointed there there you will find st lucia distant but twenty leagues and there that is st vincent we pass between them and to barbados beyond it was incredibly elating to be making plans for landfall within the next day can we stop at an island for water on the way stanhope said his voice was croaking with dehydration no said kydd decisively we dont know if the french are still in control after what weve suffered i don want us t end in a frog prison cecilia lifted a barricoe and shook it we dont have much left she said her voice was husky and low her skin dry and cracked we dont stop kydd said concentrating ahead his own voice had a harsh cast for a long time there was nothing said then lord stanhope murmured i could insist kydd gripped the tiller no yr not th captain if y needs water then you cn have my share that wont be necessary lord stanhope croaked but thank you mr kydd that was nobly said we dont stop no the passage between the two islands was more than twentyfive miles at their heightofeye they would probably not even see them kydd concentrated on the boat compass the card swimming lazily under the lubbers line he had to be certain of his course for if he steered true barbados lay just eightyodd miles beyond in the atlantic less than a day away when we gets t barbados th thing id like best before douds thought could be finished there was a sickening crunch and a crazy rearing the longboat came to a sudden halt sending all hands sprawling and the mast splintering in two then the boat slid backwards crazily and into deep water again the sea was as innocent as it was possible to be but inches under water and therefore invisible a projection of reef not on the chart had been lying in wait the boat lay in disorder and kydd saw clear water in the bottom clear away th raffle nicholas were takin in water he said thickly without being told cecilia added her weight to the heaving and bundling her face set and worried her dress riding up unnoticed doud was in the foresheets bending over again and again and in silent agony nursing an injured arm it was as bad as kydd had feared the very bottom of the boat had taken the full force of the impact and was stove in by a miracle the worst affected plank was still hanging by a thread but the crystal clear water of the caribbean was gouting in their survival would now be measured in minutes unless something could be done kydds mind raced if they stuffed the holes with clothing it would reduce the flow but at the almost certain risk of the plank giving way and bringing on a final unstoppable rush of water nicholas unbend the mainsl we have t fother they would try to check the inrush by passing the sail around the outside of the boat rest o ye bale fr your lives his fingers scrabbling at the ropes and flaccid canvas kydd tried to think judging by the merest suggestion of misty grey to the northwest they were no closer than a dozen miles from st lucia the wreckage of the boat might sink under the weight of its fittings or remain a waterlogged hulk either way there was no salvation for them the mainsail was won from its rigging by sheer brute insistence and sailors knives and kydd staggered with it to the bow somehow the unwieldy mass had to be passed under with a rope each side that required two men but as well it had to be hauled away aft which rope lord stanhope said tersely stumbling towards them m lord if y please kydd said and handed him one cecilia insisted on the opposite one freeing kydd and renzi to ease the sail foot by foot down the outside length of the boat the water was halfway to the knees unnerving and making the boat wallow frighteningly bale bawled kydd and with anything they could find they furiously threw the water overside there was no telling whether they had a chance and kydd fell to his work in a frenzy of desperation he was unprepared for the inhuman screech that pierced the air it was cecilia she stood in the centre of the boat and pointed shakily to a hulking white shape below the water that glided past lazily a lethal flash of cruel eyes and a semicircle of teeth around a gaping maw kydd went icy he remembered the frenzy of killing around the burning ship the living flesh ripped and devoured before their horrorstruck gaze bale he howled cecilia remained frozen near the stump of the mast her face sagging with fear staring at the shark i i hate them i haaate them she said in rising hysteria kydd had never seen his sister like this before and saw that her terror was unhinging her his voice caught in a sob for he knew there was nothing he could do for her it was probable that before evening every one of them would have been eaten alive there were now four of the terrible creatures circling the boat an impossibly huge shark came close closer there was a sudden bump and dismaying displacement something of its evil ferocity was transmitted in the shock of the blow a personal message of hatred that was the more terrifying for being felt rather than seen cecilia sat suddenly her face contorted with terror renzi put down his baler and with an expression of supreme compassion held her rigid body close stroking soothing nicholas kydd choked his duty was baling they must fight they would play it to the last renzi went back to his work his eyes on cecilia she gulped crazily and scrabbled over the thwarts towards kydd looking to him with eyes at the very edge of madness thomas thomas pleease kydd could not look at her pppromise me pplease promise me before it hhappens youll kkill me with yyour knife pleease kydds hand strayed to the seamans knife at his belt and felt his mind unravel the shark came in again its bulk under the bright sunlit water sinister and purposeful kydd knew that the shark was closing in for a kill he took an oar and like a harpoon rammed it into its loathsome mouth as hard as he was able the shark twisted in agony and thrashed away in a fury of spray but the others took it to be a crippling injury they fell on the creature and it disappeared in a snapping frenzy of red mist bale kydd croaked but something had changed the far horizon ahead was no longer a clean line of sea and sky it was populated with pyramids of sails and not one but nearly a dozen unseen by them in their peril they had stolen up over the horizon th looard islands squadron kydd gasped the stately line of menowar stretched several miles over the sea clearly on its lawful occasions possibly exercising on the passage to barbados an incredibly moving and beautiful sight but they were many miles distant ned screamed kydd doud leaped to his feet tore off his shirt and with his good arm waved it furiously for their lives depended on it the grand procession sailed on holy christ see us see us why don ye bale kydd shrieked cecilia sat with her head at a strange angle a haunted smile playing on her lips the ships vice admiral of the blue sir benjamin caldwells leeward islands squadron of the royal navy proceeded ahead in line sailing inexorably past y bastards y fuckin scrovy doud raved but kydd knew that past the closest point of approach they had little chance the lookouts were primed to expect things ahead and with their mast a mere stump their visibility to the fleet would be nothing a lump came to his throat emotion flooded him overwhelmed him then one after another the great shipsoftheline majestically put down their helm the heavy spars braced around the sails backed then drawing at exactly the right moment to have the fleet pivoting about the one point in succession and in a faultless exercise the ships of the fleet tacked and headed directly towards them there was weeping racking joyous heartfelt and this time kydd let renzi go to cecilia in a haze of unreality they saw the leading ship fall out of line lowering a boat that sped across to them the sight of the strong open faces of the seamen misted kydds eyes they heaved the feeble sunravaged humanity into their boat and left the wreck to settle forlornly their pitiful collection of possessions was tenderly removed and the lieutenant in charge spoke kind words and discovered whom he had delivered sailors tugging strongly at the oars they went back down the line passing ship after ship in a delirious progression to the flagship in the centre for kydd there followed only disconnected images the vast bulk of the flagship alongside figures looking curiously from the deckline high above a chair swaying down from a yardarm whip cecilia first the others and finally kydd the blessed tarsmelling clean decks the crisp banging of backed sails above himself crumpling helpless concerned seamen crowding around a vision of cecilia staring at him the gold and blue of high officers gathering around lord stanhope and then his body sought peace in insensibility good god exclaimed the admiral visibly shocked frederick to see you like this great heavens you must be that is not of consequence may we talk in private his voice was weak but resolute the admirals great cabin with its dark panelling ornate silver and polished furniture did not deter lord stanhope from speaking directly i have a matter of compelling urgency that requires my attendance at the foreign office strategic naval dispositions were straightforward enough ceres frigate would be sailing for england in any event she would simply leave immediately of course it would be in order for the young lady to be accommodated until lady charlotte arrived to join her but in other naval matters it was necessary for lord stanhope to step carefully for the customs of the service could not be ordered from above in quite the same way it is my most firm resolve benjamin to recognise the quite extraordinary deeds of these men who carried me through so valiantly the admiral stroked his jaw a purse of guineas from you is the usual thing and possibly an address by myself before the ships company i rather feel that in this case something more in the way of a professional distinction perhaps a form of honour i understand frederick you will tell me more of them and i will make a suggestion the one is the quartermaster of seaflower y a perfectly noble specimen of the sea race and in my untutored eyes destined for some eminence in the sea profession and we have another who is of a most interesting character and who is the most nearly learned of any i have had the fortune to meet the last is a bold seaman of courage and humour who would be an ornament to any vessel that has the honour to bear him quite so hmmm it is within my gift to raise them to the felicity of warrant officer but i rather fancy the last named may prefer more to carry my personal recommendation to his next captain for a fitting advancement to petty officer the commanderinchief of the leeward islands squadron looked directly at stanhope very well these two are masters mates from this hour but the warrant will require that the admiralty do confirm my motions my dear benjamin i think that is a matter that can safely be left to me authors note i am a visile i have to see things in my minds eye before i can write about them i try to go to the very places that were so important to history to caress the old stones to sight along a great gun that men once served in bloody battle and most precious and transcendent to step aboard menowar of kydds day particularly the glorious shipoftheline victory and the valiant frigate constitution away from the gaudy tourist haunts in the caribbean there are many tactile relics of rousing times past unwittingly bequeathed to us by men whose concerns of the hour did not include a care for posterity henry morgans port royal slid into
