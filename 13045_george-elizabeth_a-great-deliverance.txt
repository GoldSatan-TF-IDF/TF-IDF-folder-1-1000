elizabeth george a great deliverance the first book in the inspector lynley series it was a solecism of the very worst kind he sneezed loudly wetly and quite unforgivably into the womans face hed been holding it back for threequarters of an hour fighting it off as if it were henry tudors vanguard in the battle of bosworth but at last hed surrendered and after the act to make matters worse he immediately began to snuffle the woman stared she was exactly the type whose presence always reduced him to blithering idiocy at least six feet tall dressed in that wonderfully insouciant mismatch of clothing so characteristic of the british upper classes she was ageless timeless and she peered at him through razor blue eyes the sort that must have reduced many a parlourmaid to tears forty years ago she had to be well over sixty possibly closer to eighty but one could never tell she sat bolt upright in her seat hands clasped in her lap a fi nishingschool posture which made no concessions towards comfort and she stared first at his roman collar then at his undeniably dripping nose do forgive darling a thousand apologies lets not allow a little faux pas like a sneeze to come between such a friendship as ours he was always so amusing when engaged in mental conversations it was only aloud that everything became a terrible muddle he snuffled again again she stared why on earth was she travelling second class shed swept into the carriage in doncaster like a creaking salome with rather more than seven veils to her ensemble and for the remainder of the trip shed alternated between imbibing the railways foulsmelling tepid coffee and staring at him with a disapproval that shouted church of england at every available opportunity and then came the sneeze unimpeachably correct behaviour from dancaster to london might have somehow excused his roman catholicism to her but alas the sneeze condemned him forever iahthat isif youll excuse it was simply no good his handkerchief was deep within his pocket to reach it he would have to loosen his grasp on the battered attaché case in his lap and that was unthinkable she would just have to understand we arent talking about a breach of etiquette here madam we are talking about murder upon that thought he snuffled with selfrighteous vigour hearing this the woman sat even more correctly in her seat every fibre of her body straining to project disapproval her glance said it all it was a chronicle of her thoughts and he could read each one pitiful little man pathetic not a day under seventyfi ve and looking positively every second of it and so very much what one would expect of a catholic priest a face with three separate nicks from a poor job at shaving a crumb of morning toast embedded in the corner of his mouth shiny black suit mended at elbows and cuffs squashed hat rimmed with dust and that dreadful case in his lap ever since doncaster he had been acting as if shed boarded the train with the deliberate intention of snatching it from him and hurling herself out the window lord the woman sighed and turned away from him as if seeking salvation but none was apparent his nose continued to dribble until the slowing of the train announced that they were finally approaching their journeys end she stood and scourged him with a fi nal look at last i understand what you catholics mean by purgatory she hissed and swept down the aisle to the door oh dear muttered father hart oh dear i suppose i really have but she was gone the train had come to a complete halt under the vaulted ceiling of the london station it was time to do what he had come to the city to do he looked about to make sure that he was in possession of all his belongings a pointless operation since he had brought nothing with him from yorkshire save the single attaché case that had as yet not left his grip he squinted out the window at the vast expanse of kings cross station he had been more prepared for a station like victoriaor at least the victoria he remembered from his youthwith its comforting old brick walls its stalls and buskers these latter always staying one step ahead of the metropolitan police but kings cross was something altogether different long stretches of tiled floor seductive advertisements hanging from the ceiling newsagents tobacconists hamburger shops and all the peoplemany more than he had expectedin queues for tickets gobbling down hurried snacks as they raced for trains arguing laughing and kissing goodbye every race every colour it was all so different he wasnt sure he could bear the noise and confusion getting out father or planning to stop t night startled father hart looked up into the ruddy face of the porter who had helped him find his seat earlier that morning upon the trains departure from york it was a pleasant north country face with the winds of the moors etched upon it in a hundred separate blood vessles that rode and broke near the surface of his skin his eyes were flinty blue quick and perceptive and father hart felt them like a touch as they slid in a friendly but querying movement from his face to the attaché case tightening his fingers round the handle he stiffened his body hoping for resolution and getting an excruciating cramp in his left foot instead he moaned as the pain balled hotly to its zenith the porter spoke anxiously maybe you oughtnt be travellin alone sure you dont need no help like he did of course he did but no one could help he couldnt help himself no no im off this very moment and youve been more than kind my seat you know the initial confusion the porter waved his words away dont mind that theres lots of folks dont realise them tickets means reserved no harm done was there no i suppose father hart drew in a quick sustaining breath down the aisle out the door find the tube he told himself none of that could be as insurmountable as it seemed he shuffled towards the exit his case clutched twohanded upon his stomach bounced with each step behind him the porter spoke ere father the doors a bit much ill see to t he allowed the man space to get past him in the aisle already two surlylooking railway cleaners were squeezing in the rear door rubbish sacks over their shoulders ready to prepare the train for its return trip to york they were pakistani and although they spoke english father hart found that he couldnt understand a single word beneath the obfuscation of their accents the realisation filled him with dread what was he doing here in the nations capital where the inhabitants were foreigners who looked at him with cloudy hostile eyes and immigrant faces what paltry good could he hope to do what silliness was this who would ever believe need some help father father hart finally moved decisively no fine simply fi ne he negotiated the steps felt the concrete platform beneath his feet heard the calling of pigeons high in the vaulted ceiling of the station he began to make his distracted way down the platform towards the exit and euston road behind him again he heard the porter someone meeting you know where youre going where you off to now the priest straightened his shoulders he waved a goodbye scotland yard he replied fi rmly st pancras station directly across the street from kings cross was such an architectural antithesis of the latter that father hart stood for several moments simply staring at its neogothic magnifi cence the clamour of traffic on euston road and the malodourous belching of two dieselfuelled lorries at the pavements edge faded into insignifi cance he was a bit of an architecture buff and this particular building was architecture gone wild good heavens thats wonderful he murmured tilting his head to have a better view of the railway stations peaks and valleys a bit of a cleaning and shed be a regular palace he looked about absently as if he would stop the next passerby and give a discourse on the evils that generations of coal fires had wrought upon the old building now i wonder who the twonote siren of a police van howled suddenly down caledonian road shrieking through the intersection onto euston it brought the priest back to reality he shook himself mentally part in irritation but another greater part in fear his mind was wandering daily now and that signalled the end didnt it he swallowed a gagging lump of terror and sought new determination his eyes fell upon the scream of a headline across the morning paper propped up on a nearby newsstand he stepped toward it curiously ripper strikes at vauxhall station ripper he shrank from the words cast a look about and then gave himself over to one quick paragraph from the story skimming it rapidly lest a closer perusal betray an interest in morbidity unseemly in a man of the cloth words not sentences caught his sight slashedseminude bodiesarteriessevered victims male he shivered his fingers went to his throat and he considered its true vulnerability even a roman collar was no certain protection from the knife of a killer it would seek it would plunge the thought was shattering he staggered back from the newsstand and mercifully saw the underground sign a mere thirty feet away it jogged his memory he groped in his pocket for a map of the citys underground system and spent a moment painstakingly perusing its crinkled surface the circle line to st jamess park he told himself and then again with more authority the circle line to st jamess park the circle line to st jamess park like a gregorian chant he repeated the sentence as he descended the stairs he maintained its metre and rhythm up to the ticket window and did not cease until he had placed himself squarely on the train there he glanced at the other occupants of the car found two elderly ladies watching him with unveiled avidity and ducked his head so confusing he explained trying out a timid smile of friendship one gets so turned about all kinds is what im tellin you pammy the younger of the two women declared to her companion she shot a look of practiced chilling contempt at the cleric disguised as anything i hear keeping her watery eyes on the confused priest she dragged her withered friend to her feet clung to the poles near the door and urged her out loudly at the very next stop father hart watched their departure with resignation no blaming them he thought one couldnt trust not ever not really and thats what hed come to london to say that it wasnt the truth it only looked like the truth a body a girl and a bloody axe but it wasnt the truth he had to convince them andoh lord he had so little talent for this but god was on his side he held onto that thought what im doing is right what im doing is right what im doing is right replacing the other this new chant took him right to the doors of new scotland yard so damned if we dont have another kerridgenies confrontation on our hands superintendent malcolm webberly concluded he paused to light a thick cigar that immediately permeated the air with a nasty pall of smoke christ in heaven malcolm open a window if you insist on smoking that thing his companion replied as chief superintendent sir david hillier was webberlys superior but he liked to let his men run their individual divisions in their own way he himself would never dream of launching such an olfactory assault so shortly before an interview but malcolms ways were not his own and they had never been proven ineffectual he moved his chair to escape the worst of the fumes and let his eyes take in the worst of the offi ce hillier wondered how malcolm ever managed his department as efficiently as he did given his bent for chaos files and photographs and reports and books covered every surface there were empty coffee cups and overfull ashtrays and even a pair of ancient running shoes high on a shelf just as webberly intended the room looked and smelled like the disordered digs of an undergraduate cramped friendly and fusty only an unmade bed was missing it was the sort of place that made gathering lingering and talking easy that bred camaraderie among men who had to work as a team clever malcolm hillier thought five or six times shrewder than his ordinary stoopshouldered overplump looks would indicate webberly pushed himself away from his desk and played about with the window grunting and straining with the latch before finally forcing it open sorry david i always forget he sat back down at his desk surveyed its litter with a melancholy gaze and said what i didnt need was this right now he ran one hand back through his sparse hair ginger once it was now mostly grey trouble at home hillier asked carefully eyes fixed on his gold signet ring it was a difficult question for both of them since he and webberly were married to sisters a fact that most of the yard knew nothing about one of which the two men themselves rarely spoke their relationship was one of those quirks of fate in which two men find themselves locked together in a number of ways which are generally better not discussed between them hilliers career had mirrored his marriage both were successful deeply satisfying his wife was perfection a rock of devotion an intellectual companion a loving mother a sexual delight he admitted that she was the very centre of his existence that his three children were merely tangential objects pleasant and diverting but nothing at all of real importance compared to laura he turned to her his first thought in the morning his last thought at nightfor virtually every need in his life and she met each one for webberly it was different a career that was like the man plodding along one not brilliant but cautious filled with countless successes for which he rarely took credit for webberly simply was not the political animal he needed to be to succeed at the yard thus no knighthood loomed seductively on his professional horizon and this was what had put the enormous strain upon the webberly marriage knowing that her younger sister was lady hillier clawed at the fabric of frances webberlys life it had turned her from a shy but complacent middleclass housewife to a social climber of the pushiest kind dinner parties cocktail parties dreary buffets which they could ill afford were given for people in whom they had no interest all of them part of what frances perceived as her husbands climb to the top and to them all the hilliers faithfully went laura out of sad loyalty to a sister with whom she no longer lovingly communicated and hillier himself to protect webberly as best he could from the piercingly cruel comments frances often made publicly about her husbands lacklustre career lady macbeth incarnate hillier thought with a shudder no not there webberly was responding its merely that i thought id got nies and kerridge sorted out years ago to have a confrontation crop up again between them is disconcerting how typical of malcolm to take responsibility for the foibles of others hillier thought refresh my memory on their last fray he said it was a yorkshire situation wasnt it gypsies involved in a murder webberly nodded nies heads up the richmond police he sighed heavily forgetting for a moment to blow the smoke from his cigar towards the open window hillier strained not to cough webberly loosened his necktie a fraction and absently fingered the frayed collar of his white shirt an old gypsy woman was killed up there three years ago nies runs a tight cid his men are meticulous accurate to the last detail they conducted an investigation and arrested the old crones soninlaw it was an apparent dispute over the ownership of a garnet necklace garnets were they stolen webberly shook his head tapping his cigar against a dented tin ashtray on his desk the action dislodged debris from previous cigars which drifted like dust to mingle with papers and manila folders no the necklace had been given to them by edmund hanstonsmith hillier sat forward in his chair hanstonsmith yes youre remembering it now arent you but that case was after all this the man arrested for the old womans murderromaniv i think his name washad a wife about twentyfive years old and beautiful in the way only those women can be dark oliveskinned exotic more than a bit enticing to a man like hanstonsmith in truth she got him to believe that romaniv was innocent it took a few weeksromaniv hadnt come up before the assizes yet she convinced hanstonsmith that the case needed to be reopened she swore that they were only being persecuted because of their gypsy blood that romaniv had been with her the entire night in question i imagine her charms made that easy to believe webberlys mouth quirked he stubbed out the tip of his cigar in the ashtray and clasped his freckled hands over his stomach they effectively hid the stain on his waistcoat from the later testimony of hanstonsmiths valet the good mrs romaniv had no trouble keeping even a man of sixtytwo more than busy for one entire night youll recall that hanstonsmith was a man of some considerable political influence and wealth it was no difficult matter for him to convince the yorkshire constabulary to become involved so reuben kerridgehes still yorkshire s chief constable in spite of all that happened ordered niess investigation reopened and to make matters worse he ordered romaniv released how did nies react kerridge is his superior officer after all what could he do nies was wild with anger but he released romaniv and ordered his men to begin again it would seem that releasing romaniv while making his wife happy would bring a premature end to hanstonsmiths joy hillier noted well of course mrs romaniv felt dutybound to thank hanstonsmith in the manner to which hed become so accustomed she slept with him one last timewore the poor bloke out until the wee hours of the morning if i have the story straightand then let romaniv into the house webberly looked up at a sharp knock on the door the rest as they say is a bit of bloody history the pair murdered hanstonsmith took everything they could carry got to scarborough and were out of the country before dawn and niess reaction demanded kerridges immediate resignation the knock sounded again webberly ignored it he didnt get it however but niess mouth has been watering like the devil for it ever since and here we are back with them again you say a third knock much more insistent webberly called entrance to bertie edwards the mets head of forensics who entered the room in his usual brisk manner scribbling on his clipboard and speaking to it at the same time to edwards the clipboard was as human as most mens secretaries severe contusion on the right temple he was announcing happily followed by the main laceration to the carotid artery no identification no money stripped down to the underclothes its the railway ripper all right he finished writing with a fl ourish hillier surveyed the little man with profound distaste christ these fleet street appellations were going to be haunted by whitechapel till the end of time is this the waterloo corpse webberly asked edwards glanced at hillier his face an open book in which he considered whether he should argue the merits of nameless killers being dubbed somethinganythingfor the sake of public awareness he apparently rejected that line of communication for he wiped at his forehead with the sleeve of his lab coat and turned to his immediate superior waterloo he nodded number eleven weve not quite finished vauxhall yet both are typical of the ripper victims weve seen transient types broken nails dirty badly cut hair body lice as well kings cross is still the only one out of sync and thats the bloody devil after all these weeks no id no missingpersons call on him yet i cant make it out he scratched his head with the end of his pen want the waterloo snap ive brought it webberly waved towards the wall on which were already posted the photographs of the twelve recent murder victims all of them killed in an identical manner in or near london train stations thirteen murders now in just over fi ve weeks the papers were screaming for an arrest as if he were oblivious to this edwards whistled airily between his teeth and rooted on webberlys desk for a drawing pin he carried the latest victim to the wall not a bad shot he stepped back to admire his work sewed him up quite nice jesus hillier exploded youre a ghoul man at least have the decency to remove that filthy coat when you come here have you no sense at all weve women on these floors edwards wore the guise of patient attention but his eyes flicked over the chief superintendent and lingered longest on the fleshy neck that hung over his collar and on the thick hair that hillier liked to have called leonine edwards shrugged at webberly in mutual understanding quite the gent he is he commented before leaving the room sack him hillier shouted as the door shut behind the pathologist webberly laughed have a sherry david he said its in the cabinet behind you we none of us ought to be here on a saturday two sherries considerably palliated hilliers irritation with the pathologist he was standing before webberlys display wall staring morosely at the thirteen photographs this is one hell of a mess he noted sourly victoria kings cross waterloo liverpool blackfriars paddington god damn it man why cant he at least be alphabetical maniacs often lack that little organisational touch webberly responded placidly five of these victims dont even have names for gods sake hillier complained id is always removed so are money and clothes if theres no missingperson report filed we start with prints you know how long something like that takes david were doing our best hillier turned around the one thing he knew for a certainty was that malcolm would always do his absolute best and would quietly remain in the background when the kudos were given sorry was i frothing a bit as usual so this new nieskerridge squabble whats it all about webberly glanced at his watch another yorkshire murder being disputed no less theyre sending someone down with the data a priest a priest christwhat kind of case is this webberly shrugged evidently hes the only third party that nies and kerridge could agree upon to bring us the information whys that seems he found the body hillier walked to the offi ce window afternoon sunlight shafted across his face detailing lines that spoke of too many late nights highlighting puffy pink flesh that spoke of too much rich food and port by god this is irregular has kerridge gone quite mad nies has certainly been claiming that for years but to have the first person on the scene and not even a member of the force what can the man be thinking that a priest is the only person they both can trust webberly glanced at his watch again he should be here within the hour in fact thats why i asked you to come down to hear this priests story thats certainly not your style webberly shook his head slowly he had come to the tricky part not to hear the story actually to hear the plan im intrigued hillier went to pour himself another sherry and held the bottle towards his friend who shook his head he returned to his seat and crossed one leg over the other careful not to destroy the razor crease in his beautifully tailored trousers the plan he prompted webberly poked at a stack of files on his desk id like lynley on this hillier cocked an eyebrow lynley and nies for a second goround havent we had trouble enough in that quarter malcolm besides lynleys not on rota this weekend that can be dealt with webberly hesitated he watched the other man youre letting me hang here david he said at last hillier smiled forgive me i was waiting to see how you were going to ask for her damn you webberly cursed softly you know me too well by half lets say i know youre too fair for your own good let me advise you on this malcolm leave havers where you put her webberly winced and swiped at a nonexistent fly it grates on my conscience dont be a bloody fool dont be worse than thatdont be a sentimental fool barbara havers proved herself incapable of getting along with a single di for her entire tenure in cid shes been back in uniform these past eight months and doing a better job there leave her i didnt try her with lynley you didnt try her with the prince of wales either its not your responsibility to keep moving detective sergeants around until they fi nd a little niche in which they can grow old happily its your responsibility to see that the flaming job gets done and no job got done with havers on it admit it i think shes learned from the experience learned what that being a truculent pigheaded little bitch is not likely to advance her up the ranks webberly let hilliers words scathe the air between them well he said fi nally that was always the problem wasnt it hillier recognised the sound of defeat in his friends voice that was indeed the problem advancing through the ranks god what an ignorant thing to say forgive me malcolm he quickly finished his sherry an act that gave him something to do other than look at his brotherinlaws face you deserve my job we both know it dont we dont be absurd but hillier stood ill put a call out for havers detective sergeant barbara havers tugged the door of the supers office shut walked stiffly past his secretary and made her way into the corridor she was white with rage god god how dare they she pushed her way past a clerk not bothering to stop when the folders he was carryiing slipped from his grasp and scattered she marched right through them who did they think they were dealing with did they think she was so stupid she couldnt see the ploy god damn them god damn them she blinked telling herself that there would be no tears that she would not cry that she would not react the sign ladies appeared miraculously in front of her and she ducked inside no one was present here it was cool had it really been so hot in webberlys offi ce or had it been her outrage she fumbled at her necktie jerked it loose and stumbled over to the basin the cold water gushed out of the tap beneath her fumbling fi ngers sending a spray onto her uniform skirt and across her white blouse that did it she looked at herself in the mirror and burst into tears you cow she sneered you stupid ugly cow she was not a woman easily given to tears so they were hot and bitter tasting strange and feeling stranger as they coursed down her cheeks making unattractive rivulets across what was an extremely plain extremely puglike face youre a real sight barbara she upbraided her reflection youre an absolute vision sobbing she twisted away from the basin resting her head against the cool tile of the wall at thirty years old barbara havers was a decidedly unattractive woman but a woman who appeared to be doing everything possible to make herself so fine shiny hair the colour of pinewood might have been suitably styled for the shape of her face but instead she wore it cut bluntly at an unforgivable length just below her ears as if a toosmall bowl had been placed upon her head for a model she used no makeup heavy unplucked eyebrows drew attention to the smallness of her eyes rather than to their fine intelligence a thin mouth never heightened in any way by colour was pressed permanently into a disapproving frown the entire effect was that of a woman stubby sturdy and entirely unapproachable so theyve given you the golden boy she thought what a treat for you barb after eight miserable months they bring you back from the street for another chanceand all the while its lynley i will not she muttered i will not do it i will not work with that sodding little fop she pushed herself away from the wall and returned to the basin she ran cold water into it carefully this time bending to bathe her hot face and scrub away the incriminating sign of her tears id like to give you another opportunity in cid webberly had said hed been fi ngering a letter opener on his desk but shed noticed the ripper photos on the walls and her heart had soared to be on the ripper oh god yes when do i start is it with macpherson its a peculiar case involving a girl up in yorkshire oh so its not the ripper but still its a case a girl you say of course i can help is it stewart then hes an old hand in yorkshire wed work well together i know we would in fact im expecting to receive the information in about threequarters of an hour ill need you here then if youre interested that is if im interested threequarters of an hour gives me time to change have a bite to eat get back here then be on the late train to york will we meet up there shall i see about a car ill need you to pop round to chelsea before then im afraid the conversation ground to a sudden halt to chelsea sir what on earth had chelsea to do with all this yes webberly said easily dropping the letter opener onto the general clutter on his desk youll be working with inspector lynley and unfortunately weve got to pull him out of the st james wedding in chelsea he glanced at his watch the wedding was at eleven so no doubt theyre well into the reception by now weve been trying to raise him on the phone but apparently its been left off the hook he looked up in time to see the shock on her face something wrong sergeant inspector lynley she saw it all at once the reason they needed her the reason why no one else would really quite do yes lynley is there a problem no no problem at all and then as an afterthought sir webberlys shrewd eyes evaluated her response good im glad to hear it theres a lot you might learn from working with lynley still the eyes watched gauging her reaction try to be back here as fast as you can he gave his attention back to the papers on his desk she was dismissed barbara looked at herself in the mirror and fumbled in the pocket of her skirt for a comb lynley she tugged the plastic through her hair mercilessly dragging it against her scalp abrading the skin welcoming the pain lynley it was only too obvious why theyd brought her back out of uniform they wanted lynley on the case but they needed a woman as well and every person on victoria street knew that there wasnt a female in cid who was safe near lynley hed slept his way through department and division leaving a trail of the discarded behind him he had the reputation of a racehorse put out to stud and from all the tales told the endurance as well she angrily shoved the comb back into her pocket so how does it feel she demanded of her reflection to be the one lucky woman whose virtue is quite secure in the presence of the almighty lynley no wandering hands while our barbs in the car no confi dential dinners to go over our notes no invitations to cornwall to think the case out no fear here barb god knows that youre safe with lynley in her five years working in the same division with the man she was certain hed managed to avoid so much as saying her name let alone having a single seconds foul contact with her as if a grammar school background and a workingclass accent were social diseases that might infect him if he were not scrupulously careful to keep himself clear of them she left the room and stalked down the corridor towards the lift was there anyone in all of new scotland yard whom she hated more than she hated lynley he was a miraculous combination of every single thing that she thoroughly despised educated at eton a fi rst in history at oxford a public school voice and a bloody family tree that had its roots somewhere just this side of the battle of hastings upper class bright and so damnably charming that she couldnt understand why every criminal in the city simply didnt surrender to accommodate him his whole reason for working at the yard was a joke a flaming little myth that she didnt believe for a moment he wanted to be useful to make a contribution he preferred a career in london to life on the estate what a ruddy good laugh the lift doors opened and she punched furiously for the garage and hadnt his career been convenient and sweet purchased lock stock and barrel with the family funds he bought his way right into his current position and hed be a commissioner before he was through god knew inheriting that precious title hadnt hurt his chances for success one bit hed gone from sergeant to inspector in record time straight away everyone knew why she headed for her car a rusty mini in the far corner of the garage how nice to be rich to be titled like lynley to work only for a lark and then to swing home to the belgravia townhouse or better yet fly to the cornish estate with butlers and maids and cooks and valets and think of it barb picture yourself in the presence of such greatness what shall you do shall you swoon or vomit fi rst she flung her handbag into the rear seat of the mini slammed the door and started the car with a sputter and roar the wheels squealed on the pavement as she ascended the ramp nodded brusquely towards the offi cer on guard in the kiosk and headed for the street the light weekend traffic made getting from victoria street to the embankment a manoeuvre of a few minutes only and once there the mild breeze of the october afternoon cooled her temper calmed her nerves and coaxed her into forgetting her indignation it was a pleasant drive really to the st james house barbara liked simon allcourtst james had liked him from the first time she had met him ten years ago when she was a nervous twentyyearold probationary police constable all too aware of being a woman in a closely guarded mans world where women police were still called wopsies after a few drinks and shed been called worse than thatshe knew it damn them all to hell to them any woman who aspired to cid was a bona fi de freak and made to feel that way but to st james two years her senior she had been an acceptable colleague even a friend st james was now an independent forensic scientist but he had begun his career at the yard by his twentyfourth birthday he was the very best of the sceneofcrime men quick observant intuitive he could have gone in any direction investigations pathology administration anywhere but it had all ended one night eight years ago on a drive with lynley a wild junket through the back roads of surrey they had both been drunkst james was always prompt to admit this fact but everyone knew that it was lynley who had been driving that night lynley who had lost control on a curve lynley who had walked away without a scratch while his childhood friend st james had emerged a cripple and although he could have continued his career at the yard st james had instead retired to a family house in chelsea where for the next four years he had lived like a recluse score that to old lynley she thought sourly she couldnt believe that st james had actually maintained his friendship with the man but he had and something some sort of quirky situation had cemented their relationship nearly fi ve years ago and had brought st james back into the field where he belonged score that she thought reluctantly to lynley as well she pulled the mini into an available space on lawrence street and walked back along lordship place towards cheyne row not far from the river it was an area of the city where elaborate white plaster and woodwork decorated deep umber brick buildings and black paint restored the wrought iron at windows and balconies in keeping with the village that chelsea once had been the streets were narrow metamorphosed into bright autumn tunnels by massive sycamores and elms st jamess house stood on a corner and as she passed by the high brick wall that fenced in the garden barbara heard the sounds of the party in progress a voice was raised in a toast shouts of approval followed applause an old oak door in the wall was closed but that was just as well dressed as she was she hardly wanted to burst into the festivities as if she were making an arrest she rounded the corner to find the front door of the tall old house open to the late afternoon sun the sound of laughter fl oated towards her the pure tones of silver and china the popping of champagne and somewhere in the garden the music of violin and fl ute there were flowers everywhere right out onto the front steps where the balustrades were twined with white and pink roses that fi lled the air with a heady perfume even the balconies above held potted convolvuli that tumbled trumpetshaped flowers in a riot of colours over the edge barbara drew in a breath and mounted the steps there was no point to knocking for although several guests near the door gave her inquisitive glances as she hesitated outside in her illfitting uniform they strolled back towards the garden without speaking to her and it soon became apparent that if she wanted to find lynley she would have to barge right into the wedding reception to do so the thought made her more than a little bit ill she was about to retreat cravenly back to her car to retrieve an old mackintosh that would at least cover up her clothestoo tight in the hips and straining the material at shoulder and neckwhen the sounds of footsteps and laughter close by directed her attention to the stairway in the hall a woman was descending calling over her shoulder to someone who remained on the fl oor above just the two of us are going you must come as well and well make a party of it sid she turned saw barbara and stopped where she was one hand on the banister it was very nearly a pose for she was the kind of woman who could manage to make yards of haphazardly arranged tealcoloured silk look like the very latest word in haute couture she was not particularly tall but very slender with a fall of chestnut hair framing a perfect oval face from the dozens of times she had been to fetch lynley from the yard barbara recognised her at once she was lynleys longestrunning mistress and st jamess lab assistant lady helen clyde lady helen completed her descent and crossed the hall to the door so confident barbara noted so completely selfpossessed ive the most dreadful feeling that youve come for tommy she said immediately extending her hand hello im helen clyde barbara introduced herself surprised at the firmness of the womans grip her hands were thin very cool to the touch hes wanted at the yard poor man how miserable how damnably unfair lady helen spoke more to herself than to the other woman for she suddenly shot barbara an apologetic smile but its not your fault is it come hes just this way without waiting for a reply she moved down the hallway to the garden door giving barbara no choice but to follow however at her first glimpse of the cluster of linencovered tables at which fashionably clad guests chatted and laughed barbara stepped quickly back into the dimly lit hall her fi ngers wandered up to her neck lady helen paused her dark eyes refl ective shall i search tommy out for you she offered with another quick smile its a crush out there isnt it thank you barbara replied stiffl y and watched her walk across the lawn to a group standing in merry conversation round a tall man who managed to look as if somehow hed been born wearing morning clothes lady helen touched his arm and said a few words the man looked towards the house revealing a face that bore the unmistakable stamp of aristocracy it was a greek sculpture sort of face unaccountably timeless he brushed his blond hair back from his forehead placed his champagne glass on a table nearby and after exchanging a quip with one of his friends came towards the house with lady helen at his side from the safety of the shadows barbara watched lynleys approach his movements were graceful fluid like a cats he was the handsomest man she had ever seen she loathed him sergeant havers he nodded when they joined her im not on call this weekend barbara read the implication clearly youre interrupting me havers webberly sent me sir ring him if you like she didnt look at him directly as she replied but rather focussed her eyes somewhere just over his left shoulder but surely he knows that todays the wedding tommy lady helen protested mildly lynley let out his breath in a puff of anger damn and blast of course he knows he glanced out at the lawn then sharply back to barbara is this ripper business id been told that john stewart would join macpherson its business in the north as far as i know some girls involved barbara thought hed appreciate that piece of information some spice to the case just the way he liked it a tart for dessert she waited for him to demand the particulars that no doubt were fi rst and foremost on his mind age marital status and measurements of the damsel whose distress he was only too willing to alleviate his eyes narrowed in the north lady helen laughed regretfully well there go our plans to go dancing tonight tommy darling and i was just persuading sidney to come as well i suppose it cant be helped lynley replied but he moved abruptly from the shadows into the light and both the tightness of the movement and the play of a repressed reaction on his face told barbara how irritated he really was lady helen evidently saw this as well for she spoke again cheerfully of course sid and i could easily go dancing alone with androgyny the rage no doubt one of us might be taken for a man no matter how we dress or theres jeffrey cusick we could telephone him it was somehow a personal joke between them and it had its desired effect for lynley relaxed into a smile he followed it with a dry chuckle cusick my god these are desperate times oh you may laugh lady helen replied and did so herself but he took us to royal ascot when you were far too busily engaged in some bloodthirsty murder watch at st pancras station cambridge men you see have all sorts of fi ne qualities lynley laughed outright among which is the tendency to look like a penguin when formally dressed you dreadful creature lady helen gave her attention to barbara may i at least offer you some lovely crab salad before you drag tommy back to the yard years ago i was served the most terrifying egg sandwich there if the foods not improved this may be your last chance to eat well today barbara glanced at her watch she sensed an undercurrent of urgency in lynley and knew quite well that he wanted her to accept the invitation so that hed have a few more minutes with his friends before being called back to duty she wasnt about to accommodate him theres a meeting in twenty minutes im afraid lady helen sighed well thats hardly enough time to do it the justice it deserves shall i wait for you tommy or shall i phone jeffrey dont do that lynley responded your father would never forgive you for putting your future into the hands of cambridge she smiled very well if youre off then let me fetch the bride and groom to bid you farewell his face altered swiftly no helen ijust make my excuses a look passed between them something said without being said you must see them tommy lady helen murmured there was another pause a compromise being sought ill tell them youre waiting in the study she left quickly giving lynley no chance to respond he uttered something inaudible under his breath following lady helen with his eyes as she wove back through the crowd have you brought a car he asked barbara suddenly and started down the hall away from the celebration nonplussed she followed a mini youre not exactly dressed for its splendour ill adjust im sure chameleonlike what colour is it she was puzzled by the query an illconcealed attempt to make conversation as they walked to the front of the house mostly rust im afraid my favourite he held open a door and motioned her into a dark room ill just wait in the car sir ive left it stay here sergeant it was a command reluctantly she preceded him the curtains had been drawn the only light came from the door which they had opened but barbara could see it was a mans room richly panelled in dark oak and filled with shelves of books wellused furniture and an atmosphere redolent of comfortable old leather and the fragrance of scotch lynley gravitated absently to a wall that was covered with framed photographs and stood there quietly his eyes on a portrait that was central to the display it had been taken in a cemetery and the man who was its subject bent to touch the inscription on a tombstone whose carving had long since been obliterated by time the skilful composition of the piece directed the viewers eyes not to the awkward leg brace that distorted the mans posture but to the piercing interest that lit his gaunt face studying the picture lynley seemed to have forgotten her presence the moment barbara decided was probably as good as any to give him the news im off the street she announced bluntly thats why ive come if youre wondering he turned slowly towards her back in cid he asked good for you barbara but not for you what do you mean well someones got to tell you since webberly obviously hasnt congratulations youre stuck with me she waited to see his look of surprise when it was evident that none was forthcoming she pushed on of course its damned awkward having me assigned to youdont think i dont know it i cant fi gure out what webberly wants she was stumbling on barely hearing her own words uncertain whether she was trying to forestall or provoke his inevitable reaction the sharp explosion of anger the movement to the telephone to demand an explanation or worse the icy politeness that would last until he got the superintendent behind closed doors all that i can think is that theres no one else available or that ive got some sort of wonderful latent talent that only webberly knows of or maybe its a bit of a practical joke she laughed a little too loudly or perhaps youre the best for the job lynley finished what do you know about the case inothing only that tommy they swung around at the sound of the voice the single word spoken as if on a breath the bride stood in the doorway a spray of flowers in one hand and others tucked into the tumble of coppery hair that fell round her shoulders and down her back backlit from the hallway she looked in her ivory dress as if she were surrounded entirely by a cloud a titian creation come to life helen tells me youre leaving lynley appeared to have nothing to say he felt in his pockets brought out a gold cigarette case opened it and then snapped it shut with a flash of annoyance during this operation the bride watched him the flowers in her hand trembling momentarily its the yard deb lynley finally answered i have to go she watched him without speaking fi ngering a pendant she wore at her throat not until he met her eyes did she reply what a disappointment for everyone its not an emergency i hope simon told me last night that you might be reassigned to the ripper case no just a meeting ah she looked as if she might say something moreindeed she began to do sobut instead she turned to barbara with a friendly smile im deborah st james lynley rubbed his forehead lord i am sorry mechanically he completed the introduction wheres simon he was right behind me but i think dad caught him hes absolutely terrified to let us off on our own certain ill never take care of simon well enough her laughter bubbled up perhaps i should have considered the problems of marrying a man my father is so inordinately fond of the electrodes he keeps lecturing me you mustnt forget to see to his leg every morning i think hes told me that ten times today i imagine it was all you could do to keep him from going on the honeymoon as well well of course theyve not been apart for more than a day since she stopped suddenly awkwardly their eyes met she bit the inside of her lip and an ugly fl ush stained her cheeks there was an immediate anxious silence between them the kind in which the most telling sort of communication exists in body language and tension in the air it was fi nallymercifully barbara decidedbroken by the sound of slow painfully uneven footsteps in the hall awkward harbinger of deborahs husband i see that youve come to capture tommy st james paused in the doorway but continued to speak quietly as was his habit to direct attention away from his disability and put others at ease in his presence thats a strange twist on tradition barbara time was when the brides were kidnapped not the best man he was barbara decided very much hephaestus to lynleys apollo aside from his eyes the satin blue of a highland sky and his hands the sensitive tools of an artist simon allcourtst james was singularly unattractive his hair was dark unruly with curls and haphazardly cut in a way that did nothing to make it manageable his face was a combination of aquilinity and angles harsh in repose forbidding in anger yet vibrant with good nature when softened by his smile he was sapling thin but not sapling sturdy a man who had known too much pain and sorrow at far too young an age barbara smiled as he joined them her fi rst genuine smile of the entire afternoon but even best men are generally not kidnapped to new scotland yard how are you simon fine or so my fatherinlaw continues to tell me lucky as well it seems he saw it all from the beginning he knew it directly the day of her birth youve been introduced to deborah only just now and we can keep you no longer webberlys called a meeting lynley put in you know how that is how i do then we wont ask you to stay were off ourselves in a very little while helen has the address if anything should come up dont give a thought to that lynley paused as if he were not quite sure what to do next my warmest congratulations st james he settled on saying thank you the other man replied he nodded to barbara touched his brides shoulder lightly and left the room how odd barbara thought they didnt even shake hands will you go to the yard dressed like that deborah asked lynley he looked at his clothes ruefully anything to keep up my reputation as a rake they laughed together it was a warm communication that died as suddenly as it had risen from it grew yet another little silence well lynley began id a speech all planned deborah said quickly looking down at her fl owers they trembled once again in her hand and a shower of babys breath fell to the floor she raised her head somethingit was just the kind of thing helen might say talk about my childhood dad this house you know the sort of thing witty and clever but im absolutely pathetic at that sort of thing quite out of my depth a hopeless incompetent she looked down again to see that a very small dachshund had come into the study and carried in its jaws a womans sequined handbag the dog placed the bag at deborahs satinshod feet supremely confident that the offering had merit a tail wagged in the friendliest fashion oh no peach laughing deborah bent to retrieve the purloined article but when she straightened her green eyes glittered with tears thank you tommy for everything really for it all the best deb he said lightly in reply he went to her hugged her quickly to him and brushed a kiss against her hair and it came to barbara as she stood there watching that for some reason st james had left the two of them together precisely so that lynley could do just that the body had no head that single grisly detail was the most prominent feature of the police photographs that were being passed among the three cid officers gathered at the circular table in the scotland yard office father hart looked nervously from one face to the next and he fingered the tiny silver rosary in his pocket it had been blessed by pius xii in not an individual audience of course one could never hope for that but certainly that trembling numinous hand making the sign of the cross over two thousand reverential pilgrims counted for a powerful sort of something eyes closed hed held the rosary high above his head as if somehow that would allow the popes blessing to strike it more potently he was well on his way into the third decade of the sorrowful mysteries when the tall blond man spoke what a blow was there given he murmured and father hart looked his way was he a policeman father hart couldnt understand why the man was dressed so formally but now upon hearing the words he looked at him hopefully ah shakespeare yes just the very thing somehow the big man with the awful cigar looked at him blankly father hart cleared his throat and watched them continue to scrutinise the pictures hed been with them for nearly a quarter of an hour and in that time barely a word had been exchanged a cigar had been lit by the older man the woman had twice bitten off something shed intended to say and nothing more had occurred until that line from shakespeare the woman tapped her fingers restlessly on the top of the table she at least was some sort of police person father hart knew that by the uniform she wore but she seemed so entirely unpleasant with her tiny shifting eyes and her grim little mouth she would never do not what he needed not what roberta needed what should he say the horrid photographs continued to be passed among them father hart did not need to see them he knew far too well what they captured hed been there first and it was all so unspeakably engraved on his mind william teys sprawled out on his sideall six feet four of himin a ghastly quasifetal position right arm extended as if hed been reaching for something left arm curled into his stomach knees drawn up halfway to his chest and where the head had beenthere was simply nothing like cloten himself but no imogen there to awaken in horror by his side just roberta and those terrifying words i did it im not sorry the head had rolled into a mound of sodden hay in a corner of the stall and when hed seen itoh god the stealthy eyes of a barn rat glittered in the cavityquite small of coursebut the quivering grey snout was brilliant with blood and the tiny paws dug our father who art in heavenour father who art in heavenoh theres more theres more and i cant remember it now father hart the blond man in the morning coat had removed his reading spectacles and had taken from his pocket a gold cigarette case do you smoke iyes thank you the priest snatched quickly at the case so that the others might not see how his hand trembled the man passed the case to the woman who shook her head sharply in refusal a silver lighter was produced it all took a few moments blessed time to allow him to gather together his fragmented thoughts the blond man relaxed in his chair and studied a long line of photographs that had been posted on one of the walls of the offi ce why did you go to the farm that day father hart he asked quietly his eyes moving from one picture to the next father hart squinted myopically across the room were those pictures of suspects he wondered hopefully had scotland yard seen fit to begin pursuing this malevolent beast already he couldnt tell wasnt even certain from this distance that the photographs were of people at all it was sunday he replied as if that would somehow say everything the blond man turned his head at that surprisingly his eyes were an engaging brown were you in the habit of going to teyss farm on sundays for dinner or something ohiexcuse me i thought the report you see this would never do father hart sucked eagerly at the cigarette he looked at his fingers the nicotine stains climbed past every joint no wonder hed been offered one he shouldnt have forgotten his own should have bought a pack back at kings cross but there was so very much then he puffed hungrily at the tobacco father hart the older man said he was obviously the blonds superior theyd all been introduced but hed stupidly forgotten their names the womans he knew havers sergeant by her garments but the other two had slipped his mind he gazed at their grave faces in mounting panic im sorry you asked did you go to teyss farm every sunday father hart made a determined effort to think clearly chronologically systematically for once his fingers sought the rosary in his pocket the cross dug into his thumb he could feel the tiny corpus stretched out in agony oh lord to die that way no he answered in a rush william iswas our precentor such a wonderful basso profundo he could make the church ring with sound and i father hart took a ragged breath to put himself back on the track hed not come to mass that morning nor had roberta i was concerned the teyses never miss mass so i went to the farm the cigar smoker squinted at him through the pungent smoke do you do that for all your parishioners must certainly keep them in line if you do father hart had smoked his cigarette down to the filter there was nothing for it but to stub it out the blond man did the same although his was not halfsmoked he brought out the case and offered another again the silver lighter appeared the fl ame caught produced the smoke that seared his throat soothed his nerves numbed his lungs well it was mostly because olivia was concerned a glance at the report olivia odell father hart nodded eagerly she and william teys you see had just become engaged the announcement was to be made at a small tea that afternoon shed rung him several times after mass but got nothing so she came to me why didnt she go out there herself she wanted to of course but there was bridie and the duck hed got lost somehow the usual family crisis and she couldnt be settled down until he was recovered the three others glanced at one another warily the priest reddened how absurd it all sounded he plunged on you see bridie is olivias little girl she has a pet duck well not really a pet not in the actual sense how could he explain all of it to them all the twists and turns of their village life the blond man spoke kindly so while olivia and bridie were looking for the duck you went out to the farm thats so exactly right thank you father hart smiled gratefully tell us what happened when you arrived i went to the house first but no one was there the door wasnt locked and i remember thinking that was strange william always locked everything tight as a drum if he went out he was peculiar that way insisted i do the same with the church if i wasnt about even when the choir practised on wednesdays he never once left until every person was gone and id seen to the doors thats the way he was i imagine his unlocked house gave you a bit of a turn the blond man said it did really even at one oclock in the afternoon so when i couldnt raise anyone with a knock he looked at them all apologetically i suppose i walked right in anything peculiar inside nothing at all it was perfectly clean as it always was there was however his eyes shifted to the window how to explain yes the candles had burned down have they no electricity father hart looked at them earnestly these are votive candles they were always lit always twentyfour hours a day for a shrine you mean yes thats exactly what it is a shrine he agreed immediately and hurried on when i saw that i knew at once something was wrong neither william nor roberta would ever have let the candles go out so i went through the house and from there out to the barn and there what was there really left to report the chilling tranquillity had told him at once outside in the near pasture the bleating of sheep and the cry of birds spoke of sanity and peace but in the barn the absolute quiet was the core of diablerie even from the door the rich cloying smell of pooled blood had reached him over the mixed odours of manure and grain and rotting hay it had drawn him forward with seductive unavoidable hands roberta had been sitting on an overturned pail in one of the stalls a big girl born of her fathers stock used to the labour of a farm she was motionless staring not at the headless monstrosity that lay at her feet but at the opposite wall and at the cracks that mapped its surface roberta he had called urgently he felt sickness rising from stomach to throat and his bowels loosening there was no response not a breath not a movement just the sight of her broad back her sturdy legs curled beneath her the axe at her side and then over her shoulder hed seen the body clearly for the fi rst time i did it im not sorry the only thing shed said father hart squeezed his eyes shut against the memory i went at once to the house and rang gabriel for a moment lynley believed that the priest was talking about the archangel himself the odd little man did seem a bit in touch with other worlds as he sat there painfully struggling through his story gabriel webberly asked incredulously lynley could tell that the supers patience was wearing thin he fingered through the report for some indication of the name and found it quickly enough gabriel langston village constable he said and i take it father that constable langston phoned the richmond police at once the priest nodded he looked warily at lynleys cigarette case and the other man opened it and offered another round havers refused and the priest was about to do so as well until lynley took one himself his throat felt raw but he knew theyd never get to the end of the story unless the cleric was supplied with nicotine and it appeared that he needed a companion in his vice lynley swallowed uncomfortably longed for a whisky lit up again and let the cigarette burn itself to nothing in the ashtray police came down from richmond it was all very quick it wasthey took roberta well what could you expect she admitted to the crime havers had spoken shed risen from her seat and wandered to the window her voice clearly informed them that in her opinion they were wasting their time with this foolish old man that they ought to be barrelling towards the north at this very moment lots of people admit to crimes webberly said motioning her back to her seat ive had twentyfive confessions to the ripper killings so far i just wanted to point out that can come later roberta didnt kill her father the priest went on as if the other two had not spoken its just not possible but family crimes happen lynley said gently not when theres whiskers to the priests bizarre commentso obviously logical and satisfactory to himselfno one made a response no one spoke at all or looked particularly at anyone else there was a lengthy unendurable pause in the proceedings broken by webberly who pushed away from the table jesus he muttered im terribly sorry but he stalked to a cabinet at the corner of the room and pulled out three bottles whisky sherry or brandy he asked the others lynley sent a prayer of thanksgiving to bacchus whisky he replied havers nothing for me she said primly im on duty yes of course father whatll it be oh a sherry would be only too sherry it is webberly tossed back a small neat whisky before pouring again and returning to the table they all stared meditatively into their glasses as if each wondered whod be the fi rst to ask the question lynley finally did so his throat newly soothed by the fragrant single malt ahwhiskers he prompted father hart looked down at the papers spread out on the table isnt it in the report he asked plaintively about the dog yes it does mention the dog that was whiskers the priest explained and sanity was restored there was collective relief it was dead in the stall with teys lynley noted aloud yes dont you see thats why we all of us know robertas innocent aside from the fact that she was devoted to her father theres whiskers to consider she would never hurt whiskers father hart eagerly sought out the words to explain he was a farm dog part of the family since roberta was five he was retired of course a bit blind but one just doesnt put down dogs like that everyone in the village knew whiskers he was a bit of a pet to all of us hed wander down of an afternoon to nigel parrishs house on the common have a bit of a lie in the sun whilst nigel played the organ hes our organist at church you see or sometimes hed have his tea at olivias got on with the duck did he webberly asked straightfaced oh famously father hart beamed whiskers got on with us all and when roberta was out and about he followed her everywhere thats why when they took roberta i had to do something and here i am yes indeed here you are webberly concluded youve been more than helpful father i believe inspector lynley and sergeant havers have all that they need for now he got to his feet and opened the door of his offi ce harriman the morselike tapping of word processor keys stopped a chair scraped on the fl oor webberlys secretary popped into the room dorothea harriman bore a modest resemblance to the princess of wales which she emphasised to a disconcerting degree by tinting her sculptured hair the approximate shade of sunlight on wheat and refusing to wear her spectacles in the presence of anyone likely to comment upon the spencerian shape of her nose and chin she was eager to advance swept up in her creer as she monosyllabically called it she was intelligent enough to make a success of her job and would most likely do so especially if she could bring herself to renounce her distracting manner of dress which everyone referred to as parody princess today she was wearing what looked like a dropwaisted pink ball gown that had been shortened for everyday wear it was utterly hideous yes superintendent she asked in spite of threats and imprecations harriman insisted upon calling every employee at the yard by his or her full title webberly turned to the priest are you staying in london father or returning to yorkshire im on the late train back confessions were this afternoon you see and as i wasnt there i did promise to have them until eleven tonight of course webberly nodded call a cab for father hart he told harriman oh but i havent enough webberly held up a restraining hand its on the yard father on the yard the priest mouthed the words coloured with pleasure at the implication of brotherhood and acceptance behind them he allowed the superintendents secretary to shepherd him from the room what do you drink when you do drink sergeant havers webberly asked when father hart had gone tonic water sir she replied right he muttered and opened the door again harriman he barked fi nd a bottle of schweppes for sergeant havers dont pretend you havent the slightest idea where to get one just get one he slammed the door went to the cabinet and brought out the bottle of whisky lynley rubbed his forehead and pressed tightly at both sides of his eyes god what a headache he murmured have either of you any aspirin i do havers replied crisply and rooted through her handbag for a small tin she tossed it across the table to him take as many as you like inspector webberly regarded them both thoughtfully he wondered not for the first time if this partnership of two such antipodal personalities had even the ghost of a chance for success havers was like a hedgehog curling herself into a protective ball of thistle at the least provocation yet underneath that prickly exterior of hers was a fine probing mind what was left to question was whether thomas lynley was the right combination of patience and congeniality to encourage that mind to overcome the wrangling of the termagant personality that had made it impossible for havers to work in successful partnership with anyone else sorry to take you out of the wedding lynley but there was no other way this is the second runin nies and kerridge have had up north the first one was a disaster nies was right all along and crisis ensued i thought he fingered the rim of his glass and chose his words carefully that your presence might serve to remind nies that he can sometimes be wrong webberly watched carefully for a reaction from the younger mana stiffening of muscles a movement of the head a fl icker behind the eyelids but there was nothing to betray him it was no particular secret among his superior offi cers at the yard that lynleys single runin with nies nearly five years before in richmond had resulted in his own arrest and however premature and ultimately spurious that arrest had been it was the only black mark on an otherwise admirable record of service a denigration that lynley would have to live with for the rest of his career its fine sir lynley replied easily i understand a knock on the door announced miss harrimans successful quest for the schweppes which she placed triumphantly on the table in front of sergeant havers she glanced at the clock its hands were nearing six as this isnt a regularly scheduled workday superintendent she began i thought i might yes yes go on home webberly waved oh no it isnt that at all harriman said sweetly but i think in regulation sixtyfi vea regarding compensatory time take monday and ill break your arm harriman webberly said with equivalent sweetness not in the middle of this ripper business wouldnt think of it sir shall i just put it on the tick regulation sixtyfi vec indicates that put it anywhere harriman she smiled understandingly at him absolutely superintendent the door closed behind her did that vixen wink at you as she left the room lynley webberly demanded i didnt notice sir it was half past eight when they began gathering together the papers from the table in webberlys office darkness had fallen and the fluorescent lighting did nothing to hide the rooms genial air of disarray if anything it was worse now than it had been before with the additional files from the north spread out on the table and an acrid cirrus of cigarette and cigar smoke that in conjunction with the mixed scents of whisky and sherry produced the effect of being in a rather downatheel gentlemens club barbara noticed the deep lines of exhaustion that were drawn on lynleys face and judged that the aspirin had done him little good he had gone to the wall of ripper photographs and was inspecting them moving from one to the next as she watched he lifted a hand to one of themit was the kings cross victim she noted needlesslyand traced a finger along the crude incision that the rippers knife had made death closes all he murmured hes black and white flesh with no resilience who could ever recognise a living man from this or from this for that matter webberly responded he brusquely gestured to the photographs that father hart had brought lynley rejoined them he stood near barbara but was she well knew oblivious of her she watched the expressions pass quickly across his face as he sorted through the photographs one last time revulsion disbelief pity his features were so easy to read that she wondered how he ever managed to conduct a successful investigation without giving everything away to a suspect but he did it all the time she knew his record of success the string of followup convictions he was the golden boy in more ways than one well head up there in the morning then he said to the superintendent he picked up a manila envelope and tucked all the materials inside webberly was examining a train schedule which he had unearthed from the jumble on his desk take the eightfortyfi ve lynley groaned have a bit of mercy sir id like at least the next ten hours to get rid of this migraine then the ninethirty and no later than that webberly glanced round his offi ce one last time as he shrugged into a tweed overcoat like his other clothing it was becoming threadbare in spots and a small patch was worked poorly into the left lapel where no doubt cigar ash had done its worst report in on tuesday he said as he left the superintendents absence seemed to rejuvenate lynley at once barbara noted for he moved with amazing alacrity of spirit to the telephone the moment the man was gone he dialled a number tapped his fi ngers rhythmically against the desk top and peered at the face of the clock after nearly a minute his face lit with a smile you did wait old duck he said into the phone have you broken it off with jeffrey cusick at lastha i knew it helen ive told you repeatedly that a barrister cant possibly make you happy did the reception end well he did oh lord what a scene that must have been has andrew ever cried in his lifepoor st james was he absolutely slain with mortificationwell its the champagne does it you know did sidney recoveryes well she did look for a while as if shed get a bit maudlin at the end shes never made a secret of it that simons her favourite brother of course dancings still on we promised ourselves didnt wecan you give me say an hour or sohmm what was thathelen my god what a naughty little girl he laughed and dropped the phone back onto its cradle still here sergeant he asked when he turned from the desk youve no car sir she replied stonily i thought id wait to see if you needed a ride home thats awfully good of you but weve all been kept here long enough for one evening and im sure youve far better things to do on a saturday night than see me home ill catch a cab he bent over webberlys desk for a moment writing quickly on a piece of paper this is my address he said handing it to her be there at seven tomorrow morning will you that should give us some time to make more sense of all this before we head to yorkshire good evening then he left the room barbara looked down at the paper in her hand at the handwriting which even in a hurry still managed to be an elegant scrawl she studied it for more than a minute before she ripped it into tiny pieces and tossed them into the rubbish she knew quite well where thomas lynley lived the guilt began on the uxbridge road it always did tonight it was worse when she saw that the travel agency was closed preventing her from gathering the material on greece as shed promised empress tours where had they ever come up with a name like that for such a grubby little shop where people sat behind plastictopped desks that were painted to look as if they were wood she slowed the car peering through the dirty windscreen to look for signs of life the owners lived above the shop perhaps if she banged on the door a bit she could rouse them no it was too ridiculous mum was no more going to greece than to the moon shed just have to wait for the brochures a bit longer still shed passed at least a dozen agencies in the city today why hadnt she stopped what else did mum have to live for but those silly little dreams overcome with the need to compensate in some way for her failure barbara pulled the car over in front of patels grocery a ramshackle affair of green paint rusting shelves and precariously stacked crates from which emanated that peculiar blend of odours that comes from vegetables not quite as fresh as they ought to be patel was still open at least leave it to him never to miss a chance to make ten pence barbara he greeted her from inside the shop as she bent over the boxed fall fruit on the pavement outside mostly apples a few late peaches shipped in from spain whassa doin out so late he couldnt imagine her having a date of course no one could she couldnt herself had to work late mr patel she replied how much for the peaches eightyfive a pound but for you pretty face we say eighty she picked out six he weighed them wrapped them and handed them over i was seeing your father today she looked up quickly and caught the guard dropping over mr patels dark face like a mask when he saw her expression was he behaving himself she asked casually shouldering her handbag my goodness yes he always behaves mr patel took her money counted it twice carefully and dropped it into his register you take care now barbara men see a nice girl like you and yes ill take care barbara interrupted she tossed the peaches onto the front seat of the car nice girl like you barb you take care keep those legs crossed virtue like yours is defi nitely easy to lose and a woman fallen is fallen forever she laughed bitterly jerked the car into gear and pulled out onto the road in acton there were two potential areas of residence simply called by inhabitants the right and wrong streets it was as if a dividing line split the suburb arbitrarily condemning one set of residents while it elevated others on the right streets of acton pristine brick houses boasted woodwork which always sparkled admirably in the morning sun in a multiplicity of colours roses grew in abundance there fuchsias flourished in hanging pots children played games on unlittered pavements and in patchwork gardens snow kissed gabled roofs in peaks of meringue in the winter while in summer tall elms made green tunnels through which families strolled in the perfumed evening light there was never an argument in the right streets of acton never loud music the smell of cooking fish or fi sts raised in a fight it was sheer perfection the single ocean on which every familys boat of dreams sailed placidly forward but things were much different as close as a single street away people liked to say that the wrong streets of acton got the heat of the day and thats why things were so different there it was as if an enormous hand had swept down from the sky and jumbled up houses and avenues and people so that everything was always just a bit out of sorts no one worked quite so hard on appearances houses sagged moodily into decay gardens once planted were soon ignored then forgotten altogether and left to fend for themselves children played noisily on the dirty pavements disruptive games that frequently brought mothers to doorways shrieking for peace from the din the winter wind spit through poorly sealed windows and summer brought rain that leaked through the roofs people in the wrong streets didnt think much about being anywhere else for to think of being elsewhere was to think of hope and hope was dead in the wrong part of acton barbara drove there now turning the mini in on a street lined with cars that were rusting like her own neither garden nor fence fronted her own house but rather a pavementhard patch of dirt on which she parked her little car next door mrs gustafson was playing bbc since she was nearly deaf the entire neighbourhood was nightly regaled with the doings of her favourite television heroes across the street the kirbys were engaging in their usual preintercourse argument while their four children ignored them as best they could by throwing dirt clods at an indifferent cat that watched from a nearby fi rstfl oor window sill barbara sighed groped for her front door key and went into her house it was chicken and peas she could smell it at once like a gust of foul breath that you lovey her mothers voice called bit late arent you dear out with some friends what a laugh working mum im back on cid her mother shuffled to the door of the sitting room like barbara she was short but terribly thin as if a long illness had ravaged her body and taken it sinew by sinew on a march towards the grave cid she asked her voice growing querulous oh must you barbara you know how i feel about that my lovey as she spoke she raised a skeletal hand to her thin hair in a characteristic nervous gesture her overlarge eyes were puffy and rimmed with red as if she had spent the day weeping brought you some peaches barbara responded gesturing with the sack the travel agent was closed im afraid i even banged on the door to get them down from above but they mustve gone out diverted from the thought of cid mrs haverss face changed lighting with a dusty glow she caught at the fabric of her shabby housedress and held it bunched in one hand as if containing excitement oh that doesnt matter at all wait till you see go in the kitchen and ill be right there your dinners still warm barbara walked past the sitting room wincing at the chatter of the television and the fusty smell of a chamber too long kept closed the kitchen fetid with the odour of tough broiled chicken and anaemic peas was little better she looked gloomily at the plate on the table touched her fi nger to the withered fl esh of the fowl it was stone cold as slippery and puckered as something kept preserved in formaldehyde for forensic examination fat had congealed round its edges and a single rancid dab of butter had failed to melt on peas that looked as if they had had their last warming in a former decade wonderful she thought could the lovely crab salad have even come close to this epicurean splendour she looked for the daily paper and found it as always on the seat of one of the wobbly kitchen chairs she grabbed the front section opened it to the middle and deposited her dinner on the smiling face of the duchess of kent lovey youve not thrown away your nice dinner damn barbara turned to see her mothers stricken face lips working in rejection lines drawn in deep grooves down to her chin pale blue eyes filled with tears she clutched an artificial leather album to her bony chest caught me mum barbara forced a smile putting an arm round the womans birdlike shoulders and leading her to the table i had a bite at the yard so i wasnt hungry should i have saved it for you or dad mrs havers blinked quickly the relief on her face was pathetic ii suppose not no of course not we wouldnt want chicken and peas two nights in a row would we she laughed gently and laid her album on the table dad got me greece she announced did he so thats what he was doing out of the cage all by himself barbara asked casually her mother looked away fingering the edges of her album picking nervously at the artificial gold leaf she gave a sudden movement a quick brilliant smile and pulled out a chair sit here lovey let me show you how we went the album was opened previous trips through italy france turkeynow there was a bizarre oneand peru were fl ipped through quickly until they arrived at the newest section devoted to greece now heres the hotel we stayed at in corfu do you see how its just right there on the bay we could have gone down to kanoni to a newer one but i liked the view didnt you lovey barbaras eyes smarted she refused to submit how long will it take will it never end youve not answered me barbara her mothers voice quivered with anxiety i did work so hard on the trip all today having the view was better than the new hotel in kanoni wasnt it lovey much better mum barbara forced the words out and got to her feet ive got a case tomorrow can we do greece later would she understand what sort of case its abit of a problem with a family in yorkshire ill be gone a few days can you manage do you think or shall i ask mrs gustafson to come and stay wonderful thought the deaf leading the mad mrs gustafson her mother closed the album and drew herself stiffly upright i think not my lovey dad and i can manage on our own we always have you know except that short time when tony the room was unbearably stifl ingly hot oh god barbara thought just a wisp of air just this once for a moment she went to the back door which led out to the weedchoked garden wherere you going her mother asked quickly that familiar note of hysteria creeping into her voice theres nothing out there you mustnt go outside after dark barbara picked up the discarded chicken dinner rubbish mum i wont be a moment you can wait by the door and see im all right but iby the door if you like no i mustnt be by the door well leave it open just a bit though you can shout if you need me that sounds the plan mum she picked up the package and went hurriedly out into the night a few minutes she breathed the cool air listened to the familiar neighbourhood sounds and felt in her pocket for a crumpled pack of players she shook one out lit it and gazed up at the sky what had started the seductive descent into madness it was tony of course bright frecklefaced imp fresh spring air in the constant darkness of winter watchme watchme barbie i can do anything chemistry sets and rugger balls cricket on the common and tag in the afternoon and horribly stupidly chasing a ball right onto the uxbridge road but he didnt die from that just a stay in hospital a persistent fever a peculiar rash and a lingering etiolating kiss from leukaemia the wonderful delicious irony of it all go in with a broken leg come out with leukaemia it had taken him four agonising years to die four years for them to make this descent into madness lovey the voice was tremulous right here mum just looking at the sky barbara crushed her cigarette out on the rockhard ground and walked back inside deborah st james braked the car to a halt on a breath of laughter and turned to her husband simon have you never been told youre quite the worlds worst navigator he smiled and closed the road atlas never once but have a heart consider the fog she looked out the windscreen at the large dark building that loomed in front of them poor excuse for not being able to read a road map if you ask me are we at the right place it doesnt look as if a souls waited up for us i shouldnt be surprised i told them wed arrive at nine and now its he peered at his watch in the weak interior light of the car good god its half past eleven she heard the laughter in his voice are you for it my love shall we spend our wedding night in the car teenagers grappling hotly in the backseat do you mean she tossed her long hair back with a shake of her head hmm it is a thought but im afraid in that case you should have hired something larger than an escort no simon theres nothing for it im afraid but banging on the doors and rousing someone but you shall make all our excuses she stepped out into the chilly night air taking a moment to study the building before her it was a preelizabethan structure by initial design but one which had undergone a number of jacobean changes that added to its air of rakish whimsicality mullioned windows winked in the moonlight that fi ltered through the wispy fog which had settled on the moors and was now drifting down into the dales walls were covered with virginia creeper its leaves burning the old stone to rich russet chimneys germinated upon the roof in a helterskelter pattern of capricious warts against the night sky there was a contumacy about the building that denied the very existence of the twentieth century and this quality spread to the grounds that surrounded it here enormous english oaks stretched out their branches over lawns where statuary encircled by flowers interrupted the fl ow of the land pathways meandered into the woods beyond the house with a beckoning siren charm in the absolute stillness the play of water from a fountain nearby and the cry of a lamb from a distant farm were the only auditory concomitants to the whisper of the breeze that soughed through the night they might have been richard and anne home to middleham at last deborah turned back to the car her husband had opened his door and was watching her waiting in his usual patient fashion for her photographers reaction to the beauty of the place its wonderful she said thank you my love he lifted his braced left leg from the car dropped it with a thump onto the drive and extended his hand with a practised movement deborah helped him to his feet i feel as if weve been going round in circles for hours st james remarked stretching thats because we have she teased just two hours from the station deborah a wonderful drive he laughed softly well it was love admit it absolutely the third time i saw rievaulx abbey i was positively enchanted she glanced at the forbidding oak door before them shall we try it then they crunched across the gravel drive to the dark recess into which the door was set a pitted wooden bench was tipped drunkenly against the wall next to it and two enormous urns stood on either side with the perversity of plants one urn held a burgeoning beauty of flowers while the other was home to a withering colony of geraniums whose dried leaves fluttered raspingly to the ground as deborah and her husband passed st james applied some considerable strength to the large brass fixture that hung in the centre of the door silence greeted its fading echoes theres a bell as well deborah noticed have a go with that the ringing far back in the deepest reaches of the house immediately roused what sounded like an entire pack of hounds into furious howling well thats certainly done it st james laughed dammit casper jason sonly the bell you devils pitched very much like a mans but with the unmistakable cadence of a country woman born and bred a raucous voice shouted brisk reprovals behind the door down with you out get back tthe kitchen a pause followed by some desperate scuffling no blast you out in the back why you blackguard fiends give me my slips damn your eyes with that a bolt shrieked back from the inside of the door which was pulled briskly open a barefooted woman hopped back and forth on the icy stones of the entry her frizzy grey hair flying about her shoulders in bursts of electricity mr allcourtst james she said without preamble come in with you both damn she removed the woollen shawl she had thrown about her shoulders and dropped it to the floor where it immediately became a rug for her feet she tugged the edges of a voluminous crimson dressing gown more closely round her and the moment the others entered energetically slammed home the door there thats better thank god she laughed a bellow both ungoverned and unrefined pardon me both im generally not so awfully emily brontë did you get lost extensively st james admitted this is my wife deborah mrs burtonthomas he added you must be frozen solid their hostess noted well well take care of that soon enough lets get out of here and into the oak hall ive a nice fire there danny she shouted over her left shoulder then come its just this way danny they followed her through the old stoneflagged room white walled dark beamed it was bonechillingly cold with recessed windows uncovered by curtains a single black refectory table in the centre of the floor and a large unlit fireplace sinking deep into the far wall above it hung an assortment of fi rearms and oddly peaked military helmets mrs burton thomas nodded as st james and deborah gave their attention to these oh yes cromwells roundheads were here she said they had a nice bite out of keldale hall for a stretch of ten months in the civil war sixteen fortyfour she added darkly as if expecting them to commit to memory the year of infamy in the history of the burtonthomas clan but we rid ourselves of them just as soon as we could blackguard devils the lot she led them through the shadows of a darkened dining room and from there to a long richly panelled chamber where scarlet curtains were drawn across embrasured windows and a coal fire roared in the grate well lord wheres she got herself to mrs burtonthomas muttered and went to the door through which theyd just come danny that brought a responding running of footsteps and a touslehaired girl of about nineteen appeared in the doorway sorry the newcomer laughed got your slips though she tossed these to the woman who caught them deftly chewed a bit here and there im afraid thanks pet will you fetch some brandy for our guests that dreadful watson man finished off a good third of a decanter before he staggered off to bed tonight its gone dry and theres more in the cellar will you see to it as the girl went to do so mrs burtonthomas examined her slippers frowning at a hole newly chewed in one heel she muttered beneath her breath put the slippers back on her feet and replaced the shawlwhich she had been using as a sort of earthbound fl ying carpet in their progress through the house on her shoulders please do sit down didnt want to light the fire in your room till you arrived so well have a bit of a chat whilst it heats up bloody cold for october isnt it early winter they say the cellar was obviously closer than the word itself implied for within moments young danny returned with a fresh bottle of brandy she opened and decanted it at a hepplewhite table which stood under a portrait of some glowering hawkfeatured burtonthomas ancestor then returned to them with a tray on which three brandy glasses and a decanter sparkled shall i see to the room auntie she asked please get eddie for the luggage and do apologise to that american couple if theyre wandering about wondering what all the uproar is will you mrs burtonthomas poured three healthy drinks as the girl left the room once again ah but they came here for atmosphere and by god i can dish it up in spades she laughed uproariously and threw down her drink in a single gulp i cultivate colour mrs burtonthomas admitted gleefully pouring herself another give them a bit of the old eccentric and youll make every guidebook from frommer to ronay the womans appearance served as complete verification of this last statement she was a combination of stately home and gothic horror imposingly tall with a mans broad shoulders she moved with a looselimbed indifference to the priceless furniture with which the room was filled she had the hands of a labourer the ankles of a dancer and the face of an aging valkyrie her eyes were blue deepsunken above cheekbones jutting across her face she had a hookshaped nose that with the passage of years had grown more pronounced so that now in the uncertain light of the room it seemed to be casting a shadow upon her entire upper lip she looked about sixtyfive years old but age to mrs burtonthomas was obviously a very relative matter well she was looking them over hungry at all you did miss dinner by about a glance cast towards the grandfather clock ticking sonorously against a far wall two hours hungry my love st james asked deborah his eyes deborah saw were alive with amusement ahno not a bit she turned to mrs burtonthomas youve others staying here then just one american couple youll see them at breakfast you know the sort polyester and showy gold chains godawful diamond ring on the mans little finger kept me howlingly entertained last night with a discourse on dentistry wanted me to have my teeth sealed it seems the very latest thing mrs burtonthomas shuddered and downed another drink bit egyptiansounding something for posterity you know or was it to prevent cavities she shrugged with grand indifference havent the slightest what is this fi xation americans all have with their teeth i ask you all straight and shiny well god crooked teeth give a face a bit of dash i say she poked ineffectually at the fi re sending a shower of sparks out onto the rug then stomped on these with terrific energy well delighted youre here is all i can say not that grandpapa isnt still doing fl ipfl ops in the grave at my opening the place up to the tourist trade but it was that or the bleeding national trust she winked at them over the rim of her glass and pardon me for saying so but this sort of life is ever so roaringly more amusing there was a clearing of the throat from the direction of the doorway where a boy stood awkwardly in plaid flannel pyjamas an antique smoking jacket several sizes too large belted clumsily round his slender waist it gave his appearance an anachronistic panache he carried a pair of crutches in his hands what is it eddie mrs burtonthomas asked impatiently youve done the luggage havent you thesere in the boot auntie he responded shall i do em as well of course you ninny he turned and scurried from her sight she shook her head darkly im a martyr to my family an absolute religious martyr well come now little ones let me show you to your room you must be dropping with fatigue no no bring the brandy with you they followed her back through the dining room to the stone hall and from there through another doorway that took them to the stairway polished uncarpeted oak stairs led to the upper regions of the house swathed in deep shadows baronial stairway mrs burtonthomas informed them slapping her hand on its thick wood railing dont even make these dandies anymore come its just this way in the upper hall she led them down a dimly lit corridor in which ancestral portraits battled with three flemish tapestries mrs burtonthomas nodded moodily towards the latter simply must move them god knows theyve been hanging there since but no one could ever convince greatgrandmama that these things look better from a bit of a distance tradition you understand i battle it everywhere here we are little ones she threw open a door i shall leave you here all the mod cons but youll find them no doubt with that she was gone dressing gown fl apping round her ankles slippers slapping comfortingly upon the fl oor a tumble of coals upon the hearth welcomed them into the bedroom it was deborah thought as she entered the most beautiful room she had ever seen oak panelled with the beguiling faces of two gainsborough women smiling down from either end it embraced them with centuries old welcome and grace small table lamps with rose shades put forth a diffused radiance that burnished the mahogany of the enormous fourposter a looming wardrobe cast an elongated shadow against one wall and a dressing table held an array of crystal atomisers and silverbacked brushes at one of the windows stood a cabriolelegged table on which an arrangement of lilies had been placed deborah walked to this and touched her fingers to the fluted edge of one ivory fl ower theres a card she said pulled it off and read it her eyes filled with tears she turned to her husband he had gone to the hearth and lowered himself into an overstuffed chair that sat to one side of it he was watching her as he so often did with that familiar reserve the only communication coming from his eyes thank you simon she whispered she tucked the card back into the flowers swallowed an emotion she couldnt define and forced herself to speak lightly how did you ever fi nd this place do you like it he asked in answer you couldnt possibly have chosen anything more wonderful and you know it dont you he didnt reply a knock at the door and he looked at her a smile dancing round the corners of his mouth his expression plainly saying whats next come in he called it was the girl danny a pile of blankets in her arms sorry forgot these theres an eiderdown already but auntie thinks the worlds as cold as herself she walked into the room with an air of friendly proprietorship eddie get your things in she asked opening the wardrobe and plopping the blankets unceremoniously inside hes just a bit thick you know got to excuse him she studied herself in the wavy mirror on the inside of the wardrobe door fingered a few wandering hairs just a bit more out of place than theyd been before and caught them watching her now youd best beware of the babys cry she pronounced solemnly it was as if shed spoken exactly on cue the hounds would surely howl next the babys cry have the americans a child with them deborah asked dannys dark eyes widened she looked from woman to man you dont know has no one ever told you deborah saw from the girls behaviour that they were soon to be enlightened for danny wiped her hands prefatorily down the sides of her dress glanced from one end of the room to the other for unwanted listeners and walked to the window in spite of the cold she unfastened the latch and swung it open has no one told you about that she asked dramatically gesturing out into the night there was nothing for it but to see what that was deborah and st james joined danny at the window where in the distance the skeletal walls of a ruined building rose through the fog keldale abbey danny intoned and settled right in next to the fire for a confi dential chat thats where the cry of the baby comes from not from here st james pulled the window closed drew across the heavy curtains and led deborah back to the fire she curled up on the fl oor next to his chair warming herself allowing the fire to tingle against her skin a ghost baby i take it she said to danny an absolute one that i heard myself youll hear it as well wait and see ghosts always have legends attached st james noted glad you asked dannys posture replied as she wriggled back into her chair as does this she said solemnly keldale was royalist you know during the war she spoke as though the late seventeenth century were only a week removed loyal t the last man of em t the king the village of keldale down the road a mile youve seen it st james chuckled we should have but im afraid we came in from adifferent direction the scenic route deborah added danny chose to ignore the diversion well she went on was towards the end of t war and old blackguard devil cromwellobviously danny had learned her history at her aunties kneegot word that the lords o the north were planning an uprising so he swept through the dales one last grand time taking manor houses ruining castles destroying royalist villages keldales well hidden so we discovered st james put in the girl nodded earnestly but days in advance the village got word that the murdrous roundheads was coming twasnt the village that old cromwell wanted but the villagers themselves all o them that was loyal t king charlie to kill them of course deborah prompted as the girl paused in her story to catch her breath t kill every last one she declared when word came that cromwell was looking for the kel the village got a plan together theyd move every stick every stitch every soul t the grounds o the abbey so when the roundheads arrived thered be keldale all right but not a soul in her rather an ambitious plan st james remarked an it worked danny replied proudly her pretty eyes danced above rosy cheeks but she lowered her voice cept for the baby she inched forward in her chair obviously they had reached the climax of the tale the roundheads arrived twas just as the villagers hoped twas deserted and silent with a heavy fog and throughout all the village not a soul not a stitch not a living creature and thendannys swift glance made certain her audience was with hera baby began t cry in the abbey where all the villagers were ah god she clutched her lovely bosom the terror for theyd escaped cromwell only t be betrayed by a babe the mother hushed the baby by offering her breast but twas no good the wee baby cried and cried they were desperate in terror that the dogs from the village would begin t howl with the noise and cromwell would find them so they hushed the poor child an they smothered it good heavens deborah murmured she edged closer to her husbands chair just the sort of story one longs to hear on a wedding night isnt it ah but you must know dannys expression was fervent for the sound of the babe is terrible luck less you know what t do wear garlic st james asked sleep with a crucifix clutched in ones hand deborah punched him lightly on the knee i want to know i insist upon knowing shall i have my life blighted because ive married a cynic tell me what to do danny should i hear the baby gravely danny nodded tis always a night when the baby cries from the abbey grounds you must sleep on your right side your husband on his left an you must hold on t one another close till the wailing stops thats interesting st james acknowledged sort of an animated amulet may we hope that this baby cries often not terrible often but i she swallowed and suddenly they saw that this was no amusing legend for lovestruck honeymooners for to her the fear and the story were real but i heard i myself some three years back tis not something ill soon forget she got to her feet youll remember what t do youll not forget well not forget deborah reassured the girl as she vanished from the room they were quiet at her departure deborah rested her head against st jamess knee his long thin fingers moved gently through her hair smoothing the curly mass back from her face she looked up at him im afraid simon i didnt think i would be not once this last year but i am she saw in his eyes that he understood of course he did had she ever truly doubted that he would so am i he replied every moment today i felt just a little bit mad with terror i never wanted to lose myself not to you not to anyone in fact but there it is it happened he smiled you invaded my heart with a little cromwellian force of your own that i couldnt resist deborah and i find now that rather than lose myself the true terror is that i might somehow lose you he touched the pendant hed given her that morning nestling in the hollow of her throat it was a small gold swan so long between them a symbol of commitment choosing once choosing for life his eyes moved from it back to her own dont be afraid he whispered gently make love to me then with great pleasure jimmy havers had little pigs eyes that darted round the room when he was nervous he might feel as if he were putting on the bravura performance of a lifetime lying his way grandly out of everything from an accusation of petty larceny to being caught in flagrante delicto but the reality was that his eyes betrayed him every time as they were doing now didnt know if youd be home in time to get your mum the greece stuff so jim went out himself girl it was his habit to speak of himself in the third person it allowed him to evade responsibility for virtually any unpleasantness that cropped up in his life like this one now no i didnt go to the turf accountant didnt pick up snuff either if it was done at all was jimmy that done it not me barbara watched her fathers eyes dance their way round the sitting room god what a grim little death pit it was a tenbyfi fteenfoot room whose windows were permanently sealed shut by years of filth and grime crammed with that wonderful threepiece suite so essential to delicate living but this one a creation that had billed itself as artifi cial horsehair thirtyfive years ago when even real horsehair was a hideous concept of comfort the walls were papered with a maddening design of interlocking rosebuds that simpered their way to the ceiling racing magazines overflowed from tables onto the floor and argued there with the fi fteen simulated leather albums that assiduously documented every inch every mile of her mothers breakdown and through it all tony smiled and smiled and smiled a corner of the room held his shrine the last picture of him before his illnessa distorted unfocused little boy kicking a football into a temporary goal net set up in a garden that had once leapt with fl owerswas enlarged to beyond lifesize proportions on either side suitably framed in mock oak hung every school report he had ever done every note of praise from every teacher hed had andgod have mercy on us allgiven pride of place the certificate of his death beneath this an arrangement of plastic flowers did obeisance a rather dusty obeisance considering the state of the room itself the television blared as it always did from the opposite corner placed there so tony can watch it as well his favourite shows still played regularly to him frozen in time as if nothing had happened as if nothing had changed while the windows and doors were closed and locked chained and barred to hold out the truth of that august afternoon and the uxbridge road barbara strode across the room and switched off the set hey girl jim was watching that her father protested she faced him my god he was a pig when was the last time hed had a bath she could smell him from herethe sweat the body oils that collected in his hair on his neck behind the creases of his ears the unwashed clothing mr patel told me you were by she said sitting down on the horrible couch it prickled against her skin the eyes flicked around from the dead television to the plastic flowers to the obscene roses scaling the wall jim went to patels sure he nodded he grinned at his daughter his teeth were badly stained and along the gumline barbara saw the liquid building within his mouth the coffee tin was by his chair inexpertly hidden by a racing form she knew he wanted her to look away for a moment so that hed have time to do his business without getting caught she refused to play along spit it out dad she said patiently theres no use swallowing it and making yourself sick is there barbara watched her fathers body sag in relief as he reached for the tin and spat the snuffinduced brown slime from his mouth he wiped himself off with a stained handkerchief coughed into it heavily and adjusted the tubes that fed the oxygen into his nose mournfully he looked at his daughter for tenderness and found none so his eyes quickly shifted and began their slither round the room barbara watched him thoughtfully why wouldnt he die she wondered hed spent the last ten years decaying by degrees why not one big jump into black oblivion hed like that no more gasping for breath no more emphysema no more need for snuff to soothe his addiction just emptiness nothingness nothing at all youll get cancer dad she said you know that dont you ey jims okay barb dont you worry girl cant you think of mum what would happen if you had to go into hospital again like tony it hung unspoken in the air shall i speak to mr patel i dont want to have to do that but i shall you know if you persist in this business with snuff patel gave jim the idea in the fi rst place her father protested his voice was a whine after you told him to cut off jims fags you know i did that for your own good you cant smoke round an oxygen tank the doctors told you that but patel said snuff was okay for jim mr patel is not a doctor now give me the snuff she held out her hand for it but jim wants no argument dad give me the snuff he swallowed twice hard his eyes darted here and there got to have something barbie he whimpered she winced at the name only tony had called her that on her fathers lips it was a malediction nonetheless she moved to him put her hand on his shoulder and forced herself to touch his unwashed hair dad try to understand its mum we have to consider without you she would never survive so weve got to keep you healthy and fi t dont you see mumloves you so much was there a glimmer there at that did they still see each other in this little hell they so richly deserved or was the fog too thick he gave a choked sob a dirty hand went into his pocket and the small round tin was produced jim dont mean no harm barbie he said as he handed the tin to his daughter his eyes slid from her face to the shrine to the plastic flowers in their plastic vases beneath it she went to them at once dumped out the fl owers and confiscated the additional three tins of snuff hidden there ill speak to mr patel in the morning she said coldly and walked out of the room of course it would be eaton terrace eaton place was simply tpoo too belgravia and lynley would never stoop to ostentation besides this was just the city townhouse howenstowthe cornish estatewas where the lynleys really hung their hats barbara stood looking at the elegant white building how enchantingly clean everything was in belgravia she thought how upperclass chic it was the only area in the city where people would consent to live in converted stables and boast about it to all their friends were in belgravia now did we mention it oh do stop by for tea its nothing much just three hundred thousand pounds but we like to think of it as such an investment five rooms with the sweetest little cobblestone street that youve ever seen do say youll be here at half past four youll recognise the place ive planted bego nias in every window box barbara mounted the spotless marble steps and with a scornful shake of her head noted the small asherton coat of arms beneath the brass light fi xture armigerous lynley no converted stable for you she lifted her hand to press the bell but stopped herself and turned to survey the street since yesterday there had been no time to consider her position her initial meeting with webberly fetching lynley from the wedding and the subsequent meeting at scotland yard with the peculiar little priest had all followed so swiftly that there had been no moment in which she could sort out her feelings and devise a strategy for surviving this new apprenticeship true lynley had not been as appalled at the assignment as she had thought he would be certainly not as appalled and outraged as she herself had been but then his mind had been occupied with other matters the wedding of his friend and no doubt his latenight assignation with lady helen clyde now with some time to reflect upon it he would surely allow her to feel the full brunt of his irritation at being saddled with such a pariah as herself so what to do here it was at last the opportunity she had been waiting forhoping for praying forthe chance to prove herself in cid once and for all it was the chance to make up for the arguments the slips of the tongue the impetuous decisions the foolish mistakes of the past ten years theres a lot you might learn from working with lynley webberlys words returned to her and she knotted her brow what could she possibly learn from lynley the right wine to order with dinner a few dance steps how to dazzle a roomful of people with engaging conversation what could she learn from lynley nothing of course but she knew too well that he represented her only chance of being reassigned to cid so as she stood on his fi ne doorstep she considered thoughtfully her best approach to getting along with the man it would have to be complete cooperation she decided she would offer no suggestions would agree with every thought he had with every statement he made survive she told herself and turned and pressed the bell she had been expecting a buxom uniformed pert little maid to answer her ring so she was surprised for lynley himself opened the door a piece of toast in one hand slippers on his feet and his reading spectacles perched on the end of his aristocratic nose ah havers he said looking over them at her youre early excellent he led the way to the back of the house and into an airy morning room fresh with white wainscoting pale green walls and an unusually restrained adams ceiling french doors at one end were undraped to allow a view of a lateblooming garden and breakfast was laid out in silver serving dishes along an ornate walnut sideboard the room smelled invitingly of warm bread and bacon and in answer to the odour barbara felt her stomach rumble hollowly she pressed her arm against it and tried not to think of her own mornings fare of a single overboiled egg and toast the dining table was laid for two a number that momentarily surprised barbara until she remembered lynleys evening rendezvous with lady helen clyde her ladyship was no doubt at this moment still in his bed unused to rising before half past ten do help yourself lynley motioned absently towards the sideboard with his fork and gathered up a few sheets of the police report that lay in haphazard fashion among the china there isnt a person i know who cant think better while eating but avoid the kippers they seem a bit off no thank you she replied politely ive eaten sir not even a sausage they at least are remarkably good do you find that the butchers are finally having a whack at putting more pork than meal into sausages these days its refreshing to say the least nearly fi ve decades after world war ii and were fi nally coming off rationing he picked up a teapot like everything else on the table it was antique bone china no doubt part of the mans family history what about something to drink i have to warn you im addicted to lapsang souchong tea helen claims that it tastes like dirty socks ii could do with a cuppa thank you sir good he declared have some and tell me what you think she was adding a lump of sugar to the brew when the front bell rang again footsteps came running up a stairway in the back ill get it my lord a womans voice called it was a cornish accent sorry about the last time the baby and all its the croup nancy lynley murmured to himself take the poor child to the doctor the sound of a womans voice fl oated down the hall breakfast a lighthearted laugh what a propitious arrival ive effected nancy hell never believe its purely coincidental upon her last sentence lady helen breezed into the room and paralysed barbara into a moment of breathcatching icesheathed despair they were wearing identical suits but while lady helens had obviously been cut by the designer himself to fi t her fi gure barbaras own was offtherack a throughthelookingglass chain store copy with rucked seams and altered hemline to prove it only the differing colours might possibly save her from complete humiliation she thought she grasped her teacup but lacked the will to lift it to her lips lady helen paused only fractionally at the sight of the policewoman im in a mess she said frankly thank god youre here as well sergeant for ive a terrible feeling itll take three heads to see me clear of the muddle ive made for myself that said she deposited a large shopping bag on the nearest chair and went directly to the sideboard where she began browsing through the covered dishes as if food alone were sufficient to see her through her dilemma muddle lynley asked he glanced at barbara how do you like the lapsang her lips felt stiff its very nice sir not that awful tea again lady helen groaned really tommy youre a man without mercy had i known you were coming id hardly have been so remiss as to serve it twice in one week lynley replied pointedly unoffended she laughed isnt he piqued sergeant from the way he talks youd think i was here every morning eating him out of house and home there is yesterday helen you vicious man she turned her attention back to the sideboard these kippers smell appalling did nancy bring them up in her suitcase she joined them at the table with a plate piled high with a gastronomic argument of eggs and mushrooms grilled tomatoes and bacon whats she doing here by the way why isnt she at howenstow wheres denton this morning lynley sipped his tea his eyes on the report on the table before him as ill be out of town ive given denton the next few days off he replied absently no need for him to come with me a crisp piece of bacon halted in midair lady helen stared youre joking of course tell me youre joking darling im perfectly capable of getting along without my valet im not totally incompetent helen but thats not what i mean lady helen drank a mouthful of the lapsang souchong grimaced at the taste and set down the cup its caroline shes gone off on holiday for this entire week you dont thinktommy if shes run off with denton ill be absolutely lost nothis as he was about to speaki know what youre going to say they have every right to their personal lives i agree completely but we simply must come to some sort of compromise over thisyou and ibecause if they get married and live with you then you and i shall get married as well lynley replied placidly and well be as happy as hedgehogs the four of us you think its amusing dont you but just look at me one morning without caroline in the flat and im a complete disaster surely you dont think this is an ensemble that she would approve of lynley regarded the ensemble in question barbara didnt need to do so the vision of lady helen was branded into her mind a smartly tailored burgundy suit silk blouse and a mauve scarf that cascaded down to a trim waist whats wrong with it lynley asked it looks fine to me in fact considering the hourhe glanced at his pocket watchid say youre almost too sartorially splendid lady helen turned to barbara in exasperation isnt that every bit just like a man sergeant i end up this morning looking like an overripe strawberry and he murmurs looks fine to me and buries his nose in a murder fi le far better that than assist you with your clothing for the next few days lynley nodded at the ignored shopping bag that had toppled over and now spilled a few assorted pieces of material onto the floor is that why youve come lady helen pulled the bag towards her i only wish it were that simple she sighed but its worse by far than the dentoncaroline affairweve not finished with that by the wayand im at a total loss ive mixed up simons bullet holes barbara was beginning to feel as if shed walked into something designed by wilde surely at any moment lane would enter stage left with the cucumber sandwiches simons bullet holes lynley more accustomed to lady helens pirouettes of thought was patient you know we were working on the patterns of blood splattering based on trajectory angle and calibre you remember that dont you the piece to be presented next month the very one simon had left it all organised for me in the lab i was supposed to run off the preliminary set of data attach them to the cloth and set up the lab for the fi nal study but i mixed up the cloths lynley fi nished st james will go on about that helen what do you propose to do she looked forlornly down at the samples that she had dumped unceremoniously onto the floor of course im not hopelessly ignorant in the matter after four years in the laboratory at least i recognise the twentytwo calibre and can easily find the fortyfi ve and the shotgun but as to the othersand even worse as to which blood pattern goes with each trajectory its a muddle lynley fi nished in a word she agreed so i thought id pop by this morning to see if perhaps we could sort it all out lynley leaned down and fingered his way through the pile of material cant be done old duck sorry but youve hours of work here and weve a train to catch then whatever shall i say to simon hes been working on this for ages lynley pondered the question theres one thing what professor abrams at chelsea institute do you know him when she shook her head he went on he and simon both have testifi ed as expert witnesses they did in the melton case only last year they know each other perhaps hed help i could phone him for you before i leave would you tommy id be so grateful id do anything for you he lifted an eyebrow surely not the thing to say to a man over breakfast she laughed engagingly even the dishes id even give up caroline if it came to that and jeffrey cusick even jeffrey poor man traded for bullet holes without a second thought all right then ill see to it as soon as weve finished our breakfast i take it that we may now finish our breakfast oh yes of course she dug happily into her plate while lynley put on his spectacles and looked at his papers once more what kind of case is it that has you two rushing off so early in the morning lady helen asked barbara pouring herself a second cup of tea which she sugared and creamed with a liberal hand a decapitation that sounds particularly grim are you travelling far up to yorkshire the teacup was suspended and then lowered carefully to the saucer beneath lady helens eyes moved to lynley regarding him for a moment before she spoke where in yorkshire tommy she asked impassively lynley read a few lines a place called here it is keldale do you know it there was a minute pause lady helen considered the question her eyes were on her tea and although her face was without expression a pulse began to beat in the vein at her throat she looked up but the smile she offered did not touch her eyes keldale not at all lynley tossed down his newspaper and considered barbara havers there was no need to do so surreptitiously for she was bent over the glaucoushued formica train table between them perusing the keldale murder report he gave momentary idle consideration to the depths to which british rail was sinking with its current colour scheme designed to take maximum wear with minimum upkeep but then his thoughts returned to the offi cer opposite him he knew about havers everyone did shed failed miserably through her first tenure in cid swiftly alienating macpherson stewart and hale three of the easiest dis with whom one could ever hope to work macpherson especially with his rolling highland humour and his paternal approach should have been a mentor extraordinaire for someone like havers the man was a virtual teddy bear had any ds ever failed to work successfully at his side only havers lynley remembered the day of webberlys decision to put her back in uniform everyone had known it was coming of course it had been coming for months but no one had been quite prepared for the womans reaction if i was lahdeedah eton youd be keeping me shed shouted in webberlys offi ce in a broken voice loud enough for the entire fl oor to hear if id a chequebook large enough and a title on my name and a willingness to screw everything in sightwoman man child or animalid be quite good enough for your precious department at the mention of eton three heads had swivelled in lynleys direction by the end of the diatribe a quick cessation of workday noise indicated to him that every person within range of vision was looking his way hed been standing at a cabinet rooting about for the file on that miserable little worm harry nelson but found that his fi ngers had suddenly become clumsy of course he really didnt need the file not exactly at the moment indeed he couldnt stand there forever he had to turn to go back to his desk he made himself do it made himself say quite lightly good lord i always draw the line at animals and made himself walk casually across the room nervous uncomfortable laughter greeted his remark then webberlys door slammed and havers stormed wildly down the corridor her mouth was twisted with rage her face blotched and mottled with tears that she wiped off savagely with the sleeve of her coat lynley felt the entire force of her hatred wash over him as her eyes met his and her lips curled in contempt it was like being struck by an illness for which there was no cure a moment later macpherson lumbered by his desk tossed down the file on harry nelson and said yere a class act laddie in his amiable rumble but still it had taken at least ten minutes for his hands to stop shaking so that he could dial the phone for helen lunch old duck he had asked her she could tell she could hear it at once absolutely tommy simons been forcing me all morning to look at the most hideous hair samples imaginabledid you know that scalp actually comes off when you pull out someones hair darlingand somehow lunch seems just the very thing shall we say the connaught blessed helen god what a wonderful anchor shed been in his life this past year lynley pushed the thought from his mind and returned to his study of havers she reminded him just a bit of a turtle especially this morning when helen had come into the room the poor wretch had absolutely frozen muttered less than ten words and retreated right into her shell what bizarre behaviour as if she had something to fear from helen he felt in his pockets for his cigarette case and lighter sergeant havers glanced up at his movement then returned to her report her face impassive she doesnt smoke or drink lynley thought and smiled wryly well get used to it sergeant im not at all a man who neglects his vices not in the past year at least hed never quite been able to comprehend the womans remarkable antipathy towards him there was if one thought about it the entire ridiculous subject of classand god knows hed taken a fair share of ribbing once his colleagues discovered hed inherited a title yet after a week or two of their mocking bows and fanfares whenever he entered a room the title had simply ceased to be an issue at all but not for havers who seemed to hear the orotund words eighth earl of asherton booming out every time he walked anywhere near her something hed scrupulously avoided doing since shed been returned to uniform he sighed and here they were now together what was it exactly that webberly had in mind in establishing this grotesque alliance of theirs the super was by far the most intelligent man hed ever run across at the yard so this quixotic little partnership hadnt come out of nowhere he looked out the rainsplattered window if i can only determine which one of us is sancho panza well get on famously he laughed sergeant havers looked up curiously but said nothing lynley smiled just look for windmills he told her they were drinking the railways styrofoam coffee from its styrofoam cups when sergeant havers tentatively brought up the question of the axe no prints on it at all she observed it does seem odd doesnt it lynley replied he winced at the taste of the liquid and shoved the cup aside kill your dog kill your father sit there waiting for the police to arrive but wipe the axe handle clean of your fingerprints it doesnt follow why do you think she killed the dog inspector to silence it i suppose so she agreed reluctantly lynley saw that she wanted to say something more what do you think iits nothing youre probably quite right sir but you have another idea lets hear it havers was eyeing him warily sergeant he prompted she cleared her throat i was only thinking that she really wouldnt need to silence it i meanit was her dog why would it bark at her i could be wrong but it seems that it would bark at an intruder and an intruder would want to silence it lynley studied the tips of his steepled fi ngers the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime he murmured it would bark at a girl it knew if she were killing her father he argued buti was thinking sir havers nervously pushed her clipped hair behind her ears a gesture that made her more unattractive than ever doesnt it look as if the dog was killed first she leafed through the papers that she had replaced in the folder and took out one of the photographs teyss body has collapsed right over the dog lynley examined the picture yes of course but she could have arranged it haverss sharp little eyes widened in surprise i dont think she could sir not really why not teys was six feet four inches tall she clumsily pulled out more of the report he weighedhere it is fourteen and onehalf stone i cant see this roberta slinging round fourteen and onehalf stone of dead weight just to arrange a crime scene especially if she intended to confess immediately after it doesnt seem possible besides the body had no head so youd think thered be a bit of blood on the walls if shed slung it about but there wasnt score a point for you sergeant lynley said pulling his reading spectacles out of his pocket i think i agree here let me have a look at that she handed him the entire fi le time of death was put at between ten and midnight he said more to himself than to her had chicken and peas for dinner something wrong sergeant nothing sir someone walked over my grave a charming expression ah he read on and barbiturates in the blood he looked up his brow furrowed and stared sightlessly at sergeant havers over the tops of his spectacles somehow one never thinks of a man like that needing sleeping pills there he is putting in a hard days work on a farm out in that wonderful fresh air of the dales he eats a hearty dinner and just drops off to sleep by the fire bucolic bliss so why sleeping pills it looks as if hed only just taken them obviously one hardly expects him to have somnambulated his way out to the barn she froze at once at his tone retreated back into her shell i only meant excuse me lynley interrupted quickly i was joking i do sometimes it relieves the tension youll have to try to get used to it of course sir she replied with deliberate courtesy the man accosted them as they walked over the pedestrian bridge towards the exit he was extremely thin anaemiclooking obviously someone who was victim to at least a thousand different kinds of stomach problems that were the bane of his existence even as he approached them he popped a tablet into his mouth and began chewing upon it with furious determination superintendent nies lynley remarked affably have you come all the way from richmond to meet us thats quite a drive for you sixty bloody miles so lets get it straight right from the top inspector nies snapped hed stopped dead in front of them blocking their way to the stairs that would lead them down to the departures platform and out of the station i dont want you here this is kerridges goddamned game and ive nothing to do with it you want anything you get it from newby wiske not from richmond is that perfectly clear i dont want to see you i dont want to hear from you if youve come up here with a personal vendetta in mind inspector then just shove it up your arse right now got it ive not time for poncey schoolboys itching for a pretty scratch of revenge there was a moment of silence watching niess dyspeptic face barbara wondered if anyone ever spoke to lord asherton in such a colourful manner on his cornish estate sergeant havers lynley said mildly i dont believe youve ever been introduced to chief superintendent nies of the richmond police force she had never seen a man driven to a loss so swiftly done with an impeccable show of manners nice to meet you sir she said dutifully damn you to hell lynley nies snarled just stay out of my way with that he turned on his heel and pushed his way through the crowd towards the exit nicely done sergeant lynleys voice was serene his eyes searched through the swarm of humanity in the terminal it was nearly noon and the usual bustle of yorks station was intensified by the lunch hour as people took the opportunity to purchase tickets to argue car hire prices with the station agents to meet loved ones who had timed arrivals to fit into the schedules of a working world lynley found the person he was looking for said ah i see denton up ahead and raised his hand in acknowledgment to a young man who was approaching them denton had just come out of the cafeteria caught in the midst of a meal he was chewing swallowing and wiping his mouth with a paper napkin as he dodged through the crowd he additionally managed to comb his thick dark hair neatly straighten his necktie and give a quick glance at his shoes all before reaching them good trip my lord he asked handing lynley a set of keys the cars just outside he smiled pleasantly but barbara saw that he avoided lynleys eyes lynley gazed at his valet critically caroline he said dentons round grey eyes grew immediately rounder caroline my lord he repeated innocently his cherubic face became if possible even more cherubic he flicked a nervous glance back in the direction from which hed just come dont caroline my lord me weve a few things to straighten up here before you go off on this holiday of yours this is sergeant havers by the way denton gulped and nodded quickly at barbara pleased sergeant he said and turned his eyes back to lynley my lord stop being so obsequious you dont do it at home and in public it makes my skin positively crawl with embarrassment impatient lynley shifted his black overnight case from one hand to the other sorry denton sighed and dropped the pose carolines in the cafeteria ive a cottage lined up in robin hoods bay what a romantic you are lynley observed drily spare me the details just tell her to phone lady helen and reassure her youre not off to gretna green will you do that denton the young man grinned will do in a tic thank you lynley reached into his pocket and from his wallet extracted a credit card he handed it to the man dont get any ideas he warned i want only the car on this is that clear absolutely denton replied crisply he glanced over his shoulder to the cafeteria where a pretty young woman had come outside and was watching them she was as fashionably dressed and as fashionably coiffured as lady helen clyde herself always was practically her clone if it came down to it barbara thought sourly and wondered if it was a requirement of the job handmaiden to the youngest daughter of an earl just like someone stepping out of the nineteenth century the only real difference between caroline and her ladyship was a minor lack of selfassurance evidenced by carolines grip upon her handbag a twofisted clinging to the handles as if it were to be used as a defensive weapon denton spoke shall i be off then be off lynley responded and added as the man scurried back in the direction he had come take some care will you not a fear my lord not a fear was the swift reply lynley watched him disappear into the crowd the young woman on his arm he turned to barbara i think thats the last interruption he said lets be on our way with that he led her out onto station road and directly up to a sleek silver bentley ihavegotthe poop hank watson said confidentially from the next table the straightcertifi edverifi edpoop satisfi ed that he had the undivided attention of the others in the dining room he went on about the babyintheabbey story jojobean and i had the straight certified from angelina this morning st james looked at his wife more coffee deborah he asked politely when she demurred he poured some for himself and gave his attention back to the other couple hank and jojo watson hadnt wasted much time becoming elbowrubbing intimates of the only other guests at keldale hall mrs burtonthomas had seen to that by seating them at adjoining tables in the halls immense dining room she hadnt bothered with introductions she knew quite well there would be no need the beautiful bolection mouldings of the rooms panelled walls the sheraton sideboard and the william and mary chairs became entirely lost to the american couples interest once st james and deborah entered the room hank hon maybe they dont want to hear about the baby in the abbey jojo fi ngered her gold chain from which were hanging a veritable excrescence of trinkets mom applepie and sugarbean danced alongside a mercedesbenz symbol a diminutive spoon and a minuscule eiffel tower hellsapoppin they dont was hanks riposte you just ask them bean jojo rolled her eyes in apology at the other couple hanks charmed with england just really charmed she explained love it hank nodded if i could just get some toast thats hot the placed be perfect why in heck dyou people eat your toast cold ive always thought it was a cultural defi ciency st james responded hank brayed appreciatively his mouth open wide to display a row of startlingly white teeth cultural deficiency thats good thats real good hear that bean cultural defi ciency hank always repeated any remark that made him laugh somehow it gave him a certain authorship over it now back to the abbey he was also not easily diverted hank his wife murmured she was a bit like a rabbit exophthalmic with a little upturned nose that continually twitched and flexed on her face as if she were not quite used to the air she breathed loosen up bean her husband urged these people here are the saltofthe earth i think i will have more coffee simon deborah said her husband poured met her eyes and said milk dear yes please hot milk for the coffee hank remarked seeing a new avenue in which to demonstrate his considerable verbal fl exibility now thats something else i just havent got used to hey heres angelina now the said young girlobviously by her physical resemblance to danny yet another member of the curiouser and curiouser burtonthomas clanwas carrying a large tray into the dining room with intense concentration she was not as pretty as danny a plump little red hen of a girl whose scrubbed cheeks and rough hands made her look as if shed be more at home on a farm than attempting to be part of her familys eccentric establishment she bobbed a nervous good morning avoiding their eyes and awkwardly distributed breakfast gnawing her bottom lip miserably as she did so shy little thing hank observed loudly squashing a square of toast into the centre of his fried egg but she gave us the true poop last night after dinner now youve heard about that baby right deborah and st james looked at each other deciding which one of them would take up the conversational ball it was tossed to deborah yes indeed we did she replied crying from the abbey danny told us about it just after we arrived ha bet she did hank said obscurely and then to make sure his meaning was clear added nice little piece you know likes the attention hank his wife murmured into her porridge her hair was very short strawberry blonde and the tips of her ears showing through it had become quite red jojobean these people are not dum hank replied they know the score he waved a fork at the other two a piece of sausage was poised perilously on the prongs you gotta excuse the bean he explained youd think living in laguna beachd make a swinger outa her wouldnt you you familiar with laguna beach california no pause for an answer it is the finest place in the world to live no offence to you here of course jojobean and ive lived there forhow long is it now pretty face twentytwo yearsand she still blushes i tell you when she sees two queers getting personal jojo i tell her thereisnouse getting hot and bothered about queers he lowered his voice we got them coming out our verifi ed ears in laguna he confi ded st james could not bring himself to look at deborah i beg your pardon he asked unsure if he had correctly heard the unusual gymnastic pun queers man faggots homosexshuls by the certifi ed verified millions in laguna they all want to live there now as to the abbey hank paused to slurp gustily at his coffee seems the real story is that danny and her youknowwhat used to meet at the abbey on a regular basis you know what i mean for a little clutchandfeel and on the night in question some three years back theyve just decided its time to consecrate the relationship you follow me completely st james replied he studiously avoided deborahs eyes now danny see is a little leery of this after all being a virgin on the wedding nights a puhretty big item to let go of dont you agree specially in this neck of the woods and if little danny lets this fella have his waywell theres no backward road is there he awaited st jamess response i should imagine not hank nodded sagely so as her sister angelina tells it she was there st james asked incredulously hank spent a moment guffawing at the thought banging his spoon with tympanic delight on the top of the table youre a card fella he directed his attention to deborah he always like this always she replied promptly thats great well back to the abbey of course deborah and st james exchanged looks replied so heres this fella with danny hank painted the scene in the air with his knife and fork the gun is loaded and the trigger cocked when all of a sudden comes this baby wailing fist to beat the band can you see it huh can you in detail st james replied well these two hear that baby and think its the worda god himself they get outa that abbey so fast that youd think the devil was chasing them and that my friends put an end to that to the baby crying do you mean deborah asked oh simon i was hoping wed hear it tonight or perhaps even this afternoon warding off evil turned out to be so much more rewarding than i expected it to be minx his look said not to the crying baby hank instructed to the youknowwhat between danny and whoever he was who the hell was he anyway bean a weird name ezra somebody hank nodded well anyway danny comes back to the hall here with a case of the hoohas that just wont quit wants to confess her sins and go right to the lord so they call the local priest in it is exorcism time for the abbey the hall or danny st james enquired all three fella so this priest comes rushing down and does the bit with the holy water goes on to the abbey and he stopped completely his face lit with joy his eyes alive with delight a master storyteller with the audience tearing and clawing to hear every last syllable more coffee deborah thank you no and what do you think hank demanded st james considered the question he felt his wifes foot nudge his good leg what he dutifully responded damn if there wasnt a real baby there a newborn with the cord still attached couldnt be more than a couple hours old deadern a door knocker by the time the old priest got there exposure they say how dreadful deborahs face paled what a horrible thing hank nodded solemnly youre talking horrible just think of poor ezra bet he couldnt youknowwhat for another two years whose baby was it hank shrugged he turned his attention to his nowcold breakfast clearly the juicier elements of the story were the only ones that he had pursued no one knows jojo answered they buried it in the churchyard in the village with the funniest epitaph on the poor little grave i cant recall it offhand youll have to go see it theyre newlyweds bean hank put in with a broad wink at st james i bet they got plenty more on their minds than traipsing through graveyards obviously lynley favoured the russians theyd begun with rachmaninoff moved to rimskykorsakov and were now slambanging their way through the cannonades of the overture there did you notice it he asked her once the music had crashed to its fi nale one of the cymbalists was just a counterbeat behind but its my only bone of contention with that particular recording of he flipped the stereo off barbara noticed for the first time that he wore absolutely no jewelleryno crested signet ring no expensive wrist watch to fl ash gold richly when it caught the light for some reason that fact was as distracting to her as an unsightly display of opulent ornamentation would have been i didnt catch it sorry i dont know a lot about music did he really expect herwith her backgroundto be able to converse with him about classical music i dont know much about it either he admitted ingenuously i just listen to it a great deal im afraid im one of those ignoramuses who say i dont know a thing about it but i know what i like she listened to his words with surprise the man had a first in history an oxford education why in the world would he ever apply the word ignoramus to himself unless of course it was designed to put her at ease with a liberal dose of charm something he was capable of doing quite well it was effortless for him as easy as breathing i must have developed my liking for it during the very last part of my fathers illness it was always playing in the house when i could get away to see him he paused removed the tape and the silence in the car became every bit as loud as the music had been but far more disconcerting it was some moments before he spoke again and when he did it was to pick up the thread of his original thought he simply wasted away to nothing so much pain he cleared his throat my mother wouldnt consider putting him into hospital even towards the end when it would have been so much easier on her she wouldnt hear of it she sat with him hour after hour day and night and watched him die by degrees i think it was music that kept them both sane those last weeks he kept his eyes on the road she held his hand and listened to tchaikovsky in the end he couldnt even speak ive always liked to think the music did his speaking for him it was suddenly crucial to stop the direction the conversation was taking barbara gripped the stiff edges of the folded roadmap with dry hot fingers and searched for another subject you know that bloke nies dont you it blurted out badly all too obviously an illconcealed attempt to digress she shot a wary look at him his eyes narrowed but otherwise he gave no immediate reaction to the question one hand merely dropped from the steering wheel for a moment barbara thought ridiculously that he intended to use it to silence her but he simply chose another tape at random and slid it into the stereo he did not however turn the unit on she stared out at the passing countryside mortifi ed im surprised you dont know about it he fi nally said know about what he looked at her then he appeared to be trying to read her face for insolence or sarcasm or perhaps a need to wound apparently satisfied with what he saw he returned his eyes to the road just about five years ago my brotherinlaw edward davenport was murdered in his home north of richmond superintendent nies saw fit to arrest me it wasnt a long ordeal just a matter of a few days but quite long enough a glance at her again a selfdeprecatory smile youve not heard that story sergeant its nasty enough to make good cocktail party gossip inono id not heard it and anyway i dont go to cocktail parties she turned blindly to the window i should guess the turnoff is near perhaps three miles she said uselessly she was shaken to the core she could not have said why did not want to think about it and forced herself to study the scenery refusing to be caught up in any further conversation with the man concentration on the land became imperative and as she gave herself over to it the country began its process of seduction upon her for she was so used to the frenetic pace of london and the desperate grime of her neighbourhood in acton that yorkshire came as a bit of a shock the countryside was a thousand different shades of green from the patchwork quilts of the cultivated land to the desolation of the open moors the road dipped through dales where forests protected spotless villages and then climbed switchbacked curves to take them again up to the open land where the north sea wind blew unforgivingly across heather and furze here the only life belonged to the sheep they wandered free and unfenced unfettered by the ancient dry stone walls that constructed boundaries for their fellows in the dales below there were contradictions everywhere in the cultivated areas life burgeoned from every cranny and hedgerow a thick vegetation that in another season would produce the mixed beauties of cow parsley campion vetch and foxglove it was an area where transportation was delayed while two dogs expertly herded a flock of plump sheep across pasture down hillside and along the road for a twomile stroll into the centre of a village directed only by the whistling of the shepherd who followed his fate and the fate of the animals he owned left to the skill of the running dogs and then suddenly the plants villages magnificent oaks elms and chestnutsthis truly insubstantial pageantfaded to nothing in the glory of the moors here the cerulean sky exploded with clouds it swept down to meet the rough unconquered land earth and air there was nothing else save the sapient presence of the blackfaced sheep stalwart denizens of this lonely place its beautiful isnt it lynley asked after some minutes in spite of everything thats happened to me here i still love yorkshire i think its the loneliness here the complete desolation again barbara resisted the confi dence the implicit message behind the words that here was a man who could understand its very nice sir not like anything ive ever seen i think this is our turn the road to keldale switched back and forth taking them to the deepest section of the dale moments after the turn the woods closed in on them trees arched over the road ferns grew thickly at its sides they came to the village the way that cromwell had come and they found it as he had deserted the ringing of st catherines church bells told them immediately why there was no sign of life in the village upon the cessation of what lynley was beginning to believe was surely sayerss nine tailors the church doors opened and the ancient building spewed forth its tiny congregation at last he murmured he stood leaning against the car thoughtfully surveying the village hed parked in front of keldale lodge a trim little hostelry heavily hung with ivy and multipaned windows from which he had a sweeping view in four directions taking it in he concluded that there couldnt possibly have been a more unlikely spot on earth for a murder to the north was the narrow high street flanked by grey stone buildings with tiled roofs and white woodwork containing the requisite elements for comfortable village life a shoeboxsized post offi ce a nondescript greengrocers a shop advertising lyons cakes on a rusty yellow sign and looking like the purveyor of everything from motor oil to baby food a wesleyan chapel wedged with delightful incongruity between sarahs tea room and sinjis beauty shoppe pretty curls make lovely girls the pavement on either side of the street was raised only slightly off the road and water pooled in front of doorways from the mornings rainfall but the sky was clear now and the air was so fresh that lynley could taste its purity to the west a road called bishop furthing led off towards farmland enclosed on either side by the ubiquitous dry stone walls of the district on its corner stood a treeshaded cottage with a front door only steps from the street it had an enclosed garden to one side from which the excited yelping of small dogs burst forth at regular intervals as if someone were playing with them rough and tumble the building itself was labelled as inconspicuously as possible with the single word police blue letters on a white sign that stuck out from a window home of the archangel gabriel lynley concluded suppressing a smile to the south two roads veered off from an overgrown twobench common keldale abbey road ostensibly leading to the same and over the humped bridge that spanned the lazy movement of the river kel church street with st catherines built on a hillock on the corner it too was surrounded by a low stone wall and embedded into this was a world war i memorial plaque the sombre commonality of every village in the nation to the east was the road down which they had wended their way to this bit of yorkshire heaven it had been deserted earlier but now the bent form of a woman trudged up the incline a scarf tucked into her black coat shod in heavy brogues and dazzling blue ankle socks she carried a mesh bag over one arm it dangled there limply empty on a sunday afternoon there was little hope of filling it with foodstuffs purchased at the grocers for everything was locked up tight and even if it were not she was heading in the wrong direction to be making a purchase out of the village back up towards the moors a farmwife perhaps having made some delivery the village was surrounded by woods by the upward slope of meadow by the feeling of absolute security and peace once st catherines bells ceased ringing the birds took up tittering from rooftops and trees somewhere a fire had been lit and woodsmoke just the ghost of its fragrance was like a whisper in the air it was hard to believe that three weeks past a mile out of town a man had been decapitated by his only daughter inspector lynley i hope i havent kept you waiting long i always lock up during church since theres no one else to watch the place im stepha odell i own the lodge at the sound of the voice lynley turned from his inspection of the village but at the sight of her his polite introduction died on his lips a tall shapely womanperhaps forty years oldstood before him she was dressed for church in grey linen a wellcut dress with a white collar the rest of her was black shoes belt handbag and hat except for her hair which was coppery red and fell to her shoulders she was stunning he found his voice thomas lynley he said idiotically this is sergeant havers do come in stepha odells voice was warm and pleasant ive your rooms ready youll find us a quiet inn at this time of year there was a chill in the building they entered an atmosphere produced by thick walls and stone floors these were covered with a faded axminster carpet she led them into a tiny reception area moving with a swift unconscious grace and produced an oversized register for them to sign youve been told i only do breakfast havent you she asked earnestly as if satisfying hunger were the uppermost thing on his mind at this moment do i look that desperate well manage mrs odell lynley said tricky move old boy transparent as hell havers stood mute at his side her face without expression miss their hostess replied stepha really you can get meals at the dove and whistle on st chads lane or at the holy grail or if you want something special theres keldale hall the holy grail she smiled the pub across from st catherines that name must certainly propitiate the abstinent gods at least it does father hart but hes been known to tip a pint or two in an evening there shall i show you your rooms without waiting for an answer she led them up the crooked stairs displaying lynley noted a remarkably pretty pair of ankles and above which rose an even prettier pair of legs youll find us glad to have you in the village inspector she stated as she opened the door to the first room and then with a gesture of her hand indicated the room next door with the unspoken message that it was up to them to decide who stayed where thats helpful im glad to hear it weve none of us anything against gabriel you see but hes not been a popular man round here since they carted roberta off to the asylum lynley was positively white with rage but there was not the slightest indication of that emotion in his voice barbara watched his performance on the telephone with grudging admiration a virtuoso she admitted the name of the admitting psychiatrist there wasnt one what a fascinating procedure then upon whose authoritywhen exactly did you expect me to stumble upon this information superintendent since youve conveniently left it out of the reportno youve got things backwards im afraid you dont move a suspect to an institution without formal paperworkits unfortunate that your police matron is on holiday but you fi nd a replacement you dont move a nineteenyearold girl into a mental hospital for the simple reason that she refuses to speak to anyone barbara wondered if he would allow himself to explode if he would show even a crack in that welltailored savile row armour of his im afraid that bathing daily is not the preeminent indication of unshakable sanity either dont pull rank on me superintendent if this is any indication of the manner in which youve handled this case theres no wonder to me that kerridge is after your skin whos her solicitorshouldnt you be getting her one yourself thendont tell me what you have no intention of doing ive been brought in on this case and henceforth it shall be conducted correctly am i being quite clear now please listen carefully you have exactly two hours to get everything to me in keldale every warrant every paper every deposition every note that was taken by every officer on this case do you understand two hourswebberly webberly phone him then and have done with it stonefaced lynley handed the telephone back to stepha odell she replaced it behind the reception counter and ran a finger along the receiver several times before looking up should i have said nothing she asked a trace of anxiety in her voice i dont want to cause trouble between you and your superiors lynley flipped open his pocket watch and checked the time nies is not my superior and yes you should have told me thank you for doing so you saved me a needless trip to richmond that no doubt nies was longing to force me to make stepha didnt pretend to understand instead she gestured vaguely to a door on their right imay i offer you a drink inspector you as well sergeant weve got a real ale that as nigel parrish is fond of saying sets you to rights come this way she led them into a typical english country inn lounge whose air was heavy with the scent of a recent fire the room had been cleverly designed with enough homelike qualities to keep residents comfortable while maintaining a formal enough atmosphere to keep villagers out there were a variety of plump chintzcovered couches and chairs decorated with petit point pillows tables spread out in no particular arrangement were maple well used and ringed on their tops where too many glasses had been placed on the wood without protection the carpet was a floral design patchy with darker colours in some sections where furniture had recently been moved suitably tedious prints hung on the walls riding to hounds a day at newmarket a view of the village but behind the bar at the far side of the room and over the fireplace were two watercolours that displayed a distinctive talent and remarkable taste both were views of a ruined abbey lynley wandered to one of these as stepha worked behind the bar this is lovely he remarked a local artist a young man named ezra farmington does them she replied theyre of our abbey those two are how he paid for his board here one autumn he lives in the village permanently now barbara watched the redheaded woman deftly work the taps and scoop the foam from the churning brew that was developing a life of its own in the glass stepha laughed in a breathless charming way when the foam slipped over the side and onto her hand and she unconsciously raised her fingers to her lips to lick the residue barbara idly wondered how long it would take lynley to get her into bed sergeant stepha asked an ale for you as well tonic water if you have it barbara replied she looked out the window on the common the old priest who had been to see them in london was having an anxious conversation with another man from the gesturing and pointing at the silver bentley the news of their arrival was apparently the topic of the village a woman crossed from the bridge to join them she was wispylooking an effect produced by a dress too gauzy for the season and by babyfine hair which the smallest air current ruffled she rubbed her arms for warmth and rather than joining in the conversation of the two men she merely listened as if waiting for one or the other of them to walk off in a moment the priest said a few final words and meandered back towards the church the other two remained standing together their conversation went in fi ts and starts with the man saying something with a quick look at the woman and then away and the woman replying briefly there were long silences in which the woman looked at the bank of the river next to the common and the man focused his attention on the lodgeor perhaps the car in front of it someone was significantly interested in the arrival of the police barbara decided a tonic water and an ale stepha was saying as she placed both glasses on the bar its a home brew my fathers recipe we call it odells you must tell me what you think of it inspector it was a rich brown liquid shot through with gold has a bit of a kick doesnt it lynley said when he tasted it are you sure you wont have one havers just the tonic water thank you sir he joined her at the couch in front of which he had earlier spilled out the contents of the report on the teys murder and had icily flipped through every paper looking for the explanation of roberta teyss placement in barnstingham mental asylum there had been none that had set him off on the telephone to richmond now he began to go through the paperwork again stacking things in categorical fashion from the bar stepha odell watched them with friendly interest sipping an ale that shed poured for herself weve got the original warrants the forensics report the signed depositions the photographs lynley fingered the materials as he named them he looked up at barbara no keys to the farmhouse damn the man richard has a set of those if you need them stepha said quickly as if hoping to make up for her remark about roberta that had set lynley off on a collision course with the richmond police in the fi rst place richard gibson he wasis william teyss nephew he lives in the council cottages on st chads lane its just off the high street lynley looked up how does he come to have keys to the farmhouse having arrested robertawell i suppose they just gave them to richard hes to inherit it anyway once the estates all settled she added in williams will i suppose hes seeing to the place in the meantime someone must hes to inherit how was roberta treated in the will stepha gave the bar a thoughtful sweep with a cloth it was fixed between richard and william that the farm would go to richard it was a sensible arrangement he works there with william worked there she corrected herself ever since he returned to keldale two years ago once they got over their row about roberta it all worked out to everyones advantage william had someone to help him richard had a job and a future and roberta had a place to live for life sergeant lynley nodded at her notebook which was lying unused next to her tonic water if you would please stepha flushed as she saw barbara reach for her pen is this an interview then she asked flashing an anxious smile i dont know how much i can help you inspector tell us about the row and roberta she came round the bar and joined them pulling a comfortable cushioned chair to the other side of the table she sat down tucking her legs to one side and glanced at the stack of photographs in front of her she looked away quickly ill tell you what i can but it isnt much olivias the one who can tell you more olivia odellyour sisterinlaw my brother pauls widow stepha placed her glass of ale on the table and used the same movement to cover the photographs with a pile of forensic reports if you dont mind sorry lynley said quickly we get so used to looking at horrors like that that we become immune he replaced it all in the folder why did they have a row about roberta olivia told me latershe was with them at the dove and whistle when it happenedthat it was all due to the way roberta looks she fingered her glass made a pattern of lace on the moisture of its surface richards from keldale you see but hed been gone a good few years trying his luck with barley in the fens hed married down there had two children as well when the farming didnt work out he returned to the kel she smiled at them they say that the kel never lets one go easily and that was the case for richard he was gone for eight or nine years and when he returned he was quite a bit shocked to see the change in roberta you said it was all due to the way she looks she didnt always look as she does now she was always a big girl of course even at eight when richard left but she was never stepha hesitated clearly searching delicately for the right word for a euphemism that would be factual at the same time as it was noncommittal obese barbara fi nished like a cow yes stepha went on gratefully richard had always been great friends with roberta for all hes twelve years her senior and to come back and find his cousin so sadly deterioratedphysically i mean she was much the same otherwisewas a terrible shock to him he blamed william for ignoring the girl said she had done it to herself to try to get his attention william raged at that olivia said shed never seen him so angry poor man thered been problems enough in his life without an accusation like that from his own nephew but they got it sorted out richard apologised the very next day william wouldnt take roberta to a doctorhe wouldnt bend that farbut olivia found a diet for the girl and from that time on all went well until three weeks ago lynley observed if you choose to believe that roberta killed her father then yes it all went well until three weeks back but i dont believe she killed him not for one blessed moment lynley looked surprised at the force behind her words why not because aside from richardwho heaven knows has enough trouble just dealing with that family of his ownwilliam was all that roberta had besides her reading and dreams there was only her father shed no friends her own age no other girls nearby on the farms or in the village stepha shook her head she kept to herself when she wasnt working on the farm with her father mostly she read she was here every day for the guardian in fact for years on end they never did take a paper on the farm so shed come every afternoon once everyoned seen it and wed let her take it home with her i think shed read every book of her mothers in the house all of marsha fitzalans and the newspaper was the only thing left for her weve no lending library you see she frowned down at the glass in her hands she stopped looking at the paper a few years back though when my brother died i couldnt help thinking her greyblue eyes darkened that perhaps roberta was in love with paul after he died four years ago we saw nothing of the girl for quite some time and she never came again to ask for the guardian if a village as small as keldale could even have an undesirable area out of which residents aspired to escape st chads lane would have been that spot it was more like an alley than a street an unpaved thoroughfare to nowhere having the one distinction of a pub on the corner this was the dove and whistle its doors and woodwork painted a blinding shade of purple itself looking very much as if it wished it could have had the good fortune to be settled somewhereanywhere else richard gibson and his brood lived in the last attached house in this lane a pinched stone building with chipped window sashes and a front door that had once been painted royal blue but now was fading to a decided grey this stood open to the late afternoon mindless of the rapidly dropping temperature in the dale and from within the confi nes of the tiny house came the noise of a family quarrelling passionately god damn you do something with him then hes your son as well jesus christ youd think he was a miraculous little version of virgin birth from all the interest you take in his upbringing it was a woman speaking a shrieking that sounded as if at any moment it would choose hysteria or cachinnation as a second line of attack a mans voice rumbled in answer indistinguishable in the general uproar oh it will be better then thats a fine laugh dick when youve the whole bleeding farm to use as an excuse just like last night you couldnt wait to get there could you so dont tell me about the farm well never see you then when youve five hundred acres to hide in lynley rapped sharply with the rustgrimed knocker on the open door and the scene froze before them with a plate on his knee obviously attempting to eat some sort of utterly unappetising afternoon meal a man sat on a sagging couch in a cramped sitting room while in front of him a woman stood her arm upraised a hairbrush in her hand both stared at the unexpected visitors youve caught us at our very best moment it was straight to bed next richard gibson said the gibsons were a portrait of contrasts the man was enormous nearly six and a half feet with black hair swarthy skin and sardonic brown eyes he was bullnecked with the thick limbs of a labourer his wife on the other hand was a scrap of a blonde sharpfeatured and at the moment white to the lips with rage but there was an electricity in the air between them that gave credence to what the man had said here was a relationship where every argument and discussion was merely a skirmish before the major battle of who would be master between the sheets and the answer to that judging from what lynley and havers could see before them was clearly a tossup shooting a final smouldering look at her husband that spoke of desire as much as rage madeline gibson left the room slamming the kitchen door behind her the big man chuckled when she was gone eight stone of tiger he commented getting to his feet one hell of a woman he extended a large paw richard gibson he said genially you must be scotland yard when lynley had made the introductions gibson went on sundays are always the worst round here he jerked his head towards the kitchen from which a steady wailing indicated the state of the relationship between mother and what sounded like fourteen children roberta used to help out but were without her now of course you know that thats why youve come he hospitably indicated two antiquated chairs that were belching stuffing onto the floor lynley and havers picked their way across the room to them avoiding broken toys scattered newspapers and at least three plates of halfconsumed food that lay on the bare floor somewhere a glass of milk had been left too long in the room for its sour smell overcame even the other odours of poorly cooked food and plumbing gone bad youve inherited the farm mr gibson lynley began will you move there soon it cant be soon enough for me im not sure my marriage can survive another month of this place gibson toed his plate away from the couch a scrawny cat slid out of nowhere sniffed at the dried bread and pungent sardines and rejected the offering by attempting to bury it gibson watched the animal his face amused youve lived here several years havent you two to be exact two years four months and two days to be even more precise i could probably get it down to the hours as well but you get the idea i couldnt help overhearing the fact that your wife doesnt seem to be enthused about the teys farm gibson laughed youre well bred inspector lynley i like that sort of thing when the police come calling he ran his hands through his thick hair looked at the fl oor beneath his feet and found a bottle of ale that in the general confusion had become positioned precariously against the side of the couch he picked it up and drained it before going on wiping his mouth on the back of his hand it was the gesture of a man used to taking his meals out in the fi elds no madeline wants the fens again she wants the open spaces the water and the sky but i cant give that to her so ive got to give her what i can gibsons eyes flicked over sergeant havers who kept her head bent over her notebook sound like the words of a man who would kill his uncle dont they he asked pleasantly hank finally caught up with them in the novices room st james looked up from kissing his wifeher skin smelled intoxicatingly of lilies her fingers moved silkily through his hair her murmured my love against his mouth fired his bloodand there was the american grinning wickedly down at them from his perch on the wall of the day room cotcha hank winked st james contemplated murder deborah gasped in surprise hank hopped down unbidden to join them hey bean he shouted found the lovebirds in here jojo watson appeared only moments later struggling through the doorway in the ruined abbey teetering dangerously on high heels round her neck as a complement to the chains and trinkets hung an instamatic camera taking some shots hank said in explanation nodding towards the camera a few minutes more and wedve had a few sweet onesa you he snorted with laughter slapping st james affectionately on the shoulder dont blame you a bit fella if she belonged to me i couldnt keep my mitts off her he gave brief attention to his wife dammit bean be careful woman break your neck in this place he turned back to the other two and noticed deborahs equipmentcamera case tripod discarded lenses hey you taking shots too got sidetracked huh thats honeymooners for you come on down here bean join the party back from richmond so soon st james finally managed to ask with strangled courtesy deborah he noted was surreptitiously trying to straighten her clothes her eyes met his full of laughter and mischief alive with desire what in gods name were the americans doing here now well hank admitted as jojo reached them at last i gotta tell you fella richmond wasnt quite everything that you promised itd be not that we didnt get a bang outa the drive whatsay jojobean didnt we love it hank loves driving on the wrong side of the road jojo explained her nose twitched her eyes caught the exchange of looks between the two younger people hank why dont we take a nice long walk toward bishop furthing road wouldnt that be a sweet way to end the afternoon she put her bejewelled hand on her husbands arm attempting to draw him out onto the abbey grounds hellsapoppin no hank answered pleasantly i have done enuff walking on this trip to last me a lifetime he cocked his head at st james shrewdly that was some map you gave us fella if the bean here wasnt so fast at reading road signs wed be in edinburgh by now he pronounced it edinberg well theres no harm done is there we got here in time to show you the death hole itself there was nothing for it but to go along death hole deborah enquired she had knelt and was replacing her equipmentforgotten for a few moments in the lovely blue of simons eyesin its case the baby remember hank said patiently although considering what you twos up to in here i can see the baby story didnt exactly scare the livin hell outa you did it he winked lasciviously ah the baby st james responded he picked up deborahs case now i got your interest hank approved i could tell at first you mighta been a little peeved at me popping in on you like that but now i got you i can tell yes indeed deborah responded but her thoughts were elsewhere curious how it had all happened in a moment she loved him had loved him from her childhood but in a dizzying lightningbolt moment of time shed realised that it had changed somehow becoming quite different between them from what it had been before hed all of a sudden become not that gentle simon whose tender presence had filled her heart with joy but a whipbodied lover whose very look aroused her good heavens deborah youve become quite silly with lust she thought st james heard his wifes bubble of laughter deborah he asked hank nudged him in the ribs with a knowing elbow dont worry about the bride he confided theyre all shy at first he strutted on ahead like stanley with livingston in sight pointing out areas of interest to his wife with a catch that bean get it in the lens sorry my love st james murmured as they followed the progress of the other two through the ruined day room across court and warming house and into the cloister i thought i had him taken care of until midnight at least five minutes more and im afraid he would have caught me getting you into some truly serious trouble what a thought she laughed oh simon what if he had he would have shouted get it in the lens bean and our love life might have been destroyed forever her eyes danced and sparkled her hair gleamed brightly in the afternoon sun blowing about her throat and shoulders carelessly st james drew in a sharp breath it was like a pain i dont think so he said evenly the death hole was in what remained of the vestry this was no more than a narrow roofless hallway overgrown with grass and wildflowers just beyond the south transept of the ancient church here a series of four arched recesses lined the wall and it was to these that hank pointed with ghoulish drama in onea them he announced get it in the lens bean he tromped through the grass and posed toothily seems this was the place where the monks kept their church duds sorta a cupboard or something and on the night in question the baby was plopped right in and left to die pretty sickening when you think about it huh he bounced back to their sides just the right size for a kid though he added thoughtfully like a whatdayacallit sacrifi cial offering im not sure the cistercian monks were in that line of business st james commented and human sacrifices have been out of fashion for a good number of years well whatdaya think then whose baby was it i couldnt even begin to guess st james replied knowing full well the theory was forthcoming then lemme tell you how it happened because the bean and i figgered it out the fi rst day didnt we bean a wait for the woman to nod her head loyally come on over here lemme show you two lovebirds a thing or two hank led them through the south transept across the uneven paving of the presbytery and out onto the abbey grounds through a gap in the wall there you have it he pointed triumphantly to a narrow track that led to the north through the woods i see indeed st james replied got it fi ggered out too ah no hank hooted sure you dont thats cause you havent thought it through like me n the bean have right sugarplum sugarplum nodded mournfully moving her bunny eyes from st james to deborah in silent contrition gypsies her spouse went on okay okay i admit it bean and i didnt get the full handle on this till we saw them today you know who i mean those trailers parked on the sidea the road well we figgered out that there musta been somea the same here that night it had to be a babya theirs i understand gypsies are inordinately fond of their children st james noted drily well nota this kid anyway hank replied undeterred so get the pitcher here fella danny and ezra are over there somewhere he waved vaguely in the direction from which they had comegetting ready for the plunge you know and tippytoeing along this path comes some old crone with a kid old crone well sure dont you see it ditchdelivered no doubt st james said ditchwho hank shrugged off the literary allusion like lint from his coat the old crone looks around right and left hank demonstrated and slips into the abbey looks around for a deposit box and bingo bobsyeruncle it certainly is an interesting theory deborah put in but i always feel just a bit sorry for the gypsies they seem to get blamed for everything dont they that little bride brings me right on up to theory number two jojobean blinked her apologies gembler farm was in excellent condition a fact unsurprising since richard gibson had continued to work it throughout the three weeks since his uncles death opening the welloiled gates that hung between two stone posts lynley and havers entered and surveyed it it would be quite an inheritance to their left stood the farmhouse an old building constructed from the common brown bricks of the district with freshly painted white woodwork and frail clematis conscientiously trimmed and trellised over windows and door it was set back from gembler road and a welltended garden fenced to keep out the sheep separated the two next to the house was a low outbuilding and forming another side to the quadrangle that comprised the yard the barn loomed to their right like the house it was constructed of brick with a heavily tiled roof it was two fl oors high with gaping windows on the second floor through which the tops of ladders could be seen dutch doors were used on the ground level of the barn for this was a building for tools and animals only vehicles would be kept in the outbuilding to the far side of the house they walked across the wellswept yard and lynley inserted a key into the rusting lock that hung on the barn door it swung noiselessly open inside it was eerily still dim musty and overcold too much the place where a man had met a violent end quiet havers observed she hesitated at the door while lynley entered hmm he responded from the third stall expect thats due to the sheep sir he looked up at her from where he had squatted on the pockmarked stone fl oor she was quite pale sheep sergeant he said theyre in the upper meadow remember thats why its so quiet have a look here will you seeing that she was reluctant to approach he added you were right she came forward at that and passed her eyes over the stall at the far end was heaped a mouldly pile of hay to the centre was a not overlarge pool of dried bloodbrown not red there was nothing else right sir havers asked dead on the bottom if youll pardon the expression not a drop of blood on the walls i dont think we had any bodyslinging here no crimescene arrangement done after the fact nice thinking havers he looked up in time to see the surprise on her face she reddened in confusion thank you sir he stood up and directed his attention back to the stall the overturned bucket upon which roberta had been sitting when the priest found her was still in its place the hay into which the head had rolled remained untouched the pool of dried blood had scraping marks from the forensic team and the axe was gone but otherwise everything remained as it had been originally photographed except for the bodies the bodies good god feeling like the fool nies intended him to be lynley gaped numbly at the outer edge of the stain where a heelprint matted several black and white hairs into the coagulated blood he swung to havers the dog he said inspector havers what in gods name did nies do with the dog her eyes went to the same heelprint saw the same hairs it was in the report wasnt it it wasnt he replied with a muttered curse and knew that he was going to have to drag every scrap of information out of nies as if he were a surgeon probing for shrapnel it would be absolute hell lets look at the house he said grimly they entered as the family would through an enclosed porchlike hallway in which old coats and mackintoshes hung on pegs and workboots stood beneath a singleplank bench along the wall the house had gone unheated for three weeks so the air was tomblike a car rumbled past on gembler road but the sound was muffl ed and distant the hall took them immediately into the kitchen it was a large room with a red linoleum floor dark ash cabinets and brilliantly white appliances that looked as if they were still polished daily nothing whatsoever was out of place not a dish was out of a single cupboard not a crumb lay on a single work top not a stain marred the surface of the white castiron sink in the centre of the room stood a worktable of unpainted pine its top scarred with the slashings of thousands of knives cutting thousands of vegetables with the discolouration of generations of cooking no wonder gibson is eager for the place lynley remarked as he looked it over certainly a far cry from st chads lane did you believe him sir havers asked lynley paused in his inspection of the cupboards that he was in bed with his wife when teys was killed considering the nature of their relationship its a credible alibi wouldnt you say ii suppose so sir he glanced at her but you dont believe it its only thatwell she looked like she was lying like she was angry with him as well or maybe angry with us lynley considered haverss statement madeline gibson had indeed spoken to them grudgingly spitting the words out with barely a glance of corroboration at her husband for his part the farmer had smoked stolidly during her recitation a blank expression of disinterest on his face but unmistakably a lurking touch of amusement behind his dark eyes theres something not quite right there ill agree lets go through here they went through a heavy door into the dining room where a mahogany table was covered with clean creamcoloured lace on it yellow roses in a vase had long since died weeping petals onto the fret of the cloth a matching sideboard stood to one side with a silver epergne placed in its exact centre as if someone with a measuring tool had made certain it was equidistant from each end a china cabinet held a beautiful collection of dishes obviously unused by the inhabitants of the house they were antique belleek pieces each one stacked or tilted or turned in some way to display it best as in the kitchen nothing was out of place save for the flowers they might have been wandering through a museum it was across the hall from the dining room however where they first found signs of the life of the house for here in the sitting room the teyses had kept their shrine havers preceded lynley into the room but at the sight she cried out involuntarily and stepped back quickly one arm raised as if to ward off a blow something wrong sergeant lynley inspected the room to see what had startled her observing nothing but furniture and a collection of photographs in one corner excuse me i think she produced an unnatural grimace to pass for a smile sorry sir ii think i must be hungry or something a little lightheaded im fi ne she walked to the corner of the room in which the photographs hung before which the candles rested underneath which the flowers had died this must be the mother she said quite a tribute lynley joined her at a threecornered table that backed into the wall beautiful girl he replied softly studying the pictures she really wasnt much more than that was she look at the wedding picture she looks as if she were ten years old such a little creature it was unspoken between them how had she produced a cow like roberta dont you think its a bit havers paused and he glanced at her she clasped her hands stiffly behind her i mean if he was planning to marry olivia sir lynley set down what was obviously the final portrait of the woman she looked about twentyfour a fresh smiling face golden freckles sprinkled across the bridge of her nose long gleaming blonde hair tied back and curled beguiling he stepped back from the collection its as if teys established a new religion in the corner of this room he said macabre wouldnt you agree i she tore her eyes from the picture yes sir lynley turned his attention to the rest of the room everyday living had gone on in it there were a comfortably worn couch several chairs a rack holding numerous magazines a television set and a womans escritoire lynley opened this neatly stacked stationery a tin of postage stamps three unpaid bills he glanced at them a chemists receipt for teyss sleeping pills the electricity the telephone he looked at the last but there was nothing of interest no long distance calls everything neat and clean beyond the sitting room was a small libraryoffice and they opened the door to this looked at each other in surprise and walked into the room three of the four walls had shelves that climbed to the ceiling and every shelf was littered with books books stacked books piled books falling loosely to one side books standing up at rigid attention books everywhere but stepha odell said that there was no lending library so roberta came for the newspaper lynley fi nished shed read all of her own bookshow was that possibleand all of marsha fitzalans who by the way is marsha fitzalan schoolteacher havers responded she lives on st chads lane next door to the gibsons thank you lynley murmured inspecting the shelves he put on his spectacles hmm a bit of everything but heavily into the brontës werent they havers joined him austen she read dickens bit of lawrence they went in for the classics she pulled down pride and prejudice and opened it tessas was scrawled childishly across the flyleaf this same declaration was in dickens and shakespeare two norton anthologies and all the brontës lynley moved to a book stand that was fi xed underneath the rooms only window it was the kind used for large dictionaries but on its top rested an immense illuminated bible he ran his fingers down the page to which the book was open i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt he read now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance he looked up at havers ill never understand why he forgave his brothers she said after what theyd done to him they deserved to die the bitterness behind her words burned he closed the book slowly marking the place with a scrap of paper from the desk but he had something they needed food she scoffed he removed his spectacles i dont think it had anything at all to do with food not really he noted whats above stairs the second floor of the house was simple four bedrooms lavatory bathroom all opening off a central square landing illuminated by a skylight of opaque glass an obvious modernisation to the house this last architectural feature gave the effect of being in a greenhouse not altogether unpleasant but unusual on a farm the room on their right appeared to be a guest room a neatly made pinkcounterpaned bed a rather smallish affair considering the size of the houses occupants stood against one wall on a rug printed with a design of roses and ferns it was obviously quite old and the once brilliant reds and greens were muted now bleeding one into the other in a soothing rust the walls were hung with paper on which tiny flowersdairies and marigoldssprinkled down on the bedside table a small lamp stood upon a circle of lace the chest of drawers held nothing as did the wardrobe reminds me of a room in an inn lynley remarked barbara noted the view from the window an uninteresting panorama of the barn and the yard looks as if no ones ever used it lynley was examining the counterpane across the bed he pulled it back to reveal a badly stained mattress and a yellowing pillow no guests expected here odd to leave a bed unmade wouldnt you say not at all why put sheets on it if its never going to be used except that look shall i go on to the next room inspector barbara asked impatiently the house was oppressing her lynley glanced up at the tone of her voice he drew the counterpane back over the bed exactly as it had been placed before and sat on the edge what is it barbara he asked nothing she replied but she heard the edge of panic in her voice id just like to get on with it this room obviously hasnt been used in years why examine every inch of it like sherlock holmes as if the murderer were going to pop out of the fl oorboards he didnt reply at once so the shrillness of her voice seemed to linger in the room long after she had spoken whats wrong he repeated may i help his eyes were on her dark with their concern so infi nitely kind it would indeed be easy theres nothing wrong she exploded i just dont want to have to follow you around like a spaniel dog i dont know what you expect of me i feel like an idiot ive a brain goddammit give me something to do he got to his feet his eyes still on her why dont you go across the landing and deal with the next room he suggested she opened her mouth to say more decided against it and left him pausing for a moment in the greenish light of the landing she could hear her own breathing harsh and loud and knew he must be able to hear it as well that damnable shrine the farm itself was bad enough with its ghastly lifelessness but the shrine had completely unnerved her it had been set up in the very fi nest corner of the room with a view of the garden barbara thought weakly tony has the telly and she has the damn garden what had lynley called it a religion yes sweet jesus a temple to tony she compelled her breathing to return to normal crossed the landing and went into the next room thats torn it barb she told herself what happened to agreement to obedience to cooperation how will you feel back in uniform next week she looked about furiously her lips quivering in disgust well who bloody well cared after all it was a preordained failure had she really expected this to be a success she crossed the room to the window and fumbled with the latch what had he said what is it may i help the insanity was that for just a moment she had actually thought about talking to him about telling him everything there was to tell but of course it was unthinkable no one could help least of all lynley she unlocked the window threw it open to feel the fresh air on her burning cheeks then turned back determined to do her job this was robertas room neat like the other but with a livedin air about it a largae fourposter was covered by a quilt a patchwork affair with a bright cheerfu design of sun clouds and rainbow on a sapphire background sky clothes hung in the wardrobe sturdy shoeswork shoes walking shoes slippersstood lined beneath them there were a dressing table with a wavy cheval glass and a chest of drawers on which a framed photograph lay face down as if it had toppled over barbara glanced at it curiously mother father and a newborn roberta in the fathers arms but the picture itself slightly distended was crowded into its frame as if it didnt quite fit she turned the frame in her hands and prised off the backing she was correct in her guess the photograph had been too large for the purchased frame so it had been folded back unfolded the picture was very much different for to the left of the father hands clasped behind her stood the mirror image of the babys mother a smaller version certainly but undoubtedly the offspring of tessa teys barbara was about to call out to lynley when he came to the door a photograph album in his hands he paused as if trying to decide how to get their relationship back in order ive found the strangest thing sergeant he said as have i she replied as determined as he to forget her outburst they exchanged their items yours explains mine i dare say lynley remarked she gave curious attention to the open pages of the album it was a pictorial family record the kind that documents weddings and births christmas easter and birthdays but every picture that had more than one child in it had been cut up in some way oddly defaced so that pictures had central slices missing or wedges cut into them and the size of the family was systematically reduced in every one the effect was chilling a sister of tessas id say lynley observed perhaps her first child barbara offered surely shes too old to be a first child unless tessa produced her when she was a child herself he set the frame down slipped the photograph into his pocket and turned his attention to the drawers ah he said at least we know why roberta was so anxious for the guardian shes lined her drawers with it andhavers look at this from the bottom drawer beneath a pile of worn jerseys he pulled something which had been placed face down hidden the mystery girl once again barbara looked at the photograph he handed to her it was the same girl but older this time a teenager she and roberta were standing in the snow in st catherines churchyard both grinning at the camera the older girl had her hands on robertas shoulders pulling her back against her she had bent over although certainly not far for roberta was nearly as tall as sheand had pressed her cheek to the other girls her dark gold hair touched robertas brown curls in front of them with robertas hand clutched into his fur was a border collie who looked very much as if he were grinning as well whiskers roberta doesnt look half bad there barbara said handing the picture to lynley big but not fat then this must have been taken sometime before gibson left remember what stepha said shed not been fat then not until richard was gone he pocketed the additional photograph and looked round the room anything else he asked clothes in the wardrobe nothing much of interest as he had done in the other room she drew back the quilt from the bed unlike the other however this bed was made and its fresh laundered linen gave off the scent of jasmine but underneath it as if the jasmine were incense subtly burning to hide the odour of cannabis was the cloying smell of something more barbara looked at lynley do you absolutely he replied help me pull off the mattress she did so covering her mouth and nose when the stench filled the room and they saw what lay beneath the old mattress the boxspring covering had been cut away in the far corner of the bed and resting within was a storehouse of food rotting fruit bread grey with mould biscuits and candy pastries halfeaten bags of crisps oh jesus barbara murmured it was more prayer than exclamation and in spite of the catalogue of gruesome sights she had seen as a member of the force her stomach heaved uneasily and she backed away sorry she gasped with a shaky laugh bit of a surprise lynley dropped the mattress back into place his face was expressionless its sabotage he said to himself sir stepha said something about a diet as barbara had done before lynley walked to the window evening was drawing on and in a fading patch of the dying light he withdrew the photographs from his coat pocket and examined them he stood motionless perhaps in the hope that an uninterrupted undisturbed study of the two girls would tell him who killed william teys and why and what a storehouse of rotting food had to do with anything watching him barbara was struck by how a trick of light falling across hair cheek and brow made him look vastly younger than his thirtytwo years and yet nothing altered or obscured the mans intelligence or the wit behind his eyes not even the shadows the only noise in the room was his breathing steady and calm very sure he turned found her watching him and began to speak she stopped him well she said forcefully pushing her hair behind her ears in a pugnacious gesture see anything else in the other rooms just a box of old keys in the wardrobe and a veritable museum of tessa he replied clothing photographs locks of hair among teyss own things of course he replaced the photographs in his pocket i wonder if olivia odell knew what she was in for they had walked the threequarters of a mile from the village down gembler road to the teyss farm as they returned lynley began to wish that he had driven his car it was not so much concern that darkness had fallen but a longing for music to distract him without it he found himself glancing at the woman walking wordlessly at his side and he reluctantly considered what he had heard about her one angry vairgin macpherson had said what she needs is a faer toss i the hay then he roared with laughter and lifted his pint in his big bears grasp but no me laddies ill not test those waters i leave tha plaisure to a youngr man but macpherson was wrong lynley thought there was no question of angry virginity here it was something else this wasnt haverss first murder investigation so he could not understand her reaction to the farm her initial reluctance to enter the barn her strange behaviour in the sitting room her inexplicable outburst upstairs for the second time he wondered what on earth webberly had in mind in creating their partnership but he found he was too weary to attempt an explanation the lights of the dove and whistle came in sight upon the final curve of the road lets get something to eat he said roast chicken the proprietor announced its our sunday night dinner get you some up quick if you have a seat in the lounge the dove and whistle was doing a brisk evenings business in the public bar which had fallen into stillness upon their entrance a pall of cigarette smoke hung like a heavy rain cloud over the room farmers gathered in conversation in a corner their mudencrusted boots placed on rungs of ladderbacked chairs two younger men played a boisterous game of darts near a door marked toilets while a group of middleaged women compared the sunday evening remnants of saturdays crimps and curls courtesy of sinjis beauty shoppe the bar itself was surrounded by patrons most of whom were joking with the girl who worked the taps behind it she was clearly the village anomaly jet black hair rose out of her scalp in spikes her eyes were heavily outlined in purple and her clothes were nighttimeinsoho explicit short black leather skirt white plunging blouse black lace stockings with holes held together by safety pins black laced shoes of the sort that grandmothers wear each of her ears pierced four timeswore the dubious decoration of a line of stud earrings except for the bottom right hole which sported a feather dangling to her shoulder fancies herself a rock singer the publican said following their glance shes m daughter but i try not to let the word out often he thumped a pint of ale on the wobbly table in front of lynley gave a tonic water to barbara and grinned hannah he shouted back into the public bar stop making a spectacle of yourself girl yre driving every man present insane with lust he winked at them wickedly oh dad she laughed the others did as well tell him off hannah somebody called and another whats the poor bloke ever known about style style is it the publican called back cheerfully shes a cheap one to dress all right but shes running through my fortune buying gunk for her hair how dyou keep them spikes up han got scared in the abbey id say heard the baby howl did you han laughter a playful swing at the speaker the statement made see were all friends here barbara wondered if theyd rehearsed the whole thing she and lynley were the only occupants of the lounge and once the door closed behind the publican she longed for the noise of the public bar again but lynley was speaking she must have been a compulsive eater who murdered her father because he put her on a diet it slipped out before barbara could stop herself sarcasm was rich in her voice who obviously did a lot of eating in secret lynley went on his own voice was unperturbed well it doesnt look that way to me she argued she was pushing him and she knew it it was defensive and stupid but she couldnt help it what does it look like to you that foods been forgotten who knows how long its been there i think we can agree that its been there three weeks and that any food thats left out for three weeks is likely to spoil all right ill accept that barbara said but not the compulsive eating why not because you cant prove it dammit he ticked off items on his fi ngers we have two rotting apples three black bananas something that at one time might have been a ripe pear a loaf of bread sixteen biscuits three halfeaten pastries and three bags of crisps now you tell me what we have here sergeant ive no idea she replied then if youve no idea perhaps youll consider mine he paused barbara she knew at once from his tone that she had to stop him he couldnt he wouldnt understand im sorry inspector she said swiftly i got spooked at the farm and iive jumped all over you for it ever since iim sorry he appeared to be taken aback all right lets start again shall we the publican approached and plopped two plates down onto the table chicken and peas he announced proudly barbara got up and stumbled from the room no ezra stop i cant with a deliberately unstifled curse ezra farmington lifted himself off the struggling girl beneath him swung to the edge of the bed and sat there fighting for breath and composure his entire bodybut most particularly he noticed sardonically his head throbbing he lowered this to his hands burying his fingers in honeycoloured hair now she would cry he thought all right all right he said and added savagely im not a rapist for gods sake she did begin to cry at that a fist at her mouth dry hot sobs erupting from deep within her he reached for the lamp no her voice stopped him danny he said trying to speak calmly but aware that he was forcing words out between clenched teeth he couldnt look at her im sorry she wept it was all too familiar it couldnt go on this is ridiculous you know he reached for his watch saw from the luminous dial that it was nearly eight and put it on he began to dress at that the crying increased a hand reached for him touched his naked back he flinched the sobbing continued he picked up the rest of his clothes left the room went into the lavatory and after dressing stared morosely at his reflection in the dusky mirror while his watch ticked away fi ve minutes when he returned the weeping had stopped she still lay on the bed her ivory body shimmering in the moonlight and stared at the ceiling her hair was darkness the rest of her was light his artists eyes travelled the length of her the curve of cheek the fullness of breast the swelling of hip the softness of thigh an objective study in black and white translated quickly to canvas it was an exercise he often engaged in one which disassociated mind from body something he most particularly wanted to do right now his eyes fell on the curling triangle of darkness objectivity shot out the window for gods sake get dressed he snapped am i supposed to stand here staring at you as retribution you know why tis she whispered she made no other move you know why that i do he replied he stayed across the room by the lavatory door it was safer there a few feet closer and hed be on her again and thered be no stopping it he felt his jaw tighten felt every muscle coil with a life of its own you dont lose a chance to remind me danny sat up swung on him why should i she shouted you know wha you did be quiet do you want fitzalan to report back to your aunt have some sense wont you why should i when did you if you wont let it go then whats the point danny why see me at all you cn ask that even now when everyone knows he crossed his arms in front of him steeling himself to the sight of her her hair was tangled round her shoulders her lips were parted her cheeks were wet with tears glistening in the dull light her breastshe forced his eyes to remain on her face you know what happened weve been over it a thousand times going over it a thousand times more wont change the past if you cant let it go then weve got to stop seeing each other more tears welled up and spilled down her cheeks he hated to see her cry it made him want to cross the room and crush her in his arms but what was the use it would only begin again and end in disaster no she was still crying but her voice was low she hung her head i don want that then what do you want i need to know because i know very well what i want danny and if we both dont want the same thing then theres really no use is there he was struggling to summon up control but what little he had was vanishing quickly he thought he might actually cry with frustration i want you she whispered oh god that cuts it that really does you dont want that he replied miserably because even if you did and even if you had me at every juncture youd throw the past in my face and i cant bear that danny ive had enough to his horror his voice caught on the last word her head flew up im sorry she whispered she slipped off the bed and came across the room her body sculpted by moonlight he looked away her smooth fingers found their way to his cheek across it into his hair i never do think o your pain she said only my own im so sorry ezra he drove his gaze to the wall the ceiling the square of night sky beyond the window if he met her eyes he knew he was lost ezra her voice was like a caress in the darkness she smoothed back his hair took a step closer he could smell her musky fragrance feel the tips of her breasts sear his chest her hand dropped to his shoulder and pulled him closer dont you think she continued we both have tforgive it was finally too much there was nowhere else to look his last sane thought was better lost than alone nigel parrish waited until they returned from the lounge to the public bar he was still sitting in his usual corner taking his time about nursing a courvoisier when they fi nished their meal he regarded them with the kind of interest he usually reserved for the village inhabitants quite as if they were going to be around for the next few years they were certainly worth the time and consideration he decided for they were so deliciously bizarre a couple the mans dressed absolutely to kill nigel thought and chuckled inwardly at his tasteless pun charcoal suit handtailored and fairly shrieking savile row gold pocket watch looped across waistcoat burberry tossed casually onto the back of a chairwhy is it that people with the money to buy burberries always toss them about without a second thoughtshoes polished to a sombre unscuffed shine this was scotland yard somehow the woman was more what he had in mind she was short and dumpy sort of a walking rubbishbin type she wore a wrinkled stained suit that fitted her badly entirely the wrong colour for her as well nigel noted baby blues a lovely colour but not on you dumpling her blouse was yellow and did distressing things to her sallow complexion not to mention the fact that it was very badly tucked in all around and the shoes sensible brogues were what one would expect of the police and indeed she wore them but with blue tights to match the suit lord what a vision the poor woman was he clucked his disapproval and got to his feet he sauntered over to the table they had chosen near the door scotland yard he began chattily without introduction has anyone told you about ezra as he lifted his head to look at the newcomer lynleys first thought was no but i should guess youre about to a man stood there brandy glass in hand obviously waiting for an invitation to sit when sergeant havers automatically opened her notebook he considered himself a member of their party and pulled out a chair nigel parrish he introduced himself the organist lynley recalled he guessed that the man was somewhere in his forties and he was blessed with features that middle age enhanced thinning brown hair touched by grey at the temples was combed neatly off an intelligent brow a firm straight nose gave parrishs face distinction a strong jaw and chin were indications of strength he was slender not particularly tall and striking rather than handsome ezra lynley prompted him parrishs brown eyes darted from person to person in the room as if he were waiting for someone to enter farmington our resident artist doesnt every village have a resident artist poet novelist or something i thought that was a virtual requirement of country life parrish shrugged narrow shoulders ezras ours watercolours the occasional oil not bad actually he even sells some of them in a gallery in london he used to come here for just a month or so each year but hes become one of us now he smiled down at his drink dear dear ezra he mused lynley was not about to be played like a fi sh on the line what is it youd like us to know about ezra farmington mr parrish parrishs startled glance betrayed that he hadnt quite been expecting so direct an approach aside from the fact that hes just the teeniest bit of a village lothario theres what happened on the teyss place that you ought to know lynley found ezras romantic inclinations to be neither here nor there although obviously they were of interest to parrish what happened on the teyss place he asked ignoring the other dangling line well parrish warmed to his topic but a sad glance at his empty glass cooled the fi res of the story sergeant lynley said tonelessly his eyes on the other man would you get mr parrish another courvoisier parrish said with a smile and one for me havers obediently left the table nothing for her nigel asked face wrinkled with concern she doesnt drink what a bore when havers returned parrish treated her to a sympathetic smile took a genteel sip of the cognac and settled down to his story as to ezra he said leaning into the table confidentially it was a nasty little scene the only reason i know about it is that i was out that way whiskers you see lynley had gone in this direction once before the musical dog pardon father hart told us that whiskers liked to lie on the common and listen to you play the organ parrish laughed isnt it the absolute devil i practise my fingers to the bone dear ones and my most enthusiastic audience is a farm dog his words dealt with the matter in a lambent fashionas if nothing on earth could really be more amusing yet lynley could see it was a brittle performance a facade made frangible by the force of a current of bitterness that ran swift and sure just beneath the surface parrish was working at joviality and rather too industriously well there you have it he continued he turned the snifter in his hands admiring the variety of colours that the cognac produced as it caught the light a virtual sahara of musical appreciation in the village in fact the only reason i play at st catherines on sundays is to please myself god knows no one else can tell a fugue from a scherzo dyou know that st catherines has the finest organ in yorkshire typical isnt it im sure rome purchased it personally to keep the rcs in control in keldale im c of e myself and farmington lynley asked ezra i dont think ezras religious at all except seeing no amused appreciation on lynleys face what you probably mean is what do i have to say about ezra youve certainly read me mr parrish ezra parrish smiled and took a drink perhaps for courage perhaps for solace it was difficult to tell he lowered his voice momentarily however and as he did so a brief glimmer of the real man emerged brooding and moody but the chatty gossip replaced him almost at once let me see loves it must have been about a month ago when william teys ran ezra off the farm was he trespassing absolutely but according to ezra he has some sort of artistic licence that allows him to trespass everywhere and i do mean everywhere he was doing what he call light studies of high kel moor your basic rouen cathedral sort of thing start a new picture every fi fteen minutes im familiar with monet then you know what i mean well the only waylets say the quickest wayup to high kel moor is right through the woods behind gembler farm and the way to the woods was across teyss land lynley fi nished exactly i was trotting along the road with whiskers in tow hed put in his usual appearance on the common and as it seemed late to let the old boy find his own way home i was taking him there myself i had hoped our darling stepha might be willing to do the job in her mini but she was nowhere to be found so i had to drag the old thing out there on these poor stiff legs you dont own a car not one that runs with any reliablity im afraid anyway i got to the farm and there they were right in the road having the most godawful row ive ever seen there was william in his jimjams excuse me his pyjamas inspector or was it his dressing gown parrish squinted at the ceiling and considered his own question it was his dressing gown i remember thinking lord what hairy legs old william has when i saw him quite like a gorilla i see and ezra was standing there shouting at him waving his arms and cursing in ways that must have made poor sainted williams hair stand on end the dog got hot into the action and took quite a piece out of ezras trousers while he was doing that william ripped three of ezras precious watercolours into shreds and dumped the rest of the portfolio right onto the verge it was dreadful parrish looked down as he concluded his story a mournful note to his voice but when he lifted his head his eyes said clearly that ezra had got what hed long deserved lynley watched sergeant havers climb the stairs and disappear from view he rubbed his temples and walked into the lounge where a light at the far end of the room illuminated the bent head of stepha odell she looked up from her book at his footsteps have we kept you up to lock the door lynley asked im terribly sorry she smiled and stretched her arms languidly over her head not at all she replied pleasantly i was nodding a bit over my novel however what are you reading a cheap romance she laughed easily and got to her feet which he noticed were bare she had changed from her grey church dress into a simple tweed skirt and sweater a single freshwater pearl on a silver chain hung between her breasts its my way of escaping everyone always lives happily ever after in a romance novel he remained where he was near the door how do you escape inspector i dont im afraid then what do you do about the shadows in your life the shadows chasing murderers down it cant be a pleasant job why do you do it there was the question he admitted and knew the answer its penance stepha an expiation for sins committed that you couldnt understand i never stopped to think about it ah she nodded thoughtfully and let it go well youve a package thats come brought by a rather nasty man from richmond he wouldnt give me his name but he smelled like a large digestive tablet an apt description of nies lynley thought as she went behind the bar he followed she had evidently been working in the lounge in the late afternoon for the room was scented richly with beeswax and the yeasty smell of ale that combination took him right back to cornwall a tenyearold boy hurriedly wolfing down pasties in the kitchen of the trefallen farm such delicacies they were to him meat and onions folded into a flaky shell fruit forbidden and unheard of in the formal dining room of howenstow common his father would snort contemptuously and indeed they were which was why he loved them stepha placed a large envelope on the counter here it is will you join me for a nightcap thank you id like that she smiled he noticed how it curved her cheeks how the tiny lines round her eyes seemed to vanish good sit down then you look exhausted he went to one of the couches and opened the envelope nies had made no effort to put the material in any sort of order there were three notebooks of information some additional photographs of roberta forensic reports identical to the ones he already had and nothing whatsoever on whiskers stepha odell placed a glass on the table and sat opposite him drawing her legs up into the seat of the chair what happened to whiskers lynley asked himself why is there nothing about that dog gabriel knows stepha responded for a moment he thought it was some sort of village expression until he recalled the constables name constable langston she nodded sipping her drink her fi ngers on the glass were long and slender unencumbered by rings he buried whiskers where she shrugged a shoulder and pushed her hair back off her face unlike the ugliness of the gesture by havers in stepha it was a lovely movement chasing shadows away im not sure i expect it was somewhere on the farm but why was no forensic study done on the dog lynley mused i suppose they didnt need one they could see how the poor thing died how his throat was slit inspector he fumbled back through the material looking for the pictures no wonder he had failed to see it before teyss body sprawled right over the dogs corpse obscured the view he considered the photograph you see the problem now dont you what do you mean can you imagine roberta slitting whiskerss throat an expression of distaste passed across stephas face its impossible im sorry but its just impossible beyond that no weapon was ever found surely she didnt slit the poor animals throat with an axe as she spoke lynley found himself beginning to wonder for the first time exactly who the real target of the crime had been william teys or his dog suppose a robbery had been in the works he thought the dog would need to be silenced he was old certainly incapable of attacking someone but well enough able to make a din if a foreign presence were found in his territory so the dog would have to be dealt with but perhaps not quickly enough so that when teys rushed out to the barn to see what the yelping was all about he would have to be dealt with as well perhaps thought lynley we have no premeditated murder here but a crime of an entirely different nature stepha he said thoughtfully he reached in his pocket who is this he handed her the photograph that he and havers had found in robertas chest of drawers where on earth did you get this in robertas bedroom who is it its gillian teys robertas sister she tapped the photograph lightly for emphasis studying it as she spoke roberta must have kept this well hidden from william why because after gillian ran off she was dead to william he threw away her clothes got rid of her books and even destroyed every picture that she was in burnt her birth certifi cate as well as everything else in a great bonfi re right in the middle of the yard how on earth she asked more to herself than to him her eyes on the photograph did roberta manage to save this more importantly perhaps why did she save it thats easy enough roberta adored gillian god knows why gillian was the great disaster in the family she turned out quite wild she drank and swore and ran around like mad having the time of her life off to a party in whitby one night out with some hellion godknowswhere the next picking up men and giving them a run for their money then one night some eleven years ago she left and she never came back lynley caught the word left or disappeared stephas body backed into the chair one of her hands rose to her throat but she stopped the gesture as if it were betraying her left she said fi rmly he went along why i imagine because she was at odds with william he was fairly straitlaced and gillian was nothing if not after a good time but richardher cousincould probably tell you more the two of them were rather thick before he left for the fens stepha got to her feet stretched and walked to the door where she paused inspector she said slowly lynley looked up from the photograph halfexpecting her to say more about gillian teys she hesitated would you likeanything else tonight the light from the reception area behind her cast a glow upon her hair her skin looked smooth and lovely her eyes were kind it would be so easy an hour of bliss impassioned acceptance a simple longedfor forgetting no thank you stepha he made himself say the river kel was a peaceful tributary unlike many of the rivers that debouched frantically from the hillsides down into the dales silently it wended its way through keldale flowing past the ruined abbey on its way to the sea it loved the village treating it well seldom overflowing in destruction it welcomed the lodge to exist on its banks splashed greetings onto the village common and listened to the lives of the people who lived in the houses built at its very edge olivia odell had one of these houses across the bridge from the lodge with a sweeping view of the common and of st catherines church it was the finest home in the village with a lovely front garden and a lawn that sloped down to the river it was still early morning when lynley and havers pushed open the gate but the steady wailing of a child coming from behind the house told them that the inhabitants were already up and about they followed the griefstricken ululation to its source on the back steps of the house sat the youthful mourner she was huddled in a ball of woe head bent to her knees a crumpled magazine photograph beneath her grubby shoes to her left sat her audience a solemn male mallard who watched her sympathetically upon her head was the ostensible source of her grief for shed cut her hairor rather somebody had and had plastered it onto her skull with grease it once had been red and from the look of the locks escaping their confi nement decidedly curly but now giving off the malodourous waft of cheap pomade it was nothing but dreadful to behold havers and lynley exchanged a look good morning the inspector said pleasantly you must be bridie the child looked up grabbing the photograph and clutching it to her chest in a motherly gesture the duck merely blinked whats wrong lynley asked kindly bridies defiant posture was completely deflated at the gentle sound of the tall mans voice i cut my hair she wailed i saved my money to go to sinjis but she said she couldnt make my hair go this way and she wouldnt cut it so i cut it myself and now look at me and mummys crying as well i tried to straighten it all out with this stuff of hannahs but itll never come right she hiccupped pathetically on the last word lynley nodded i see it does look a bit awful bridie exactly what sort of effect were you going after he quailed inwardly at the thought of hannahs black spikes this she waved the photograph at him wailing anew he took it from her and looked at the smiling smooth coiffured semblance of the princess of wales elegant in black evening gown and diamonds not a hair out of place of course he muttered bereft of her picture bridie took comfort in the presence of her duck slinging an arm round him and pulling him to her side you dont care dougal do you she demanded of the bird in reply dougal blinked and investigated bridies hair for its edible propensities dougal the duck lynley enquired angus mcdougal mcduck bridie responded the formal introduction made she wiped her nose on the sleeve of her tattered pullover and looked fearfully over her shoulder at the closed door behind her a single tear rolled down her cheek as she went on an hes hungry but i cant go inside to get his food all i gots these marshmallows theyre all right for a treat but his real foods inside and i cant go in why not cause mummy said she didnt want to see me again till id done something about my hair and i dont know what to do the child began to cry again real tears of anguish dougal would apparently starvean unlikely prospect considering his sizeunless some quick thinking were applied to the situation it appeared however that a plan of attack would be unnecessary for at that moment the back door was jerked open angrily olivia odell took one look at her daughterher second only that dayand burst into tears i cant believe you would do it i just cant believe it get in the house and wash your hair her voice rose higher with each word climbing the peak to hysteria but dougal take dougal with you the woman said weeping but do as i say the duck was scooped into nineyearold arms and the two offenders disappeared olivia tugged a tissue from the pocket of her cardigan blew her nose and smiled shakily at the two adults what a dreadful scene she said but as she spoke she began to cry again and walked into the kitchen leaving them standing at the open back door she stumbled to the table and buried her face in her hands lynley and havers looked at each other and decision made entered the house unlike gembler farm there was not the slightest doubt that this house was lived in the kitchen was in total disarray the stove top cluttered with pots and pans appliances gaping open to be cleaned flowers waiting to be put into water dishes piled in the sink the floor was sticky under their feet the walls badly needed paint and the entire room reeked with the charcoal bouquet of burnt toast the offending source of this odour was lying on a plate a sodden black lump that looked as if it has been hastily extinguished by a cup of tea beyond the kitchen what little they could see of the sitting room indicated that its condition was much the same housekeeping was certainly not olivia odells strong point neither was child rearing if the mornings confrontation were any indication shes out of my control olivia wept nine years old and shes out of my control she tore the tissue to shreds looked dazedly about for another and seeing none cried harder still lynley removed a handkerchief from his pocket take this he offered ta she responded oh my god what a morning she blew her nose dried her eyes ran her fingers through her brown hair and looked at her reflection in the toaster she moaned when she saw herself and her bloodshot brown eyes filled again but didnt spill over i look fifty years old wouldnt paul have laughed and then disjointedly she wants to look like the princess of wales so she showed us lynley responded impassively he drew a chair out from the table picked the newspapers off of it and sat down after a pause havers did likewise why olivia asked directing the question more to the ceiling than to her companions what have i done that my daughter believes the key to happiness is to look exactly like the princess of wales she squeezed her fingers into her forehead william would have known what to do what a mess i am without him wishing to avoid a fresh onslaught of tears lynley spoke quickly to divert her little girls always have someone they admire dont they yes olivia said oh yes how true that is shed begun twisting his handkerchief into an appalling little rope lynley winced as he saw it mangled but i never seem to have the right thing to say to the child everything i try seems to end in hysterics william always knew what to say and do whenever he was here everything went smoothly but the moment he was gone wed begin to fi ght like cats and dogs and now hes really gone whats to become of us she didnt wait for an answer its her hair she hates having red hair shes hated it ever since she learned to speak i cant understand it why is a nineyearold girl so damned passionate about her hair redheads lynley noted are generally passionate about everything oh thats it thats it stephas quite the same youd think bridie was her clone not her niece she drew in a breath and sat up in her chair footsteps came running down the hall lord give me strength olivia murmured bridie entered the room a towel wrapped precariously round her head her pullover which she hadnt bothered to remove in her haste to obey her mothers instructionsthoroughly soaked round her shoulders and down most of her back she was followed by her duck who walked like a seaman with a peculiar rolling gait hes crippled bridie announced noticing lynleys inspection of the fowl when he swims he jus goes round in a big circle so i dont let him swim unless im there we took him swimming lots last summer though in the river we made a dam just outside and he had ever so much fun hed plunk himself in the water and go round and round huh dougal the mallard blinked his agreement and searched on the floor for something to eat here let me see you macbride her mother said the daughter came forward the towel was removed the damage was surveyed olivias eyes welled with tears again above her daughters head she bit her lip looks like it just needs a bit of a trim lynley interposed hastily what do you think sergeant a trim ought to do it havers agreed i think the thing to do bridie is to give up on the princess of wales idea now lynley added as the childs bottom lip trembled youve got to remember that your hair is curly hers is quite straight and when sinji told you that she couldnt make it go in that style she was telling you the truth but shes so pretty bridie protested tears threatened once again she is absolutely but it would be a fairly strange world if every woman were exactly like her wouldnt it believe me there are many women who are very pretty and look nothing like her there are bridie gave a longing glance to the crumpled photograph again a large smear of grease was sitting on the princesss nose you can believe the inspector when he says that bridie havers added and her tone implied the rest hes a bit of an expert on the subject bridie looked from woman to man sensing undercurrents that she didnt understand well she announced i spose i got to feed dougal the duck at least looked as if he approved the odell sitting room was only a slight improvement over the kitchen it was hard to believe that one woman and one child could produce such disarray clothes lay piled over chairs as if mother and daughter were in the process of moving knickknacks perched in unlikely positions on the edges of tables and window sills an ironing board was set up in what looked like permanent residence an upright piano spat sheet music onto the fl oor it was havoc with dust so thick that it gave the air fl avour olivia appeared to be unaware of the mess as she absently gestured them towards seats but she looked about as she took her own and sighed in unembarrassed resignation its usually not this bad ive beenits been she cleared her throat and shook her head as if to get her thoughts in order once again the fingers went through the wispy windblownlooking hair it was a girlish gesture oddly incongruous in a woman who so plainly was no longer a girl she had paperfi ne skin and delicate features but the ageing process was not dealing with her kindly she was lined and although thin her flesh lacked resiliency as if she had lost too much weight too quickly bones jutted from her cheeks and wrists you know she said suddenly when paul died it wasnt this bad i cant come to grips with whats happened to me over william the suddenness lynley offered the shock she nodded perhaps youre right my husband paul was ill for several years i had time to prepare myself and bridie of course was too young to understand but william she made an effort at control fixing her eyes on the wall sitting up tall william was such a presence in our lives such a strength i think we both started to depend on him and then he was gone but its selfish of me to be reacting like this how can i be so awful when theres bobba to consider roberta she glanced at him then away she always came here with william what was she like very quiet very nice not an attractive girl heavy you know but she was always very good to bridie her weight caused a problem between richard gibson and his uncle though didnt it olivias brow furrowed a problem how do you mean their argument over it at the dove and whistle will you tell us about it oh that stepha must have told you but that has nothing to do with williams death this as she saw sergeant havers write a few lines in her notebook one can never be sure will you tell us about it a hand fluttered up as if in protest but resettled in her lap richard hadnt been back from the fens for long he ran into us at the dove and whistle there were words silly over in a minute thats all she smiled vaguely what sort of words it really had nothing to do with roberta initially we were all sitting together at a table and william im afraid made a comment about hannah the barmaid have you seen her last night then you know she looksdifferent william didnt at all approve of her nor of the way her father deals with her you knowas if hes just amused by it all so william said something about it something like why her dad lets her walk about looking like a tart is a mystery to me that sort of thing nothing really serious richard was just a bit in his cups hed a terrible set of scratches on his face so i think hed been at it with his wife as well his mood was foul he said something about not being such a fool as to judge by appearances thatas i recallan angel could be wearing a streetwalkers guise and the sweetest blondeheaded little face could hide a whore and william took that to mean what she produced a tired smile as a reference to gillian his older daughter rather immediately im afraid he demanded to know what richard meant by his remark richard and gilly had been great friends you see i think to avoid having to explainrichard sidetracked onto roberta how as an example of not judging by appearances of course it went on from there richard demanded to know why roberta had been allowed to get into such an unattractive state in turn william demanded to know what he had meant by his insinuation about gilly richard demanded that william answer william demanded that richard answer you know the sort of thing and then she laughed it was a tittering sound like that of a trapped bird i thought they might fight richard said no child of his would ever be allowed to eat her way into an early grave and that william ought to be ashamed of the job hed done as a father william became so angry that he said something about richard being ashamed of the job he was doing as a husband he made awell a bit of a crude reference to madeline going unsatisfi edshes richards wife have you met herand frankly just when i thought richard might truly hit his uncle instead he just laughed he said something about being a fool to waste his time worrying about roberta and left us that was all yes what do you suppose richard meant by being a fool as if seeing the direction his question was taking her she frowned you want me to say that he felt he was being a fool because if roberta died hed get the farm is that what he meant no of course not william rewrote his will shortly after richard returned from the fens richard knew very well that the farm had been left to him not to roberta but if you and william married then the will would most likely have been rewritten once again isnt that true clearly she saw the trap yes buti know what youre thinking it was to richards advantage that william should die before we could marry but isnt that always the case when theres an inheritance involved and people dont generally kill one another just because theyre to inherit something in a will on the contrary mrs odell lynley objected politely people do it all the time that wasnt the case here i just think well that richards not very happy and unhappy people say lots of things that they really dont mean and do lots of things that they wouldnt otherwise do just to try to forget their unhappiness dont they neither lynley nor havers replied at once olivia moved restlessly in her chair outside bridies voice rose as she called to her duck did roberta know about this conversation lynley asked if she did she never mentioned it when she was here she mostly talkedin that lowvoiced way of hersabout the wedding i think she was eager for william and me to marry to have a sister in bridie to have what she once had with gillian she missed her sister dreadfully i dont believe she ever got over gillians running away her nervous fi ngers found a loose thread on the hem of her skirt and she twisted it compulsively until it broke then she looked at it mutely as if wondering how it came to be wrapped round her fi nger bobbathats what william always called her and we did as wellwould take bridie off so that william and i could have time alone she and bridie and whiskers and that duck would go off together can you imagine what they looked like she smiled and smoothed the creases in her skirt theyd go to the river across the common or down to the abbey for a picnic the four of them and then william and i would be able to talk what did you talk about tessa mostly of course it was a problem but the last time he was herethe day of his deathhe said it had fi nally been overcome im not certain that i understand lynley remarked what kind of a problem emotional you mean an unwillingness to come to terms with her death olivia had been looking out the window but she turned to them upon the last word death she asked perplexed tessas not dead inspector she deserted william a short time after roberta was born hed hired a detective to find her so that he could have their marriage annulled by the church and saturday afternoon he came to tell me shed been found at last york the man said and im not obligated to tell you anything more ive yet to be paid for my services you know lynley gripped the telephone in his hand he could feel the anger burning in his chest how does a court order sound he asked pleasantly listen here old chap dont try to pull that kind of shit on me mr houseman may i remind you that in spite of what you may think you are not part of a dashiell hammett novel lynley could just picture the man feet up on his desk a bottle of bourbon in the filing drawer a gun tossed from hand to hand as he balanced the telephone receiver on his shoulder he wasnt too far from the truth harry houseman looked out the grimy window of his office above jackies barber shop in richmonds trinity church square a light rain was falling not enough to clean off his window just enough to emphasise its fi lth what a dreary day he thought hed intended to spend it on a drive to the coasta little lady in whitby was only too eager to do some serious private investigating with himbut this kind of weather didnt put him in the mood and god knows he needed to be in the mood more and more these days before anything happened in the land down under he grinned showing a badly capped front tooth it added a piratical dimension to his otherwise mundane appearance dull brown hair muddycoloured eyes cadaverous skin and the incongruity of full sensual lips he played with a wellchewed pencil on the top of his scarred desk his eyes caught the thinlipped glance of his wifes shrewish face peering moodily out at him from the photograph nearby he reached out with his pencil and toppled it over face down im sure we can reach some sort of mutual agreement houseman said into the phone let me see miss doalson a suitable pause for dramatic effect do i have time today towell cancel that it can certainly wait until i see back to the phone what did you say your name was we arent going to see each other lynley responded patiently youre going to give me the address in york and thats going to be the end of our relationship oh i dont see how i can certainly you do lynleys voice was steel because as you said you havent been paid yet and in order for you ever to get paid once the estate is settledwhich may incidentally take years if we dont get to the bottom of thisyoure going to have to give me tessa teyss address a pause for consideration what is that miss doalson the infuriating voice asked in saccharine tones on the other line well put him off will you a martyred sigh i can see inspector that youre not an easy man to deal with we all have to make a living you know believe me i know lynley replied curtly the address ill just have to find it in my fi les may i give you a ring insay an hour or so no well good god man im on my way to richmond no no that wont be necessary just wait a moment old chap houseman leaned back in his chair eyeing the grey sky for a minute he reached over to his dented filing cabinet opening and closing a few drawers for effect whats that miss doalson he called no put her off till tomorrow will you i dont care if shes weeping buckets sweetheart i dont have time to spend with her today he picked the scrap of memo paper off his desk ah here it is inspector he said and gave lynley the address but dont expect her to welcome you with open arms will you i dont particularly care how she welcomes me mr houseman good oh but you ought to inspector just a bit you know hubby went mad when he heard the news thought hed strangle me right on the spot so god knows what hell do when scotland yard shows up hes one of those scholarly types big words and thick specs but trust me inspector that man is deep theres an animal inside him lynleys eyes narrowed it was a cast upon the waters an expert manoeuvre he wanted to swim past it but admitted defeat what are you talking about what news did he hear the news about hubby number one of course what are you trying to tell me houseman that tessa teys is a bigamist old boy houseman finished with delight married up with number two without seeing to the formal byebyes to our william can you imagine her surprise when i popped up on her doorstep the house wasnt at all what he had expected women who desert husband and children should somehow end up in tenement buildings pungent with the odours of garlic and urine they should daily subdue a bucking quarrelsome conscience with liberal applications of soporific gin they should be faded and worn their looks quite destroyed by the ravages of shame whatever they should be lynley was certain they shouldnt be tessa teys mowrey hed parked in front of the house and they stared at it silently until havers fi nally spoke not exactly gone downhill has she she asked theyd found it easily a new middleclass neighbourhood a few miles from the city centre the kind of place where houses have numbers as well as coy little names the mowreys home was called jorvik view it was the concrete reality of every mediocre dream a facade of brick covered the pouredblock construction red tiles swept up to form steep gables whitecurtained bay windows showed off sitting and dining rooms on either side of a polished front door a singlecar attached garage was topped by a white ironfenced roof terrace and a door opened onto this from the upper floor of the house it was on this terrace that they had their first glimpse of tessa she came out of the door blonde hair blowing lightly in the breeze to water potted plants spider chrysanthemums dahlias and marigolds that made an autumn wall of colour against the white iron she saw the bentley and hesitated watering can poised in midair appearing every bit in the late morning light as if renoir had captured her by surprise and she looked lynley noted grimly not a day older than her photograph taken nineteen years before and religiously enshrined at gembler farm so much for the wages of sin he muttered maybe theres a portrait in the attic havers replied lynley glanced at her in surprise thus far today she had been so markedly diligent about behaving appropriately about cooperating completely and promptly with his every order that to hear her break away from that and say something amusing was a bit of a shock a nice one in fact honours to you sergeant he chuckled lets see what mrs mowrey has to say she met them at the front door looking from one to the other in confusion andwas it veiled just behind the eyesa touch of fear good morning she said down from the roof terrace she looked at least more like a woman approaching middle age but the hair was still sunnyblonde the fi gure slight the skin lightly freckled and virtually unlined lynley showed her his warrant card scotland yard cid may we come in mrs mowrey she looked from lynley to haverss grim face and back again of course her voice was quite even polite and warm but there was a hesitation a rigidity in her movements that suggested strong emotion withheld she led them to the left through an open door that took them into the sitting room where she gestured wordlessly at the furniture beckoning them to sit it was a wellfurnished tasteful room with pieces of a modern design pine and walnut that mingled with subdued autumn colours a clock was ticking somewhere light and rapid like a racing pulse here was none of the riotous disorder of olivia odell nor the mechanical precision of gembler farm rather this room was obviously the gathering place for a congenial family with informal photographs displayed souvenirs of trips and a stack of boxed games and cards shelved among books tessa mowrey chose a chair in the farthest corner where the light was weakest she sat down on its edge her back upright her legs crossed her hands folded in her lap she wore a plain gold wedding band she didnt ask why scotland yard had come calling rather she followed lynley with her eyes as he walked to the mantel and took note of the photographs that were its display your children he asked there were two of them a girl and a boy pictures taken on a family holiday in st ives he recognised the familiar sweep of the bay the grey and white buildings on the shore and the assortment of boats left beached at low tide yes she responded she volunteered nothing else quiescent she awaited the inevitable the silence continued lynley allowed it to do so eventually sheer nervousness compelled her to go on has russell telephoned you there was an edge of despair in her voice it was dullsounding as if shed experienced the full range of grief and there was nothing left in her no depth of emotion to plummet further i thought he might of course its been three weeks id begun to hope he was only punishing me till we sorted everything out she stirred uneasily when sergeant havers took out her notebook oh must you she asked faintly im afraid so lynley replied then ill tell you everything its best she looked down at her hands and tightened their grip on each other odd lynley thought how as members of the same species we inevitably rely on the same set of gestures for our nonverbal signals of distress a hand raised to the throat arms cradling the body protectively a quick adjustment of clothing a flinching to ward off a psychic blow tessa he saw was gathering strength now to get through this ordeal as if one hand could give the other a transfusion of courage through the simple expedient of fi ngers intertwined it seemed to work she looked up her expression defi ant i had just turned sixteen when i married him can you understand what its like to be married to a man eighteen years older than yourself when youre only sixteen of course you cant no one can not even russell you didnt want to stay on in school id planned to but id left school to help on the farm for a few weeks when dads back went bad it was only a temporary arrangement i was supposed to return in a month marsha fitzalan gave me work to do so that i wouldnt fall behind but i fell behind and there was william how do you mean hed come to buy a ram from dad i took him out to see it william wasvery handsome i was romantic he was heathcliff come to claim cathy at last as far as i was concerned surely your father had some concern about his sixteenyearold daughter wanting to marry and to marry a man so much older than herself he did mother as well but i was stubborn and william was responsible respectable and strong i think they believed that if they didnt let me marry him i would turn out wild and go desperately bad in one way or another so they gave their consent and we married what happened to the marriage what does a sixteenyearold girl know about marriage inspector she asked in answer i wasnt even certain how babies got themselves born when i married william youd think a farm girl would have a bit more sense but you have to remember that i spent most of my free time with the brontës charlotte anne and emily were always a bit vague when it came down to the details but i found out quickly enough gillian was born before my seventeenth birthday william was thrilled he adored her it was as if his life began the moment he saw gilly yet a number of years passed before you had a second child thats because gilly changed everything between us how somehow shethis tiny fragile baby made william discover religion and nothing was quite the same after that ive somehow got the impression he was always religious oh no not till gillian it was as if he couldnt quite be a good enough father as if he had to purify his soul to be worthy of a child how did he do it she laughed shortly at the memory but the sound was regretful and unamused the bible confession daily communion within a year of our marriage he became the backbone of st catherines and a devoted father and there you were a teenager trying to live with a baby and a saint thats exactly what it was like except that i didnt have to worry so much about the baby i wasnt quite good enough to care for williams child or perhaps not holy enough because at any rate he mostly cared for her himself what did you do i retreated to my books she had sat nearly motionless through the initial part of their conversation but now she moved restlessly getting up and pacing across the room to look out the bay window where york minster loomed in the distance but instead of the cathedral lynley guessed that tessa saw the past i dreamt that william would become mr darcy i dreamt that mr knightley would sweep me off my feet i hoped that any day i might meet edward rochester if i only believed enough that my dreams were real she crossed her arms in front of her as if that could ward off the pain of that time i wanted desperately to be loved how i wanted to be loved can you possibly understand that inspector who couldnt understand lynley replied i thought that if we had a second child we would each have someone special to love so ii seduced william back to our bed back oh yes back hed left me shortly after gilly was born and had begun to sleep elsewhere on the couch in the sewing room anywhere but with me why he used as an excuse the fact that gillys birth had been so hard on me he didnt want me to become pregnant and go through the torture again there are contraceptives williams catholic inspector there are no contraceptives she turned from the window to face them again the light bled colour from her cheeks effaced eyebrows and lashes and deepened the creases from nose to mouth if she sensed this she made no move to avoid it rather she remained as if willing to allow her age to be exposed she went on but i really think looking back on it that it was sex not conception that frightened william at any rate i got him back to my bed eventually and eight years after gilly roberta was born if you had what you wanteda second baby to lovewhy did you leave because it began again all of it she wasnt mine any more than gillian had been i loved my little girls but i wasnt allowed near them not the way i wanted to be i had nothing although her voice quavered on the last word she drew herself in cradling her body tighter and found control all i had once again was darcy my books so you left i woke up one morning just a few weeks after roberta was born and i knew that if i stayed i would shrivel to nothing i was nearly twentyfive i had two children i wasnt allowed to love and a husband who had begun to consult the bible before dressing in the morning i looked out the window saw the trail leading to high kel moor and knew i would leave that day didnt he try to stop you no of course i wanted him to but he didnt i walked out of the door and out of his life carrying just one valise and thirtyfour pounds i came to york he never came to see you never tried to follow you she shook her head i never told him where i was i just ceased to exist but id ceased to exist so many years before for william that what did it matter why didnt you divorce him because i never intended to marry again i came to york longing for an education not a husband i planned to work for a while to save money to go to london or even emigrate to the states but six weeks after i arrived in york everything changed i met russell mowrey how did you meet she smiled at the memory theyd fenced off part of the city when they began the viking digs yes i recall that russell was a graduate student from london he was part of the excavation team id stuck my head through a bit of a hole in the fence to have a look at the work and there was russell his first words to me were jesus a norse goddess and then he blushed to the roots of his hair i think i fell in love with him then he was twentysix years old he wore spectacles that kept slipping down his nose absolutely filthy trousers and a university jersey when he walked over to speak to me he slipped in the mud and fell directly onto his bottom not much of a darcy lynley said kindly no so much more we were married four weeks later why didnt you tell him about william she knotted her brows appeared to be searching for words that would enable them to understand russell was an innocent he had suchsuch an image of me he saw me as a kind of viking princess a snow queen how could i tell him i had two children and a husband that id left on a farm in the dales what would have changed if hed known nothing i suppose but at the time i believed everything would have i believed that he wouldnt want me if he knew that he wouldnt be willing to wait for me through a divorce id been looking for love inspector and finally here it was could i take a chance that it might escape me but youre only two hours from keldale here were you never worried that william might one day show up in your life even as a chance encounter on the street william never left the dales not once in the years that i knew him he had everything there his children his religion his farm why on earth would he ever come to york besides i thought at first that wed go to london russells family is there id no idea that hed want to settle here but here we stayed we had rebecca five years later then william eighteen months after that william you can imagine how i felt when russell wanted to call him william its his fathers name what could i do but agree and youve been here then for nineteen years yes she replied first in a small fl at in the city centre then a row house near bishopthorpe road and last year we bought this house wedsaved for so long russell worked two jobs and ive my job at the museum as well weve been she blinked back her fi rst tears so happy god so happy until now youve come for me havent you or have you brought me word no ones told you you havent read about it read about it has somethinghe isnt tessa looked from lynley to havers it was obvious that she saw something in their faces for her own face flashed fear before she went on the night russell left he was terribly angry i thought that if only i said nothing did nothing it would work itself out hed come home and lynley suddenly understood that they were talking about two entirely different things mrs mowrey he said do you not know about your husband her eyes widened growing dark with apprehension russell she whispered he left that saturday the investigator found me three weeks ago hes not been home since mrs mowrey lynley said carefully william teys was murdered three weeks ago on saturday night between ten and midnight your daughter roberta was charged with the crime if they had thought she might faint they were wrong she stared at them without speaking for nearly a minute then turned back to the window rebecca will be home soon she said tonelessly she comes home for lunch shell ask about her father she does every day she knows somethings wrong but ive managed to keep most of it from her a trembling hand touched her cheek i know russells gone to london i havent phoned his family because of course i didnt want them to know anything was wrong but i know hes gone to them in london i know do you have a photograph of your husband lynley asked his familys london address she swung on him he wouldnt she cried passionately this is a man who has never lifted his hand to strike one of his own children he was angryyes ive said that but his anger was with me not with william he wouldnt have gone he couldnt have she began to cry horribly shedding what were probably her first tears in three agonising weeks pressing her forehead against the window glass she wept bitterly as if she would never be consoled havers got to her feet and left the room good god where is she going lynley wondered halfexpecting a repeat of her disappearing act in the pub last night but she returned moments later with a pitcher of orange juice and a glass thank you barbara he said she nodded shot him a diffi dent smile and poured the woman a glass of the liquid tessa mowrey took it but rather than drink she clutched it as if it were a talisman rebecca mustnt see me like this ive got to pull myself together must be stronger than this she saw the glass in her hand took a sip and grimaced i cant abide tinned orange juice why do i have it in the house oh russell says that its not that bad i suppose it isnt really when she turned back to lynley she looked he saw every single day of her fortythree years he did not kill william thats what everyone in keldale says of roberta she flinched i dont think of her as my daughter im sorry i never knew her shes been placed in a mental asylum mrs mowrey when william was found she claimed to have killed him then if shes admitted to the crime why have you come to see me if she says she killed william then certainly russell her voice drifted off it was as if she had suddenly heard her own words and realised how eager she was to trade daughter for husband he could hardly blame her lynley thought of the barn stall the ornate bible the photograph albums the cool silence of the melancholy house did you never see gillian again he asked abruptly waiting for a sign the smallest indication that tessa knew of gillians disappearance there was none never she never contacted you in any way of course not even if shed wanted to william wouldnt have allowed it im sure probably not thought lynley but once she ran off once she cut the ties with her father why had she not sought her mother then religious fanatic havers declared decisively she shoved her hair back behind her ears and gave her attention to the photograph she held but this ones not half bad she did okay on her second time round too bad she didnt bother with a divorce russell mowrey smiled up at her from the photograph tessa had given them he was a nicelooking man in a threepiece suit wife on his arm easter sunday havers put it in the manila folder and gave herself back to the passing scenery at least we know why gillian left because of the fathers religion thats the way i see it havers replied obviously a combination of that and the second baby there shed been for eight years the centre of her fathers lifemum doesnt appear to have counted for muchwhen all of a sudden a new baby arrives its supposed to be mummys but dad doesnt trust mummy to do right by her children so he takes this one over as well mummy leaves and gillian follows not exactly havers she waited eight years to go wherever she went well you cant expect her to have run off when she was eight years old she bided her time probably hating little roberta every second for stealing her dad that doesnt make sense first you say that gillian left because she couldnt abide her fathers religious fanaticism then you say she left because shed lost his love to roberta now what is it she either loves him and wants to be his favourite again or she cant abide his religious devotion and feels she has to escape you cant have it both ways its not black and white havers protested loudly these things never are lynley glanced at her amazed by the affront in her voice her stubby features looked like paste barbara im sorry dammit im doing it all over again why do i bother im no good at this i always do it i never barbara he interrupted fi rmly she stared straight ahead yes sir were discussing the case not arguing before a bar of justice its fine to have an opinion i want you to in fact ive always found it extremely helpful to talk a case over with someone but it was more than that really it was arguing laughing hearing the sweet voice say oh you think youre right tommy but i shall prove you wrong he felt loneliness settle on him like a cold wet shroud havers moved restlessly in her seat with no music playing the tension was screaming to be heard i dont know what it is she said at last i get into the fray and forget what im doing i understand he let the matter drop his eyes following the meandering pattern that the stone walls made on the hillside across the dale from the road on which they travelled he thought about tessa he knew that he was trying to understand her and that he was illequipped to do so nothing in his life of cornwall and howenstow of oxford and belgravia even of scotland yard explained the paucity of experience of life on a remote farm that would drive a girl of sixteen to believe that her only future lay in immediate marriage and yet surely that was the foundation of what had happened no romantic interpretation of the facts at handno reflections upon heathcliff no matter how aptcould hide the real explanation the drudgery and sheer ennui of those weeks when she had been forced to stay home and help out had made an otherwise simple yorkshire farmer look arresting by comparison thus she merely moved from one trap into another married at sixteen a mother before her seventeenth birthday wouldnt any woman have wanted to escape such a life yet if that was the case why marry again in such a hurry havers broke into his thoughts an underlying note of urgency in her voice made lynley glance at her curiously tiny beads of sweat stood out on her forehead she swallowed noisily what i cant see is thetessas shrine the woman walks out on himnot that she didnt appear to have every right to and he sets up a virtual taj mahal of photographs in a corner of the sitting room it suddenly dawned on lynley how do we know william set up the shrine havers came to her own quick terms with the knowledge either of the girls could have done it she responded who do you imagine it had to be gillian as a bit of revenge a little daily reminder to william that mummyd run off a little knife inserted between the ribs since hed started to favour roberta bet on it sir havers agreed they drove on for several miles before lynley spoke again she could have done it havers something tells me she was desperate enough tessa dyou mean russell was gone that night she says she took aspirin and went directly to bed but no one can verify it she could have gone to keldale why kill the dog he wouldnt have known her he wasnt there nineteen years ago who was tessa to him a stranger but decapitate her first husband havers frowned would have been easier to divorce him id think no not for a catholic even so russells a better candidate if you ask me who knows where he went when lynley didnt reply she added sir i lynley hesitated studying the road ahead tessas right hes gone to london how can you be certain of that because i think i saw him havers at the yard so he did go to turn her in i suppose she knew all along that he would no i dont think so havers offered a new thought well then theres ezra lynley flashed her a smile william in his jimjams in the middle of the road ripping up ezras watercolours while ezra curses him to hell and back we could have a motive for murder there i dont think an artist would take lightly to having someone rip up his work havers opened her mouth stopped she reflected for a moment but it wasnt his pyjamas yes it was it wasnt it was his dressing gown remember nigel said his legs reminded him of a gorilla so what was he doing in his dressing gown it was still light out it wasnt time for bed changing for dinner i dare say hes up in his room looks out the window sees ezra trespassing and comes charging into the yard i suppose that could be it what else exercising perhaps deep knee bends in his underwear thats hard to picture orperhaps with olivia lynley smiled not if everything weve heard about him is true william sounds to me like a strictly aftermarriage man i dont think hed try any funny business with olivia beforehand what about nigel parrish what about him walking the dog back to the farm out of the goodness of his heart like a cardcarrying member of the rspca doesnt that whole story seem a bit off to you it does but do you really think parrish would want to get his hands dirty with a bit of william teyss blood not to mention his head rolling across the stall fl oor to be honest he seems the type to faint at the sight they laughed a fi rst shared communication it dropped almost immediately into an uncomfortable silence at the sudden realisation that they could become friends the decision to go to barnstingham mental asylum grew out of lynleys belief that roberta held all the cards in the current game they were playing the identity of the murderer the motive behind the crime and the disappearance of gillian teys hed stopped an hour out of york to make the arrangements by telephone and now pulling the car to a stop on the gravel drive in front of the building he turned to barbara cigarette he offered his gold case no sir thank you he nodded glanced at the imposing building then back at her rather wait here sergeant he asked as he lit his cigarette with the silver lighter he took a few moments about replacing all the impedimenta of his habit she watched him with speculative eyes why he shrugged casually too casually she noted you look fagged out i thought you might want a bit of a rest fagged out it was his publicschoolfop act shed begun to notice how he used it occasionally to serve the need of the moment hed dropped it earlier why was he picking it up now if were talking about exhaustion inspector you look just about ready to drop whats up he examined himself in the mirror at her words his cigarette dangling from his lips his eyes narrowed against the smoke part sam spade part algernon moncrieff i do look a sight he busied himself about his appearance for a moment straightening his tie examining his hair brushing at nonexistent lint on the lapels of his jacket she waited finally he met her eyes the fop as well as the other personae was gone the farm upset you a bit yesterday he said frankly i have an idea that what well find in here is going to be a hell of a lot worse than the farm for a moment she couldnt take her eyes from his but she pressed her hand to the door and flung it open i can deal with it sir she said abruptly and got out into the brisk autumn air weve kept her confined dr samuels was saying to lynley as they walked down the transverse passage that ran straight through the building from east to west barbara followed behind them relieved to find that barnstingham was not exactly what she had pictured when she first heard the words mental asylum it was really not very hospitallike at all an english baroque building laid out on crossaxes they had entered through a front hall that rose two storeys with fluted pilasters standing on plinths against the walls light and colour were the operative words here for the room was painted a calming shade of peach the decorative plasterwork was white the anklethick carpeting was merely a shade off rust and while the portraits were dark and moody of the flemish school their subjects managed to look suitably apologetic about the fact all this was a relief for when lynley had first mentioned the need to see roberta to come to this place barbara had become quite faint that old insidious panic setting in lynley had seen it of course damn the man he didnt miss a trick now that she was inside the building she felt steadier a feeling that improved once they left the great central hall and began their journey down the passage here conviviality expressed itself in soothing constable landscapes and vases of fresh flowers and quiet voices in the air the sound of music and singing came from a distance the choir dr samuels explained here its just this way samuels himself had been a secondary source of both surprise and relief outside the walls of the hospital barbara wouldnt have known he was a psychiatrist psychiatrist somehow conjured up images of freud a bearded victorian face a cigar and those speculative eyes but samuels had the look of a man who was more at home on horseback or hiking across the moors than probing disturbed psyches he was wellbuilt loose limbed and clean shaven with a tendency barbara guessed to be less than patient with anyone whose intelligence did not match his own he was probably the devil on a tennis court as well shed begun to feel quite at ease with the hospital when dr samuels opened a narrow doorfunny how it had been concealed by some panellingand led them into the new wing of the building this was the locked ward looking and smelling exactly as barbara had supposed a locked ward would the carpeting was a very dark serviceable brown the walls were the colour of sunbaked sand unadorned and broken only by doors into which small windows were set at eye level the air was filled with that medicinal smell of antiseptics and detergents and drugs and it was cut by a low moaning that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere it could have been the wind it could have been anything here it is she told herself the place for psychos for girls who decapitate daddies for girls who murder lots of things are murder barb theres been absolutely nothing since her original statement dr samuels was saying to lynley shes not catatonic shes merely said what she intends to say i think he glanced at the clipboard he was carrying i did it im sorry on the day the body was found shes not spoken since theres no medical cause shes been examined dr samuels lips tightened in offence it was clear that this scotland yard intrusion bordered on insult and if he had to impart information it would be minimal at best shes been examined he said no seizure no stroke she can speak she chooses not to if he was bothered by the clipped nature of the doctors response lynley didnt let it show he was used to encountering attitudes like the psychiatrists attitudes proclaiming that the police were antagonists to be thwarted rather than allies to be helped he slowed his steps and told dr samuel about robertas cache of food this at least caught the mans attention when he next spoke his words walked the line between frustration and deeper thought i dont know what to tell you inspector the food could as you guess be a compulsion it could be a stimulus or a response it could be a source of gratification or a form of sublimation until robertas willing to give us something to go on it could be damn well anything lynley shifted to another area why did you take her from the richmond police isnt that a bit irregular not when the responsible partys signed her in dr samuels replied were a private hospital the responsible party was that superintendent nies samuels shook his head impatiently not at all we dont take people at random from the police he scanned robertas chart it waslet me see wheregibson richard gibson he names himself as her closest relative hes the one who got the court to agree and filled out the paperwork richard gibson thats the name on the form inspector samuels replied tersely hes signed her in for treatment pending the trial shes in therapy daily theres no progress yet but that isnt to say there never will be any but why would gibson lynley was speaking more to himself than the other two but samuels went on perhaps in the assumption that he was being addressed shes his cousin after all and the sooner shes better the sooner the trial that is unless shes proven incompetent to stand trial at all and in that case lynley fi nished his eyes fixed grimly on the doctors face shes in for life isnt she until she recovers samuels led them up to a heavy locked door shes just in here its unfortunate that she has to be alone but considering the circumstances he gestured with his hands unlocked the door and swung it open roberta youve visitors he said hed chosen prokofi evromeo and juliet and the music had begun almost immediately when he started the car thank god barbara thought brokenly thank god let the music of violins cellos and violas drive thought away drive memory away drive everything completely irreversibly away so that there is no existence but that of audition so that she neednt think of the girl in the room and even more frightening of the man in the car even staring steadfastly ahead she could still see his hands on the wheel could see the gold hair on themlighter even than the hair on his headcould see each finger note its movement as he guided the car back to keldale when he leaned forward to make an adjustment in the sound she could see his profi le he was very lightly tanned gold and brown skin hair and eyes straight classical nose the fi rm line of jaw a face that spoke clearly of tremendous inner strength of resources of character that she couldnt comprehend how had he done it shed been by a window not looking out but rather staring fixedly at the wall a lummox of a girl nearly six feet tall who must have weighed well over fifteen stone she sat on a stool her back hunched over in an arc of defeat and she rocked roberta my name is thomas lynley ive come to talk to you about your father the rocking continued the eyes looked at nothing saw nothing if she heard at all she gave absolutely no sign her hair was filthy foulsmelling it was pulled back from her broad moonshaped face with an elastic band but greasy tendrils had escaped imprisonment and hung forward stiffl y kissing on her neck the pockets of fl esh that encased in their folds the incongruous ornament of a single slender gold chain father hart came to london roberta hes asked us to help you he says he knows you didnt hurt anyone nothing the broad face was expressionless suppurating pimples covered cheeks and chin bloated skin stretched over layers of fat that had long ago erased whatever defi nition her features might have had she was doughlike grey and unclean weve been talking to a great many people in keldale weve seen your cousin richard and olivia and bridie bridie cut her hair roberta shes made quite a mess of it unfortunately in an effort to look like the princess of wales her mother was quite upset about it she said how good you always were to bridie no response roberta was dressed in a tooshort skirt that revealed white fl abby thighs upon which the flesh dotted by red pustules quivered when she rocked there were hospital slippers on her feet but they were too small and her sausage toes hung out their uncut nails curling around them weve been to the house have you read all those books stepha odell said that youd read them all we were amazed at how many you have we saw the pictures of your mother roberta she was lovely wasnt she silence her arms hung at her sides her enormous breasts strained against the cheap material of her blouse its buttons struggled to hold the thin garment closed as the pressure of the rocking continued each movement causing the flesh to heave to and fro in a rebarbative pavane i think this may be a bit difficult for you to hear roberta but we saw your mother today do you know that she lives in york you have another brother and sister there she told us how much your father loved you and gillian the movement ceased the face neither acknowledged nor changed but the tears began they were silent ugly rivers of mute pain dipping and plunging through the crevices of fat climbing the peaks of acne with the tears came the mucus it began its descent from her nose in a slimy cord touched her lips and crawled onto her chin lynley squatted before her he removed a snowy handkerchief from his pocket and wiped her face clean he took her pulpy lifeless hand in his own and pressed it fi rmly roberta there was no response ill find gillian he stood folded the elegant monogrammed linen square and returned it to his pocket what had webberly said barbara thought theres a lot you might learn from working with lynley and now she knew she couldnt look at him she couldnt meet his eyes she knew what would be there and the thought of its existence in this man she had been determined to believe was an absolute fop of an upperclass snob chilled her entirely he was supposed to be the man who danced in nightclubs who dispensed sexual favours laughter and good cheer who moved effortlessly in a giltedged world of money and privilege but he was not supposed to benever supposed to bethe man she had seen today hed stepped neatly out of the mould shed created and destroyed it without a backward glance she had to fit him back into it somehow if she didnt the fires within her that for so many years had kept her alive would be swiftly extinguished and then she knew well she would die in the cold that was the thought that carried her to keldale longing to fly from his presence but when the bentley made the final turn into the village she knew immediately that there would be no quick escape for nigel parrish and another man were having a violent quarrel upon the bridge directly in the path of the car organ music seemed to be blasting from the very trees it swelled to crescendoes faded and roared out again a baroque combination of chords rests and flourishes that made lynley think that at any moment the phantom himself would come swinging down from the opera chandeliers at the appearance of the bentley the two men parted the one shouting a final violent imprecation at nigel parrish before he stalked off in the direction of the high street i think ill have a word with our nigel lynley remarked no need for you to come havers go have a bit of a rest i can certainly thats an order sergeant damn him yes sir lynley waited until havers had disappeared into the lodge before he walked back across the bridge to the strange little cottage that sat on the far side of the common it was he thought a more than curious structure the front of the building was trellissed by late roses unrestrained they spread out like an encroaching wilderness towards the narrow windows on either side of the door they climbed the wall crowned the lintel majestically and travelled upward to begin their glory on the roof they were a solid blanket of disturbing colourblood redand they fl ooded the air with a scent so rich as to be virtually miasmal the entire effect was one step short of obscene nigel parrish had already retreated inside and lynley followed him pausing in the open doorway to survey the room the source of the music that continued to soar round them was a speaker system that beggared belief enormous amplifiers sat in all four corners creating at the centre a vortex of sound other than an organ a tape recorder a receiver and a turntable there was nothing in the room save a threadbare carpet and a few old chairs parrish switched off the tape recorder that had been the source of the sound he rewound the tape removed it from the machine and replaced it in its container he took his time about it all giving every movement a precision which told lynley that he knew very well that the other man was standing at the door it was nonetheless a nice performance mr parrish a start of surprise a swift turn a welcoming smile breaking over the features but he couldnt hide the fact that his hands were shaking as lynley saw this so apparently did parrish for he stuffed them into the pockets of his tweed trousers inspector a social call i hope sorry you had to come upon that little scene with ezra ah so that was ezra yes honeyhaired honeytongued little ezra dear boy thought artistic licence gave him access to my back garden to study the light on the river can you imagine such cheek here i was finetuning my psyche with bach when i glanced out the window and saw him setting up shop blast his pretty little heart its a bit late in the afternoon to be setting up for a painting lynley remarked he wandered to the window neither the river nor the garden could be seen from the room he reflected on the nature of parrishs lie well who knows what goes on in the minds of these great magicians of the paintbrush parrish said lightly didnt whistler paint the thames in the middle of the night im not sure ezra farmingtons in whistlers league lynley watched parrish take out a packet of cigarettes and struggle to light one with fingers that wouldnt cooperate he crossed the room and offered the flame of his lighter parrishs eyes met his and then hid themselves behind a thin veil of smoke thanks he said beastly little scene well i havent welcomed you to rose cottage a drink no i hope you dont mind if i indulge he disappeared into an adjoining room glass rattled there was a long pause followed by the sounds of bottles and glassware again parrish emerged a respectable inch of whisky in a tumbler his second or third lynley speculated why do you drink at the dove and whistle the question caught parrish off guard do sit down inspector i need to and the thought of you towering over me like nemesis himself makes me positively limp with fear it was an excellent stall tactic lynley thought but two could play at that game he walked over to the stereo and took his time over an inventory of parrishs tapes a considerable collection of bach chopin verdi vivaldi and mozart with an adequate representation of modernists as well parrish indulged a wide range of musical tastes he concluded he crossed the room to one of the heavy stuffed chairs and meditated on the black oak beams that spanned the ceiling why do you live in this village in the middle of nowhere a man with your musical taste and talent would obviously be happier in a more cosmopolitan environment wouldnt he parrish laughed shortly he smoothed a hand over his perfectly combed hair i think i like the other question better have i choice on which one to answer the holy grail is only round the corner but you walk to the other end of the village onwhat was ityour tired old legs to drink in the other pub on st chads lane whats the attraction absolutely nothing well i could say its hannah but i doubt if youd believe me the truth is i prefer the doves atmosphere theres something unholy about getting roaring drunk just opposite a church isnt there avoiding someone at the holy grail lynley asked avoiding parrishs eyes slipped from lynley to the window a fullheaded rose was kissing the glass with enormous lips the petals had begun to curl back stigma style anther and filament had blackened it should have been picked it would die soon good heavens no whom would i avoid father hart perhaps or the dear deceased william he and the priest used to tipple a few once or twice a week there you didnt care much for teys did you no not much holierthanthous have never been in my line i dont know how olivia abided the man perhaps she wanted a father for bridie perhaps god knows the child could use some parental influence even dour old william was probably better than nothing liv is hopeless with her id take it on myself but to be frank i dont much care for children and i dont like ducks at all but youre close to olivia anyway parrishs eyes showed nothing i went to school with her husband paul what a man he was riproaring goodtime paul he died four years ago is that correct parrish nodded huntingtons chorea at the end he didnt even recognise his wife it was horrible for everyone changed everyones life to see him die that way he blinked several times and gave his attention to his cigarette and then to his fi ngernails they were well manicured lynley noted the man went on with another bright smile it was his defensive weapon his way of denying any emotion that might seep through the surface of his thinshelled indifference i suppose the next question is where was i on the fatal night id love to trot out an alibi for you inspector in bed with the village tart would be nice but im afraid that i didnt know our blessed william would encounter an axe that evening so i sat here playing my organ quite alone but i must clear myself mustnt i so i suppose i should say that anyone who heard me could verify the story like today perhaps parrish ignored the question and fi nished off his drink then when i was done i skipped off to bed again unfortunately very much alone how long have you lived in keldale mr parrish ah back to the original thought are we let me see it must be nearly seven years before that before that inspector i lived in york i was a music teacher at a prep school and no if youre going to go delving into my past for tasty little items i was not dismissed i left by choice i wanted the country i wanted some peace his voice rose slightly on the last word lynley got to his feet let me give you some now good evening to you as he left the cottage the music resumed muted this timebut not before the discordant noise of glass breaking on stone told him the manner in which nigel parrish celebrated his departure i hope you dont mind but ive booked you into keldale hall for dinner stepha odell said she cocked her bright head to one side and regarded lynley thoughtfully yes i think i did just the right thing you look as if you need that tonight am i becoming gaunt before your eyes she closed a ledger and shelved it behind the reception desk not at all the foods excellent of course but that isnt why ive booked you there the hall is one of our biggest diversions its run by the local eccentric you have everything here dont you she laughed all the pleasures that life affords inspector would you like a drink or are you still on duty i wouldnt say no to a pint of odells good she led him into the lounge and busied herself behind the bar keldale hall is run by the burtonthomas family i use that last word quite loosely of course mrs burtonthomas has half a dozen or more young people working for her and she stubbornly insists that they all call her auntie its part of the cloud of eccentricity in which she likes to move i should imagine sounds a dickensian group lynley remarked she pushed his ale across the bar and pulled a smaller one for herself just wait till you meet them and meet them you shall for mrs burtonthomas always takes dinner with her guests when i rang her to book you in she was beside herself with the idea of scotland yard dining at her table no doubt shell poison someone just to see you at work the pickings are going to be rather slim however she said she has only two couples there now an american dentist and two hoochiesmoochie types to use her expression it sounds just the kind of evening im longing for he walked to the window glass in hand and looked down the winding lane that was keldale abbey road he couldnt see much of it for it curved to the right and disappeared into the dusk stepha came to join him they didnt speak for some moments i expect youve seen roberta she said gently at last he turned thinking to find her watching him but she wasnt instead her eyes were on the glass of ale she held she turned it slowly in the palm of her hand as if all her concentration were centred on its balance and the total necessity of not spilling a drop how did you know she was quite tall as a child i remember almost as tall as gillian a big girl with a hand dampened by the moisture of the glass she brushed a few hairs from her brow her fingers left a misty streak on her skin she rubbed it off impatiently it happened quite slowly inspector first she was just filled outchubby i suppose then she waswhat you saw today the shudder that passed through her body spoke volumes and as if she realised what her reaction implied she went on thats horrible of me isnt it i have rather a despicable aversion to ugliness frankly i dont much like that about myself but you didnt answer me i didnt what did you ask how you knew id seen roberta a dull flash crept into stephas cheeks she shifted her weight from one foot to the other and looked so illatease that lynley was sorry he had pressed her it doesnt matter he said its just thatyou look a bit different than you did this morning more weighted down and there are lines at the corners of your mouth the flush deepened on her beautiful skin they werent there before i see so i wondered if youd seen her but you knew without asking yes i suppose i did and i wondered how you can bear to look at the ugliness of other peoples lives as you do ive done it for some years one gets used to it stepha the big man strangled as he sat at his desk the dirty girl dead with the needle in her arm the savage mutilation of a young mans corpse did one ever really get used to mans dark side her eyes met his with surprising directness but surely it must be like looking at hell a bit then have you never wanted to run from it run away madly in the other direction never not once one cant run forever she turned from him moving her eyes back to the window i can she murmured a sharp rap on the door caused barbara to stub out her third cigarette she looked around in a panic opened the window and rushed to the lavatory where she flushed the incriminating evidence down the toilet a second rap and lynleys voice called her name she went to the door he hesitated glancing over her shoulder curiously before he spoke ah havers he said apparently miss odell has seen fi t to find us a more edible repast this evening shes booked us into keldale hall he consulted his watch in an hour what barbara cried out in involuntary horror i haventi canti dont think lynley raised an eyebrow please dont go all helen on me and say youve nothing to wear havers but i havent she protested you go alone ill get something at the dove and whistle considering your reaction to last nights fare do you think thats wise a blow below the belt blast him i dont care much for chicken i never have wonderful i understand the cook at the hall is a bit of a gourmet i doubt if anything with feathers will even put in an appearance unless of course hannahs waiting on tables but i simply cant its an order havers in an hour he turned on his heel damn him she slammed the door loud enough to signal her displeasure wonderful what an evening to look forward to fumbling aimlessly with sixteen pieces of silverware wineglasses everywhere waiters and waitresses removing knives and forks before one even had a chance to decide what to do with them chicken and peas at the dove and whistle sounded like heaven compared to that she stomped to the wardrobe and yanked it open divine now what shall it be for an evening of mingling elegantly with society the brown tweed skirt and matching pullover the jeans and hiking boots what about the blue suit to remind him of helen ha who could ever remind him of helen with her impeccable wardrobe her wellcut hair her manicured hands her lyrical voice she yanked a white wool shirtwaist from the wardrobe and tossed it onto the rumpled bed it really was almost amusing would people actually think she was his date apollo taking medusa to dine how would he handle the stares and the gibes one hour later as good as his word he knocked on her door she looked in the mirror her stomach churning oh god the dress was awful she resembled a whitegarbed barrel with legs she jerked open the door and glared at him furiously he was dressed to the absolute teeth do you always carry clothes like that around with you she demanded incredulous just like the boy scouts he smiled shall we go he escorted her gallantly down the stairs and into the night where he opened the car door for her and tucked her within the tooled leather comfort of the bentley the born gentleman she thought derisively on automatic pilot get him into his lord of the manor outfit and forget scotland yard as if he read her mind he turned to her before starting the car havers id like to give the case a rest for the evening what on earth would they have to talk about if the murder of teys was going to be taboo all right she replied brusquely he nodded and turned the ignition key the big car purred to life i love this part of england he said as they set off down keldale abbey road you havent been told that im an unabashed yorkist have you a yorkist the war of roses were deep in their country now sheriff huttons not far from here and middlehams practically within shouting distance oh wonderful a discourse on history her entire knowledge of the war of roses began and ended with the confl icts name naturally i know ones really obliged to think badly of the yorks they did after all do away with henry vi he tapped his fi ngers reflectively against the wheel except i can never help thinking that there was a justice in that pomfret and all richard ii being murdered by his very own cousin killing henry seems to have closed the circle of the crime she pleated the white dress between her fi ngers and sighed defeated look sir im no good at this sort of thing iwell id do much better at the dove and whistle if youd please just barbara he pulled abruptly to the verge he was looking at her she knew but she stared ahead into the darkness and counted the moths that danced in the cars headlamps would you just for an evening be what you are whatever you are whats that supposed to mean god how shrewish she sounded it means that you may drop the act or at least that i wish you would what act just be what you are how dare you why do you pretend not to smoke he interrupted why do you pretend to be such a public school fop she hadnt intended the words to be so shrill at first as if evaluating her comment he didnt respond there was silence then he threw back his head and laughed touché shall we call a truce for the rest of the evening and go on despising each other with the dawn she glared at him a moment then in spite of herself smiled she knew she was being manipulated but it didnt seem to matter all right she said reluctantly but she noticed that neither of them had answered the others question they were welcomed into keldale hall by a woman who put to rest every sartorial fear of barbaras that lynley had not been able to assuage she was dressed in a motheaten skirt of indeterminate colour a gypsy blouse decorated with stars and a beaded shawl that she had slung round her shoulders like an indian blanket her grey hair was gathered tightly into two elastic bands one on each side of her neck and to complete the ensemble she had perched an elaborate tortoiseshell spanish comb on the top of her head scotland yard she asked and looked lynley over with a critical eye god they didnt package em that way when i was young she laughed uproariously come in were a small party tonight but youve saved me from murder hows that lynley asked ushering barbara ahead of him ive an american couple that id love to kill but well leave that youll understand soon enough were gathered in here she led them across the massive stone hall scented with the assorted meats that were roasting in the kitchen nearby i havent breathed a word that youre scotland yard she confi ded loudly shouldering her beadwork back into place when you meet the watsons youll know why on through the dining room where candlelight was casting shadows on the walls a linencovered table was set with china and silver the other couple are newlyweds londoners i like em dont paw each other in public the way so many newlyweds do very quiet very sweet i expect they dont like to draw attention to themselves because the mans crippled wife is a lovely little creature though barbara heard lynleys swift intake of breath behind her his steps slowed and then stopped altogether who are they he asked hoarsely mrs burtonthomas turned around at the entrance to the oak hall name of allcourtst james she threw open the door heres more company for us she announced barbara was intensely aware of the photographic quality of the scene a fi re burned brilliantly hissing as the flames devoured the coal comfortable chairs were gathered round it at the far end of the room touched by shadows deborah st james was bent over a piano leafing through a family album with delight she looked up with a smile the men rose to their feet and the picture froze lord lynley whisperedprayer curse resignation at his tone barbara looked at him and it came with a sudden jolt of recognition how ridiculous that she hadnt seen it before lynley was in love with the other mans wife hi there thats kuva nicelookin suit hank watson said he extended his hand to lynley it was fat slightly sweaty like shaking hands with a warm uncooked fi sh dentistry he announced here for the ada convention in london tax writeoff to the sky this is jojo my wife somehow the introductions were muddled through champagne before dinner is my rule mrs burtonthomas said before breakfast as well if i have my way danny bring the juice she shouted in the general direction of the doorway and a few moments later a girl came into the room burdened with an ice bucket champagne and glasses what linea work you in fella hank asked lynley as the glasses went around i thought si here was some sorta college professor type gave me the jumping heehaws when he said he was a deadbody man sergeant havers and i work for scotland yard lynley responded sayhey jojobean did you hear that woman he looked at lynley with new interest you here on the baby gig the baby gig threeyearold case guess the trails kinda cold now hank winked in the direction of danny who was putting the bottle of champagne into the bucket of ice dead baby in the abbey you know lynley didnt know anything didnt want to know anything he couldnt have answered if his life depended upon it he found that he didnt know what to do with himself where to cast his eyes what to say he was only conscious of deborah were here on the decapitation gig havers responded politely miraculously decapitation hank crowed this is one jumping area of the country dont you think so bean sure is his wife said nodding in solemn affirmation she fingered the long strand of white beads she wore and looked hopefully in the direction of the silent st jameses hank hunched forward in his chair dragging it closer to lynleys well give us the poop he demanded i beg your pardon the poop the verifi ed certifi ed poop hank slapped the arm of lynleys chair who did it fella he demanded it was too much the appalling little man screwing his face up in excitement was too much to bear he was wearing a saffron polyester suit a matching shirt in a fl oral print and round his neck hung a heavy gold chain with a medallion that danced on the thick hair of his chest a diamond the size of a walnut glittered on his finger and he fl ashed white teeth made even whiter by his burntsienna tan his bulbous nose flexed its nostrils blackly were not entirely sure lynley replied seriously but you fi t the description hank stared at him bugeyed i fit the description he croaked then he peered at lynley closely and broke into a grin damn you brits i just cant get the hang of your humour but im gettin better right si lynley finally looked at his friend and found him smiling amusement danced in st jamess eyes absolutely si replied as they drove in the darkness back to the lodge barbara studied lynley furtively realising that until this evening it had been entirely unthinkable to her that a man such as he could ever have been unsuccessful in love yet here on the outskirts of the village was the undeniable evidence of that fact deborah there had been at the hall a horrified moment with the three of them staring at one another before she had come forward a tentative smile on her face a hand outstretched in greeting tommy whatever are you doing in keldale deborah st james had asked hed been at an absolute loss barbara saw it and intervened an investigation she replied then the horrible little american had thrown himself into their midstit was a merciful intervention reallyand the other three began to breathe evenly once more still st james had remained in his place by the fire greeting his friend politely but making no other movement his eyes for the most part following his wife if he was concerned about lynleys unexpected arrival if jealousy stirred in him at the mans blatant feelings his face betrayed nothing of the two deborah had been more obviously distressed her colour was high her hands had clasped and unclasped repeatedly in her lap her eyes had moved restlessly between the two men and she hadnt concealed her relief when lynley suggested their departure at the earliest opportunity after the meals conclusion now he was pulling the car in front of the lodge and switching off the ignition he leaned back and rubbed his eyes i feel as if i could sleep for a year how do you suppose mrs burtonthomas is going to get rid of that dreadful dentist arsenic he laughed shell have to do something he was talking as if staying another month were the dearest thing to his heart what an appalling man not exactly the sort one wants to run into on a honeymoon she admitted she wondered if he would pick up the conversational thread if he would say anything about st james and deborah and the awkward coincidence that had flung them into his path indeed she wondered further if he would say anything at all about how he had come to position himself on the worst possible side of this unusual love triangle instead of replying however he got out of the car and slammed the door barbara watched him shrewdly as he came to her side not a ripple appeared on the surface of his calm he was in firm control if anything at all the fop was back the lodge door opened and a square of light framed stepha odell i thought i heard your car she said youve a visitor inspector deborah gazed at her reflection in the mirror hed said absolutely nothing since coming into their room merely walking over to the fire and sitting in the chair the brandy glass in his hand shed watched him not sure what to say afraid to penetrate the wall of his sudden isolation dont go that way simon shed wanted to shout dont cut yourself off from me dont go back to that darkness but how could she say it and risk having tommy thrown up in her face she ran the water into the bathroom basin and dismally watched its flow what was he thinking alone in that room was he haunted by tommy did he wonder if she closed her eyes when they made love so she could dream of him he never once had asked he never once had questioned he simply accepted whatever she said whatever she gave so what could she say or give to him now with her past and tommys between them she splashed her face repeatedly dried it turned off the water and forced herself to walk back into the bedroom her heart sank when she saw that hed gone to bed his heavy leg brace lay on the floor near the chair and his crutches leaned against the wall next to the bed the room was dark but in the dying light of the fire she saw that he was still awake sitting up in fact with the pillows behind him watching the glow of the embers she walked to the bed and sat down im in a welter she said he felt for her hand i know ive been sitting here trying to think how i might help you but i dont know what to do i hurt him simon i never intended to but it happened all the same and i cant seem to forget it when i see him i feel so responsible for his pain i want to make it go away ii suppose id feel better then less guilty about it all he touched her cheek and traced the line of her jaw if it were only that easy my love you cant make it go away you cant help him hes got to do it alone but its hard because hes in love with you and the fact that youre wearing a wedding ring doesnt change that deborah simon he wouldnt let her finish what bothers me is seeing the effect he has on you i see your guilt i want to take it away and i dont know how i wish that i did i dont like to see you feeling so wretched she searched his face finding comfort and peace in the familiar battle of its lines and angles utterly unhandsome a catalogue of agonies lived through and conquered and lived through again her heart swelled with love for him her throat tightened with the emotions sudden intensity have you actually been sitting in this darkness worried about me how like you simon why do you say that what did you think i was doing tormenting yourself withthings in the past ah he drew her into his arms resting his cheek on the top of her head i wont lie to you deborah its not easy for me knowing that tommy was your lover if it had been some other man i could have attributed to him all sorts of faults to convince myself that he wasnt worthy of you but thats not the case is it he is a good man he does deserve you and no one knows that better than i so you are haunted by it i thought as much not haunted not at all his fingers moved lightly down her hair to caress her throat and slip the nightdress from her shoulders i was at first ill admit that but frankly the very first time we made love i realised that i never had to think of you and tommy again if i didnt want to and now she could feel his smile every time i look at you im reminded most decidedly of the present not the past and then i find that i want to undress you breathe the fragrance of your skin kiss your mouth and breasts and thighs in fact the distractions becoming quite a problem in my life in mine as well then perhaps my love he whispered we should concentrate all our energies on seeking a solution her hand slid under the covers he caught his breath at her touch thats a good beginning he admitted and brought his mouth to hers the visitor was superintendent nies he was waiting in the lounge three empty pint glasses on a table nearby and a cardboard carton at his feet he was standing not sitting a man wary and watchful and never relaxed his lips thinned at the sight of lynley and his nostrils pinched as if he smelled something foul he was contempt personified you wanted everything inspector he snapped here it is he gave the carton a sharp kick not so much to move it as to direct the other mans attention to it no one stirred it was as if the raw hatred behind niess words immobilised them all next to her barbara felt lynleys tension tightening his muscles like a whipcord his face however was without expression as he took the measure of the other man this is what you wanted isnt it nies persisted nastily he picked up the carton dumping its contents onto the carpet i expect when you ask for everything that you do mean everything inspector something about you tells me youre a man of your word or were you hoping that id send it all with someone else so you might avoid having any further chats with me lynleys eyes dropped to the objects on the floor a womans clothing by their appearance perhaps youve had too much to drink he suggested nies took a step forward blood rushed to his face youd like to think that wouldnt you youd like to see me giving it over to drink in my cups with flaming regret for having you in the nick for a few days over davenports death not exactly the digs his precious lordship was used to were they barbara had never recognised so acutely one mans need to strike another or the atavistic savagery that often drives that need to completion she saw it in nies now in his posture in his hands with their talonlike fi ngers halfway drawn into a fist in the cords that stood out on his neck what she couldnt understand was lynleys reaction after the initial flash of tension hed become unnaturally unperturbed that seemed to be the source of niess increasing rage have you solved this case inspector nies sneered made any arrests no of course not not without having all the facts so let me give you a few and save you a little time roberta teys killed her father she chopped off his miserable head sat herself down and waited to be discovered and no bloody evidence you can dig out of the blue is ever going to prove this case otherwise not for kerridge not for webberly not for anyone but you have a fine time digging for it laddie youll get nothing more from me now get out of my way nies shoved past them flung open the outer door and stormed to his car it roared into life he ground the gears viciously and was gone lynley looked at the two women stepha was very pale havers was stoic but both clearly expected some kind of response from him he found he couldnt make one whatever devils were driving niess behaviour he didnt care to discuss them he longed to hang labels on the man paranoid psychopath madman came to mind but he knew too well what it felt like to be brought to the breaking point through sheer endeavour and exhaustion during a case lynley could see that nies was a hairsbreadth from breaking under the stress of the scotland yard scrutiny of his competence so if it gave the man even a moments relief to rail wildly about their runin fi ve years ago he was more than happy to give nies free rein would you get the teys file from my room sergeant he asked havers youll find it on the chest of drawers havers gawked at him sir that man just its on the chest of drawers lynley repeated he crossed the room to the heap of garments on the floor picked up the dress and laid it like a collapsed tent across the couch it was a pale pastel print with a white sailor collar and long sleeves that ended in upturned white cuffs the left sleeve of the garment was heavily stained with a solid mass of brown another solid mass formed an irregular pool from thighs to knees the bottom of the skirt was speckled with it blood he fingered the material and recognised the texture without looking to see if a label revealed it a delicate lawn shoes had been part of the package as well large black highheeled pumps with mud encrusted along the ridge where left sole met shoe body these too were flecked with the same brown substance petticoat and underclothes completed the lot thats her church dress stepha odell said and added tonelessly she had two one for winter and one for spring her best dress lynley asked as far as i know he was beginning to understand the villagers stubborn refusal to believe that the girl had committed the crime with each new piece of information it made less and less sense havers returned with the file her face without expression before he began leafi ng through it he was convinced that the information he wanted wouldnt be there it wasnt damn the man lynley muttered fruitlessly and looked at havers hes given us no analysis of the stains hed have to have done them wouldnt he havers asked hes done them but he has no intention of giving them to us not if that would make our job easier lynley uttered an oath beneath his breath and swept the garments back into their cardboard container whats to do havers asked lynley knew the answer he needed st james the mechanical precision of his highly trained mind the quick clean certainty of his finely wrought skill he needed a laboratory where tests could be made and a forensic expert he could trust who would make them it was a maddening circular sort of problem because in any direction the trail curved unquestionably back to st james he regarded the open carton at his feet and gave himself the ephemeral pleasure of cursing the man from richmond webberly was wrong he thought im the last person he should have involved in this nies reads the london condemnation too clearly he sees in me his single serious mistake he considered his options he could turn the case over to another di macpherson could certainly come sailing into keldale and have the matter taken care of within two days but macpherson was caught up in the ripper murders it would be inconceivable to move him from the one case where his expertise was so desperately needed simply because nies couldnt come to terms with his past he could telephone kerridge in newby wiske kerridge after all was niess superior offi cer but to have kerridge involved chomping at the bit to make up for the romanivs in any way he could was even more absurd besides kerridge didnt have the paperwork the results of the lab tests the depositions all he had was an overwhelming hatred of nies and an inability to get along with the man the entire situation was an irritating howling political maelstrom of thwarted ambition error and revenge he was sick of it a glass was placed before him on the table he looked up into stephas serene eyes a bit of odells is called for i think he laughed shortly sergeant he said would you care to indulge no sir she replied and just when he thought she would go on in her former exasperating imonduty manner she added but i could do with a smoke if you dont mind he handed her his gold case and silver lighter have as many as you like she lit her cigarette got all dressed up to chop off dads head it doesnt make sense the dress does stepha said why because it was sunday she was ready for church lynley and havers looked up realising simultaneously the import of stephias words but teys was killed on saturday night havers said so roberta must have got up as usual on sunday morning put her church clothes on and waited for her father lynley eyed the dress heaped in the carton he wasnt in the house so she probably assumed he was somewhere on the farm she wouldnt worry of course because hed be back in time to take her to church he probably never missed church in his life but when he didnt show up she began to get worried she went out to look for him and she found him in the barn havers concluded but the blood on her dresshow do you think it came to be there id guess she was in shock she must have picked up the body and cradled it in her lap but he had no head how could she lynley went on she lowered the body back down to the floor and still in shock sat there until father hart came and found her but then why say she killed him she never said that lynley replied what do you mean what she said was i did it im not sorry lynleys voice held a note of decision that sounds like a confession to me not necessarily he ran his fi ngers round the edges of the stain on the dress and tested the spacing of the spatters on the skirt but it does sound like something what that roberta knows quite well who murdered her father lynley awoke with a jolt early morning light filtered into the room in delicate bands that streaked across the floor to the bed a chill breeze blew back the curtains and carried upon it the pleasant sounds of waking birds and the distant cries of sheep but none of this touched his awareness he lay in the bed and knew only depression overwhelming desperation and the burning of desire he longed to turn on his side and fi nd her there her wealth of hair spread across the bedclothes her eyes closed in sleep he longed to arouse her to wakefulness his mouth and tongue feeling the subtle familiar changes in her body that betrayed her desire he flung back the covers madness he thought he began pulling on clothing mindlessly furiously any article that first came to hand escape was the exigency he grabbed an aran sweater and ran from the room thundering down the stairs and out into the street there he finally noticed the time it was half past six a heavy mist lay on the dale swirling delicately round the edges of buildings and blanketing the river to his right the high street was shuttered abandoned not even the greengrocer was stirring his boxes out onto the pavement sinjis windows were darkened the wesleyan chapel was barred and the tea room looked back at him with blank disinterest he walked to the bridge wasted fi ve minutes restlessly tossing pebbles into the river and was finally distracted by the sight of the church on its hillock st catherines looked peacefully down upon the village the very exorcist he needed for the demons of his past he began to walk towards it it was a proud little church surrounded by trees and an ancient crumbling graveyard it lifted its splendid norman exterior to the sky its apse housed a semicircle of stained glass windows while its bell tower at the opposite end played host to a whispering band of doves for a moment he watched them rustling at the edges of the roof then he walked up the gravel path to the lych gate he entered and the peace of the graveyard settled round him idly he began to wander among the graves looking at tombstones made barely legible by the ravages of time the yard was overgrown with weeds and grass dampened by morning mist gravestones bent into thick vegetation moss flourished on surfaces that never saw sun and trees sheltered fi nal resting places of people long forgotten a curious group of twisting italian cypresses arched over a few toppled tombstones some distance from the church their contortions were mystifying oddly humanoid as if they were attempting to protect the graves beneath them intrigued he walked in their direction and saw her how completely like her to have rolled up the legs of her faded blue jeans to have removed her shoes and plunged barefoot into the tall damp growth so as to capture the graves in the best angle and light how like her as well to be utterly oblivious to her surroundings oblivious to the streak of mud that snaked from ankle to calf to the torn crimson leaf that had somehow become tangled in her hair to the fact that he stood less than ten yards away and drank in her every movement and longed quite hopelessly for her to be again what she once had been in his life the low ground fog hid and revealed in alternate patches the early sunlight weakly dappled the stones an inquisitive bird watched with bright eyes from a grave nearby he was only dimly aware of this but he knew that with her camera she would capture it all he looked for st james surely the man would be sitting somewhere nearby fondly watching his wife work but he was nowhere in sight she was very much alone he felt immediately as if the church had betrayed him with its early promise of comfort and peace its no good deb he thought as he watched her nothing makes it go away i want you to leave him betray him come back to me its where you belong she looked up brushed her hair off her face and saw him he knew from her expression that he might as well have said everything aloud she read it at once oh tommy of course she wouldnt pretend wouldnt fill the awkward moment with amusing chatter that helenlike would serve to get them through the encounter instead she bit her lip looking very much as if he had struck her and turned back to her tripod making unnecessary adjustments he walked to her side im so sorry he said she continued to fumble uselessly with her equipment her head bent her hair hiding her face i cant get past it i try to see my way clear but its just no good her face was averted she seemed to be examining the pattern of the hills i tell myself that its ended the right way for us all but i dont believe that i still want you deb she turned to him then her face quite white her eyes gleaming with tears you cant youve got to let that go my mind accepts that but nothing else does a tear escaped and descended her cheek he put out his hand to wipe it away but remembered himself and dropped his arm to his side i woke up this morning so desperate to make love with you again that i thought if i didnt get out of the room at once i should begin clawing at the walls in pure adolescent frustration i thought the church would be a balm to me what i didnt think was that you would be wandering round its graveyard at dawn he looked at her equipment what are you doing here wheres simon hes still at the hall ii woke up early and came out to see the village it didnt ring true is he ill he asked sharply she scanned the branches of the cypresses a shallowness in simons breathing had immediately awakened her shortly before six he was lying so still that for one horrifying moment she thought he was dying he was drawing in each breath carefully and she knew all at once that his only thought had been not to awaken her but when she reached for his hand his fingers closed bruisingly round her own let me get your medicine she whispered and had done so and then had watched his determined face as he battled to be master of the pain can youfor an hour my love it was the part of his life that brooked no companion it was the part of his life she could never share she had left him he hadthere was some pain this morning lynley felt the full impact of deborahs words he understood so well everything that they implied christ theres no escaping it is there he asked bitterly even thats part of the miserable account no raw horror tore her voice dont say that dont you ever dont you do that to yourself it isnt your fault having spoken so quickly really without thinking of the impression that her words would have upon lynley it was suddenly as if she had said too much far more than she had intended to sayand she went back to fumbling with her camera taking it apart this time detaching lens from body and body from tripod putting everything away he watched her her movements were jerky like an oldtime motion picture run at the wrong speed perhaps sensing this and realising what her discomfort revealed she stopped what she was doing her head bent one hand at her eyes her hair was caught in a shaft of sunlight it was the colour of autumn summers death is he still at the hall did you leave him there deb it wasnt that he wanted to know but that she needed to tell him even now he couldnt let that need go unanswered he wantedit was the pain he doesnt want me to see it he thinks hes protecting me if he makes me leave she looked up at the sky as if for some sort of sign the delicate muscles worked in her throat being cut out like this its so hard i hate it he understood thats because you love him she stared at him for a moment before she replied i do i do love him tommy hes half of myself hes part of my soul she put a tentative hand on his arm a mere whisper of a touch i want you to find someone to love you like that its what you need its what you deserve but ii cant be that someone for you i dont even want to be his face blanched at her words his spirit despaired at the fi nality behind them seeking composure he found a distraction in the grave at their feet is this the source of your mornings inspiration he asked lightly yes she deliberately matched her tone to his ive heard so much about the baby in the abbey that i thought id have a peek at its grave as flame to smoke he read bizarre epitaph for a child im rather attached to shakespeare a thin voice said behind them they swung around father hart looking like a spiritual gnome in his cassock and surplice stood on the gravel path a few feet away hands folded demurely over his stomach hed managed to come upon them noiselessly like an apparition taking its form from the mist left to my own devices i always think shakespeares just the thing for a grave timeless poetic he gives life and death meaning he patted the pockets of his cassock and brought out a packet of dunhills lighting one absently and pinching the match between his fingers before pocketing it it was a dreamlike movement as if he were unaware that he was doing it at all lynley noticed the yellow pallour of his skin and the rheumy quality of his eyes this is mrs st james father hart he said gently shes taking photographs of your most famous grave father hart stirred from his reverie most famous puzzled he looked from man to woman before his eyes fell on the grave and clouded his cigarette burned ignored between his stained fingers oh yes i see he frowned what a horrible thing to have done to an infant leaving it out naked in the cold to die i needed special permission to bury the poor thing here special permission she was unbaptized but i call her marina he blinked quickly moving on to other things but if its famous graves that youve come to see mrs st james then what you really want is the crypt sounds like something from edgar allan poe lynley remarked not at all its a holy place the priest dropped his cigarette to the path and crushed it out he stooped unselfconsciously for the extinguished butt put it into his pocket and began to walk in the direction of the church lynley picked up deborahs camera equipment and they followed its the burial place of st cedd father hart was saying do come in i was just getting ready for daily mass but ill show it to you first he unlocked the doors of the church with an enormous key and motioned them inside weekday mass is a bit of a bygone now no one much bothers unless its a sunday william teys was my only consistent daily attendant and with william gonewell ive found myself more often than not saying mass in an empty church during the week he was a close friend of yours wasnt he lynley asked the priests hand wavered over the light switch he waslike a son did he ever talk to you about the trouble he had sleeping about his need for sleeping pills the hand wavered again the priest hesitated it was too long a pause lynley decided and adjusted his position in the dim light to see the old mans face more clearly his eyes were on the light switch but his lips moved as if in prayer are you all right father hart iyes fine i justso often the memory of him the priest pulled himself up with an effort like someone drawing the scattered pieces of a puzzle into one disjointed pile william was a good man inspector but a troubled spirit hehe never spoke to me about having difficulty sleeping but it doesnt surprise me at all to hear it why because unlike so many troubled souls who drown themselves in alcohol or escape their difficulties some other way william always faced them head on and did the best he could he was strong and decent but his burdens were tremendous burdens like tessa leaving and gillian running away on the second name the priests eyes closed he swallowed with difficulty it was a rasping sound tessa hurt him but gillian devastated him he was never the same once shed gone what was she like sheshe was an angel inspector sunshine the shaking hand moved quickly to the lights and switched them on and the priest gestured towards the church well what do you think of it it was decidedly not the expected interior of a village church village churches tend to be small square purely functional affairs with an absence of colour line or beauty this was none of that whoever had built it had cathedrals in mind for two great pillars at the west end had been intended to bear more tremendous weight than that of st catherines roof ah so youve noticed father hart murmured following the direction of lynleys gaze from pillars to apse this was to have been the site of the abbey st catherines was to have been the great abbey church but a conflict among the monks resulted in the other location by keldale hall it was a miracle a miracle deborah asked a real miracle if theyd built the abbey here where the remains of st cedd are it would all have been destroyed in the time of henry viii can you imagine destroying the very church where st cedd lay buried the priests voice managed to convey his complete revulsion no it was an act of god that brought about the disagreement among the monks and since the foundation for this church was already laid and the crypt complete there was no reason to disinter the body of the saint so they left him here with just a small chapel he moved with painful slowness to a stone stairway that led from the main aisle down into darkness its just this way he beckoned them the crypt was a second tiny church deep within the main church of st catherines it was a vault arched in norman style and pillared with columns that had meagre ornamentation at its far end a simple stone altar was adorned with two candles and a crucifi x and along its sides stones from an earlier version of the churchcrossheads and cross shafts and pieces from vesicular windowslay preserved for posterity it was a damp and musty place poorly lit and smelling of loam green mould clung to the walls deborah shivered poor man its so cold here one would think he might prefer to be buried somewhere in the sun hes safer here the priest answered he moved reverently to the altar rail knelt and spent the next few moments in meditation they watched him his lips moved and then he paused for a moment as if in communion with an unknown god his prayer completed he smiled angelically and got to his feet i speak to him daily father hart whispered because we owe him everything why is that lynley asked he saved us the village the church the life of catholicism here in keldale as he spoke the priests face began to glow lynley thought fleetingly of montressor and restrained himself from looking for the mortar and bricks the man himself or the relics he asked the man his presence his relics all of it the priest flung out his arms and encompassed the crypt and his voice rose in zealous jubilation he gave them courage to keep their faith inspector to remain true to rome during the terrible days of the reformation the priests hid here then the stairway was covered with a false floor and the village priests remained in hiding for years but the saint was with them all the time and st catherines never fell to the protestants there were tears in his eyes he fumbled for his handkerchief youimplease excuse me when i talk about ceddto be so privileged to have his relics here to be in communion with him im not quite sure you could understand to be on a firstname basis with an early christian saint was obviously too much for the old man lynley sought a diversion the confessionals above look like elizabethan carvings he said kindly are they the man wiped his eyes cleared his throat and gave them a shaky smile yes they werent originally intended for confessionals thats why they have such a secular theme one doesnt generally expect to see young men and women entwined in dance on the wood carving in a church but theyre lovely arent they i think the light in that part of the church is too poor for the penitents to see the doors clearly i expect some of them think its a depiction of the hebrews left on their own while moses went up to sinai what does it depict deborah asked as they followed the little priest up the stairs and into the larger church once again a pagan bacchanal im afraid he replied he smiled apologetically as he said it bid them good morning and disappeared through a carved door near the altar they watched it close behind him what an odd little man how do you know him tommy lynley followed deborah out of the church into the light he brought us all the information on the case he found the body he told her briefly about the murder and she listened as she always had her soft green eyes never moving from his face nies she cried when he had completed the tale how dreadful for you tommy how completely unfair it was like her he thought to cut to the quick of the matter to see beneath the surface to the issue that plagued him at the heart of the case webberly thought my presence might make him more cooperative god knows how he said drily unfortunately i seem to be having the opposite effect on the man but how awful for you after what nies put you through in richmond why did they assign you to this case couldnt you have turned it down he smiled at her whitefaced indignation were not usually given that option deb may i drive you back to the hall she responded in an instant oh no you dont need to ive of course i wasnt thinking lynley set down her camera case and bleakly watched the doves grooming and settling themselves on the bell tower of the church her hand touched his arm it isnt that she said gently ive a car just over there you probably didnt notice it now he saw the blue escort parked under a chestnut that was blanketing the ground with crisp autumn leaves he picked up her case and carried it to the car she followed some paces behind she unlocked the boot and watched as he put the case inside she took more time than was necessary to arrange it in a safe travelling position for the short mile back to the hall and then because it could no longer be avoided she looked at him he was watching her making a passionate study of her features as if she were about to vanish forever and all he would have left was the image in his mind i remember the flat in paddington he said making love to you there in the afternoon i havent forgotten that tommy her voice was tender for some reason that did nothing but hurt him further he looked away will you tell him you saw me of course i will and what we talked about will you tell him of that simon knows how you feel hes your friend so am i i dont want your friendship deborah he said i know but i hope you will someday itll be there when you do he felt her fingers on his arm again they tightened then loosened in farewell she opened the car door slipped inside and was gone alone he walked back towards the lodge feeling the cloak of desolation settle more firmly round his shoulders he had just reached the odell house when the garden door opened and a little figure hurtled determinedly down the steps she was followed moments later by her duck you wait here dougal bridie shouted mummy put your new food in the shed yesterday the duck unable to navigate the steps anyway sat patiently waiting as the child tugged open the shed door and disappeared inside she was back in a moment lugging a large sack behind her lynley noticed that she wore a school uniform but it was badly rumpled and not particularly clean hello bridie he called her head darted up her hair he noticed had been managed somewhat more expertly since yesterdays fiasco he wondered who had done it got to feed dougal she said got to go to school today as well i hate school he joined her in the yard the duck watched his approach warily one brown eye on him and the other on the promised breakfast bridie poured a gargantuan portion onto the ground and the duck flapped his wings eagerly okay dougal here you go bridie said she lifted the bird lovingly from the steps and placed him on the damp ground watching fondly as he plunged headfirst into the food he likes breakfast best she confided to lynley taking an accustomed place on the top step she rested her chin on her knees and gazed adoringly at the mallard lynley joined her on the step youve fixed your hair quite nicely he commented did sinji do it for you she shook her head eyes still on duck nope aunt stepha did it did she she did a very nice job shes good at stuff like that bridie acknowledged in a tone that indicated there were other things that aunt stepha was not at all good at but now i have to go to school mummy wouldnt let me go yesterday she said it was too humiliating for words bridie tossed her head scornfully its my hair not hers she added practically well mothers have a way of taking things a bit personally havent you noticed she couldve taken it the way aunt stepha did she just laughed when she saw me she hopped off the steps and filled a shallow pan with water here dougal she called the duck ignored her there was a chance the food might be taken away if he did not eat it all as fast as he could dougal was a duck who never took chances water could wait bridie rejoined lynley companionably they watched as the duck gorged himself bridie sighed she was inspecting the scuffed tops of her shoes and she rubbed at them ineffectually with a dirty finger dont know why i have to go to school anyway william never did never wellnot after he was twelve years old if mummyd married william i wouldntve had to go to school bobba didnt go ever bridie adjusted her information william never made her go after she was sixteen i dont know what ill do if i have t wait till im sixteen mummyll make me go she wants me to go to university but i dont want to what would you rather do take care of dougal ah not that he doesnt look like the picture of complete health bridie but ducks dont live forever its always nice to have something to fall back on i can always help aunt stepha at the lodge she nodded dougal had finished his breakfast and was now beak deep into the water pan i tell mummy that but its no use i dont want you spending your life at that lodge she did a disconcertingly fair imitation of olivia odells distracted voice she shook her head darkly if william and mummy had married it would all be different i could leave school and do all my learning at home william was awfully clever he could have taught me he would have i know it how do you know it cause he always would read to me and dougal the duck hearing his name waddled contentedly back to them in his peculiar lopsided fashion mostly bible stuff though bridie polished one shoe on the back of her sock i dont much like the bible old testament especially william said it was because i didnt understand it and he told mummy i ought to have religious structions he was real nice and explained stories to me but i didnt understand em very well its mostly cause no one ever got in trouble for their lies hows that lynley sought fruitlessly through his own limited religious instruction for successful biblical liars everybody was always lying with other people least thats what the stories said and no one ever got told it was wrong ah yes lying lynley studied the mallard who was examining his shoelaces with a knowing beak well things are a bit symbolic in the bible he said breezily what else did you read nothing just the bible i think thats all william and bobba ever read i tried to like it but i didnt i didnt tell william that cause he was trying to be nice and i didnt want to be rude i think he was trying to get to know me she added wisely cause if he married mummy id be round all the time did you want him to marry your mummy she scooped the bird up and placed it on the step between them with a level dispassionate look at lynley dougal began grooming his shining feathers daddy read to me bridie said in answer her voice was a shade lower and her concentration on her shoe tops was total and then he went away went away lynley wondered if this was a euphemism for his death he went away one day bridie rested her cheek on her knee pulled the bird to her side and stared at the river he didnt even say goodbye she turned and kissed the ducks smooth head he pecked at her cheek in return i wouldve said goodbye she whispered would you use the word angel or sunshine to describe someone who drank swore and ran around like mad lynley asked sergeant havers looked up from her morning eggs stirred sugar into her coffee and thought about it i suppose it depends on your definition of rain doesnt it he smiled i suppose so he pushed his plate away from him and regarded havers thoughtfully she wasnt looking half bad this morning there was a hint of colour on her eyelids cheeks and lips and her hair had a noticeable curl to it even her clothes had distinctly improved for she wore a brown tweed skirt and matching pullover which even if they werent exactly the best colour for her skin tone at least were a marked improvement over yesterdays ghastly blue suit why the question she asked stepha described gillian as wild a drinker who ran around like mad yes but father hart said she was sunshine that is peculiar he said teys was devastated when she ran away havers knotted her thick eyebrows and without thinking about how the action redefined their relationship poured lynley a second cup of coffee well that does explain why her photos are gone doesnt it hed devoted his life to his children and look at his reward for the effort one of the two vanishes into the night the last four words struck a chord in lynley he rummaged through the file on the table between them and brought out the picture of russell mowrey that tessa had given them id like you to take this round the village today he said havers took the photograph but her expression was quizzical but you said he was in london now yes not necessarily three weeks ago if mowrey was here then he would have had to ask someone for directions to the farm someone would have had to see him concentrate on the high and the patrons of the pubs you might go to the hall as well if no ones seen him were back to tessa then she fi nished or someone else with a motive there seem to be several madeline gibson answered the door to lynleys knock hed climbed his way over two quarrelling children in the wartorn front garden manoeuvred past a broken tricycle and a dismembered doll and avoided a plate of congealing fried eggs on the front steps she surveyed all this with a bored glance and adjusted an emerald green peignoir over high pointed breasts she wore nothing under it and made no secret of the fact that he couldnt have arrived at a more inconvenient time dick she called her sultry eyes on lynley put it back in your trousers its scotland yard she gave him a lazy smile and held the door open wider do come in inspector she left him in the tiny entryway among the toys and the dirty clothes and strolled to the stairwell dick she called again she turned folded her arms across her breasts and kept her eyes on lynley a smile played over her features a wellformed knee and thigh showed themselves between the folds of thin satin there was movement above them a mans mumbling and richard gibson appeared he clattered noisily to the bottom of the stairs and caught sight of his wife jesus christ put on some clothes mad he said you didnt want them on five minutes ago she replied looked him over with a knowing smile and made her way deliberatelyrevealing as much of her slim body as possibleup the stairs gibson watched her with wry amusement you should see what shes like when she really wants it he confided shes just teasing now ah yes i see the farmer laughed through his nose at least it keeps her happy inspector for a while he scrutinised the chaos of the cottage and added lets go out in front lynley thought the front garden was even less appealing a place for their encounter than the malodorous cottage but he held his tongue and followed the other man go in to your mother gibson ordered his two wrangling children with his foot he pushed the plate to the edge of the front step in a moment the familys mangy cat appeared from the tangle of dry and dying bushes and began to devour the remains of the eggs and toast it was the greedy surreptitious eating of a scavenger and it reminded lynley of the woman upstairs i saw roberta yesterday he said to gibson the other man had sat down on the step and was lacing his work shoes tightly how was she any improvement no when we first met you didnt mention the fact that youd signed roberta into the asylum mr gibson you didnt ask inspector he finished with the boots and got to his feet did you expect me to leave her with the police in richmond not especially have you arranged for a solicitor as well gibson lynley saw wasnt a man who expected the police to concern themselves with the legal representation of confessed murderesses the question surprised him his eyelids quivered and he spent a moment tucking his flannel shirt into his blue jeans he took his time about answering a solicitor no intriguing that youd make arrangements to have her put into hospital but not make arrangements for her legal interests convenient as well wouldnt you say a muscle worked in gibsons jaw no i wouldnt say can you explain yourself then i dont think i need to explain myself to you gibson said tersely but it seems to me that bobbys mental problems were a wee bit more pressing than her legal ones his swarthy skin had darkened indeed and if shes found incompetent to stand trialas no doubt she will beyoure in a good position arent you gibson faced him by god i am yes he retorted angrily free to take the damn farm free to have the damn house free to screw my damn wife on the dining room table if i want and all without bobby hulking about thats what you want to hear isnt it inspector he thrust his face forward belligerently but when lynley offered no reaction to this aggression he backed away his words however were no less angry ive just about had it with people believing id hurt bobby with people believing madeline and i would be only too happy to see her put away for life you think i dont know thats what everyone believes you think madeline doesnt know it he laughed bitterly no i didnt get her a solicitor i got one myself and if i can get her certifi ed mentally incompetent i intend to do so do you think thats worse than seeing she ends up in prison so you think she did kill her father lynley asked gibsons shoulders sagged i dont know what to think all i know is bobbys not the same girl that i knew when i left keldale that girl wouldnt have hurt a fly but this new girlshes a stranger perhaps that has to do with gillians disappearance gillian gibson laughed incredulously id say gillys leaving was a relief to all concerned why lets just say gilly was advanced for her years shall we he glanced back at the house lets just say shed have made madeline look like the virgin mary am i making myself clear perfectly did she seduce you you are direct arent you give me a fag and ill tell you about it he lit the cigarette that lynley offered from his case and looked off into the fields that began just across the unpaved street beyond them the trail to high kel moor weaved into the trees i was nineteen years old when i left keldale inspector i didnt want to leave god knows that was the last thing i wanted to do but i knew if i didnt thered be hell to pay eventually but you slept with your cousin gillian before you left gibson snorted hardly slept isnt exactly the word id use with a girl like gilly she wanted control and she had it inspector she could do things to a manbetter than a highclass tart she made me crazy just about four times a day how old was she she was twelve when she first locked her eyes on me in an uncousinly fashion thirteen the first time sheperformed then for the next two years she drove me wild are you telling me you left to escape her im hardly that noble i left to escape william it was only a matter of time before he caught her going at me i didnt want that to happen to either of us i wanted it to end why did you never just speak to william about it gibsons eyes widened as far as he was concerned neither of those girls could do anything wrong how was i supposed to tell him that gilly the proverbial apple of his eye was rubbing up to me like a cat in heat and taking me on like a whore hed never have believed it half the time i didnt myself she left keldale a year after you didnt she he tossed his cigarette into the street thats what they tell me he replied did you ever see her again gibsons eyes slid away i never did he replied and it was a blessing marsha fitzalan was a bent withered woman with a face that reminded lynley of the kind on american dolls carved from apples it was a mass of delicate wrinkles that traced a pattern across her cheeks up to her eyes these were blue they danced in her face with interest and amusement and told anyone who looked at her that the body was indeed old but the heart and the mind had not changed from youth good morning she smiled and then with a look at her watch or nearly afternoon youre inspector lynley arent you i thought you might be by sooner or later ive lemon pie made for the occasion lynley asked indeed she replied come in although she lived in one of the council houses on st chads lane its appearance couldnt have been more different from the gibsons the front garden was planted parterrelike with neat patterns of flowers in the spring there would be alyssum and primrose snapdragons and geraniums they had been trimmed back for the coming of winter the soil turned over lovingly round each plant on two of the stepping stones leading to the door birdseed had been fashioned into small accessible piles and a set of metal wind chimes hung near a window its six notes still managing to be heard over the din of the gibson children next door the contrast to the gibsons small cottage continued indoors where the smell of potpourri in the air reminded lynley of long afternoons spent in his grandmothers bedroom at howenstow the tiny sitting room was comfortably if inexpensively furnished and two of its walls were lined from fl oor to ceiling with books a small table under the single window was covered by a collection of photographs and several needlepoint tapestries hung above an ancient television set will you come into the kitchen inspector marsha fitzalan asked i know its dreadful to entertain in the kitchen but ive always been far more comfortable there my friends tell me its because i grew up on a farm and the life of a farm always centres itself in the kitchen doesnt it i suppose i never got over that here please sit at the table coffee and pie you do look hungry i imagine youre a bachelor bachelors never eat as well as they should do they again there was the memory of his grandmother that unmistakable security of unconditional love as he watched her busily putting together a tray her hands sure and unshaking lynley knew for a certainty that marsha fitzalan held the answer can you tell me about gillian teys he asked her hands stopped she turned to him with a smile gilly she said what a pleasure that shall be gillian teys was the loveliest creature ive ever known she returned to the table and placed the tray between them it was an unnecessary nicety the kitchen was so tiny that only a few steps were needed to move across the room yet still she preserved the semblance of gentility and countered the claustrophobia of poverty by using the tray it was covered with a piece of old lace upon which rested fine bone china both plates were chipped but the cups and saucers had somehow managed the years unscathed autumn leaves in a pottery jug served to decorate the plain pine table and onto its surface marsha fitzalan set everything out carefully plates cutlery and linen she poured the steaming coffee into their cups and added sugar and milk to her own before she began to speak gilly was exactly like her mother i taught tessa as well of course it betrays my age dreadfully to admit to that but there you have it nearly everyone in the village passed through my classroom inspector her eyes twinkled as she added except father hart he and i are of the same generation i should never have guessed lynley said solemnly she laughed why is it that truly charming men always know when a woman is fi shing for a compliment she dug into her pie enthusiastically chewed appreciatively for a few moments and then continued gillian was the mirror image of her mother she had that same lovely blonde hair those beautiful eyes and that same wonderful spirit but tessa was a dreamer and gillian was a bit more of a realist i should say tessas head was always in the clouds she was all romance i think thats why she chose to marry so young she was determined that life was all about being swept off ones feet by a tall dark hero and william teys certainly fit the image gillian wasnt worried about being swept off her feet oh no i dont think the thought of men ever entered gillys head she wanted to be a teacher i can remember her coming by in the afternoons curling up on the floor with a book how she loved the brontës that child must have read jane eyre six or seven times by her fourteenth birthday she jane and mr rochester were all rather intimate acquaintances as i recall and she loved to talk about everything she read but it wasnt just chatter she talked about characters motivations meanings she would say i shall have to know these things when im a teacher miss fitzalan why did she run away the old woman studied the bronze leaves in the jug i dont know she replied slowly she was such a good child there was never a problem that she couldnt seem to solve with that quick mind of hers i honestly dont know what happened could she have been involved with a man perhaps someone she was running after miss fitzalan dismissed the idea with a movement of her hand i dont believe gillian was interested in men yet she was a bit slower to mature than the other girls were what about roberta was she much like her sister no roberta was like her father she stopped suddenly and frowned was i dont want to talk about her in the past tense like that but she seems to have died she does doesnt she the woman looked as if she appreciated his concurring with her roberta was big like her father very solid and silent people will tell you she had no personality at all but thats not true she was simply excruciatingly shy she had her mothers romantic disposition her fathers taciturnity and she lost herself in books like gillian yes and no she read like gillian but she never spoke about what she read gillian read to learn roberta i think read to escape escape what miss fitzalan fussily straightened the lace that covered the old tray her hands lynley saw were spotted with age the knowledge of being deserted i should guess by gillian or her mother by gillian roberta worshipped gillian she never knew her mother you can imagine what it must have been like having gilly for an older sister so lovely so lively so intelligent everything roberta wasnt and wished she could be jealousy she shook her head she wasnt jealous of gilly she loved her i should think it hurt roberta dreadfully when her sister left but unlike gillian who would have talked about her painlord knows gilly talked about anything and everythingroberta internalised it i remember in fact the poor childs skin after gilly left funny that i would still remember that lynley thought of the girl he had seen in the asylum and was not surprised that the teacher would remember the condition of robertas skin acne he asked she would have been young for that no she broke out in the most dreadful rash i know it was nerves but when i spoke to her about it she blamed it on whiskers miss fitzalan dropped her eyes and toyed with her fork making delicate patterns in the crumbs on her plate lynley waited patiently convinced there was more finally she went on i felt so inadequate inspector such a failure as a friend and as a teacher that she couldnt talk to me about what had happened to gilly but she just couldnt talk so she blamed it all on being allergic to her dog did you speak to her father about it not at first william had been so crushed by gillians running off that he wasnt the least bit approachable for weeks it seemed the only person he would talk to at all was father hart but in the end frankly i felt i owed it to roberta after all the child was only eight years old it wasnt her fault that her sister had run away so i went out to the farm and told william i was worried about her especially considering the pathetic story shed made up about the dog she poured herself more coffee and sipped it as she brooded over that longago visit poor man i certainly neednt have worried about his reaction i think he must have felt terribly guilty about having ignored roberta because he drove to richmond directly and bought three or four different kinds of lotion to put on her skin it may well have been that all the poor girl needed was her fathers attention because the rash went away after that but nothing else did lynley thought in his mind he saw the lonely little girl in the gloomy farmhouse surrounded by the ghosts and voices of the past living her life in grim sterility taking her nourishment from books lynley unlocked the back door and let himself into the house it was unchanged as cold and airless as it had been before he went through the kitchen to the sitting room where tessa teys smiled at him tenderly from her corner shrine looking young and infinitely vulnerable he imagined russell mowrey raising his head from his excavation and seeing that lovely face framed in a gap in the fence it was easy to see why mowrey had fallen in love it was easy to see why he would be in love still not a thousand ships but one enraged husband lynley thought is it possible tessa or did you see your world shatter in one afternoon and know you couldnt bear to build it again he turned from the shrine and ran up the stairs no the answer had to be in the house it had to be gillian he went first to her bedroom but its vacuity told him nothing the bed stared up at him wordlessly its covering unblemished the rug held no footprints leading back into the past the wallpaper covered no longheld secrets it was as if a young girl had never lived in the room had never breathed her liveliness and spirit into the air and yet something something of gillian lingered something he had seen something he could feel he walked to the window and looked unseeing at the barn she was wild ungoverned she was an angel sunshine she was a cat in heat she was the loveliest creature ive ever seen it was as if there were no real gillian at all but only a kaleidoscope that juggled before viewing appeared different to each person who gazed into it he longed to believe that the answer was in the room but when he turned from the window he saw nothing but furniture wallpaper and rug how could someone be wiped so completely out of the life of the family in which she had lived for sixteen years it was inconceivable yet it had been done or had it he walked to robertas room gillian couldnt have faded from her sisters life so completely the love was there the bond was strong everyone at least no matter what they had said about gillian agreed upon that his gaze roamed from window to wardrobe to bed he considered this last it was her hiding place for food why not for gillian as well steeling himself to the sight and the smell of the putrefaction lynley pulled back the mattress the stench rose like an undulating wave he glanced about looking for a way to make the job at hand easier but finding nothing that would do the light in the room was poor and unpleasant as it would be there was nothing for it but to drag the entire mattress off and rip the box spring apart grunting with the effort he jerked mattress and bedding onto the floor and then went to the window he threw it open and stood for a moment sucking in the fresh air before turning back to the bed he climbed onto the box spring and planned his attack ignoring his queasiness come on old boy isnt this why you got into police work buck up now give it one big pull he did so and the rotting materialthat thin layer of sanitycame apart in his hands exposing the madness beneath it mice scattered in all directions leaving diminutive tracks through the decaying fruit one sowlike rodent nursed her litter of clutching blind offspring in a bed of womens dirty underclothes and an angry cloud of moths disturbed from their slumber burst out into the light flinging themselves upwards into lynleys face startled he reeled back managed to keep from crying out and quickly made his way to the bathroom where he took a moment to splash water on his face he looked at himself in the mirror and laughed soundlessly good thing you skipped lunch after that you may well skip eating for the rest of your life he sought a towel on which to dry his face there was none on the rack but he caught a glimpse of a dressing gown hanging on the back of the bathroom door he swung it shut its broken hasp lock grated against the frame like a shriek he dried his face on the hem of the garment fingered the lock meditatively and after a moment a new thought triggered he left the room the box of keys was where he had seen it before far in the back on the top shelf of teyss wardrobe he took it out and dumped it onto the bed teys would have put gillians things in a trunk somewhere in the attic perhaps and the keys would be here he searched through them fruitlessly they were all door keys the oldfashioned keyhole variety a strange collection of rusting metallic mementoes he threw them back into their box in disgust and cursed the blind determination of the man who had wiped one daughters existence off the face of the earth why he wondered what kind of anguish was it that had driven william teys to deny the existence of the child he so loved what could she possibly have done to bring him to such an act of destruction and at the same time provoke her sister to such an impotent yet desperate act of preservation as the simple hiding of a photograph he knew what came next the attics a blind old boy back to her bedroom you know its there maybe not in the mattress but you know its there he shuddered at the thought of what other surprises waited like spectres in that sepulchral room as he was gathering his shattered defences for another assault the sound of whistling joyful and unrestrained came to him from outside he went to the window a young man was walking down the trail from high kel moor an easel over his shoulder and a wooden case in his hand it was time lynley decided to meet ezra his first thought was that the other man was not as young as he looked from a distance it must have been the hair lynley thought which was a rich deep blond and worn much longer than was the current fashion up close ezra looked very much what he was a man somewhere in his thirties wary about this meeting with the detective from scotland yard the wariness came through in the careful stance it also came through in the swiftly veiled eyes the kind of eyes that changed colour with the clothing he wore they were deep blue now as was the mans shirt which was streaked with paint he had stopped whistling the moment he saw lynley come out of the house and climb nimbly over the pasture wall ezra farmington he said pleasantly farmington halted his features put lynley in mind of the delacroix painting of frederic chopin here were the same sculpted lips the shadow of a cleft in the chin the dark brows much darker than the hair the nose that was dominant but not detractive thats right he said noncommittally doing some painting on the moor today yes nigel parrish tells me you do light studies the name got a reaction the eyes became guarded what else does nigel tell you that he saw william teys run you off his property you seem to be making free use of it now with gibsons permission the words were terse indeed he didnt mention it lynley gazed serenely in the direction of the trail it was steep and rocky illmaintained not the place for a country hike an artist would have to be most sincere about his endeavours to bother climbing up to the high moor at all he turned back to the other man the afternoon breeze that rustled through the pasture ruffl ed farmingtons blond hair appealingly so that the sun struck its highlights lynley began to understand why he wore it long mr parrish tells me that teys destroyed some of your work does he also tell you what the hell he was doing out here that night farmington demanded no blast his eyes ill be damned if he does according to him he was bringing teyss dog back to the farm the artists face mirrored his disbelief bringing the dog back to the farm what a laugh he savagely drove the pointed legs of his easel into the soft earth nigel really knows how to manipulate the facts doesnt he let me guess what he told you that teys and i were having a bloody fine row in the middle of the road when up he popped innocently walking the poor blind dog home farmington ran one hand through his hair in agitation his body was so tense that lynley wondered if he would start swinging his fi sts christ that man will drive me to do something mad lynley lifted an eyebrow in interest the other man read the expression and i suppose that is a confession of guilt inspector well i suggest you trot back to nigel and ask him what he was doing wandering down gembler road last night believe me that dog could have found his way back from timbuktu if hed wanted to he laughed that dog was a damn sight smarter than nigel not that that means much lynley wondered at the source of farmingtons anger the passion was real without doubt yet it was out of all proportion to the subject at hand the man was like a taut bowstring upon which undue pressure was being exerted an ounce more and he would snap i saw your work at keldale lodge the way you painted the abbey put me in mind of wyeth was that deliberate ezra relaxed a tightly balled fist that was done years ago i was floundering for style i didnt trust my instincts so i copied everyone elses im surprised stepha still has it hanging she said you did it to pay for your board one autumn thats right i paid for most everything like that in those days if you look hard enough youll see my crap hanging in every shop in town i even bought toothpaste that way it was a derisive statement an indication of contempt but directed at himself not at lynley i like wyeth lynley went on theres a simplicity to his work that i find refreshing i like simplicity the clarity of line and image details farmington folded his arms are you always this obvious inspector i try to be lynley responded with a smile tell me about your argument with william teys and if i refuse you may of course but id wonder why have you something to hide mr farmington farmington shifted on the balls of his feet ive nothing to hide i was on the moor that day and came down towards dark teys must have seen me from a window hell i dont know he caught up with me here on the road we had it out he destroyed some of your work it was crap anyway it didnt matter i was always under the impression that artists like to have control over their own creations rather than give it to other people wouldnt you agree lynley immediately saw that hed struck tender flesh for farmington stiffened involuntarily his eyes moved to the low sun in the sky he didnt respond immediately id agree he said finally yes by god id agree then when teys took it upon himself teys ezra laughed i didnt care what teys did i told you what hed destroyed was pure crap anyway not that hed have known the difference any man whod play souza full blast for an evenings entertainment hasnt got a whole lot of taste as far as im concerned souza the godawful starsandstripes piece christ youd think he was entertaining a house full of flagwaving americans and then to have the cheek to howl at me for disturbing his peace by tiptoeing across his land to get to the trail i laughed at him thats when he went for my paintings what did nigel parrish do while all this was going on nothing nigel had seen what hed come to see inspector hed done his bit of sleuthing he could rest an easy man that night and on other nights farmington picked up his easel if theres nothing more ill be on my way no there is one thing more farmington pivoted to face him what he demanded what were you doing the night william teys died i was at the dove and whistle and after time was called home in bed sleeping it off alone he tossed his hair off his face it was an odd distinctly feminine gesture sorry i didnt take hannah with me inspector shed be quite an alibi but ive never gone in for the whips and chains routine he climbed over the rock wall and strode angrily down the road it was as they say in american detective films a total bust sergeant havers tossed the photograph onto the table in the dove and whistle and dropped wearily into a chair opposite him which means i suppose that no one has ever seen russell mowrey in this lifetime and unless we can believe in reincarnation no one has ever seen him at all tessa however was widely recognised a few lifted eyebrows a few pointed questions what was your response i was suitably vague murmuring a lot of interesting latin adages to get me through difficult moments i was fine until i tried out caveat emptor somehow it didnt have that ring of authority the other phrases had would you care to drown your disappointment in a drink sergeant he asked just tonic water she responded and seeing his expression added really i dont drink much sir honest with a smile ive spent a rather fascinating day lynley told her when he returned with her drink an encounter with madeline gibson all hotly deshabille in an emerald negligee with absolutely nothing at all underneath the life of a policeman is rotten havers noted and gibson upstairs at the absolute ready i was a welcome guest i can imagine ive learned the most today about gillian however she was a sunshine angel a cat in heat or the loveliest creature ever seen it depends whos reporting the details either the womans a chameleon or some of these people are taking considerable trouble to make it look that way but why i dont know unless of course they have a vested interest in keeping her as mysterious as possible he swallowed the rest of his ale and leaned back in his chair stretching his tired muscles but the real atmosphere today was at gembler farms havers whys that i was hot on the trail of gillian teys picture it please something told me it was all in robertas room so i threw myself into the investigation with a passion ripped off the top of her mattress box spring and fairly lost myself on the spot he described the sight havers made a grimace of distaste glad i missed that oh have no fear i was far too discomposed to put the bed back together so i shall need your assistance tomorrow shall we say directly after breakfast sod you she grinned it was obviously teatime when they arrived at the cottage on the corner of bishop furthing road it was a late tea however probably sliding itself right into dinner for constable gabriel langston answered the door holding tightly in his hand a plate weighted down with a variety of food cold chicken legs cheese fruit and cake jockeyed for position on a brown pottery dish langston seemed very young for a policeman but aptly named gabriel for he was slightly built with thinning yellow hair the consistency of spun glass babysmooth skin and features that looked undeveloped as if the bones were too soft beneath them i shshshouldve sseen you at once he stammered blushing heavily on cheeks and neck whwhen you arrived but i was totold youd ccome to mme if you nneeded anything nies told you no doubt lynley guessed the other man nodded awkwardly and gestured them into his home the table was laid out for one and the constable hastily set his meal down on it wiped his hand on his trousers and extended it to lynley nnice to mmeet you bboth ssorry about he blushed darker and gestured helplessly at his mouth as if there were something he could have done about his speech impediment ttea he said eagerly thank you id love a cup what about you sergeant yes thank you havers replied the man nodded in obvious relief smiled and disappeared into an undersized kitchen off the room in which they stood the cottage they could see was strictly a oneperson affair not much more than a bedsitting room but it was conscientiously cleanswept polished and dusted only the faint odour of wet dog marred it the source of this lay on a chewed and stringy rag rug toasting himself before a singlebar electric fire set into a small stone fireplace he was a white highland terrier and he lifted his chin blinked at them seriously and yawned revealing a long pink tongue this done he turned his nose happily back to the electric blaze langston returned with a tray in his hands and another terrier at his heels this was a livelier version of the first for it threw itself upon lynley in excited greeting hhere down langston ordered as sharply as his gentle voice would allow the dog obeyed reluctantly then scampered across the room to join the other in a heap by the fire ththeyre ggood lads inspector ssorry lynley waved off the apology as langston poured the tea go on with your meal constable havers and i are out prowling a bit late this evening we can talk while you eat langston didnt look as if he believed this was possible but he dug into his food with a shy duck of his head i understand that father hart rang you directly after he found william teyss body lynley began when the man nodded eagerly he went on roberta was still there when you arrived another nod did you bring richmond in immediately why was that lynley regretted the question the moment he asked it stupid clod he thought wondering what it would be like for the man to have to agonise his way through questioning witnesses especially those like father hart who seemed to float between two distinct planes of existence langston was staring at his plate attempting to formulate an answer i expect that was the quickest way to go about it havers offered langston nodded gratefully did roberta speak to anyone at all langston shook his head not to you not to anyone from richmond again the negative lynley glanced at havers then she only spoke to father hart he considered the situation roberta was sitting on the overturned pail the axe was nearby the dog was under teys but the weapon used to slit the dogs throat was missing is that correct a nod langston bit into his third chicken leg his eyes on lynley what happened to the dog ibburied hhim where out the bback lynley leaned forward behind this cottage why did nies tell you to do so langston swallowed rubbed his hands on his trousers he looked miserably at his two companions by the fire and seeing themselves the focus of his attention they wagged their tails supportively i it was embarrassment rather than his speech that stopped him this time i love ddogs he said ddidnt want ththem to burn old whwhiskers hewas a ppal o the llads poor man lynley murmured when they were on the street again darkness was falling quickly somewhere a womans voice rose calling to a child no wonder he brought in richmond what could have possessed him becoming a police constable havers demanded as they crossed to the lodge i expect he never thought hed come across a murder at least not one like this who would expect it in a place like keldale god knows before this langstons most serious duty was probably patrolling the village and checking shop doors to see they were locked at night then whats next havers asked we wont have the dog till the morning true lynley flipped open his watch that gives me twelve hours to talk st james into abandoning his honeymoon for the thrill of the chase what do you think havers have we a chance will he have to choose between the dead dog and deborah afraid so i think well need a miracle sir im good at that lynley said grimly it would have to be the white shirtwaist again barbara took it out of the wardrobe and looked at it critically a different belt and it wouldnt look bad or perhaps a scarf at the throat had she brought a scarf even one for the head could be tied someway to give a touch of colour to change the outfit somehow to make it look a bit different humming beneath her breath she rummaged through her things they were tossed into the chest of drawers in a heap but she found what she was looking for easily enough a scarf of red and white checks a bit like a tablecloth but it couldnt be helped she went to the mirror and saw her refl ection with a start of pleased surprise the country air had whipped colour into her cheeks and her eyes had sparkle to them it was being useful that did it she decided she had enjoyed her day in the village alone it was the first time a di had allowed her to do something all by herself it was the fi rst time a di had assumed she had brains she felt bolstered by the experience and realised how much her confidence had been destroyed by her humiliating return to uniform what a horrible time that had been in her life the seething anger boiling over into imcomprehensible rage the festering sore of unhappiness the knowledge of being evaluated by others as not good enough not up to snuff snuff the image of jimmy haverss little pig eyes looked back at her from the mirror her eyes were his she turned from the glass everything was going to be better now she was on her way and nothing could stop her she would sit for the inspectors exam again she would pass this time she knew it she stepped out of her tweed skirt struggled out of the pullover and kicked off her shoes of course no one had given her any information about russell mowrey but everyone had taken her quite seriously in her questioning everyone had seen her for what she was a representative of new scotland yard a fine representative competent intelligent insightful it was what she had needed now she could really be part of the case she completed her dressing tied the scarf jauntily round her throat and descended the stairs to meet lynley he was in the lounge standing before the watercolour of the abbey lost in thought behind the bar stepha odell watched him they might have been part of a painting themselves the woman stirred fi rst a drink before you leave sergeant she asked pleasantly thank you no lynley turned ah havers he said absently rubbing his temples are you ready for another assault on keldale hall quite she replied then were off he nodded a detached goodnight to the other woman and hand on barbaras elbow guided her from the room ive been meditating on our best approach he said once they were in the car youll have to keep that dreadful american couple engaged in conversation long enough for me to have a word with st james can you do that i hate to abandon anyone to such a fate but if good old hank hears me i have the most appalling suspicion that hell demand to be part of the case himself no problem sir barbara replied ill keep him enthralled he glanced at her suspiciously how ill have him talk about himself in response lynley laughed suddenly looking younger and far less fatigued that should do it all right now lookit barbie hank said with a wink if its investigating you and tom are up to in this burg then you oughta get yourselfs hooked up in this place for a nighter two what say jojobean this place jumps after dark huh they were taking their postprandial drinks in the oak hall hank wearing blinding white trousers an embroidered southoftheborder shirt open to the waist and the requisite gold chain leered at barbara knowingly he stood as if hoping to become at one with the garlands and cherubs of the carved chimneypiece one hand was resting on a stylised stone primrose the fingers curling round a generous measure of brandy his third or fourth the other hand was at his waist the thumb cocked into the loop of his trousers it was quite a pose his wife sat in a highbacked chair directing her mournfully apologetic gaze alternately betweeen deborah and barbara lynley and st james barbara noted with satisfaction had managed to effect a disappearance in the direction of the stone hall almost immediately after dinner and mrs burtonthomas had dozed off noisily on a wellpadded couch nearby barbara reflected upon the uneven quality of mrs burtonthomass snores and decided the woman was faking it she couldnt blame her hank had been holding forth for a good quarter hour barbara cast a quick look at deborah to see how she was dealing with her husbands sudden desertion of her to hanks clutches the other womans face crossed by fi re and shadow was tranquil but when she felt barbaras eyes on her a mischeivous smile touched her lips for an instant she knows perfectly well whats happening barbara decided and liked deborah for the generosity implied behind her acceptance of the fact as hank was opening his mouth to continue his description of the afterdark jumps at keldale hall lynley and st james rejoined them by the fi re now you gotta get the pitcher here hank was continuing i go to the window two nights ago to shut out that damned screeching ever hear peacocks make such a ruckus debbie peacocks deborah asked good heavens simon it wasnt the baby in the abbey at all did you lie to me i was obviously misled st james replied it sounded remarkably like a baby to me are you telling me we warded off evil for nothing like a baby hank demanded incredulous you must be lost in the throes of luv si that was a peacock screeching fit to beat the band he sat down knees spread apart his arms resting on his chunky thighs so i go to the window to either shut the thing or give the old heaveho to a shoe and kill that damn bird im one helluva shot did i tell you that no well we got this alley in laguna see where the queers hang out he waited to see if he would once again have to explain the denizens of laguna beach to his audience but they were caught in the grip of his pictorial pun he went on happily and i get puhlenty of practise heaving shoes out at them lemme tell you whatsay bean truth or not truth honey jojo replied he can hit anything she swore to the others i have no doubt lynley said grimly hank flashed his capped teeth so here i am at the window ready to heave it see when what i notice is a heckuva lot more an some bird someone else screeching lynley enquired hell no the bird was there all right but i got an eyefulla something else he waited for them to ask what it was there was polite silence okay okay he laughed he lowered his voice danny and that fella whatsis name irahezekiah ezra yep and they are liplocked like i never seen whew you two gonna come up for air i yell he howled appreciatively polite smiles all around jojo gazed from one face to another like a puppy eager to be loved only this is the best part hank lowered his voice again what we got on our hands isnt danny at all but its ezra all right he smiled triumphantly their complete attention was his at last more brandy deborah st james asked thank you hank squirmed forward in his seat but hes gettin it on with angelina can you see it he barked with laughter and pounded his knee this ezras busier than a rooster in a henhouse fellas i dont know what hes got but he sure likes spreading it around he slurped at his drink i made a few pointed remarks to angelina in the am but that girl is deep not a twitch of the eye im telling you tom if its action youre looking for you oughta get yourself down here he sighed with satisfaction and fingered his heavy gold chain luv wonderful thing huh nothing messes with the mind like luv bet you can attest to that si huh ive been distraught for years st james acknowledged hank brayed cotcher heart pretty young did she he pointed a knowing finger at deborah after him for a while huh since childhood she replied smoothly childhood hank crossed the room to slosh more brandy into his glass mrs burtonthomas snored loudly as he passed her you twore school sweethearts like me and the bean ill bet remember it bean a little youknowwhat in the back of the chevy you got drivein movies here i think thats a phenomenon endemic to your country st james replied say what hank shrugged and fell back into his seat brandy splashed out onto his white trousers he ignored it so you met in school no we were formally introduced at my mothers house st james and deborah exchanged innocent glances hey she set you two up i bet the bean and i met on a blind date too we got something in common si actually i was born in his mothers house deborah added politely but i grew up mostly in simons house in london hanks face fell these are dangerous waters did you catch that bean you two related cousins or something visions of haemophiliacs languishing behind closed doors clearly danced in his head not at all my father is simonswell what would you call dad she turned to her husband footman servant butler valet fatherinlaw st james replied did you catch that bean hank said in awe this is some romance it was sudden unexpected she was trying to adjust lynleys was turning out to be such a multifaceted character like a diamond cut by a master jeweller that in every situation a new surface glittered that she had never seen before in love with deborah all right certainly that was understandable but in love with the daughter of st jamess servant barbara struggled to assimilate the information how had it ever happened to him she wondered he had always seemed to be in such complete control of his life and his destiny how had he ever allowed it to happen she now saw his peculiar behaviour at st jamess wedding in an entirely new light not anxious to be rid of her as soon as he could but anxious to be away from a source of considerable pain the nuptial happiness of a woman he loved with another man at least she understood now why of the two men deborah had chosen st james obviously shed never even been given a choice for lynley would never have allowed himself to speak to her of love to do this would ultimately have led him to speak of marriage and lynley would never marry the daughter of a servant it would shake his family tree to its very roots yet he certainly must have wanted to make deborah his wife and how he must have suffered watching st james placidly break the ridiculous code of social behaviour that held lynley immobilised what had st james said fatherinlaw in four short syllables he had coolly wiped away every class distinction that might ever have separated him from his wife no wonder she loves him barbara realised suddenly she glanced warily at lynley as they drove back to the lodge what must it be like for him knowing that he had lacked the courage to tell deborah that he wanted her knowing that hed put his family and his title before his love how he must hate himself what regret he must feel how horribly lonely he must really be he felt her looking at him you did nice work today sergeant especially at the hall keeping hank at bay for a quarter of an hour shall get you a citation rest assured she felt absurdly warmed by the praise thank you sir st james agreed to help he did indeed he did indeed lynley thought he let out his breath sharply in selfderision and tossed the file onto the bedside table he dropped his spectacles on top of it rubbed his eyes and adjusted the pillows behind his back deborah had spoken to her husband lynley could see that theyd already discussed what his response would be when he was asked to assist it was a simple one of course tommy what can i do how like both of them how like deborah to have seen in their conversation that morning all of his concerns about the case how like her to have paved the way for him to ask st jamess help and how like st james to have agreed without hesitation for any hesitation would have aroused the guilt that always lay like a dangerous wounded tiger between them he leaned back against the pillows and closed his eyes wearily allowing his mind in its exhaustion to drift back to the past he gave himself to the bewitching visions of a former happiness that remained unclouded by grief or pain the lovely thais by his side sate like a blooming easter bride in fl owr of youth and beautys pride happy happy happy pair none but the brave deserves the fair drydens words came from nowhere unbidden and unwanted he swallowed them down and demanded that they recede into his mind an effort that took every ounce of his concentration and prevented him from hearing the door open and the footsteps cross to the bed he was quite unaware in fact of the presence in the room until a cool hand touched his cheek gently his eyes fl ew open i think you need an odells inspector stepha whispered nonplussed he stared at her he waited for his smooth persona to click into place for the arrival of that illusory man who laughed and danced and had a quickwitted answer for everything but nothing happened stephas appearance in his room materialising for all he knew out of nowhere seemed to have destroyed his only line of defence and all that was left in his repertoire of engaging behav iours was the ability to meet without wavering her beautiful eyes he needed to give reality to the moment to make her something he hadnt dreamt up from the mist of his dispirited memory so he reached out and touched the fall of her hair soft he thought wonderingly she caught his hand and kissed the palm the wrist her tongue lightly traced the length of his fingers let me love you tonight let me drive away the shadows she spoke on the merest breath of a whisper and he wondered if her voice were a part of the dream but her smooth hands played across his cheeks and jaw and throat and when she bent to him and he tasted the sweetness of her mouth felt the caress of her tongue he knew she was part of a searing reality a present calmly laying siege to the castellated walls of his past he wanted to flee from the onslaught to escape to that haven of blisscharged remembrance that had kept him well armoured in the year that had passed a year during which all desire had been absent all longing dead all life incomplete but she allowed no evasion and as she purposefully destroyed the ramparts that shielded him he felt once again not a sweet liberation but that terrifying need to possess another person body and soul he couldnt he wouldnt allow it to happen he desperately sought out last shattered defences uselessly willing back into being an insensate creature who no longer lived in its place was rebornquiet and vulnerablethe man who had been there inside all along tell me about paul she raised herself on one elbow touched her finger to his lips traced their shape the light struck her hair her shoulders her breasts she was fire and cream scented almost imperceptibly with the sweetness of devon violets why because i want to know about you because he was your brother because he died her eyes moved from his what did nigel say that pauls death changed everyone it did bridie said that he went away that he never said goodbye stepha lowered herself next to him into his arms paul killed himself thomas she whispered her body trembled on the words he held her closer bridies not been told we say he died of huntingtons and he did in a way it was huntingtons that killed him have you ever seen people with the disease st vitus dance theyve no control over their bodies they twitch and stagger and leap and fall and then their minds go at the last but not paul by god not paul her voice caught she drew in a breath his hand found its way to her hair and he pressed his lips to the top of her head im sorry he had just enough mind left to know that he no longer recognised his wife no longer knew the name of his child no longer had any control over his body he had just enough mind left to decide it was time for him to die she swallowed i helped him i had to he was my twin i didnt know that nigel didnt tell you no nigels in love with you isnt he yes she answered without artifi ce did he come to keldale to be near you she nodded we were all at university together nigel paul and i i might have married nigel at one time he was less mad then less angry im the source of his madness im afraid but ill never marry now why not because huntingtons is a hereditary disease im a carrier i dont want to pass it on to a child its bad enough seeing bridie every day and thinking every time she stumbles or drops something that shes got the bloody disease herself i dont know what id do if i had a child of my own probably drive myself mad with worry you dont have to have children or you could adopt men say that of course nigel does all the time but theres no point to marriage as far as im concerned if i cant have my own child my own healthy child was the baby in the abbey a healthy child she drew herself up to look at him on duty inspector an odd time and place for it wouldnt you say he smiled wryly sorry reflex action im afraid and then he added unrepentant was she wherever did you hear about the baby in the abbey no dont tell me keldale hall i understand it was a bit of a legend come true of sorts the legendfanned by the burtonthomases at every opportunityis that sometimes one can hear a baby cry from the abbey at night the reality im afraid is much as youd expect its a trick of wind when its blowing with just the right force from the north through a crack in the wall between the north transept and nave it happens several times a year how do you know when we were teenagers my brother and i camped there for a fortnight one spring until wed tracked the sound down of course we didnt disappoint the burtonthomases by telling them the truth but to be honest even that wind doesnt sound a great deal like a baby and the real baby ah back to that are we she rested her cheek on his chest i dont know much about it it was just over three years ago father hart found her managed to stir up a great deal of local outrage about her and it fell to gabriel langston to sort it all out poor gabriel he never was able to discover anything at all the furor died down after a few weeks there was a funeral that everyone of conscience attended and that was the end of it im afraid it was all rather grim and you were glad when it was over i was i dont like grimness i dont want it in my life i want life filled with laughter and wild crazy joy perhaps youre afraid of feeling anything else i am but im mostly afraid of ending up lost like olivia of loving someone so much and then having that person ripped out of my life i cant bear to be near her any longer after paul died she went into a fog bank and never emerged i dont want to be like that ever she spoke the last word on a hard note of anger but when she raised her head her eyes shone with tears please thomas she whispered and his body responded with the quicksilver fl ame of desire he pulled her to him roughly felt her heat and passion heard her cry of pleasure felt the shadows drift away what about bridie what do you mean shes like a little lost soul just bridie and that duck stepha laughed she curled on her side her smooth back a pleasant pressure against him bridies special isnt she olivia seems oddly detached from her its as if bridies growing up without parents at all liv wasnt always that way but bridies like paul so exactly like i think it hurts olivia even to see her shes not really over paul yet i doubt she ever will be then why on earth was she going to remarry for bridies sake paul was a very strong father olivia seems to have felt duty bound to replace him with someone else and william was eager to be the replacement i suppose her voice was growing sleepy i dont quite know what she thought it was going to be like for herself but i think she was more interested in getting bridie under control it would have worked well too william was very good to bridie so was roberta bridie says you are as well she yawned does she i fixed her hair poor little pumpkin im not certain im good at anything else you chase ghosts away he whispered youre very good at that but she was asleep he awoke to find the reality this time she lay childlike curled with her knees drawn up with both of her fi sts under her chin she was frowning with her dream and a strand of hair was caught between her lips he smiled at the sight a glance at his watch told him it was nearly seven he bent and kissed her bare shoulder she awoke at once coming fully awake in an instant not the least bit confused about where she was she raised her hand touching his cheek pulling him down to her he kissed her mouth then her neck and heard the delicate change in her breathing that signalled her pleasure when he reached her breast his hand slid the length of her body she sighed thomas he lifted his head her cheeks were flushed her eyes bright i must go not just yet look at the time in a moment he bent to her felt her hands in his hair youioh lord she laughed as she realised how her body was betraying her he smiled go if you must then she sat up kissed him a last time and crossed to the bathroom he lay there fi lled with a contentment that he had thought was entirely lost to him and listened to the familiar noises she made he found himself wondering how hed survived the last year of isolation then she was returning to him smiling running his hairbrush through her tangled hair she reached for her grey dressing gown and began to put it on lifting one arm gracefully as she did so and it was in that movement in the early morning light that he saw the unmistakable evidence on her body that she had borne a child barbara finally got up when she heard lynleys door open and close softly shed been lying on her side her eyes fi xed desperately upon a single spot on the wall her teeth grinding together so fiercely that her entire jaw ached she had willed conscious feeling into absolute death for the last seven hours ever since the first moment when shed heard them together in his room she walked now to the window on legs that felt numb she stared stonily out into the keldale morning the village seemed lifeless a place without colour or sound how appropriate she thought the real agony was the bed the unmistakable rhythmic creaking of his bed it went on and on until she wanted to scream to pound her fists against the wall to bring it to an end but the silence that fell just as suddenly was worse it beat against her eardrums in angry pulsations that she finally came to recognise as the pounding of her heart and then the bed again endlessly and the womans muffl ed cry she put a dry hot hand onto the windowpane and felt with listless surprise the damp cool glass her fingers slipped left streaks she examined them meticulously so much for his unrequited love for deborah barbara thought acidly christ i must have been absolutely out of my mind when had he ever been more than what hed been last night a real stud a bona fide bull a hard hot stallion of a man who had to prove his virility between the legs of every woman he met well you proved it last night inspector took her directly up to heaven three or four times didnt you youve got solid gold talent all right she laughed soundlessly mirthlessly it was a pleasure really to discover that he was just what shed always assumed him to be an alley cat on the prowl for any female in heat cleverly disguised under a refulgent veneer of upperclass breeding but what a thin veneer it was after all scratch the surface of the man and the truth oozed out the bath began running noisily in the next room a rushing of water that sounded to barbara like a burst of applause she stirred turned from the window and made her decision about how to face the day were going to have to take the house apart one room at a time lynley said they were in the study havers had gone to the bookshelves and was sullenly flipping through a dogeared brontë he watched her other than monosyllabic expressionless replies to every remark hed made at breakfast she had said nothing at all the fragile thread of communication they had established between them seemed to be utterly broken to make matters worse shed returned to her hideous light blue suit and ridiculous coloured tights havers he said sharply are you listening to me her head turned with slow insolence to every wordinspector then start with the kitchen one of the two places where a little woman belongs whats that supposed to mean not a thing she left the room his eyes followed her perplexed what in gods name had got into the woman they had been working so well together but now she was acting as if she could hardly wait to throw it all away and return to uniform it made no sense webberly was offering her a chance to redeem herself given that why would she deliberately attempt to prove justifi able every prejudice held against her by the other dis at the yard he muttered an oath and summarily dismissed her from his thoughts st james would be in newby wiske by now the corpse of the dog wrapped in a polystyrene shroud in the boot of the escort and robertas clothing in a cardboard carton on the rear seat he would perform the autopsy supervise the tests and report the results with his usual efficiency thank god st jamess involvement would ensure that at least something in the case was handled correctly chief constable kerridge of the yorkshire constabulary had been only too delighted to hear that allcourtst james would be coming to use their wellequipped lab anything lynley thought to put another nail in niess coffin he shook his head in disgust went to william teyss desk and opened the top drawer it held no secrets there were scissors pencils a wrinkled map of the county a typewriter ribbon and a roll of tape the map caused a flurry of shortlived interest and he unfolded it eagerly perhaps it marked out a careful search for teyss older daughter but it was unmarred by any cryptogrammic message that indicated the location of a missing girl the other drawers were as devoid of pertinent facts as the first a pot of glue two boxes of unused christmas cards three packets of photographs taken on the farm account books records of lambing a roll of aging breath mints but nothing of gillian he leaned back in the chair his eyes fell on the bookstand and the bible it held struck by a thought he opened it to the previously marked page and pharaoh said unto joseph forasmuch as god hath showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou art thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than thou and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it on josephs hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of egypt seeking guidance from the lord lynley looked up havers was leaning against the study door her shapeless body silhouetted sharply by the morning light her face a blank have you finished the kitchen he asked thought id take a break she sauntered into the room got a smoke on you he handed her his cigarette case absently and went to the bookshelves running his eyes over them seeking a volume of shakespeare he found it and began looking is daze a redhead inspector it took a moment for the odd question to strike him when he looked up havers was back at the door running her fi ngers meditatively against the wood apparently indifferent to whatever answer he might give i beg your pardon she flipped open the cigarette case and read its inscription darling thomas well always have paris wont we daze coldly she met his eyes it was then that he noticed how pale she was how the skin beneath her eyes was dark with fatigue how the gold case shook in her hand aside from her rather hackneyed use of bogart is she a redhead havers repeated i only ask because you seem to prefer them or is the truth that anyone will do horrified lynley realised too late what the change in her was and his own responsibility for having brought it about there was nothing he could say there was no quick answer he could give but he could tell at once that none was necessary for she had every intention of continuing without his response havers she held up a hand to stop him she was deathly white her features looked fl at her voice was tight you know its really poor form not to go to the womans room for your trysts inspector im surprised you didnt know that with your experience i should think that a little social nicety like that would be the last thing youd forget of course its just a small lapse and it probably doesnt really bother a woman at all not when its compared with the ecstatic experience of fucking you he recoiled from the brutal ugliness that her tone gave the word im sorry barbara he said why be sorry she forced a guttural laugh no one thinks about listeners in the heat of passion i know i never do she gave a brittle smile and it certainly was the old heat of passion last night wasnt it i couldnt believe it when you two started banging away on a second go and so soon lord you barely gave it a rest he watched her move to the shelf and run a finger along the spine of a book i didnt know you could hear us i apologise barbara im terribly sorry she swung back to him quickly why be sorry she repeated her voice louder this time you arent on duty twentyfour hours a day and besides its not really your fault is it how were you to know stepha would howl like a banshee nonetheless it was never my intention to hurt your feelings you havent hurt my feelings at all she laughed shrilly where on earth did you get an idea like that lets say youve merely piqued my interest as i listened to you sending stepha to the moonwas it three times or fouri wondered if deborah used to howl as well it was a wild shot in the dark but the barb had gone home he knew that she saw it for her face blazed with triumph thats hardly your concern is it of course not i know that but during your second session with stephait was at least an hour wasnt iti couldnt help thinking about poor old simon he must have to struggle like hell to follow your act youve certainly done your homework havers ill say that much for you and when you take off the gloves you do shoot to kill or am i mixing my metaphors dont you patronise me dont you dare she shouted just who the hell do you think you are your superior officer for a start oh thats right inspector nows the time to pull rank well what shall i do shall i get to work in here dont mind if im not quite up to par i didnt sleep well last night she pulled a book angrily from the shelf it toppled to the floor he could see she was struggling not to cry barbara she continued to pull books down to turn the pages savagely to drop them to the floor they were mildewed and damp filling the air with the unpleasant odour of neglect listen to me youve done good work so far dont be foolish now she pivoted trembling whats that supposed to mean you have a chance to be back in cid dont throw it away because youre angry with me im not angry with you i dont give a shit about you of course not i didnt mean to imply that you did we both know why i was assigned to you anyway they wanted a woman on the case and they knew i was safe she spat the word out the minute this is over im back on the street what are you talking about come on inspector im not stupid ive looked in a few mirrors he was astonished at the implication behind her words do you think youve been brought back to cid because webberly believes id take any other female officer to bed she didnt respond is that what you think he repeated the silence continued dammit havers its what i know she shouted but what webberly doesnt know is that any blonde or brunette is safe with you these days not just pigs like me its redheads youve a taste for redheads like stepha replacements for the one that youve lost that has nothing to do with this conversation it has everything to do with it if you werent so desperate to have deborah back you wouldnt have spent half the night pounding stepha into pulp and we wouldnt be having this whole bleeding discussion then lets drop it shall we ive apologised youve made your feelings and beliefs bizarre as they areabsolutely clear i think weve said enough oh thats damned convenient to call me bizarre she cried bitterly what about you you wont marry a woman because her fathers in service you watch your very own friend fall in love with her instead you spend the rest of your life racked with misery over it and then you decide to call me bizarre your facts arent quite straight he said icily oh ive got all the facts i need and when i string them together bizarre is just the word id use to describe them fact one youre in love with deborah st james and dont bother to deny it fact two shes married to someone else fact three you obviously had a love affair with her which leads us inescapably to fact four you damn well could have married her but you chose not to and youre going to pay for that stupid narrowminded upperclass decision for the rest of your bleeding goddamn life you seem to have a great deal of confi dence in my fatal attraction for women any woman who sleeps with me is only too willing to become my wife is that correct dont you laugh at me she shrieked her eyes squeezed shut in rage im not laughing at you im also not spending another moment discussing this with you he started for the door oh thats it run away thats just what id expect of you lynley go have it off with stepha again or what about helen does she pop a red wig on so you can get it up does she let you call her deb he felt anger like a current shooting through his veins he drove himself towards calm by looking at his watch havers im going to newby wiske to see the results of st jamess tests that gives you aboutshall we say three hours to tear this house apart and fi nd me somethinganything haversthat leads me to gillian teys since you have such a remarkable ability to gather facts out of thin air that should prove to be no problem whatsoever for you if however you have nothing to report within three hours consider yourself sacked is that clear why not sack me right now and have done with it then she shrilled because i like to look forward to my pleasures he walked over to her took his cigarette case from her limp hand daze is blonde he said she snorted i fi nd that hard to believe does she wear a red wig for those intimate moments i dont know he turned the cigarette case over in his hand so that the old ornate a engraved on its cover was face up but its an interesting question if my father were still alive id ask him this was his daze is my mother he picked up the volume of shakespeare and left barbara stared after him motionless waiting for the pounding of her blood to stop slowly coming to terms with ther terrible enormity of what she had done youve done good work so far you have a chance to be back on cid dont throw it away because youre angry with me and isnt that exactly what she had done the need to rage at him to castigate him to rail against his attraction to a beautiful woman had overcome every good intention that she had ever possessed in setting to work on the case what in gods name had come over her was she jealous had there been one insane moment when she had been so foolish as to think that lynley might ever look at her and not see her for what she truly was a plain dumpy woman angry at the world bitter and friendless and terribly alone had she possibly harboured a secret hope that he might come to care for her is that what had driven her to attack him this morning the thought was patently absurd it couldnt be it wasnt possible she knew enough about him not to be that ignorant she felt drained it was this house she decided it was having to come and work in this dwelling place of ghouls five minutes here and she was ready to snap and snarl to climb the walls to tear wildly at her hair she went to the study door and looked across the sitting room to tessas shrine the woman smiled at her kindly but wasnt there just a touch of victory in her eyes wasnt it as if tessa had known all along that she could do nothing but fail once she walked into this house and felt its silence and chill three hours hed said three hours to fi nd the secret of gillian teys she laughed bitterly at the thought tasting the sound in the empty air he knew that she would fail that he would have the enjoyment of sending her back to london back to uniform back to disgrace so what was the point of trying at all why not leave now rather than give him the pleasure she threw herself down on the sittingroom couch tessas image watched her sympathetically butwhat if she could find gillian what if where lynley himself had failed she was able to succeed would it really matter then if he sent her back to the streets wouldnt she know once and for all that she was good for something that she could have been part of a working team it was a thought she picked idly at the worn upholstery of the couch the sound of her fi ngers scratching at the threads was the only noise in the house except for the rustling and burrowing of mice at the edge of her consciousness like a halfformed thought she looked at the stairway refl ectively they sat at a table in the corner of the keys and candle newby wiskes central and most thriving pub most of the lunchtime crowd had thinned out and aside from themselves only the regulars remained hunched over the bar to nurse pints of bitters they pushed their plates to one side of the table and deborah poured the coffee that had just been placed before them outside the cook and the dishwasher dumped rubbish into the bin arguing loudly over the merits of a threeyearold who would be running at newmarket and upon whom the cook had evidently invested a considerable sum of his most recent weeks wages st james ministered to his coffee with his usual amount of sugar lynley spoke after the fourth teaspoonful was dumped absently into the cup does he count not that ive ever noticed deborah replied st james thats appalling how can you stand it just sugaring oer the devil himself his friend replied he pulled the test results towards him i need to do something to recover from the smell of that dog you owe me for this one tommy in spades what do you have the animal bled to death from a wound in the neck it appeared to have been infl icted with a knife the blade of which was fi ve inches long not a pocketknife then i should guess a kitchen knife a butcher knife something along that line did forensics see to all the knives on the farm lynley fingered through the material from the file he had brought with him apparently but the knife in question was nowhere to be found st james looked thoughtful thats intriguing it almost suggests he paused brushing aside the idea well they have the girl admitting to killing her father they have the axe sitting right there on the fl oor with no fingerprints on it lynley interjected given but unless the rspca wants to make a case for cruelty to animals theres no real necessity to have the weapon that killed the dog youre starting to sound like nies perish the thought st james stirred his coffee and was about to apply more sugar to it when with a beatific smile his wife moved the bowl out of his reach he grumbled goodnaturedly and continued his conversation however there was something else barbiturates what barbiturates st james repeated they showed up in the drug screen here he passed the toxicology report across the table lynley read it amazed are you telling me the dog was drugged yes the amount of residual drug that showed up in the tests indicates that the animal was unconscious when his throat was slit unconscious lynley scanned the report and tossed it down on the table then he couldnt have been killed to silence him hardly he wouldnt have been making a sound was there enough barbiturate to kill him had someone attempted to kill him with the drug and then having botched it decided to take a knife to the poor creature thats possible i suppose except that with everything youve told me about the case it doesnt make much sense why not because this unknown person would have had to get into the house first get the drug administer it to the dog wait for it to do the trick realise that it wasnt going to kill him go back for a knife and finish the job off what was the dog doing all this time cooperatively waiting to have his throat slit wouldnt he have been barking raising the devil wait youre too far ahead of me why would the person have to go into the house for the drug because it was the very same drug that william teys had taken and he kept his sleeping pills in the house not in the barn i should think lynley assimilated this perhaps someone brought it with him perhaps i suppose the person could have administered it to the dog waited for it to take effect slit the dogs throat and waited for teys to come out to the barn between ten and midnight what would teys be doing in the barn between ten and midnight looking for the dog why why the barn why not in the village where the dog always went why look for him at all in fact everyone says that the dog wandered freely why would he have suddenly been worried about him on this one night st james shrugged what teys was up to is a moot point if your attention is fi xed on finding the killer of the animal only one person could have killed that dogroberta outside the pub st james spread the tentlike dress over the boot of lynleys car oblivious of the curious stares of a group of elderly tourists who passed in pursuit of pictorial souvenirs cameras slung round their necks he pointed to the stain on the inside elbow of the left sleeve to the poollike stain between waist and knees and to the same substance on the right white cuff all of these test as the dogs blood tommy he turned to his wife my love will you demonstrate as you did in the lab on this bit of lawn deborah cooperatively dropped to her knees resting back on her heels her rich umber dress billowed out and spread on the ground like a mantle st james moved behind her a willing dog would make this easier to imagine but well do our best robertawho had access to her fathers sleeping pills i should guesswould have given the dog the drug earlier in his dinner perhaps she would have had to make sure the animal stayed in the barn it wouldnt have done to have had the creature keel over in the village somewhere once the dog was unconscious she would kneel down on the ground just as deborah has done only that particular posture could give us the stains in the precise places they appear on her dress she would lift the dogs head and hold it in the crook of her arm he gently bent deborahs arm to demonstrate then with her right hand she would cut the dogs throat thats insane lynley said hoarsely why wait a moment tommy the dogs head is turned away from her she drives the knife into his throat which results in the pool of blood on the skirt of her dress she pulls the knife upward with her right hand until the job is done he pointed to specific areas on deborahs dress we have blood on the elbow where the head was cradled blood on the skirt where it poured from the neck and blood on the right sleeve and cuff from where she drove the knife in and continued the path of the slash st james touched his wifes hair lightly thank you my love he helped her to her feet lynley walked back to the car and examined the dress frankly it doesnt make a great deal of sense why on earth would she do it are you saying the girl dressed herself up on a saturday night in her best sunday clothes calmly went out to the barn and slit the throat of a dog shed loved since childhood he looked up why i cant answer that i cant tell you what she was thinking only what she had to have done but couldnt she have gone out to the barn found the dog dead and in her panic picked him up cradled him and got the blood all over herself then there was a fractional pause possibly but unlikely but its possible it is possible yes but unlikely tommy what scenario do you have then deborah and st james exchanged uneasy glances in which lynley saw that they had discussed the case and were of a mutual opinion they were reluctant to share well he demanded are you saying that roberta killed her dog that her father came to the barn and discovered the deed that they got into a tremendous row and then she beheaded him no no its quite possible that roberta didnt kill her father at all but she was defi nitely present when it happened she had to have been why because his blood is all over the bottom of her dress perhaps she went to the barn found his body and fell to her knees in shock st james shook his head that idea doesnt wash why not he pointed to the garment on the back of the car look at the pattern teyss blood is in splatters you know what that means as well as i it only got there one way lynley was silent for a moment she was standing by when it happened he concluded she had to have been if indeed she didnt do it herself then she was standing right there when someone else did is she protecting someone tommy deborah asked seeing the expression on lynleys face he didnt reply at once he was thinking of patterns patterns of words patterns of images patterns of behaviours he was thinking of what a person learns and when he learns it and when it emerges into practical use he was thinking of knowledge and how it ultimately inevitably combines with experience and points to what is incontrovertible truth he roused himself to answer the question with one of his own st james what would you do how far would you go to save deborah it was a dangerous query its risk was deadly these were waters perhaps best left unexplored forty thousand brothers is that where we are with it now st james voice was unchanged but the angles of his face were a warning finely drawn and grim how far would you go lynley insisted tommy dont deborah put out her hand a gesture to stop him from going any further to stop him from doing irreparable damage to the delicate crystal of their friable peace would you hold back the truth would you lay down your life how far would you go to save deborah st james looked at his wife the colour had completely drained from her face her sprinkling of freckles danced across her nose her eyes were haunted with tears and he understood this was no grappling in an elsinore grave but the question primeval id do anything he replied his eyes on his wife by god yes i would id do anything lynley nodded people generally do dont they for the ones they love most he chose tchaikovsky symphony no pathetique he smiled as the swelling of the first movement filled the car helen would never have allowed it darling tommy absolutely not she would have protested lets not drive our mutual depression right into suicide then she would have resolutely rooted through all of his tapes to find something suitably uplifting invariably strauss played at full volume with helen making her usual assortment of amusing remarks over the din just picture them tommy flitting through the woods in their little tutus its positively religious today however the heavy theme of pathetique with its relentless exploration of mans spiritual suffering suited his mood he couldnt remember the last time he had felt so burdened by a case it felt as if a tremendous weight having nothing whatsoever to do with the responsibility of getting to the bottom of the matter were pressing upon his heart he knew the source murderits atavistic nature and ineffable consequenceswas a hydra each head ruthlessly cut off in an effort to reach the prodigious doglike body of culpability left in its place two heads more venomous than the last but unlike so many of his previous cases in which mere rote suffi ced to see him sear his way to the core of evilstopping the flow of blood allowing no further growth and leaving him personally untouched by the encounterthis case spoke to him far more intimately he knew instinctively that the death of william teys was merely one of the heads of the serpent and the knowledge that eight others waited to do battle with himand more than that that he had not even come to know the true nature of the evil he facedfilled him with a sense of trepidation but he knew himself well enough to know that there was more to his desolation and despair than the death of a man in a keldale barn there was havers to be dealt with but beyond havers there was the truth for underneath her bitter unfounded accusations her ugliness and hurt the words she spoke rang with veracity had he not indeed spent the last year of his life fruitlessly seeking a replacement for deborah not in the way havers had suggested but in a way far more dishonest than an inconsequential coupling in which two bodies meet experience momentary pleasure and separate to lead their individual lives untouched and unchanged by the encounter that at least was an expression of some sort a giving of the moment no matter how brief but for the last year of his life he had given nothing to anyone behind his behaviour wasnt the reality that he had maintained his isolated celibacy this last long year not because of deborah but because he had become high priest in a religion of one a celebrant caught up in devotion to the past in this twisted religion he had held up every woman in his life to unforgiving scrutiny and had found each one wanting in comparison to deborah not the real deborah but a mystical goddess who lived only in his mind he saw now that he had not wished to forget the past that he had done everything instead to keep it alive as if his intention had always been to make it not deborah his bride he was sick at heart with the sickness came the realisation that there were facts to be faced about stepha as well but he could not bring himself to them not yet as the final movement of the symphony came to a close he turned down the winding road from the moors into keldale autumn leaves flew from under the cars wheels leaving a cloud of red gold and yellow billowing behind him promising winter he pulled in front of the lodge and spent a moment gazing at the windows numbly wondering how and when he was going to piece together the fragments of his life havers must have been watching for him from the lounge for she came to the door as soon as he switched off the cars ignition he groaned and steeled himself to another confrontation but she gave him no chance to make preliminary remarks ive found gillian she announced she had somehow survived the morning the dreadful row with lynley followed by the horrors of robertas bedroom had served to wear down her anger and wretchedness abrading them both into a dull detachment she knew he was going to sack her anyway she certainly deserved it but before he did she would prove to him that she could be a decent ds in order to do that however there was this one last meeting to get through this one last opportunity to show her stuff she watched lynleys eyes roam over the unusual collection of items spread out on one of the tables in the lounge the album containing the defaced family pictures a dogeared and wellthumbed novel the photograph from robertas chest of drawers the additional one of the two sisters and a collection of six yellowed newspaper pages all folded and shaped to the identical size seventeen by twentytwo inches lynley absently felt in his pocket for his cigarettes lit one and sat down on the couch what is this sergeant he asked i think these are the facts on gillian she responded her voice was carefully modulated but a slight quaver in it caught his attention she cleared her throat to hide it youre going to need to enlighten me im afraid he said cigarette her fingers itched to feel the cylinder of tobacco her body ached for the soothing smoke but she knew if she lit one it would betray her shaking hands no thank you she replied she took a breath kept her eyes on his noncommittal face and went on how does your man denton line your chest of drawers with some sort of paper i should guess ive never noticed but it isnt newspaper is it she sat down opposite him squeezing her hands into fi sts in her lap feeling the sharp crescent pain of nails biting palms it wouldnt be because the newsprint would come off on your clothes true so i was intrigued when you mentioned that robertas drawers were lined with newspapers and i remembered stepha saying that roberta used to come every day for the guardian until paul odell died then she stopped barbara pushed her hair back behind her ears it was quite unimportant she told herself if he didnt believe her if he laughed at the conclusions she had drawn after nearly three hours in that horrible room except that i dont think the reason she stopped coming for the guardian had anything to do with paul odell i think it was gillian his eyes drifted to the newspapers and barbara saw him take in what she herself had noticed that roberta had lined her drawers with the classified section moreover although there were six pieces of newspaper on the table they were duplicates of only two pages of the guardian as if something memorable had appeared in a single issue and roberta had collected that days edition from the villagers to keep as souvenirs the personal column lynley murmured by god havers gillian sent her a message barbara pulled one of the sheets towards her and ran her finger down the column r look at the advert g she read i think thats the message look at the advertisement what advertisement she reached for a representation of the second saved page this one i think he read it dated nearly four years previously it was a small square announcement of a meeting in harrogate a panel discussion involving a group from an organisation called testament house the members of the panel were listed but gillian teys was not among them lynley looked up his brown eyes frankly quizzical youve lost me sergeant her eyebrows lifted in surprise arent you familiar with testament house never mind i keep forgetting that you havent been in uniform in years testament house is run out of fitzroy square by an anglican priest he used to teach at university but evidently one day one of his students asked him why he wasnt bothering to practise what he preachedfeeding the hungry and clothing the nakedand he decided that was something in his life that he ought to address so he started testament house which is an organisation that collects runaways teenaged prostitutesboth male and femaledrug abusers of every colour and shape and everyone else under the age of twentyone whos hanging about aimlessly in trafalgar or piccadilly or in any of the stations just waiting to be preyed on by a pimp or a whore hes been doing it for years the uniformed police all know him we always took kids to him hes the reverend george clarence thats listed here i take it she nodded he goes out on fundraising tours for the organisation do i understand you to mean that you believe gillian teys was picked up by this group in london iyes i do why it had taken her ages to find the advertisement ages longer to decipher its signifi cance and now everythingmost especially her career she admitteddepended upon lynleys willingness to believe because of this name she pointed to the third on the list of panelists nell graham yes im completely in the dark i think nell graham was the message roberta was waiting for she faithfully searched the paper each day for years waiting to see what had happened to her sister nell graham told her it meant gillian had survived why nell graham why not he glanced at the other names terence hanover caroline paulson or margaret crist havers picked up the battered novel from the table because none of those were born of one of the brontës she tapped the book the tenant of wildfell hall is about helen huntington a woman who breaks the social code of her time and leaves her alcoholic husband to start a new life she falls in love with a man who knows nothing about her past who knows only the name she has chosen for herself helen graham nell graham inspector she finished and waited in agony for his reponse when it came nothing could have surprised her more could have disarmed her more quickly bravo barbara he said softly his eyes lit and a smile breaking over his face he leaned forward earnestly whats your theory on how she came to be involved with this group the relief was so tremendous that barbara found she had begun trembling from head to toe she took a ragged breath and somehow found her voice myi suspect that gillian had enough money to get to london but that ran out fairly soon they may have picked her up off the street somewhere or in one of the stations but wouldnt they return her to her father thats not how testament house works they encourage the kids to go home or at least to phone their parents and let them know theyre all right but no one is forced to do it if they choose to stay at testament they just have to obey the rules no questions asked but gillian left home at sixteen if she is this nell graham she would have been twentythree when she was on this panel in harrogate does it make sense that she would have stayed with testament house for all those years if she had no one else it makes perfect sense if she wanted a family they were her best bet at any rate theres only one way we can know for sure talk to her he finished promptly he got to his feet get your things together well leave in ten minutes he rooted through the file and took out the photograph of russell mowrey and his family give this to webberly when you get to london he said as he scribbled a message on the back when i get to london her heart sank he was giving her the sack then hed as much as promised that after their encounter at the farm it was indeed all she could expect lynley looked up all business you found her sergeant you can bring her back to keldale i think gillians the only way were going to get through to roberta dont you agree iwhat about she stopped herself afraid to believe the meaning behind his words you dont want to phone webberly have someone else go there yourself ive too many things to see to here you can see to gillian if nell graham is gillian hurry up weve got to get to york so you can catch the train buthow should i what approach should i use should i simply he waved her off i trust your judgment sergeant just bring her back as quickly as you can she unclenched her hands aware of the numbing relief sweeping over her yes sir she heard her voice whisper he tapped his fingers against the steering wheel and regarded the house cresting its smooth slope of lawn by driving like the devil he had managed to get havers on the three oclock train for london and now he sat in front of the mowrey home trying to decide how best to approach the woman inside wasnt the truth after all better than the silence had he not at least learned that she met him at the door the wary glance that she cast back over her shoulder told him he was far less welcome than when they had previously met my children are just home from school she said in explanation and stepped outside pulling the door shut behind her she drew her cardigan firmly round her slender body it was like the body of a child have youis there word about russell he reminded himself that he couldnt have expected her to ask about her daughter tessa of all people had said goodbye to the past had made a surgical cut and walked away cleanly you need to involve the police mrs mowrey she paled he couldnt he didnt you must telephone the police i cant i cant she whispered fi ercely hes not with his relatives in london is he she shook her head briefly once and kept her face averted have they heard from him at all again the same response then isnt it best to find out where he is when she didnt reply he took her arm and led her gently towards the drive why did william keep all those keys what keys there was a box of them on the shelf in his wardrobe but there are no keys anywhere in the rest of the house do you know why she bent her head put a hand to her brow those id forgotten she murmured iit was because of gillians tantrum when was this she must have been seven no she was nearly eight i remember because i was pregnant with roberta it was one of those situations that come up out of nowhere and are blown all out of proportion the kind that families laugh about later when the children are grown i remember william said at dinner gilly well read from the bible tonight i was sitting theredaydreaming probably and expected her to say yes papa as she always did but she decided that she wouldnt read the bible that night and william decided just as definitely that she would she became absolutely hysterical about it ran to her room and locked the door and then gilly had never disobeyed her father before poor william simply sat there astonished he didnt seem to know how to handle it what did you do nothing that helped particularly as i recall i went to gillys room but she wouldnt let me in shed only scream that she wouldnt read the bible any longer and that no one could make her then she threw things at the door ii went back down to william she looked at lynley with an expression that combined both perplexity and admiration as she went on you know william never scolded her that wasnt his way but he later took the keys from all the doors he said if the house had burned down that night and he hadnt been able to get to gilly because shed locked her door he would never have forgiven himself did they go back to reading the bible after that she shook her head he never asked gilly to read the bible after that did he read it with you no just alone a girl had come to the door as they spoke a piece of bread in her hand and a thin line of jam traced across her upper lip she was small like her mother but with her fathers dark hair and intelligent eyes she watched them curiously mummy she called her voice was sweet and clear is anything wrong is it daddy no darling tessa called back hastily ill be in in a moment she turned to lynley how well did you know richard gibson he asked her williams nephew as well as anyone could have known richard i suppose he was a quiet boy but immensely likable with a wonderful sense of humour as i recall gilly quite adored him why do you ask because william left the farm to him not to roberta her brow furrowed but why not to gilly gillian ran away from home when she was sixteen mrs mowrey no one ever heard from her again tessa drew in a breath it was sharp and quick like the reaction to an unexpected blow her eyes fixed themselves on lynley no she said it was not so much denial as disbelief he continued richard had been gone for a time as well to the fens theres a chance that gillian followed him there and then perhaps went on to london but why whatever happened what could have happened he considered how much to tell her ive got the impression he said spacing the words delicately that she was involved with richard somehow and william found out if thats the case he would have torn richard limb from limb suppose he did find out and richard knew what his reaction would be would that be enough for richard to leave the village i should think so but it doesnt explain why william left the farm to him and not to roberta does it it was apparently a bargain hed struck with gibson roberta would continue to live there for her lifetime with richard and his family but the land would go to the gibsons but certainly roberta would marry someday it hardly seems fair surely william would have wanted the land to remain in the immediate family to be passed on to his grandchildren if not to gillys children then to robertas even as she spoke lynley realised what a vast chasm the nineteen years of her absence had caused she knew nothing of roberta nothing of the girls hidden storehouse of food nothing of her vacant rocking catatonia roberta was just a name to her mother a name who would marry have children grow old she was not at all real she did not actually exist did you never think about them he asked her she looked down at her feet employing in the act an intensity that suggested all of her concentration was centered on the smooth rusty suede of her shoes when she didnt reply he persisted did you never wonder how they were mrs mowrey did you never imagine what they looked like or how theyd grown up she shook her head once sharply and when she answered him at last in a voice so controlled that it spoke volumes on the emotion she had spent on the subject she kept her eyes on the minster in the distance i couldnt let myself do that inspector i knew they were safe i knew they were well so i let them die i had to if i wanted to survive can you understand a few days ago he would have said no and that would have been the truth of the matter but that was not the case now yes he replied i do understand he nodded to her in farewell and walked back to his car inspector he turned his hand on the door handle you know where russell is dont you she read the answer in his face but she listened instead to the lie no he responded ezra farmington lived directly across from the dove and whistle in the council house that abutted against marsha fitzalans like hers its front garden was planted and cared for but with less detailed concern as if the man had started out with the best of intentions but they along with the plants had become the worse for wear bushes were thriving but overgrown weeds were assaulting the flower beds dead annuals needed to be uprooted and discarded and a small patch of lawn was looking long enough to be considered a potential source of fodder farmington was not at all pleased to see him he opened the door to lynleys knock and placed his body squarely in the frame over his shoulder lynley saw that the other man had been going through his work for dozens of watercolours were spread upon the sitting room couch and scattered on the fl oor some were torn into shreds others were crumpled into tight angry balls still others were abandoned to meet their fate underfoot it was a haphazard purging of artistic effort however because the artist himself was more than halfway drunk inspector farmington asked with deliberate politeness may i come in the man shrugged why not he opened the door wider and gestured lynley inside with a lackadaisical sweep scuse the mess just cleaning out the crap lynley stepped over several paintings from four years ago he asked blandly it was the right choice of time farmingtons face told him so in the sudden flare of nostrils and the movement of lips whats that sposed to mean he was just on the edge of slurring his words and perhaps noticing this himself he sought control visibly what time was it when you and william teys argued lynley asked ignoring the mans question time ezra shrugged no idea drink insinspector he smiled glassily and stiffl y crossed the room to pour himself a tumbler of gin no you dont mind if i thank you he gulped back a mouthful coughed and laughed swiping at his mouth so savagely with his wrist that the movement was as good as a blow pulin wimp can even handle a drink you were coming down from high kel moor thats not a walk you would make in the dark is it course not and you heard music from the farmhouse ha he waved his glass at lynley whole screamin band inspector thought i was in the middle of a fl ipping parade did you see only teys no one else are we counting sweet nigel bringing the doggie home aside from nigel nope he lifted his glass and drained it course roberta was probaly inside the house changing the records poor fat slob she wasnt much good for anything else cept his bleary eyes twinkled swinging an axe and sending papa into the great beyond he laughed at his comment like lizzie borden he added and laughed louder still lynley wondered why the man was being deliberately repugnant wondered what was motivating him to go to such great lengths to develop and then display a side of his character so ugly as to be intolerable hatred and anger were the foundation here and a contempt so virulent that it was like a third person in the room farmington was obviously a talented man and yet a man blindly bent upon destroying the single creative force that gave his life meaning as he clutched at himself with callous nonchalance and stumbled in the direction of the lavatory lynley looked at the paintings he left behind and saw the source of the mans despair in the studies the artist could not bring himself to destroy they were done from every possible angle in charcoal pencil pastels and paint they chronicled movement passion and desire and bore witness to the anguish of the artists soul they were all of stepha odell when lynley heard the mans returning footsteps he forced his eyes from the work and his mind away from the implication instead he made himself look at farmington and in doing so he saw the other man clearly for the first time womaniser and hypocrite using past pain as an excuse for present behaviour he saw that farmington was at best his own mirror image his second self the man indeed he could choose to become from kings cross station barbara took the northern line to warren street fitzroy square was only a few minutes walk from there she spent that time meditating on a plan of attack it was clear that gillian teys was involved in this situation up to her neck but that was going to be extremely diffi cult to prove if she was smart enough to disappear from sight for eleven years certainly she was smart enough to have a castiron alibi for the night in question it seemed to barbara that the best approachif indeed gillian was nell graham and if she could be located using the scant information they hadwas to give her no choice arrest her if necessary in order to get her back to keldale that night she thought about everything that had been said about gillian about her delinquent behaviour her sexual licence and her ability to hide both under an exterior of angelic refi nement there was only one way to deal with someone that clever be tough be aggressive be absolutely ruthless fitzroy squarea tidily renovated patch of camden townwas an unusual spot to fi nd a home for stray teenagers twenty years before when the square had still been a postwar rectangle of sagging buildings grubby pavements and empty windowboxes a home for the fl otsam and jetsam of london life would be what one would expect to find but now when the entire face of the square was crisp and new when the lovely green in the centre was carefully fenced off against vagrants when every building was freshly painted and every burnished door gleamed in the fading light of the day it was hard to believe that societys forgotten and unwanted frightened and pained still lived here number was the home of testament house a georgian building whose front was covered with scaffolding a rubbish bin overflowing with plaster empty paint tins cardboard cartons and dropcloths gave evidence to the fact that testament house was joining its neighbours in an architectural renaissance the front door stood open and from within came the sound of music not the rowdy rockandroll one might have expected from a gathering place for runaway teenagers but the delicate strains of classical guitar and the kind of quiet that spoke of an audience held spellbound however those on this weeks kitchen duty were not taking part in the recital above stairs barbara guessed for even outside the air was rich with the aroma of tomato sauce and spices sure indication of the evenings fare she walked up the two steps and entered the building the long hallway was covered with an old red runner worn so thin in places that the wood of the floor beneath showed through walls were bare of decoration save bulletin boards that held employment information messages received and announcements posted a schedule of classes at the university of gower street was given the most prominent position with large cardboard arrows pointing to it encouragingly nearby clinics drug programs and planned parenthood offices were advertised for inhabitants and the telephone number of a suicide hotline was printed repeatedly on tearoff sheets at the bottom of the board most of them barbara noted were gone hello a voice called cheerfully need some help barbara turned to find a plump middleaged woman leaning over the reception counter pushing a pair of hornrimmed spectacles to the top of her clipped grey hair her smile was welcoming but it faded immediately when her eyes fell upon the warrant card that barbara produced above them the intricate music continued is there some sort of trouble the woman asked i suppose you want mr clarence no barbara replied that may not be necessary im looking for this young woman her name is gillian teys but we think she may be using the name nell graham she handed over the photograph a gesture she knew would be unnecessary for the moment she had said the name the other womans expression had altered and revealed nonetheless she looked at the photograph cooperatively yes this is nell she said in spite of having been so certain barbara felt a surge of triumph can you tell me how to locate her its quite important that i fi nd her as soon as possible shes not in trouble is she its important that i find her barbara said again oh yes of course i suppose you cant tell me its only that the woman fi ngered her chin nervously let me get jonah she said impulsively this is his concern before barbara could reply the woman was running up the stairs in a moment the guitar music stopped abruptly to a storm of protesting voices and then laughter that was followed by the sound of footsteps the hushed voice of the receptionist was met by a mans response when he came into sight on the stairway barbara saw that he was the musician for he carried a fine guitar over his shoulder he was far too young to be the reverend george clarence but he wore clerical garb and his marked resemblance to the founder of testament house indicated to barbara that this must be the mans son for here were the same chiselled features the same broad expanse of forehead the same quick glance that assimilated and evaluated within an instant even his hair was the same parted on the left with an unruly tuft that no comb could discipline he was not a big man probably no more than fi ve feet eight inches tall and his build was slight but there was something about the way he held his body that indicated the presence of an inner core of strength and selfconfi dence he strode down the hall and extended his hand jonah clarence he said his grip was firm mother tells me youre looking for nell mrs clarence had removed her spectacles from their perch on the top of her head she chewed on the earpiece unconsciously as she listened to their conversation her brow creased and her eyes moving back and forth between them as they spoke barbara handed him the photograph this is gillian teys she said her father was murdered three weeks ago in yorkshire and shes going to have to come with me for some questioning clarence greeted the statement with no strong visible reaction beyond what appeared to be an inability to take his eyes from barbaras face but he made himself do so made himself look at the picture then his eyes met his mothers its nell jonah she murmured my dearest her voice was laced with compassion clarence handed the photograph back to barbara but spoke to his mother it had to happen one day didnt it he said his tone was coloured by emotion darling shall ido you want to he shook his head i was just about to leave anyway he said and looked at barbara ill take you to nell shes my wife lynley gazed at the painting of keldale abbey and wondered why he had been so blind to its message the paintings beauty lay in its utter simplicity its devotion to detail its refusal to distort or romanticise the crumbling ruin to make it anything other than what it was a vestige of time dead being devoured by time to come skeletal walls arched against a desolate sky straining to lift themselves out of the inevitable end that waited for them on the ground below they fought against flora ferns that grew stubbornly out of barren crevices wildflowers that bloomed on the edge of transept walls grass that grew thickly and mingled with wild parsley on the very stones where monks had once knelt in prayer steps led to nowhere curving stairways that once had carried the devoted from cloister to parlour from day room to court now sank into mosscovered oblivion submitting to changes that did not make them ignoble but merely moulded them into a different shape and a purpose changed windows were gone where long ago stained glass had proudly enclosed presbytery and quire nave and transept nothing remained but gaping holes gazing sightlessly out onto a landscape which rightfully proclaimed that it alone had ascendancy in the battle with time how did one really define the remains of keldale abbey was it the plundered ruin of a glorious past or a tumbling promise of what the future could be wasnt it all lynley thought in the defi nition he stirred at the sound of a car stopping at the lodge of doors opening and the murmur of voices of uneven footsteps approaching he realised that darkness was falling in the lounge and switched on one of the lamps just as st james entered the room he was alone as lynley had known he would be they faced each other across a short expanse of inoffensive carpeting across a virtual chasm created and maintained by one mans guilt and another mans pain they both knew and recognised these components of their history and as if to escape them lynley went behind the bar and poured each of them a whisky he crossed the room and handed it to his friend is she outside he asked shes gone to the church knowing deborah to have one last look at the graveyard i expect were off tomorrow lynley smiled youve been braver than i hank would have driven me off within the first five minutes are you fleeing to the lakes no to york for a day then back to london im to be in court to testify on monday morning i need a bit of time to complete a fibre analysis before then rotten luck to have had so few days weve the rest of our lives deborah understands lynley nodded and looked from st james to the windows in which they saw themselves reflected two men so entirely different from each other who shared an afflicted past and who could if he chose share a full rich future it was all he decided in the defi nition he tossed back the rest of his drink thank you for your help today st james he said finally extending his hand you and deborah are wonderful friends jonah clarence drove them to islington in his dilapidated morris it wasnt a very long drive and he was quiet for every moment of it his hands on the wheel showing white knuckles that betrayed his distress they lived on a peculiar little street called keystone crescent directly off caledonian road blessed with two takeaway food stores at its headexuding the multicultural odours of frying egg rolls falafel and fi sh and chips and a butcher shop at its foot on pentonville road it was located in an area of town that was arguing between industrial and residential dressmaking factories car hire firms and tool companies gave way to streets which were trying very hard to become fashionable keystone crescent was just that a crescent lined on one side with concave and on the other with a convex terrace of houses all were fenced by identical wrought iron and where once diminutive gardens had bloomed concrete paving provided additional parking for cars the buildings were sooty brick two storeys tall topped by dormer windows and a thin scalloping of ornamentation at the roofl ine each building had its own basement fl at and while some of the houses had recently been refurbished in keeping with the neighbourhood effort towards chic the one in front of which jonah clarence parked his car was defi nitely shabby whitewashed and decorated with green woodwork at one time but grimy now with two unlidded dustbins standing in front of it its this way he said tonelessly he opened the gate and led her down a set of narrow steep steps to the door of a fl at unlike the building itself which was in sad disrepair the door was sturdy freshly painted with a brass knob gleaming in its centre he unlocked and opened it gesturing barbara inside she saw at once that a great deal of care had gone into the decorating of the little home as if the occupants wanted to drive a very fi rm wedge between the exterior grubbiness of the building and the crisp clean loveliness of what existed within it walls were freshly painted floors were covered with colourful rugs white curtains hung in windows which housed a splendour of plants books photograph albums a humble stereo system a collection of phonograph records and three pieces of antique pewter occupied a low shelving unit that ran along one wall there were few pieces of furniture but each one had been clearly selected for its workmanship and beauty jonah clarence set his guitar carefully down on a stand and went to the bedroom door nell he called i was just changing darling out in a moment a womans voice replied cheerfully he looked at barbara she saw that his face had become grey and ill id like to go in no barbara said wait here please mr clarence she added when she read his determination to go to his wife he sat down on a chair moving painfully as if he had aged years in their brief twentyminute acquaintance he fixed his eyes on the door behind it brisk movement accompanied lighthearted humming a lilting rendition of onward christian soldiers drawers opened and closed a wardrobe door creaked there was a pause in the humming as footsteps approached the song finished the door opened and gillian teys returned from the dead she looked exactly like her mother but her blonde hair was quite short almost like a boys and gave her the appearance of being ten years old something that carried over to her manner of dress she wore a plaid pleated skirt a dark blue pullover and black shoes and knee socks she might have been on her way home from school darling i she froze when she saw barbara jonah is something her breathing seemed to stop she groped for the doorknob behind her barbara took a step forward scotland yard mrs clarence she said crisply id like to ask you some questions questions her hand went to her throat her blue eyes darkened what about about gillian teys her husband replied he hadnt moved from his chair who she asked in a low voice gillian teys he repeated evenly whose father was murdered in yorkshire three weeks ago nell she backed into the door stiffl y no nell no her voice grew louder barbara took another step forward stay away from me i dont know what youre talking about i dont know any gillian teys give me the picture jonah said to barbara rising she handed it to him he walked to his wife put his hand on her arm this is gillian teys he said but she turned her face from the photograph he held i dont know i dont know her voice was high with terror look at it darling gently he turned her face towards it no she screamed tore herself from his grasp and fled into the other room another door slammed a bolt was shot home wonderful barbara thought she pushed past the young man and went to the bathroom door there was silence within she rattled the handle be tough be aggressive mrs clarence come out of there no reply mrs clarence you need to listen to me your sister roberta is charged with this murder shes in barnstingham mental asylum she hasnt said a word in three weeks other than to claim to having murdered your father decapitated your father mrs clarence barbara rattled the handle

make it end jonah yes darling what is it nells dead so he broke down the door havers said lynley rubbed his throbbing forehead the last three hours had given him an appalling headache the conversation with havers was making it worse and there was a pause havers he demanded he knew that his voice was abrupt that it would sound like anger instead of the fatigue that it was he heard her catch her breath was she crying it wasshe had she cleared her throat it was a bath shed taken a bath he wondered if havers was aware of the fact that she was making no sense good god what had happened yes exceptshed used brushes on herself they were metal brushes she was bleeding god in heaven he muttered where is she havers is she all right i wanted to phone for an ambulance why didnt you for gods sake her husbandhe wasit was my fault inspector i thought that i should be tough with her iit was my fault her voice broke havers for gods sake pull yourself together there was blood shed used the brushes all over her body he wrapped her up he wouldnt let go of her he was crying she said she was dead christ he whispered i went to the phone he came after me he are you all right are you hurt he pushed me outside i fell im all right iit was my fault she came out of the bedroom i remembered everything wed said about her it seemed best to be firm with her i didnt think i didnt realise she would havers listen to me but she locked herself in there was blood in the water it was so hot there was steam how could she have stood the water that hot havers i thought i could do something right this time ive destroyed the case havent i of course not he replied although he was absolutely unconvinced that she hadnt blown their chances right into oblivion are they still at their fl at yes shall i get someone from the yard no he thought rapidly the situation could not possibly have been any worse to have found the woman after all these years and then to have this happen was infuriating he knew quite well that she represented their only hope of reaching the bottom of the case no matter the reality that insinuated itself from the pages of shakespeare only gillian could give it substance then what shall i go home go to bed ill handle this please sir he could hear the despair in her voice he couldnt help it couldnt stop it couldnt worry about it now just do as i say havers go home go to bed do not ring the yard and do not return to that flat is that clear am i then get a train back here in the morning what about gillian ill worry about gillian he said grimly and hung up the telephone he gazed down at the book in his lap hed spent the last four hours dredging up from his memory every single exposure hed had to shakespeare it was limited his interest in the elizabethans had been historical not literary and more than once during the evening he had cursed the educational path he had taken all those years ago at oxford wishing for expertise in an area that at the time had hardly seemed relevant to his interests he had found it at last however and now he read and reread the lines trying to wring a twentiethcentury meaning from the seventeethcentury verse one sin i know another doth provoke murders as near to lust as fl ame to smoke he gives life and death meaning the priest had said so what did the words of the prince of tyre have to do with an abandoned grave in keldale and what did a grave have to do with the death of a farmer absolutely nothing his intellect insisted absolutely everything his intuition replied he snapped the book closed it was imprisoned in gillian the meaning and the truth he picked up the telephone and dialled it was after ten when she trudged down the illlit street in acton webberly had been surprised to see her but the surprise had faded when he opened the envelope lynley had sent he glanced at the message turned it over and picked up the phone after barking an order for edwards to come at once he dismissed her without a question as to why she had suddenly appeared in london without lynley it was quite as if she didnt exist for him and she didnt did she not any longer who gives a shit she thought who bloody cares what happens it was inevitable fat stupid little pig snorting around trying to play the detective thought you knew everything about gillian teys didnt you heard her humming in the next room and even then you werent smart enough to figure it out she looked up at the house the windows were dark mrs gustafsons television blared from next door but not a sign of life glimmered from the interior of the building in front of which she stood if its inhabitants were disturbed by the neighborhood noise there was no indication there was nothing nothing thats really it isnt it she thought theres nothing inside not a single thing and espe cially not the one thing that you want to be in there all these years youve been incubating a chi mera barb and what a bloody waste its been she steeled herself against the thought refused to accept it and unlocked the door in the quiet house the smell assailed her a smell of unwashed bodies of trapped cooking odours of dead air of ponderous despair it was foul and unhealthy and she welcomed it she breathed it in deeply finding it fi tting finding it just she closed the door behind her and leaned against it letting her eyes adjust to the darkness here it is barb it all began here let it bring you back to life she put her handbag down on the splintered table next to the door and forced herself towards the stairs but as she reached them her eyes were caught by a flash of light from the sitting room she walked to the door curiously to fi nd the room empty the fl ash only a brief flicker of a passing cars lights hitting the glass of the picture his picture tonys picture she was drawn into the room and she sat in her fathers chair which along with her mothers faced the shrine tonys face grinned its impish grin at her his wiry body twisted with life she was weary and numb but she forced herself to keep her eyes on the picture forced herself back to the deepest reaches of her memory where tony still lay wizened and gaunt in a narrow white hospital bed he was branded into her consciousness as he always would be tubes and needles sprouting from him everywhere his fingers plucking spasmodically at the covers his thin neck no longer supported a head that appeared by contrast to have grown immense his eyelids were heavy crusted and closed his cracked lips bled coma they had said its nearly time now but it hadnt been not yet not until hed opened his eyes managed a fleeting elfs smile and murmured im not scared when youre here barbie you wont leave me will you he might have actually spoken to her in the sitting rooms darkness for she felt it all again as she always did the swelling of grief and thenblasting it away like a breath from hellthe rage that single reality that was keeping her alive i wont leave you she swore ill never forget lovey she cried out in surprise brought back to the shattering present lovey is that you past the pounding of her heart she forced her voice to sound pleasant no problem really after so many years of practise yes mum just having a sit in the dark lovey here let me turn on the light so no her voice rasped she cleared her throat no mum just leave it off but i dont like the dark lovey itit frightens me so why are you up i heard the door open i thought it might be she moved into barbaras line of vision a ghostly figure in a stained pink dressing gown sometimes i think hes come back to us lovey but he never will will he barbara got to her feet abruptly go back to bed mum she heard the roughness of her voice and she tried unsuccessfully to modulate it hows dad she took her mothers bony arm and firmly led her from the sitting room he had a good day today we thought about switzerland you know the air is so fresh and pure there we thought switzerland would be the nicest place next of course back so soon from greece it doesnt seem quite right to go off again but he thinks it sounds a good idea will you like switzerland lovey because if you dont think youll like it we can always choose someplace else i want you to be happy happy happy switzerlands fi ne mum she felt her mothers birdclaw hand grip her arm tightly they started up the stairs good i thought youd like it i think zurich would be the best place to begin well do a tour this time with a hired car i long to see the alps sounds fi ne mum dad thought so lovey he even went to empress tours to get me the brochures barbaras steps slowed did he see mr patel her mothers hand fluttered on her arm oh i dont know lovey he didnt mention mr patel im certain he would have said something if he had they reached the top of the stairs her mother paused at the door to her bedroom hes such a new man when he goes out for a bit in the afternoon lovey such a new man barbaras stomach turned on the thought of what her mother might mean jonah clarence opened the bedroom door softly an unnecessary precaution for she was awake she turned her head at the sound of his movement and smiled wanly at her husband ive made you some soup he said jo her voice was so small so weak that he went hurriedly on its just the tinned stuff from the pantry ive some bread and butter here as well he placed the tray on the bed and helped her into a sitting position at the movement several of the deeper cuts began to bleed again he took a towel and pressed it firmly against her skin a movement not only to stem the flow of the blood but also to block out the memory of what had happened to their lives that evening i dont not now darling he said you need to eat something fi rst will we talk then his eyes moved from her face slashes covered her hands her arms her breasts her stomach her thighs at the sight he felt such a burden of anguish that he wasnt sure he could answer her but she was watching him her beautiful eyes trusting fi lled with love waiting for his reply yes he whispered well talk then she smiled tremulously and he felt his heart wrench he put the tray across her lap but when she tried to spoon the soup he saw that her weakness had become so pronounced that no effort would make it possible for her to feed herself gently he took the spoon from her and began to help her eat a slow process in which every bit swallowed seemed an individual act of triumph he wouldnt let her talk he was too afraid of what she might say instead he soothed her with whispered words of love and encouragement and wondered who she was and what kind of terrible grief she had brought into his life they had been married for less than a year but it seemed to him that they had always been together that they had been meant for each other from the moment when his father brought her to testament house from kings cross stationa solemn little waif of a girl who looked twelve years old shes all eyes he had thought when he saw her but when she smiled she was sunlight he knew within the first few weeks that he loved her but it took nearly ten years to make her his own during that time he had been ordained had made his decision to be part of his fathers work had laboured like jacob in pursuit of a rachel he could never be certain of winning yet that thought had not discouraged him like a crusader he had set on a quest and nell was his grail no one else would do except shes not nell he thought i dont know who she is and the worst of it is im not certain i want to know he had always seen himself as a man of action one of courage a man powered by the force of his inner convictions yet still intimately a man of peace all that had died tonight the sight of her in the bathmindlessly lacerating her flesh staining the water with her bloodhad demolished that carefully constructed facade in two short minutes the time it had taken to pull her frail and screaming from the tub to try frantically to stop the bleeding to throw the shouting police officer from their fl at in two short minutes he had become not the cheekturning sincere minister of god that had long been his guise but a maniacal stranger who could have killed without impunity anyone seeking to harm his wife he was shaken to the core even more so when he considered that in protecting her from enemies he couldnt think of how he was going to protect nell from herself except shes not nell he thought she was finished eating had been fi nished in fact for several minutes and lay back against the pillows they were stained with her blood he got to his feet jo im going to get something for the cuts ill just be a moment he tried not to see the gruesome condition of the bathroom as he rooted in the cupboard the tub looked and smelled as if they had been butchering livestock in it blood was everywhere in every crevice and crack his hands weakened as he grabbed the bottle of hydrogen peroxide he felt faint jonah he took several deep breaths and went back to the bedroom delayed reaction he tried to smile clutched the bottle so tightly he thought it might break in his hands and sat on the edge of the bed mostly surface cuts he said conversationally well see what it looks like in the morning if theyre bad well go to hospital then how does that sound he didnt wait for a response rather he washed the abrasions with the chemical and continued speaking determinedly i thought we might go to penzance this weekend darling it would be good to get away for a few days dont you think so i was talking to one of the kids about a hotel down there that shed stayed at as a child if its still there it should be wonderful a view of st michaels mount i thought wed take the train down and hire a car when we got there or bicycles would you like to hire bicycles nell he felt her hand on his cheek at the touch his heart swelled and he knew he was horribly close to tears jo she whispered nells dead dont say that he returned fi ercely ive done terrible things i cant bear for you to know i thought i was safe from them that id run from them right into forever no he continued mindlessly passionately to see to her wounds i love you jonah that stopped him his face sank into his hands what do i call you he whispered i dont even know who you are jo jonah my love my only love her voice was a torment he could barely endure and when she reached out for him he was broken and ran from the room slamming the door firmly and irrevocably behind him he stumbled to a chair hearing his own breathing tear at the air feeling wedges of panic drive themselves into his stomach and groin he sat staring unseeing at the material objects that comprised their home and desperately pushed away from him the one piece of information that was at the core of his terror three weeks ago the police sergeant had said he had lied to her an immediate response rising from the horror of her incomprehensible allegation he had not been in london with his wife at that time but rather at a fourday conference in exeter followed by two additional days of fundraisers for testament house nell was supposed to have gone with him but at the last moment had begged off with flu so she said had she been ill or had she seen it as an opportunity to travel to yorkshire no the word came out involuntarily from between his teeth despising himself for even considering the question for a moment jonah willed his breathing to calm willed his muscles to relax he reached for his guitar not to play it but to reaffirm its reality and to reestablish the meaning it had in his life for he had been sitting on the back stairs of testament house in the semidarkness playing strains of the music he loved when she first spoke to him thats so nice dyou think anyone could learn she came to crouch next to him on the step her eyes on his fingers as they moved expertly among the strings and she smiled a childs smile lit with pleasure it had been simple to teach her to play for she was a natural mimic something seen or heard was never forgotten now she played as often to him as he did to her not with his assurance or passion but with a melancholy sweetness that long ago should have told him what he didnt want to face now he stood abruptly to assure himself he opened book after book and saw the name nell graham written in each volume in her neat script to show ownership he wondered or to convince herself no he picked up a photograph album from the bottom shelf and hugged it to his chest it was a document of nell a verification of the fact that she was real that she had no other life but the one she shared with him he didnt even need to open the album to know what lay within its pages a pictorial history of the love they shared of the memories that were an integral part of the tapestry of their lives being woven together in a park on a trail dreaming quietly at dawn laughing at the antics of birds on the beach all of these bore testimony were illustrations of nells life and the things she loved his eyes drifted for more assurance to her plants in the window the african violets had always reminded him the most of her the beautiful flowers poised themselves delicately precariously at the tips of their stalks the heavy green leaves protected and surrounded them they were plants that looked as if they could never survive in the rigours of the london weather but in spite of their appearance they were deceptive plants really plants of remarkable strength looking at them he knew at last and fought fruitlessly to deny it tears long in coming broke the surface and a sob escaped him he made his way back to the chair fell into it and wept inconsolably it was then that he heard the knocking at the door go away he sobbed the knocking persisted go away there was no other sound the knocking continued like the voice of his conscience it would never end damn you go away he screamed and threw himself at the door he fl ung it open a woman stood there she wore a neat black suit and a white silk blouse with a froth of lace at her throat she carried a black shoulder bag and a leatherbound book but it was her face that riveted his attention it was calm cleareyed and masked by tenderness she might have been a missionary she might have been a vision but she extended her hand and made it clear that she was real my name is helen clyde she said quietly lynley chose a corner candles fl ickered some distance away but where he was darkness shrouded the church the building smelled vaguely of incense but more strongly of age of guttering candles of the burnt ends of matches of dust it was utterly peaceful even the doves who had been stirred into momentary rustling upon his approach had fallen back into stillness and no night wind made tree branches creak and scratch against the windows he was alone his only companions were the youths and maidens entwined grecian urnlike in a soundless eternal dance of truth and beauty on the doors of the elizabethan confessionals nearby his heart felt heavy and sore it was an old story a roman legend from the fi fth century but as real at this moment as it had been to shakespeare when he used it as the foundation for his drama the prince of tyre went to antioch pursuing a riddle and marriage to a princess but he came away with nothing fl eeing for his life lynley knelt he thought about prayer but nothing came he knew he was near the body of the hydra but the knowledge gave him neither triumph nor satisfaction instead he wanted to flee from the final confrontation with the monster knowing now that although the heads were destroyed and the trunk well seared he could not hope to emerge unscathed from the encounter fret not thyself because of evildoers it was an insubstantial disembodied wavering voice it came out of nowhere tremulous and uncertain and it hovered mistily in the frigid air it was some moments before lynley located its blackrobed source father hart knelt at the foot of the altar he was bent over double his forehead pressed to the floor neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity for they shall be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herb trust in the lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the lord they shall inherit the earth for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be lynley listened to the words anguished and tried to deny their meaning as a hush swept over the darkened church once more broken only by the priests stertorous breathinghe sorted through himself trying to fi nd the detachment he needed to carry him disinterested to the end of the case have you come to confess he started at the voice unseen to him the priest had materialised from the dark lynley stood no im not a catholic he replied i was just gathering my thoughts churches are good places for that arent they father hart smiled i always stop for a prayer before locking up for the night i always check first as well to make sure no one is still inside it wouldnt do to be locked up in st catherines in this kind of cold would it no lynley agreed it wouldnt do at all he followed the little priest to the end of the aisle and out into the night clouds obscured moon and stars the other man was merely a shadow without form or feature how well do you know pericles father hart the priest didnt answer at first as he fumbled with his keys and locked the church door pericles he repeated musingly he moved past the other man out into the graveyard its shakespeare isnt it as flame to smoke yes its shakespeare iwell i suppose i know it fairly well well enough to know why pericles fled from antiochus why antiochus wanted to have him killed i the priest groped in his pockets i dont think i quite remember all the details of the play you remember enough i daresay good night father hart lynley replied and left the graveyard he descended the hillock by the gravel path his footsteps sounding unnaturally loud in the nighttime peace on the bridge he paused to gather his thoughts and he leaned against its stone side surveying the village to his right olivia odells house was dark and woman and child slept in innocent safety within across the street organ music fl oated eerily from nigel parrishs cottage on the edge of the common to his left the lodge awaited his entry and beyond that the high street curved in the direction of the pub from where he stood he couldnt see st chads lane with its council houses but he could imagine them not wanting to do that he returned to the lodge hed been gone less than an hour but he knew as soon as he walked in the door that during his absence stepha had returned the building held its breath waiting for him to discover and know his feet felt like lead he wasnt entirely sure where stephas rooms would be but his instinct told him that they were somewhere on the ground fl oor of the old building past the reception desk in the direction of the kitchen he went through the door as he did so he had his answers palpably alive in the atmosphere that surrounded him he could smell the cigarette smoke he could almost taste the liquor in the air he could hear the laughter the whispered passion the delight he could feel the hands drawing him relentlessly forward all that was left was to see the truth he knocked on the door there was immediate quiet stepha movement within hurried and suppressed stephas soft laugh hung in the air at the last moment he nearly stopped himself but then he turned the knob to enter and to know perhaps now you can give me an alibi that sticks laughed richard gibson giving the woman a proprietary slap on her naked thigh i dont think the inspector believed my little madeline for a moment lady helen saw him as they made their way over the crowded pedestrian walkway from the arrivals platform it had been a harrowing enough two hours on the train one moment afraid that gillian might go all to pieces in any one of a dozen appalling ways the next moment desperately trying to rouse sergeant havers from whatever black pit of humour she had decided to inhabit the entire experience had filled lady helen with such anxiety that the very sight of lynley brushing his blond hair back off his forehead against the breeze of a departing train made her nearly weak with relief people in the crowded station bustled and pushed round him but still he looked as if he were quite alone he raised his head their eyes met and her steps slowed momentarily even at this distance she could see the difference in him the smoky darkness under his eyes the tension in the set of his head and shoulders the deepening lines round nose and mouth he was tommy still but somehow not quite tommy at all there could be only one reason for it deborah hed seen her in keldale his face told lady helen as much and for some reasonin spite of the year that had passed since hed broken his engagement to deborah in spite of the hours that shed spent with him since then lady helen found that she couldnt bear the thought of him talking about seeing her she desperately wanted to avoid giving him an opportunity to do so it was craven she despised herself for it and she didnt at that moment care to reflect upon why it had suddenly become so crucial that tommy never speak to her of deborah again he appeared to have been reading her thoughtshow typical of him reallyfor he gave her that brief quirky smile of his and walked to meet them at the foot of the stairs how absolutely wonderful to see you tommy she said i spent half the journey when i wasnt frantically eating every pastry that wandered byterrified that youd be stuck in keldale and wed have to hire a car and drive wildly about the moors in best earnshaw fashion trying to find you well its all ended for the best hasnt it and i neednt have given in to my craving for weekold pain au chocolat in order to dull my anxiety the food is absolutely appalling on the train isnt it she tightened her arm round gillian protectively it was an instinctive gesture for although she knew the young woman had nothing to fear from lynley the last twelve hours had bonded gillian to her and now she found herself reluctant to hand the young woman over gillian this is inspector lynley she murmured a tentative smile touched gillians lips then she dropped her eyes lynley began to extend his hand to her but lady helen shook her head in warning at that his glance slid to the young womans hands the angry red scoring that covered them was ugly but not as deep or serious as the abrasions that covered her neck breasts and thighs hidden by the dress that lady helen had carefully selected for her to wear ive the car just outside he said thank god lady helen declared lead me to it this moment before my feet suffer irreparable damage from these ghastly shoes they are fetching arent they but the agony i endure hobbling about in them simply beggars belief i keep asking myself why im such a slave to fashion she airily dismissed the question as unanswerable im even willing to put up with five minutes of the most melancholy tchaikovsky in your collection just to get off my feet he smiled ill remember that old duck darling i havent the slightest doubt of it she turned to sergeant havers who had plodded wordlessly behind them since they had disembarked sergeant i need to pop into the ladies and undo the damage i did to my makeup by burying my face in that last pastry just before that dreadful tunnel will you take gillian out to the car havers looked from lady helen to lynley of course she replied impassively lady helen watched the pair walk off before she spoke again im really not sure which one of them is the worse for wear tommy thank you for last night he said in answer was it awful for you she took her eyes off the departing women awful the terrible desolation in jonah clarences face the sight of gillian lying vacanteyed scarcely covered by a bloodied sheet her wounds still seeping slow crimson where the selfinflicted damage was most severe the blood on the floor and the walls of the bathroom and deep in the grout where it would never come clean the smashed door and the brushes with bits of flesh still adhering to their horrifying metal bristles im sorry for putting you through it lynley said but you were the only one i could trust to manage it i dont know what i would have done had you not been at home when i phoned id only just got in i have to admit that jeffrey wasnt at all pleased at the manner in which our evening ended lynleys reaction played at the corners of his mouth and eyes equal parts amusement and surprise jeffrey cusick i thought you threw him over she laughed lightly and took his arm i tried darling tommy i did try but jeffrey is quite determined to prove that whether i realise it or not he and i are on the path to true love so he was working on advancing us a bit further towards the journeys end last night it was romantic dinner in windsor on the bank of the thames champagne cocktails in the garden of the old house you would have been proud of me i even remembered that wren built it so all these years of your seeing to my education havent been in vain but i hardly thought youd be throwing it away on jeffrey cusick not throwing it away at all hes a lovely man really besides he was only too helpful in assisting me with my dressing ive no doubt of that lynley remarked drily she laughed at his grim expression not that way jeffrey would never take advantage hes far tootoo fishlike spoken like the most petulant oxonian tommy she declared but to be dreadfully honest he is the teeniest bit like a cod well what can one expect ive never in my life known a cambridge man to get caught in the throes of passion was he wearing his harrovian tie when i phoned lynley asked for that matter was he wearing anything tommy how vicious but let me think she tapped her cheek thoughtfully her eyes twinkled up at him as she pretended to consider his question at some length no im afraid we were both fully clothed when you phoned and after that well there simply wasnt time we rushed desperately to my wardrobe and began looking for something that would do what do you think is it a success lynley eyed the beautifully tailored black suit and matching accessories you look like a quaker on the path to hell he said soberly good lord helen is that really a bible she laughed doesnt it just do she examined the leather volume in her hand actually its a collection of john donne given to me by darling grandfather on my seventeenth birthday i may actually open it someday what would you have done if she had asked you to read a few verses to her to get her through the night i can sound positively biblical when i want to tommy a few thees and thous a few lays and begets andwhat is it he had stiffened at her words she felt the sudden rigidity in his arm lynley was looking at his car parked outside the station doors wheres her husband she regarded him curiously i dont know hes vanished i went directly in to see gillian and later when i came out of the bedroom hed gone i spent the night there of course and he never returned how did gillian react to that im lady helen considered how best to answer the question tommy im not even certain that shes aware that hes gone this sounds a little strange im sure but i think hes ceased to exist for her she hasnt mentioned his name to me has she said anything only that she left something for bobby the message in the newspaper no doubt lady helen shook her head no i have the distinct impression that it was something at the house lynley nodded pensively and asked a fi nal question how did you talk her into coming helen i didnt shed already made up her mind and i credit that to sergeant havers tommy although from the way shes been acting i think she believes that i performed some sort of loaves and fishes in the clarence fl at do speak to her wont you shes been positively monosyllabic since i rang her this morning and i think shes blaming herself for everything thats happened he sighed that sounds just like havers christ what i dont need is one more thing to have to deal with in this bloody case lady helens eyes widened fractionally rarely if ever did he give vent to anger tommy she said hesitantly while you were in keldale did you happen tois it she didnt want to speak of it she wouldnt speak of it he flashed her his crooked smile sorry old duck he dropped his arm round her shoulders and squeezed affectionately did i mention how damnably good it is to have you here he hadnt said anything to her he hadnt so much as acknowledged her beyond a cursory nod but then why should he now that her little ladyship was there to save the day just as shed managed to do last nightthere was no reason for them to communicate at all she might have known that lynley would use one of his mistresses rather than someone from the yard wasnt that typical of him an ego so enormous that he had to make certain his london women would jump to his bidding in spite of his catting about in the country wonder if her ladyship will still jump through hoops when she finds out about stepha barbara thought and just look at her with her perfect skin perfect posture perfect breedingas if her ancestors spent the last two hundred years throwing out the rejects leaving them on hillsides like unacceptable spartan babies in order to arrive at the eugenic masterpiece that was lady helen clyde but not quite good enough to keep his lordship faithful are we sweetheart barbara smiled inwardly she observed lynley from the rear seat had another big night with little stepha ill bet of course he had since he hadnt had to worry about how much the woman howled he probably banged happily away at her for hours on end and now here was her precious ladyship to be serviced tonight well he could handle it he could rise to the challenge then he could move right on to give gillian a treat no doubt that anaemic little husband of hers would be only too happy to give the reins over to a real man and werent they both handling the little bitch with kid gloves one couldnt really blame her ladyship for that approach she didnt have all the facts on gillian teys but what was lynleys excuse since when did an accessory to murder get the red carpet treatment from cid youre going to find roberta very much changed gillian he was saying barbara listened to the words with incredulity what was he doing what was he talking about was he actually preparing her to see her sister when both of them knew damn well shed seen her only three weeks ago when theyd killed william teys i understand gillian responded in a very small nearly inaudible voice shes been placed in the asylum as a temporary measure lynley continued gently its a question of mental competence arising out of her admission to the crime and her unwillingness to speak how did shewho gillian hesitated then gave up the effort she seemed to shrink into her seat your cousin richard gibson had her committed richard her voice grew even smaller yes i see no one spoke barbara waited impatiently for lynley to begin questioning the woman and she couldnt understand his obvious reluctance to do so what was he doing he was making the kind of solicitous conversation that one generally made with the victim of a crime not with its perpetrator furtively barbara examined gillian good god she was manipulative right to the bitter end a few minutes in the bathroom last night and she had the whole lot of them right where she wanted how long had she been trotting out that little routine her eyes moved back to lynley why had he brought her back on the case today there could be only one reason really to put her in her place once and for all to humiliate her with the knowledge that even an amateur like her sweet ladyship had more expertise than havers the pig and then to condemn her forever to the street well the message was received inspector now all she longed for was a return to london and to uniform leaving lynley and his lady to sweep up the shards of the mess she had made shed worn her hair in two long blonde braids thats why she looked so young that first night in testament house she spoke to no one instead taking a quiet measure of the group deciding whether they were worthy of her trust the decision once made she said only her name helen graham nell graham but hadnt he known from the fi rst that it wasnt really her name perhaps the slight hesitation before her response when someone addressed her had betrayed her perhaps it was the wistful look in her eyes when she said it herself perhaps it was her tears when he fi rst entered her body and whispered nell in the darkness at any rate hadnt he always knownsomewhere in his heartthat it wasnt her name what had drawn him to her at first it was the childlike innocence with which she embraced the life at testament house she was so eager to learn and then so passionately involved in the purpose of the community after that it was her purity he so admired the purity which allowed her to lead a new life unaffected by personal animosities in a world where she had simply decided that such ugliness would never exist then it was her devotion to godnot the breastbeating ostentatious piety of the religious reborn but a calm acceptance of a power greater than her ownthat touched him and last it was her steadfast faith in his ability to do anything her words of encouragement when he felt despair her abiding love when he needed it most as i do now jonah clarence thought in the last twelve hours he had looked deeply unforgivingly at his own behaviour and had come to see it for what it was unremitting cowardice he had left wife and home running to an unknown destination fl eeing so that he wouldnt have to face what he was afraid to know yet what was there to fear when nellwhoever she wascould be nothing more nor less than the lovely creature who stood by his side who listened rapt to his words who held him in her arms at night there could be no dark monster in her past for him to dread there could be only what she was and always had been this was the truth he knew it he could feel it he believed it and when the door to the mental hospital opened he stood up quickly and strode across the central hall to meet his wife lynley felt rather than saw the hesitation in gillians footsteps as they entered the hospital at first he attributed it to her understandable trepidation about seeing her sister after so many years but then he saw that her gaze was fixed on a young man who came across the lobby in their direction curious lynley turned to gillian to speak only to see on her face an expression of unmitigated dread jonah she gasped taking a step backwards im sorry jonah clarence reached out as if to touch her but stopped forgive me im sorry nell his eyes were burnt out as if he hadnt slept in days you mustnt call me that not any longer he ignored her words i spent the night sitting on a bench in kings cross trying to sort it all out trying to decide if you could love a man who was too much of a coward to stay with his wife when she needed him most she reached out touched his arm oh jonah she said please go back to london dont ask that of me it would be too easy please i beg you for me not without you i wont do that whatever you feel you must do here ill be here as well he looked at lynley may i stay with my wife its up to gillian lynley replied and noticed the manner in which the young man involuntarily recoiled at the name if you want to stay jonah she whispered he smiled at her touched her cheek lightly and looked up from her face only when the sound of voices from the transverse passage signalled dr samuelss approach the man carried a stack of file folders which he handed to a female colleague before swiftly crossing towards them he eyed the entire group unsmiling if he was grateful for the appearance of roberta teyss sister and the possibility of progress that her presence implied he gave no indication inspector he said by way of greeting is a group this large absolutely necessary it is lynley responded evenly and hoped the man had the good sense to take a close look at gillians condition before he raised a storm of protest and threw them all out a pulse beat in the psychiatrists temple it was obvious that he was unused to anything short of fawning courtesy and that he was caught between a desire to put lynley summarily in his place and a wish to carry on with the planned meeting between the two sisters his concern for roberta won out this is the sister without waiting for an answer he took gillians arm and devoted his attention to her as they started down the passageway towards the locked ward ive told roberta that youre coming to see her he said quietly his head bent to hers but you must prepare yourself for the fact that she may not respond to you she probably wont in fact has she gillian hesitated seemed unsure how to proceed has she still said nothing nothing at all but these are the very early stages of therapy miss teys and mrs clarence jonah interjected fi rmly the psychiatrist stopped swept his eyes over jonah clarence a spark shot between them suspicion and dislike mrs clarence samuels corrected himself his eyes steadily on her husband as i was saying mrs clarence these are the earliest stages of therapy weve no reason to doubt that your sister will someday make a full recovery the use of the modifier was not lost on gillian someday her arm encircled her waist in a gesture very like her mothers the psychiatrist appeared to be evaluating her reaction he answered in a way that indicated that her singleword response had communicated far more than she realised yes roberta is very ill he put his hand on her elbow and guided her through the door in the panelling they walked through the locked ward the only noise among them the muffled sounds of their footsteps on the carpeting and the occasional cry of a patient from behind the closed doors near the end of the corridor a narrow door was recessed into the wall and samuels stopped before it opening it and switching on the light to reveal a small cramped room he motioned them inside youre going to find yourselves crowded in here he warned his tone of voice indicating how little he regretted the fact it was a narrow rectangle no larger than a goodsized broom closet which in fact it once had been one wall was completely covered by a large mirror two speakers hung at either end and a table and chairs were set up in the middle it was claustrophobic and pungent with the smell of floor wax and disinfectant this is fine lynley said samuels nodded when i fetch roberta i shall switch these lights out and youll be able to see through the twoway mirror into the next room the speakers will allow you to hear whats being said roberta will see only the mirror but ive told her that you will be present behind it we couldnt have her in the room otherwise you understand yes of course fine he smiled at them grimly as if he sensed their apprehension and was glad to see that theylike himselfwere not anticipating that the upcoming interview would be a diverting lark ill be in the next room with gillian and roberta is that necessary gillian asked hesitantly considering the circumstances yes im afraid it is the circumstances the murder mrs clarence samuels surveyed them all one last time and then buried his hands deeply in the pockets of his trousers his eyes were on lynley shall we deal in legalities he asked brusquely that isnt necessary lynley said im well aware of them you know that nothing she says i know lynley repeated he nodded sharply then ill fetch her he spun smartly on one heel switched out the lights and left the room closing the door behind him the lights from the room beyond the mirror gave them some illumination but their close little cell was alive with shadows they seated themselves on the unforgiving wooden chairs and waited gillian with her legs straight out in front of her staring passionately down at the scarred tips of her fingers jonah with his chair next to hers cradling its wooden back protectively sergeant havers slumped down brooding on the darkest corner of the room lady helen next to lynley observing the unspoken communication between husband and wife and lynley himself lost in deep contemplation from which he was roused by the touch of lady helens hand squeezing his own bless her he thought returning the pressure she knew she always knew he smiled at her so glad that she was with him with her cleareyed sanity in a world that would shortly go mad roberta was very much as she had been she entered the room between two whiteclad nurses dressed as she had been dressed before in the tooshort skirt the illfitting blouse the flipflopping slippers that barely sufficed to give her feet protection she had however been bathed in anticipation of the interview and her thick hair was clean and damp pulled back and fastened at her neck with a piece of scarlet yarn an incongruous note of colour in the otherwise monochromatic room the room itself was inoffensive and barren devoid of decoration save for a trio of chairs and a waisthigh metal cabinet nothing hung on the walls there was no distraction no escape oh bobby gillian murmured when she saw her sister through the glass there are three chairs here in the room as you can see roberta samuelss voice came to them without distortion over the speakers in a moment im going to ask your sister to join us do you remember your sister gillian roberta the girl seated began to rock she gave no reply the two nurses left the room gillians come up from london before i fetch her however id like you to look round the room and accustom yourself to it weve never met in here before have we the girls dull eyes remained where they had been fixed on a point on the opposite wall her arms hung inanimate at her sides lifeless pulpy masses of fat and skin samuels undisturbed by her silence let it continue while he placidly watched the girl two interminable minutes dragged by in this way before he got to his feet i shall fetch gillian now roberta im going to be in the room while you meet with her youre quite safe the last declaration seemed entirely unnecessary for if the hulking girl felt fearfelt anything at allshe gave no sign in the observation room gillian got to her feet it was a hesitant movement unnatural as if she were being propelled upward and forward by a force other than her own free will darling you know you dont have to go in there if youre afraid her husband said she did not reply but rather with the back of her hand upon which the heavy scoring from the metal brushes stood out like cutaneous veins she stroked his cheek she might have been saying goodbye to him ready samuels asked when he opened the door his sharp glance made a rapid assessment of gillian cataloguing her potential weaknesses and strengths when she nodded he went on crisply theres nothing to worry about ill be in there and several orderlies are within calling distance should she need to be quickly subdued you act as if you believe that bobby could really hurt someone gillian said and preceded him to the next room without waiting for a response the others watched waiting for a reaction from roberta when the door opened and her sister entered there was none the big square body continued to rock gillian hesitated her hand on the door bobby she said clearly her tone was quiet but matteroffact the way a parent might speak to a recalcitrant child receiving no response the young woman took one of the three chairs and placed it in front of her sister directly in her line of vision she sat down roberta gazed through her to the spot on the wall gillian looked towards the psychiatrist who had pulled his chair to one side out of robertas vision what should i talk about yourself she can hear you gillian fingered the material of her dress she dragged her eyes up to her sisters face ive come up from london to see you bobby she began her voice quavered but as she proceeded it gathered strength thats where i live now with my husband i was married last november she looked at samuels who nodded encouragingly youre going to think its so funny but i married a minister its hard to believe that a girl with such a strong catholic background would marry a minister isnt it what would papa ever say if he knew the plain face offered neither acknowledgment nor interest gillian might have been speaking to the wall she licked her dry lips and stumbled on we have a flat in islington its not a very large flat but youd like it remember how i loved plants well ive lots in the flat because the kitchen window gets just the right kind of sun remember how i could never get plants to grow in the farmhouse it was too dark the rocking continued the chair on which roberta sat groaned with her weight i have a job as well i work at a place called testament house you know that place dont you its where runaways go to live sometimes i do all sorts of work there but i like counselling the kids the best they say im easy to talk to she paused bobby wont you talk to me the girls breathing sounded drugged her heavy head hung to one side she might have been asleep i like london i never thought i would but i do i expect its because thats where my dreams are iid like to have a baby thats one of my dreams and idi think id like to write a book there are all sorts of stories inside me and i want to write them down like the brontës remember how we read the brontës they had dreams as well didnt they i think its important to have dreams its not going to work jonah clarence said brusquely the moment his wife had left the room he had seen the trap had understood that her entry into her sisters presence was a return to a past in which he had played no part from which he could not save her how long does she have to stay in there as long as she wants lynleys voice was cool its in gillians hands but anything can happen doesnt she understand that jonah wanted to jump up fling open the door and drag his wife away it was as if her mere presence in the room trapped with the horrible whalelike creature that was her sisterwere enough to contaminate and destroy her forever nell he said fi ercely i want to talk to you about the night i left bobby gillian went on her eyes on her sisters face waiting for the slightest fl icker that would indicate comprehension and recognition that would allow her words to stop i dont know if you remember it it was the night after my sixteenth birthday i it was too much she couldnt she fought onward i stole money from papa did he tell you that i knew where he kept it the extra money for the house so i took it it was wrong i know that but ii needed to leave i needed to go away for a while you know that dont you and then again seeking reassurance dont you was the rocking faster now or was it so only in the imagination of the watchers i went to york it took me all night i walked and hitchhiked i just had that rucksack you know the one i used to carry my school books in so i only had one change of clothes with me i dont know what i was thinking about running away like that it seems crazy now doesnt it gillian smiled briefly at her sister she could feel her heart hammering it was becoming quite diffi cult to breathe i got to york at dawn ill never forget the sight of the morning light hitting the minster it was beautiful i wanted to stay there forever she stopped put her hands firmly into her lap the deep scratches showed it couldnt be helped i stayed in york that entire day i was so frightened bobby id never even been away from home for a night by myself and i wasnt sure i wanted to go on to london i thought it might be easier if i went back to the farm but ii couldnt i just couldnt whats the point of this jonah clarence demanded how is all this supposed to help roberta wary lynley glanced at him but the man settled himself again his face was rigid every muscle tight so i caught the train that night there were so many stops and at every one of them i thought that i would be questioned i thought that papa might have sent the police after me or come after me himself but nothing happened until i got to kings cross you dont need to tell her about the pimp jonah whispered whats the point there was a nice man at kings cross who bought me something to eat i was so grateful to him he was such a gentleman i thought but while i was eating and he was telling me about a house he had where i could live another man came into the cafeteria he saw us he came up and said shes coming with me i thought he was a policeman that he would make me go home again i started to cry i hung on to my friend but he shook me off and ran out of the station she paused caught in the memory of that night this new man was very different his clothes were old a bit shabby but his voice was kind he said his name was george clarence that he was a minister and that the other man had wanted to take me to soho toto take me to soho she repeated firmly he said he had a house in camden town where i could stay jonah remembered it all so vividly the ancient rucksack the frightened girl the scuffed shoes and tattered jeans she wore he remembered his fathers arrival and the conversation between his parents the words pimp from sohodidnt even understand looks like she hasnt slept at all echoed in his mind he remembered watching her from the breakfast table where hed been dividing his time between scrambled eggs and cramming for a literature test she wouldnt look at anyone not then mr clarence was very good to me bobby i was like part of his family ii married his son jonah youd love jonah hes so gentle so good when im with him i feel as if nothing could evernothing ever again she concluded it was enough it was what she had come to do gillian looked at the psychiatrist beseechingly waiting for direction from him for his nod of dismissal he merely watched her from behind the protection of his spectacles they winked in the light his face told her nothing but his eyes were very kind there thats it its done nothing jonah concluded decisively youve brought her up here to this all for nothing im taking her home he began to get to his feet sit down lynley said his voice making it clear that the other man had no choice in the matter bobby talk to me gillian begged they say you killed papa but i know that you couldnt have you didnt look likethere was no reason i know it tell me there was no reason he took us to church he read to us he made up games we could play bobby you didnt kill him did you its important to you that i didnt kill him isnt it dr samuels said quietly his voice was like a feather floating gently in the air between them yes gillian responded immediately although her eyes were on her sister i put the key under your pillow bobby you were awake i talked to you i said use it tomorrow and you understood dont tell me you didnt understand i know you did i was too young i didnt understand the doctor said you had to understand i told you id put a message in the guardian that it would say nell graham remember we loved that book didnt we she was so brave and strong it was the way we both wanted to be but i wasnt strong was i the doctor queried you were you didnt look likeyou were supposed to come to harrogate the message told you to come to harrogate bobby you were sixteen you could have come i wasnt like you at sixteen gillian how could i have been the psychiatrist hadnt moved in his chair his eyes travelled between the two sisters waiting for a sign reading the underlying messages in body movements posture and tone of voice you didnt have to be you werent supposed to be all you had to do was come to harrogate not to london just to harrogate i would have taken you from there but when you didnt come i thoughti believedthat you were all right that nothingthat you were fine you werent like mummy you were fi ne like mummy yes like mummy i was like her just exactly like i could see it in the pictures but you werent so that made you fi ne what did it mean to be like mummy the doctor asked gillian stiffened her mouth formed the single word no three times in rapid succession it was too much to bear she couldnt go on was bobby like mummy in spite of what you believed no dont answer him nell jonah clarence muttered you dont have to answer him youre not the patient here gillian looked at her hands she felt the burden of guilt heavy upon her shoulders the sound of her sisters ceaseless rocking fi lled the air the sound of tortured breathing the beating of her own heart she felt that she couldnt go on she knew she couldnt turn back you know why i left dont you she said hollowly it was because of the present on my birthday the special present the one her hand went to her eyes it shook she controlled herself you must tell them the truth you must tell them what happened you cant let them lock you away for the rest of your life silence she couldnt it was in the past it had all happened to someone else besides the little eightyearold who had followed her round the farm who had watched her every movement with eyes shining with adoration was dead this gross obscene creature before her was not roberta there was no need to go further roberta was gone gillian lifted her head robertas eyes has shifted they had moved to her and in that movement gillian saw that she had indeed broken through where the psychiatrist had failed these last three weeks but there was no triumph in that knowledge there was only condemnation there was only facing one last time the immutable past i didnt understand gillian said brokenly i was only four or five years old you werent even born then he said it was special a kind of friendship fathers always had with their daughters like lot oh no jonah whispered did he read the bible to you bobby he read it to me he came in at night and sat on my bed and read the bible to me and as he read it no no no his hand would fi nd me underneath the covers do you like that gilly he would ask me does it make you happy it makes papa very happy its so nice so soft do you like it gilly jonah pounded his right fist against his forehead with his left arm he hugged himself tightly across his chest up to his shoulder please he moaned i didnt know bobby i didnt understand i was only five years old and then it was dark in the room turn over he would say papa will rub your back do you like that where do you like it best here gilly is it special here and then hed take my hand papa likes it there gilly rub papa there where was mummy the doctor asked mummy was asleep or in her room or reading but it really didnt matter because this was special this was something fathers share with daughters mummy mustnt know mummy wouldnt understand she didnt read the bible with us so she wouldnt understand and then she left i was eight years old and then you were alone gillian shook her head numbly her eyes were wide tearless oh no she said in a small torn voice i was mummy then at her words a cry escaped jonah clarences lips lady helen looked at lynley immediately and covered his hand with her own it turned grasping her fi ngers tightly papa set up all her pictures in the sitting room so i could see her every day mummys gone he said and made me look at them all so i could see how pretty she was and how much i had sinned in being born in the first place to drive her away mummy knew how much papa loved you gilly so she left you must be mummy to me now i didnt know what he meant so he showed me he read the bible he prayed and he showed me but i was too little to be a proper mummy to him so hei did other things he taught me and iwas a very good student you wanted to please him he was your father he was all you had i wanted him to love me he said he loved me when iwhen wepapa loves it in your mouth gilly and afterwards we prayed we always prayed i thought god would forgive me for making mummy run away if i became a good enough mummy to papa but god never forgave me he didnt exist jonahs head sank to the table cradled in his arms and he began to weep gillian finally looked at her sister again robertas eyes were on her although her face remained without expression the rocking had stopped so i did things bobby things i didnt understand because mummy was gone and i neededi wanted my mummy again and i thought the only way to get mummy back was to be her myself is that what you did when you were sixteen dr samuels asked softly he came to my room it was late he said it was time to become lots daughter the real way the way the bible said and he took off his clothes hed never done that before never all his clothes not like that i thought he wantedwhat i usuallybut he didnt hespread my legs andyourei cant breathe papa youre too heavy please dont im afraid oh it hurts it hurts her husband swayed on his feet scraping his chair back viciously on the linoleum fl oor he staggered to the window it never happened he cried against it it couldnt it didnt youre my wife but he put his hand over my mouth he said we cant wake bobby darling papa loves you best let papa show you gilly let papa inside like mummy like a real mummy let papa inside and it hurt and it hurt and i hated him no jonah screamed he threw open the door it crashed against the wall he ran from the room then gillian began to cry i was just a shell i wasnt a person what did it matter what he did to me i became what he wanted what anyone wanted thats how i lived jonah thats how i lived pleasing everyone the doctor asked people love looking into mirrors so thats what i was thats what he made me oh god i hated him i hated him she buried her face in her hands and wept as the grief overcame her tortured tears held in check for eleven long years the others sat motionless listening to her weeping after long painful minutes she raised her ravaged face to her sisters dont let him kill you bobby dont let him do it for gods sake tell them the truth there was no response there was absolutely nothing only the unbearable sound of gillians personal torment roberta was motionless she might have been deaf tommy lady helen whispered i cant bear this shes done it for nothing lynley stared into the next room his head was pounding his throat ached his eyes burned he wanted to find william teys fi nd him alive and tear the man savagely limb from limb he had never known such rage such sickness he felt gillians anguish overcome him like a disease but her weeping had lessened she was getting to her feet she was walking unevenly numbly to the door her hand reached for the knob she turned it pulled it open her presence had been useless after all it was over did he make you have the naked parade gilly roberta asked as if under water gillian turned slowly from the door at the sound of her sisters husky voice tell me she whispered she walked back to her chair moved it closer to the other and sat down robertas eyes heavylidded under their protective folds of fat were fi xed but unfocused on her sister her lips worked convulsively the fingers of one hand flexed it was music loud he would take off my clothes and then the girls voice altered it became honeytoned insinuatingly persuasive chillingly male pretty baby pretty baby and time to march pretty baby time to march for papa and he wouldit was in his handwatch what papa does while you march pretty baby i left the key for you bobby gillian said brokenly when he fell asleep that night in my bed i went to his room and i found the key what happened to it i left it for you roberta struggled with information buried so long beneath the weight of her childhood terrors i didntdidnt know i locked the door but you never said why you never said to keep the key oh god gillians voice was anguished are you saying that you locked the door at night but in the day you left the key in the keyhole bobby is that what you mean roberta drew her arm across her damp face it was like a shield and behind its protection she nodded her body heaved with a repressed cry i didnt know so he found it and took it away he put it in his wardrobe all the keys were there it was locked i couldnt get it dont need keys pretty baby pretty baby march for papa when did you march daytime nighttime come here pretty baby papa wants to help you march how robertas arm dropped her face was quickly shuttered her fingers picked and pulled at her lower lip bobby tell me how gillian insisted tell me what he did i love papa i love papa dont say that she reached out grabbed her sisters arm tell me what he did to you love

not like gilly turn over pretty baby papa has to punish you oh my god gillian fell to her knees took her sister into her arms she sobbed against her breast but the girl did not respond instead her arms hung limply at her sides and her body tensed as if the proximity of her sister was frightening or distasteful why didnt you come to harrogate didnt you see the message why didnt you come i thought you were all right i thought he left you alone why didnt you come bobby died bobby died dont say that youre alive dont let him kill you now roberta shrank back freeing herself fi ercely papa never kill papa never kill papa never kill her voice grew high with panic the psychiatrist leaned forward in his chair kill what roberta he asked quickly and pressed the advantage what did papa never kill baby papa didnt kill the baby what did he do found me in the barn cried and prayed and cried is that where you had the baby in the barn no one knew fat and ugly no one knew gillians eyes were transfixed in horror not on her sisters face but on the psychiatrist she rocked on her heels a hand at her mouth biting down on her fingers as if to keep from screaming you were pregnant bobby he didnt know you were pregnant no one knew not like gilly fat and ugly no one knew what happened to the baby bobby died what happened to the baby bobby died what happened to the baby gillians voice rose to a scream did you kill the baby roberta dr samuels asked nothing she began to rock it was a rapid movement as if she were hurtling back into madness gillian watched her watched the panic that drove her and the unassailable armour of psychosis that protected her and she knew papa killed the baby she asserted numbly he found you in the barn he cried and prayed read the bible for guidance and then he killed the baby she touched her sisters hair what did he do with it dont know did you ever see it never saw the baby boy or girl dont know is that why you didnt come to harrogate were you pregnant then the rocking slowed to a stop it was affi rmation baby died bobby died it didnt matter papa sorry pretty baby papa never hurt again pretty baby march for papa papa never hurt again he didnt have intercourse with you again roberta dr samuels asked but everything else stayed the same pretty baby march for papa did you march for papa roberta the doctor continued after the baby did you march for him marched for papa had to march why why did you have to she looked about furtively an odd smile of twisted satisfaction dancing on her face and then began to rock papa happy it was important that papa be happy dr samuels said refl ectively yes yes very happy happy papa wont touch she cut the words off the rocking increased in intensity no bobby gillian said dont you leave you mustnt leave now you marched for papa to keep him happy so that he wouldnt touch someone who in the darkened observation room the terrible realisation cut like a swords swath down lynleys spine the knowledge had been there before him all along a nineyearold girl being schooled in the bible being read the old testament learning the lessons of lots daughters bridie he said savagely and understood everything at last he could have told the rest of the story himself but he listened instead to the purgation of a tortured soul papa wanted gilly not a cow like roberta your father wanted a child didnt he dr samuels asked he needed a childs body to arouse him like gillians like your mothers found a child and what happened roberta pressed her cracked lips together as if to stop herself from speaking the corners of her mouth were spotted with blood she gave a ragged cry and a flurry of words escaped as if of their own volition the pharaoh put a chain on his neck and dressed him in fine linen and he ruled over egypt and josephs brothers came to see him and joseph said i am supposed to save your lives by a great deliverance gillian spoke through her tears the bible told you what to do just as it always told papa dress in linens wear a chain what happened got him in the barn how did you do that dr samuelss voice was low robertas face quivered her eyes fi lled with tears they began to spill down her acnecovered cheeks tried twice didnt work thenwhiskers she replied you killed whiskers to get your father to the barn the doctor asked whiskers didnt know gave him pills papas pills he was asleep cutcut his throat called for papa papa ran knelt by whiskers she began to rock furiously cradling her bloated body accompanying the movement with low tuneless humming she was in retreat and then roberta the psychiatrist asked you can take the last step cant you with gillian here rocking rocking savage and furious blindly determined her eyes on the wall love papa love papa dont remember dont remember of course you remember the psychiatrists voice was gentle but relentless the bible told you what to do if you hadnt done it your father would have done to that little girl all the things he had done to you and gillian through the years he would have molested her he would have sodomised her he would have raped her but you stopped him roberta you saved that child you dressed in fine linens you put on the gold chain you killed the dog you called your father to the barn he ran in didnt he he knelt down and roberta jumped off her chair it fl ew across the room striking the cabinet and she went after it moving like the wind she picked it up hurled it against the wall dumped over the cabinet and began to scream i chopped off his head he knelt down he bent to pick up whiskers and i chopped off his head i dont care that i did it i wanted him to die i wouldnt let him touch bridie he wanted to he read to her just like hed done to me he talked to her just like hed done to me he was going to do it i knew the signs i killed him i killed him and i dont care im not sorry he deserved to die slumping to the floor she wept into her hands large grey doughlike hands that covered her face but pinched and brutalised it even as they protected i saw his head on the fl oor and i didnt care and the rat came out of nowhere and he sniffed at the blood and he ate at the brains and i didnt care with a strangled cry sergeant havers leapt to her feet and staggered from the room barbara crashed into the lavatory fell blindly into a stall and began to vomit the room swam round her she was so ragingly hot that she was sure she would faint but she continued instead to vomit and as she retched painfully spasmodicallyshe knew that what was spewing forth from her body was the turbid mass of her own despair she clung to the smooth porcelain bowl fought for breath to redeem her and vomited it was as if she had never seen life clearly until the last two hours and suddenly faced with its filth she had to get away from it had to get it out of her system in that dark stifling room the voices had come to her relentlessly not just the voices of the sisters who had lived the nightmare but the voices of her own past and of the nightmare that remained it was too much she could no longer live with it she could no longer bear it i cant she sobbed inwardly tony i cant any longer god forgive me but i cant footsteps entered the room she struggled to pull herself together but the illness continued and she knew she would have to endure the further humiliation of being mortally ill in front of the fashionable competence of lady helen clyde water was turned on more footsteps the stall door opened and a damp cloth was pressed to the back of her neck folded quickly and then wiped across her burning cheeks please no go away she was sick again and what was even more despicable she began to cry i cant she wept i cant please please leave me alone a cool hand pushed her hair off her face and supported her forehead lifes rotten barb and the hell of it is that it doesnt get much better lynleys voice said horrified she spun around but it was lynley and in his eyes the compassion she had seen before in his treatment of roberta in his conversation with bridie in his questioning of tessa and she suddenly saw what it was that webberly had known she could learn from lynleythe source of his strength the centre of what she knew quite well was tremendous personal courage it was that quiet compassion nothing else that finally broke her how could he she sobbed if its your childyoure supposed to love not hurt not let him die never let him die and thats what they did her voice spiralled hysterically and all the time lynleys dark eyes were on her face i hatei cantthey were supposed to be there for him he was their son they were supposed to love him and they didnt he was sick for four years the last year in hospital they wouldnt even go to see him they said they couldnt bear it that it hurt too much but i went i went every day and he asked for them he asked why mum and dad wouldnt come to see him and i lied i went every day and i lied and when he died he was all alone i was in school i didnt get there in time he was my little brother he was only ten years old and all of usall of uslet him die alone im so sorry lynley said i swore that i would never let them forget what theyd done i asked his teachers for the letters i framed the death certificate i made the shrine i kept them in the house i closed the doors and the windows and every single day i made sure they had to sit there and stare at tony i drove them mad i wanted to do it i destroyed them i destroyed myself she put her head down on the porcelain and wept she wept for the hate that had fi lled her life for the guilt and the jealousy that had been her companions for the loneliness that she had brought upon herself for the contempt and disgust that she had directed towards others at the last when lynley wordlessly took her into his arms she wept against his chest mourning most of all the death of the friendship that could have lived between them through the transom windows in dr samuelss orderly office they could see the rose garden it was designed in plots and descending terraces the plants segregated by colour of flower and type a few bushes still had blooms on them despite the lateness of the year the cold nights the rare frost in the mornings soon however the heavy blossoms would die gardeners would cut the bushes back for a dormant winter but they would renew themselves in the spring and the circle of life would continue they watched the little party wander on the gravel paths among the plants they were a study in contrasts gillian and her sister lady helen and sergeant havers and far behind them the two nurses their forms hidden beneath the long capes they wore against the windblown afternoon lynley turned from the sight and saw dr samuels watching him thoughtfully from behind his desk his intelligent face carefully devoid of expression you knew shed had a baby lynley said from her admission physical i should guess yes why didnt you tell me i didnt trust you samuels replied and added then whatever fragile bond i could hope to develop with roberta by keeping that to myself was far more important than sharing the information with you and running the risk of your blurting it out to her he tempered his words it was after all privileged information whats going to happen to them lynley asked theyre going to survive how can you know that theyre beginning to understand that they were his victims thats the fi rst step samuels took off his spectacles and polished them on the interior of his jacket his lean face was tired he had heard it all before i dont understand how they survived this long they coped how the doctor gave a final glance to his spectacles and put them back on he adjusted their position carefully hed worn them for years and deep painful indentations had been created on either side of his nose from their pressure for gillian it appears to have been what we call dissociation a way of subdividing the self so that she could pretend to have or be those things which she couldnt really have or couldnt really be such as normal feelings for one normal relationships for another she called it being a mirror just reflecting the behaviour of those round her its a defence it protected her from feeling anything about what was happening to her how she wasnt a real person so nothing her father did could really touch or hurt her everyone in the village describes her in an entirely different way yes thats the behaviour gillian simply mirrored them taking it to its furthest extreme it becomes multiple personalities but she seems to have prevented that from occurring in itself thats remarkable considering what she went through what about roberta the psychiatrist frowned she didnt cope as well as gillian he admitted lynley gave a last glance out the window and returned to his seat a worn upholstered chair resting place no doubt for hundreds of tormented psyches is that why she ate as a way of escaping no i dont think so id say it was more an act of selfdestruction i dont understand the abused child feels he or she has done something wrong and is being punished for it roberta may well have eaten because the abuse led her to despise herselfher wickednessand destroying her body was a scourging thats one explanation the doctor hesitated and the other hard to say it could be that she tried to stop the abuse the only way she knew how short of suicide what better way than to destroy her body to make herself as ungillylike as possible that way her father wouldnt want her sexually but it didnt work unfortunately no he merely turned to perversions to arouse himself making her part of it that would feed his need for power i feel as if id like to tear teys apart lynley said i feel that way all the time the doctor responded how could anyonei dont understand it its a deviant behaviour a sickness teys was aroused by children his marriage to a sixteenyearold girlnot a voluptuous womanly sixteenyearold but a latematuring sixteenyearoldwould have been a glaring sign to anyone looking for aberrant behaviour but he was able to mask it well with his devotion to religion and his persona of the strong loving father thats so typical inspector lynley i cant tell you how typical it is and no one ever knew i cant believe it if you consider the situation its easy to believe teys projected a very successful image in his community at the same time his daughters were tricked into selfblame and secrecy gillian believed she had been responsible for her mothers desertion of her father and was making reparation for that by in teyss words being a mummy to him roberta believed that gillian had pleased her father and that she was supposed to do the same and both of them of course were taught from the bibleteyss careful selection of passages and his twisted interpretations of themthat what they were doing was not only right but written by the hand of god as their duty as his daughters it makes me sick it is sick he was sick consider his sickness he chose a child to be his bride that was safe he was threatened by the adult world and in the person of this sixteenyearold girl he saw someone who could arouse him with her childlike body and at the same time gratify his need for the selfrespect that a marriage would give him then why did he turn to his children when tessathis childlike bride of his produced a baby teys had frightening and irrefutable evidence that the creature who had been arousing him and upon whose body he had taken such gratification was not a child at all but a woman and he was threatened by women i should guess the feminine representation of the entire adult world that he feared she said he stopped sleeping with her ive no doubt of that if he had slept with her and failed to perform imagine his humiliation why risk that kind of failure when there in his house was a helpless infant from whom he could get immense pleasure and satisfaction lynley felt his throat close infant he asked do you mean dr samuels took the measure of lynleys reaction and nodded in sad recognition of an outrage he himself had felt for many years i should think that the abuse of gillian began in infancy she remembers the fi rst incident when she was four or five but teys was unlikely to have waited that long unless his religion was providing him with selfcontrol for those years its possible his religion each piece was falling into place more tidily than the last but as each did lynley felt an anger that needed free rein he controlled it with an effort shell stand trial eventually robertas going to recover shell be found competent to stand trial the doctor turned in his chair to watch the group in the garden but you know as well as i inspector that no jury in the world is going to convict her of anything when the truth is told so perhaps we can believe that there will be a form of justice after all the trees that towered above st catherines church cast long shadows on the exterior of the building so that even though it was still light outside the interior was dim the deep reds and purples from stained glass windows poured forth bloody pools of light which faded slowly on the cracked tile floor and votive candles flickered under statues who watched his movement in the aisle the air within the building was heavy and dead and as lynley made his way to the elizabethan confessional he shivered he opened the door went inside the booth knelt and waited the darkness was complete the tranquillity absolute a suitable ambience for meditating upon ones sins lynley thought a grill was moved in the darkness a gentle voice murmured incantations to a nonexistent god then yes my child at the last moment he wondered if he would be able to do it but he found his voice he came to you here lynley said this was the place where he confessed his sins did you absolve him father did you make some sort of mystical configuration in the air that told william teys he was free of the sin of abusing his children what did you tell him did you give him your blessing did you release him from the confessional his soul purged once more to go home to his farm and begin it again is that how it was in response he only heard breathing harsh and rapid that told him a living creature was on the other side of the grill and did gillian confess or was she too frightened did you talk to her about what her father did to her did you try to help her i the voice sounded as if it were coming from a great distance understand and forgive thats what you told her understand forgive what about roberta was she supposed to understand and forgive as well was a sixteenyearold girl supposed to learn to accept the fact that her father raped her made her pregnant that he then murdered her child or was that your idea father i didnt know about the baby i didnt know i didnt know the voice was frantic but you knew once you found it in the abbey you damn well knew you chose pericles father hart you damn well knew hehe never confessed to that never and what would you have done if he had what exactly would his penance have been for the murder of his child and it was murder you know it was murder no no william teys carried that baby from gembler farm to the abbey he couldnt wrap it in anything because anything he used might have been traced back to him so he carried it naked and it died you knew when you saw it whose baby it was how it got to the abbey you chose pericles for the epitaph murders as near to lust as flame to smoke you damn well knew he saidafter thathe swore he was cured cured a miraculous recovery from sexual deviance nicely engineered by the death of his infant child is that what you thought is that what you wanted to think he was recovered all right his idea of recovery was that hed stopped raping roberta but listen to me father because this is on your conscience and by god you shall hear me he stopped nothing else no you know its the truth he was addicted the only problem was that he needed a fresh young fix for his habit he needed bridie and you were going to let it happen he swore to me he swore on what the bible that he used to make gillian believe she had to give her body to her father is that what he swore on he stopped confessing i didnt know i you knew from the moment he started on bridie you knew and when you went to the farm and saw what roberta had done the real truth came crashing right down didnt it there was a stifled sob and then growing out of it a keening of grief that rose like the wail of jacob and broke on the utterance of three nearly incoherent words meamea culpa yes lynley hissed through your fault father i couldntit was the silence of the confessional its a holy oath there is no oath more important than life there is no oath more important than the ruin of a child you saw that didnt you when you went to the farm you knew that it was finally time to break the silence so you wiped off the axe you got rid of the knife and you came to scotland yard you knew the real truth would come out that way the truth you lacked the courage to reveal oh god iunderstand and forgive the whisper was broken not for this not for twentyseven years of physical abuse for two ruined lives for the death of their dreams there is no understanding there is no forgiveness by god not for this he shoved open the door of the confessional and left behind him a querulous voice rose in agonising prayer fret not thyself because of evildoersthey shall soon be cut down like the grasstrust in the lordhe shall give thee the desires of thy heartevildoers shall be cut off scarcely able to breathe lynley fl ung open the church door and stepped out into the air lady helen was leaning against the edge of a lichened sarcophagus watching gillian who stood at the small distant grave under the cypress trees her cropped blonde head bent in contemplation or prayer she heard lynleys footsteps but did not stir not even when he joined her and she felt the sure steady pressure of his arm against her own i saw deborah he said at last ah her eyes remained on gillians slight form i thought you might see her tommy i hoped you wouldnt but i did think you might you knew they were here in keldale why didnt you tell me still she looked away from him but for a moment she lowered her eyes what was there to say really wed said it already so many times she hesitated wanting to let it go to let the subject die between them once and for all but the backward abysm of time that constituted the many years of their friendship would not allow her to do so was it dreadful for you she made herself ask at fi rst and then then i saw that she loves him as you did once a regretful smile touched her lips briefl y yes as i did once where did you find the strength to let st james go helen how on earth did you survive it oh i muddled through somehow besides you were always there for me tommy you helped me you were always my friend as youve been mine my very best friend she laughed softly at that men say that about their dogs you know im not sure i ought to be flattered by the appellation but are you he asked most decidedly she replied she turned to him then and searched his face the exhaustion was there as it had been before but the weight of sorrow was lessened not gone that would not happen quickly but dissolving and leading him out of the past youre beyond the worst of it now arent you im beyond the worst i think in fact im ready to go on he touched the fall of her hair and smiled the lychgate opened and over lynleys shoulder lady helen saw sergeant havers coming into the graveyard her steps slowed momentarily when she saw them talking tranquilly together but she cleared her throat as if in warning of her intrusion and strode towards them quickly her shoulders squared sir youve a message from webberly she said to lynley stepha had it at the lodge a message what sort his usual cryptogram im afraid she handed the paper to him id positive london verifies york informed last pm she recited does it make sense to you he read the message over folded the paper and looked bleakly off through the graveyard to the hills beyond yes he replied but the words were not coming easily to him it makes perfect sense russell mowrey havers asked perceptively when he nodded she went on so he did go to london to turn tessa in to scotland yard how strange why not turn her in to the york police what could scotland yard no hed gone to london to see his family just as tessa guessed but he never made it farther than kings cross station kings cross station havers repeated thats where the ripper got him havers his picture was on the wall in webberlys office he went to the lodge alone he walked down church street and stood for a moment on the bridge as he had done only the night before the village was hushed but as he took a final look at keldale a door slammed nearby a little redhaired girl hurtled down the back steps of her house and darted to a shed she disappeared emerging moments later dragging a large sack of feed on the ground wheres dougal he called bridie looked up her curly hair trapped the sunlight burning an autumn contrast against the bright green pulloverseveral sizes too largethat she wore inside he has a stomachache today lynley wondered idly how one diagnosed a stomachache in a mallard and wisely thought better of asking why are you feeding him then he asked she pondered the question scratching her left leg with the top of her right foot mummy says i ought to shes been keeping him warm all day and she says she thinks he can eat something now sounds like a good nurse she is she waved a grubby hand at him and disappeared into the house a small package of life with her dreams intact he walked across the bridge and into the lodge behind the reception desk stepha stood up her lips parted to speak it was ezra farmingtons baby that you had wasnt it he asked her he was part of the wild crazy laughter you wanted after your brother died wasnt he thomas wasnt he yes do you watch when he and nigel torment each other over you are you amused when nigel drinks himself blind at the dove and whistle hoping to catch you spending time with ezra at his house across the street or do you escape the whole confl ict with richard gibsons help thats really unfair is it do you know that ezra doesnt believe he can paint any longer are you interested stepha hes destroyed his work the only pieces left are his paintings of you i cant help him you wont help him thats not true you wont help him lynley repeated for some reason he still wants you he wants the child as well he wants to know where it is he wants to know what you did with it who has it have you even bothered to tell him if its a boy or girl she dropped her eyes shesshe was adopted by a family in durham thats the way it had to be and thats to be his punishment i take it her eyes flew up for what why would i punish him for stopping the laughter for insisting on having something more with you for being willing to take chances for being all the things youre too afraid to be she didnt reply there was no need for her to do so when he could read the answer so clearly on her face she had not wanted to go to the farm the scene of so many of her childhood terrors the farm was a place she wished to bury in the past all she had wanted to see was the babys grave that done she was ready to leave the others this group of kind strangers who had come into her life did not question her rather they bundled her into the large silver car and drove her out of keldale she had no idea where they were taking her and she didnt much care jonah was gone nell was dead and whoever gillian was remained to be discovered she was simply a shell there was nothing else left lynley glanced at gillian in the mirror he wasnt sure what would happen he wasnt sure that it was the right thing to do he was working on instinct a blind instinct which insisted that something good had to rise like a phoenix triumphant from the ashes of the day he knew that he was looking for meaning that he couldnt accept the senselessness of russell mowreys death in kings cross station at the hands of an unknown killer he raged against it against its vile brutality against its diabolical ugliness against its terrible waste he would give meaning to it all he would not accept that these fragmented lives could not somehow conjoin could not reach across the chasm of nineteen years and find peace at last it was a risk he didnt care he would take it it was six oclock when he pulled in front of the house in york ill just be a moment he said to the others in the car and reached for his door handle sergeant havers touched his shoulder let me sir please he hesitated she watched him please she repeated he glanced at the closed front door of the house knowing that he couldnt possibly face the responsibility of putting the matter into haverss incapable hands not here not now not with so much at stake havers i can do it she replied please believe me he saw then that she was giving him the final say over her future that she was allowing him to be the one to decide whether she would stay in cid or return once and for all to the street it was represented in the matter before them sir he wanted desperately to refuse her permission to tell her to stay where she was in the car to condemn her to the pavements she had walked in uniform but none of that had been webberlys plan he understood that now and as he looked at her trusting resolute face he saw that haversreading his intention in their destinationhad built the funeral pyre herself and was perfectly determined to strike the match that would put to the test the promise of the phoenix all right he fi nally replied thank you sir she got out of the car and went to the front door it was opened she stepped inside the house and the waiting began he had never thought of himself much as a praying man but as he sat in the car in the growing darkness and the minutes passed he knew what it was to pray it was to will goodness out of evil hope out of despair life out of death it was to will dreams into existence and spectres into reality it was to will an end to anguish and a beginning to joy gillian stirred in the back seat whose house her voice died as the door fl ew open and tessa ran outside hesitating on the front path peering towards the car mummy gillian said it on a breath she said nothing else she got out of the car slowly and stared at the woman as if she were an apparition clinging to the door for support mummy gilly oh my god gilly tessa cried and began coming towards her it was all gillian needed she ran up the slope into her mothers arms and they entered the house together about the author elizabeth george is the author of highly acclaimed novels of psychological suspense her first novel a great
