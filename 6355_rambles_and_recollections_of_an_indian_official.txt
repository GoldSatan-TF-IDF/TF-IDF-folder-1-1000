greatest source of pleasure while there perhaps nine in ten would say the letters which they receive from their sisters at home these of all things perhaps tend most to link our affections with home by filling the landscapes so dear to our recollections with ever varying groups of the family circles among whom our infancy and our boyhood have been passed and among whom we still hope to spend the winter of our days they have a very happy facility in making us familiar with the new additions made from time to time to the dramatis personae of these scenes after we quit them in the character of husbands wives children or friends and while thus contributing so much to our happiness they no doubt tend to make us better citizens of the world and servants of government than we should otherwise be for in our struggles through life in india we have all more or less an eye to the approbation of those circles which our kind sisters representwho may therefore be considered in the exalted light of a valuable species of unpaid magistracy to the government of india no brother has ever had a kinder or better correspondent than i have had in you my dear sister and it was the consciousness of having left many of your valued letters unanswered in the press of official duties that made me first think of devoting a part of my leisure to you in these rambles and recollections while on my way from the banks of the nerbudda river to the himālaya mountains in search of health in the end of and beginning of to what i wrote during that journey i have now added a few notes observations and conversations with natives on the subjects which my narrative seemed to embrace and the whole will i hope interest and amuse you and the other members of our family and appear perchance not altogether uninteresting or uninstructive to those who are strangers to us both of one thing i must beg you to be assured that i have nowhere indulged in fiction either in the narrative the recollections or the conversations what i relate on the testimony of others i believe to be true and what i relate upon my own you may rely upon as being so had i chosen to write a work of fiction i might possibly have made it a good deal more interesting but i question whether it would have been so much valued by you or so useful to others and these are the objects i have had in view the work may perhaps tend to make the people of india better understood by those of my own countrymen whose destinies are cast among them and inspire more kindly feelings towards them those parts which to the general reader will seem dry and tedious may be considered by the indian statesman as the most useful and important the opportunities of observation which varied employment has given me have been such as fall to the lot of few but although i have endeavoured to make the most of them the time of public servants is not their own and that of few men has been more exclusively devoted to the service of their masters than mine it may be however that the world or that part of it which ventures to read these pages will think that it had been better had i not been left even the little leisure that has been devoted to them

chapter note editors preface the rambles and recollections of an indian official always a costly book has been scarce and difficult to procure for many years past among the crowd of books descriptive of indian scenery manners and customs the sterling merits of sir william sleemans work have secured it preeminence and kept it in constant demand notwithstanding the lapse of nearly fifty years since its publication the high reputation of this work does not rest upon its strictly literary qualities the author was a busy man immersed all his life in the practical affairs of administration and too full of his subject to be careful of strict correctness of style or minute accuracy of expression yet so great is the intrinsic value of his observations and so attractive are the sincerity and sympathy with which he discusses a vast range of topics that the reader refuses to be offended by slight formal defects in expression or arrangement and willingly yields to the charm of the authors genial and unstudied conversation it would be difficult to name any other book so full of instruction for the young angloindian administrator when this work was published in the author had had thirtyfive years varied experience of indian life and had accumulated and assimilated an immense store of knowledge concerning the history manners and modes of thought of the complex population of india he thoroughly understood the peculiarities of the various native races and the characteristics which distinguish them from the nations of europe while his sympathetic insight into indian life had not orientalized him nor had it ever for one moment caused him to forget his position and heritage as an englishman this attitude of sane and discriminating sympathy is the right attitude for the englishman in india to enumerate the topics on which wise and profitable observations will be found in this book would be superfluous the wine is good and needs no bush so much may be said that the book is one to interest that nondescript person the general reader in europe or america as well as the angloindian official besides good advice and sound teaching on matters of policy and administration it contains many charming though inartificial descriptions of scenery and customs many ingenious speculations and some capital stories the ethnologist the antiquary the geologist the soldier and the missionary will all find in it something to suit their several tastes in this edition the numerous misprints of the original edition have been all and for the most part silently corrected the extremely erratic punctuation has been freely modified and the spelling of indian words and names has been systematized two paragraphs misplaced in the original edition at the end of chapter of volume i have been removed and inserted in their proper place at the end of chapter and the supplementary notes printed at the end of the second volume of the original edition have been brought up to the positions which they were intended to occupy chapters to of the first volume describing the contest for empire between the sons of shāh jahān are in substance only a free version of berniers work entitled the late revolution of the empire of the great mogol these chapters have not been reprinted because the history of that revolution can now be read much more satisfactorily in mr constables edition of berniers travels except as above stated the text of the present edition of the rambles and recollections is a faithful reprint of the authors text in the spelling of names and other words of oriental languages the editor has endeavoured to strike a mean between popular usage and academic precision preferring to incur the charge of looseness to that of pedantry diacritical marks intended to distinguish between the various sibilants dentals nasals and so forth of the arabic and sanskrit alphabets have been purposely omitted long vowels are marked by the sign except in a few familiar words such as nerbudda and hindoo which are spelled in the traditional manner vowels are to be pronounced as in italian or as in the following english examples namely ā as in call e or ē as the medial vowel in cake i as in kill ī as the medial vowels in keel u as in full ū as the medial vowels in fool o or ō as in bone ai or āi as eye or aye respectively and au as the medial sound in fowl short a with stress is pronounced like the u in but and if without stress as an indistinct vowel like the a in america the editors notes being designed merely to explain and illustrate the text so as to render the book fully intelligible and helpful to readers of the present day have been compressed into the narrowest possible limits even india changes and observations and criticisms which were perfectly true when recorded can no longer be safely applied without explanation to the india of today the authors few notes are distinguished by his initials a copious analytical index has been compiled the bibliography is as complete as careful inquiry could make it but it is possible that some anonymous papers by the author published in periodicals may have escaped notice the memoir of sir william sleeman is based on the slight sketch prefixed to the journey through the kingdom of oude supplemented by much additional matter derived from his published works and correspondence as well as from his unpublished letters and other papers generously communicated by his only son captain henry sleeman amplematerials exist for a full account of sir william sleemans noble and interesting life which well deserves to be recorded in detail but the necessary limitations of these volumes preclude the editor from making free use of the biographical matter at his command the reproduction of the twentyfour coloured plates of varying merit which enrich the original edition has not been considered desirable the map shows clearly the route taken by the author in the journey the description of which is the leading theme of the bookeditors preface my edition published by archibald constable and company in being out of print but still in demand mr humphrey milford the present owner of the copyright has requested me to revise the book and bring it up to date this new edition is issued uniform with mr beauchamps third edition of hindu manners customs and ceremonies by the abbé j a dubois oxford at the clarendon press a work bearing a strong resemblance in substance to the rambles and recollections and also like sleemans book in that it is as valuable today as ever it waseven more valuable in some respects the labour of revision has proved to be far more onerous than was expected in the course of twentyone years the numerous changes which have occurred in india not only in administrative arrangements but of various other kinds necessitate the emendation of notes which although accurate when written no longer agree with existing facts the appearance of many new books and improved editions involves changes in a multitude of references such alterations are most considerable in the annotations dealing with the buildings at agra sikandara fathpursīkrī and delhi and the connected political history concerning which much new information is now available certain small misstatements of fact in my old notes have been put right some of those errors which escaped the notice of critics have been detected by me and some have been rectified by the aid of criticisms received from sir george grierson cie mr william crooke sometime president of the folklore society and other kind correspondents to all of whom i am grateful naturally the opportunity has been taken to revise the wording throughout and to eliminate misprints and typographical defects the index has been recast so as to suit the changed paging and to include the new matter captain james lewis sleeman of the royal sussex regiment has been good enough to permit the reproduction of his grandfathers portrait and has communicated papers which have enabled me to make corrections in and additions to the memoir largely enhancing the interest and value of that section of the book notes certain small changes have been madememoir of majgen sir william henry sleeman kcb the sleemans an ancient cornish family for several generations owned the estate of pool park in the parish of saint judy in the county of cornwall captain philip sleeman who married mary spry a member of a distinguished family in the same county was stationed at stratton in cornwall on august when his son william henry was born in at the age of twentyone william henry sleeman was nominated through the good offices of lord de dunstanville to an infantry cadetship in the bengal army on the th of march in the same year he sailed from gravesend in the ship devonshire and having touched at madeira and the cape reached india towards the close of the year he arrived at the cantonment of dinapore near patna on the th december and on christmas day began his military career as a cadet he at once applied himself with exemplary diligence to the study of the arabic and persian languages and of the religions and customs of india passing in due course through the ordinary early stages of military life he was promoted to the rank of ensign on the rd september and to that of lieutenant on the th december lieutenant sleeman served in the war with nepal which began in and terminated in during the campaign he narrowly escaped death from a violent epidemic fever which nearly destroyed his regiment three hundred of my own regiment he observes consisting of about seven hundred were obliged to be sent to their homes on sick leave the greater number of those who remained continued to suffer and a great many died of about ten european officers present with my regiment seven had the fever and five died of it almost all in a state of delirium i was myself one of the two who survived and i was for many days delirious the services of lieutenant sleeman during the war attracted attention and accordingly in he was selected to report on certain claims to prizemoney the report submitted by him in february was accepted as able impartial and satisfactory after the termination of the war he served with his regiment at allahabad and in the neighbouring district of partābgarh where he laid the foundation of the intimate knowledge of oudh affairs displayed in his later writings in he was selected for civil employ and was appointed junior assistant to the agent of the governorgeneral administering the sāgar and nerbudda territories those territories which had been annexed from the marāthās two years previously are now included in the jurisdiction of the chief commissioner of the central provinces in such a recentlyconquered country where the sale of all widows by auction for the benefit of the treasury and other strange customs still prevailed the abilities of an able and zealous young officer had ample scope sleeman after a brief apprenticeship received in the independent civil charge of the district of narsinghpur in the nerbudda valley and there for more than two years by far the most laborious of his life his whole attention was engrossed in preventing and remedying the disorders of his district sleeman during the time that he was in charge of the narsinghpur district had no suspicion that it was a favourite resort of thugs a few years later in or about he was astounded to learn that a gang of thugs resided in the village of kandēlī not four hundred yards from his courthouse and that the extensive groves of mandēsar on the sāgar road only one stage distant from his headquarters concealed one of the greatest bhīls or places of murder in all india the arrest of feringheea one of the most influential thug leaders having given the key to the secret his disclosures were followed up by sleeman with consummate skill and untiring assiduity in the years and the reports submitted by him and other officers at last opened the eyes of the superior authorities and forced them to recognize the fact that the murderous organization extended over every part of india adequate measures were then taken for the systematic suppression of the evil thuggee sleeman made it the main business of his life to hunt down the criminals and to extirpate their secret society he recorded his experiences in the series of valuable publications described in the bibliography in this brief memoir it is impossible to narrate in detail the thrilling story of the suppression of thuggee and i must be content to pass on and give in bare outline the main facts of sleemans honourable career while at narsinghpur sleeman received on the th april brevet rank as captain in he was transferred and on the rd september of the following year was gazetted captain in failure of health compelled him to take leave on medical certificate in march captain sleeman assumed civil and executive charge of the jabalpurjubbulpore district from which he was transferred to sāgar in january while stationed at jabalpur he married on the st june amélie josephine the daughter of count blondin de fontenne a french nobleman who at the sacrifice of a considerable property had managed to escape from the revolution a lady informs the editor that she remembers sleemans fine house at jabalpur it stood in a large walled park stocked with spotted deer both house and park were destroyed when the railway was carried through the site mr c eraser on return from leave in january resumed charge of the revenue and civil duties of the sāgar district leaving the magisterial duties to captain sleeman who continued to discharge them till january by the resolution of government dated th january captain sleeman was directed to fix his headquarters at jabalpur and was appointed general superintendent of the operations for the suppression of thuggee being relieved from every other charge in his health again broke down and he was obliged to take leave on medical certificate accompanied by his wife and little son he went into camp in november and marched through the jabalpur damoh and sāgar districts of the agency and then through the native states of orchhā datiyā and gwālior arriving at agra on the st january after a brief halt at agra he proceeded through the bharatpur state to delhi and meerut and thence on leave to simla during his march from jabalpur to meerut he amused himself by keeping the journal which forms the basis of the rambles and recollections of an indian official the manuscript of this work except the two supplementary chapters was completed in though not given to the world till on the st of february in the twentyeighth year of his service sleeman was gazetted major during the same year he made a tour in the interior of the himalayas which he described at length in an unpublished journal later in the year he went down to calcutta to see his boy started on the voyage home in february he assumed charge of the office of commissioner for the suppression of thuggee and dacoity up to that date the office of commissioner for the suppression of dacoity had been separate from that of general superintendent of the measures for the suppression of thuggee and had been filled by another officer mr hugh eraser of the civil service during the next two years sleeman passed much of his time in the northwestern provinces now the agra province in the united provinces of agra and oudh making murādābād his headquarters and thoroughly investigating the secret criminal organizations of upper india in he was offered the coveted and lucrative post of resident at lucknow vacant by the resignation of colonel low but that officer immediately after his resignation lost all his savings through the failure of his bankers and sleeman moved by a generous impulse wrote to colonel low begging him to retain the appointment sleeman was then deputed on special duty to bundēlkhand to investigate the grave disorders in that province while at jhānsī in december he narrowly escaped assassination by a dismissed afghan sepoy who poured the contents of a blunderbuss into a native officer in attendance during the troubles with sindhia which culminated in the battle of mahārājpur fought on the th december sleeman who had become a lieutcolonel was resident at gwālior and was actually in sindhias camp when the battle unexpectedly began in the residency at lucknow again fell vacant and lord dalhousie by a letter dated th september offered sleeman the appointment in the following terms the high reputation you have earned your experience of civil administration your knowledge of the people and the qualifications you possess as a public man have led me to submit your name to the council of india as an officer to whom i could commit this important charge with entire confidence that its duties would be well performed i do myself therefore the honour of proposing to you to accept the office of resident at lucknow with especial reference to the great changes which in all probability will take place retaining your superintendency of thuggee affairs it will be manifestly necessary that you should be relieved from the duty of the trials of thugs usually condemned at lucknow in the hope that you will not withhold from the government your services in the capacity i have named and in the further hope of finding an opportunity of personally making your acquaintance i have the honour to be dear colonel sleeman very faithfully yours dalhousie the remainder of sleemans official life from january was spent in oudh and was chiefly devoted to ceaseless and hopeless endeavours to reform the kings administration and relieve the sufferings of his grievously oppressed subjects on the st of december the resident began his memorable three months tour through oudh so vividly described in the special work devoted to the purpose the awful revelations of the journey through the kingdom of oude largely influenced the court of directors and the imperial government in forming their decision to annex the kingdom although that decision was directly opposed to the advice of sleeman who consistently advocated reform of the administration while deprecating annexation his views are stated with absolute precision in a letter written in or and published in the times in november we have no right to annex or confiscate oude but we have a right under the treaty of to take the management of it but not to appropriate its revenues to ourselves we can do this with honour to our government and benefit to the people to confiscate would be dishonest and dishonourable to annex would be to give the people a government almost as bad as their own if we put our screw upon them journey ed vol i intro p xxi the earnest efforts of the resident to suppress crime and improve the administration of oudh aroused the bitter resentment of a corrupt court and exposed his life to constant danger three deliberate attempts to assassinate him atlucknow are recorded the first in december is described in detail in a letter of sleemans dated the th of that month and less fully by general hervey in some records of crime vol ii p the residents life was saved by a gallant orderly named tīkarām who was badly wounded inquiry proved that the crime was instigated by the kings moonshee the second attempt on october is fully narrated in an official letter to the government of india bibliography no its failure may be reasonably ascribed to a special interposition of providence the resident during all the years he had lived at lucknow had been in the habit of sleeping in an upper chamber approached by a separate private staircase guarded by two sentries on the night mentioned the sentries were drugged and two men stole up the stairs they slashed at the bed with their swords but found it empty because on that one occasion general sleeman had slept in another room the third attempt was not carried as far and the exact date is not ascertainable but the incident is well remembered by the family and occurred between and one day the resident was crossing his study when for some reason or another he looked behind a curtain screening a recess he then saw a man standing there with a large knife in his hand general sleeman who was unarmed challenged the man as being a thug he at once admitted that he was such and under the spell of a masterspirit allowed himself to be disarmed without resistance he had been employed at the residency for some time unsuspected such personal risks produced no effect on the stout heart of sleeman who continued unshaken and undismayed his unselfish labours in the long strain of fortyfive years service broke down sleemans strong constitution he tried to regain health by a visit to the hills but this expedient proved ineffectual and he was ordered home on the th of february while on his way home on board the monarch he died off ceylon at the age of sixtyseven and was buried at sea just six days after he had been granted the dignity of kcb lord dalhousies desire to meet his trusted officer was never gratified the following correspondence between the governorgeneral and sleeman now published for the first time is equally creditable to both parties barrackpore park january th my dear general sleeman i have heard today of your arrival in calcutta and have heard at the same time with sincere concern that you are still suffering in health a desire to disturb you as little as possible induces me to have recourse to my pen in order to convey to you a communication which i had hoped to be able to make in person some time since when adjusting the details connected with my retirement from the government of india i solicited permission to recommend to her majestys gracious consideration the names of some who seemed to me to be worthy of her majestys favour my request was moderate i asked only to be allowed to submit the name of one officer from each presidency the name which is selected from the bengal army was your own and i ventured to express my hope that her majesty would be pleased to mark her sense of the long course of able and honourable and distinguished service through which you had passed by conferring upon you the civil cross of a knight commander of the bath as yet no reply has been received to my letter but as you have now arrived at the presidency i lose no time in making known to you what has been done in the hope that you will receive it as a proof of the high estimation in which your services and character arc held as well by myself as by the entire community of india i beg to remain my dear general very truly yours dalhousie majorgeneral sleeman reply to above dated th january my lord i was yesterday evening favoured with your lordships most kind and flattering letter of the th instant from barrackpore i cannot adequately express how highly honoured i feel by the mention that you have been pleased to make of my services to her majesty the queen and how much gratified i am by this crowning act of kindness from your lordship in addition to the many favours i have received at your hands during the last eight years and whether it may or may not be my fate to live long enough to see the honourable rank actually conferred upon me which you have been so considerate and generous as to ask for me the letter now received from your lordship will of itself be deemed by my family as a substantial honour and it will so preserved i trust by my son with feelings of honest pride at the thought that his father had merited such a mark of distinction from so eminent a statesman as the marquis of dalhousie my right hand is so crippled by rheumatism that i am obliged to make use of an amanuensis to write this letter and my bodily strength is so much reduced that i cannot hope before embarking for england to pay my personal respects to your lordship under these unfortunate circumstances i now beg to take my leave of your lordship to offer my unfeigned and anxious wishes for your lordships health and happiness and with every sentiment of respect and gratitude to subscribe myself your lordships most faithful and obedient servant w h sleeman majorgeneral to the most noble the marquis of dalhousie kt governorgeneral c c calcuttasir william sleeman was an accomplished oriental linguist well versed in arabic persian and urdu and also in possession of a good working knowledge of latin greek and french his writings afford many proofs of his keen interest in the sciences of geology agricultural chemistry and political economy and of his intelligent appreciation of the lessons taught by history nor was he insensible to the charms of art especially those of poetry his favourite authors among the poets seem to have been shakespeare milton scott wordsworth and cowper his knowledge of the customs and modes of thought of the natives of india rarely equalled and never surpassed was more than half the secret of his notable success as an administrator the greatest achievement of his busy and unselfish life was the suppression of the system of organized murder known as thuggee and in the execution of that prolonged and onerous task he displayed the most delicate tact the keenest sagacity and the highest power of organization his own words are his best epitaph i have gone on quietly he writes through evil and through good report doing to the best of my ability the duties which it has pleased the government of india from time to time to confide to me in the manner which appeared to me most conformable to its wishes and its honour satisfied and grateful for the trust and confidence which enabled me to do so much good for the people and to secure so much of their attachment and gratitude to their rulers his grandson captain j l sleeman who when stationed in india from to visited the scenes of his grandfathers labours states that everywhere he found the memory of his respected ancestor revered and was given the assurance that no englishman had ever understood the native of india so well or removed so many oppressive evils as general sir w h sleeman and that his memory would endure for ever in the empire to which he devoted his lifes work this necessarily meagre account of a life which deserves more ample commemoration may be fitly closed by a few words concerning the relatives and descendants of sir william sleeman his sister and regular correspondent to whom he dedicated the rambles and recollections was married to captain furse rn his brothers son james came out to india in joined the rd regiment of the bengal army was selected for employment in the political department and was thus enabled to give valuable aid in the campaign against thuggee in due course he was appointed to the office of general superintendent of the operations against thuggee which had been held by his uncle he rose to the rank of colonel and after a long period of excellent service lived to enjoy nearly thirty years of honourable retirement he died at his residence near ross in at the age of eightyone in sir williams only son henry arthur was gazetted to the th queens lancers and having retired early from the army with the rank of captain died in his

morgenländischen gesellschaft leipzigrambles and recollections chapter annual fairs held upon the banks of sacred streams in india before setting out on our journey towards the himālaya we formed once more an agreeable party to visit the marble rocks of the nerbudda at bherāghāt it was the end of kārtik when the hindoos hold fairs on all their sacred streams at places consecrated by poetry or tradition as the scene of some divine work or manifestation these fairs are at once festive and holy every person who comes enjoying himself as much as he can and at the same time seeking purification from all past transgressions by bathing and praying in the holy stream and making laudable resolutions to be better for the future the ceremonies last five days and take place at the same time upon all the sacred rivers throughout india and the greater part of the whole hindoo population from the summits of the himālaya mountains to cape comōrin will i believe during these five days be found congregated at these fairs in sailing down the ganges one may pass in the course of a day half a dozen such fairs each with a multitude equal to the population of a large city and rendered beautifully picturesque by the magnificence and variety of the tent equipages of the great and wealthy the preserver of the universe bhagvān vishnu is supposed on the th of asārh to descend to the world below pātāl to defend rājā bali from the attacks of indra to stay with him four months and to come up again on the th kārtik during his absence almost all kinds of worship and festivities are suspended and they recommence at these fairs where people assemble to hail his resurrection our tents were pitched upon a green sward on one bank of a small stream running into the nerbudda close by while the multitude occupied the other bank at night all the tents and booths are illuminated and the scene is hardly less animated by night than by day but what strikes a european most is the entire absence of all tumult and disorder at such places he not only sees no disturbance but feels assured that there will be none and leaves his wife and children in the midst of a crowd of a hundred thousand persons all strangers to them and all speaking a language and following a religion different from theirs while he goes off the whole day hunting and shooting in the distant jungles without the slightest feeling of apprehension for their safety or comfort it is a singular fact which i know to be true that during the great mutiny of our native troops at barrackpore in the chief leaders bound themselves by a solemn oath not to suffer any european lady or child to be injured or molested happen what might to them in the collision with their officers and the government my friend captain reid one of the general staff used to allow his children five in number to go into the lines and play with the soldiers of the mutinous regiments up to the very day when the artillery opened upon them and of above thirty european ladies then at the station not one thought of leaving the place till they heard the guns mrs colonel faithful with her daughter and another young lady who had both just arrived from england went lately all the way from calcutta to lūdiāna on the banks of the hyphasis a distance of more than twelve hundred miles in their palankeens with relays of bearers and without even a servant to attend them they were travelling night and day for fourteen days without the slightest apprehension of injury or of insult cases of ladies travelling in the same manner by dāk stages immediately after their arrival from england to all parts of the country occur every day and i know of no instance of injury or insult sustained by them does not this speak volumes for the character of our rule in india would men trust their wives and daughters in this manner unprotected among a people that disliked them and their rule we have not a garrison or walled cantonments or fortified position of any kind for our residence from one end of our eastern empire to the other save at the three capitals of calcutta madras and bombay we know and feel that the people everywhere look up to and respect us in spite of all our faults and we like to let them know and feel that we have confidence in them sir thomas munro has justly observed i do not exactly know what is meant by civilizing the people of india in the theory and practice of good government they may be deficient but if a good system of agriculture if unrivalled manufactures if the establishment of schools for reading and writing if the general practice of kindness and hospitality and above all if a scrupulous respect and delicacy towards the female sex are amongst the points that denote a civilized people then the hindoos are not inferior in civilization to the people of europe bishop heber writes in the same favourable terms of the hindoos in the narrative of his journey through india and where shall we find a mind more capable of judging of the merits and demerits of a people than his the concourse of people at this fair was as usual immense but a great many who could not afford to provide tents forthe accommodation of their families were driven away before their time by some heavy showers of to them unseasonable rains on this and similar occasions the people bathe in the nerbudda without the aid of priests but a number of poor brahmans attend at these festivals to receive charity though not to assist at the ceremonies those who could afford it gave a trifle to these men as they came out of the sacred stream but in no case was it demanded or even solicited with any appearance of importunity as it commonly is at fairs and holy places on the ganges the first day the people bathe below the rapid over which the river falls after it emerges from its peaceful abode among the marble rocks on the second day just above this rapid and on the third day two miles further up at the cascade when the whole body of the limpid stream of the nerbudda confined to a narrow channel of only a few yards wide falls tumultuously down in a beautiful cascade into a deep chasm of marble rocks this fall of their sacred stream the people call the dhuāndhār or the smoky fall from the thick vapour which is always seen rising from it in the morning from below the river glides quietly and imperceptibly for a mile and a half along a deep and according to popular belief a fathomless channel of from ten to fifty yards wide with snowwhite marble rocks rising perpendicularly on either side from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet high and in some parts fearfully overhanging suspended in recesses of these white rocks are numerous large black nests of hornets ready to descend upon any unlucky wight who may venture to disturb their repose and as the boats of the curious european visitors pass up and down to the sound of music clouds of wild pigeons rise from each side and seem sometimes to fill the air above them here according to native legends repose the pāndavas the heroes of their great homeric poem the mahābhārata whose names they have transferred to the valley of the nerbudda every fantastic appearance of the rocks caused by those great convulsions of nature which have so much disturbed the crust of the globe or by the slow and silent working of the waters is attributed to the godlike power of those great heroes of indian romance and is associated with the recollection of scenes in which they are supposed to have figured the strata of the kaimūr range of sandstone hills which runs diagonally across the valley of the nerbudda are thrown up almost perpendicularly in some places many hundred feet above the level of the plain while in others for many miles together their tops are only visible above the surface these are so many strings of the oxen which the arrows of arjun one of the five brothers converted into stone and many a stream which now waters the valley first sprang from the surface of the earth at the touch of his lance as his troops wanted water the image of the gods of a former day which now lie scattered among the ruins of old cities buried in the depth of the forest are nothing less than the bodies of the kings of the earth turned into stone for their temerity in contending with these demigods in battle ponds among the rocks of the nerbudda where all the great fairs are held still bear the names of the five brothers who are the heroes of this great poem and they are every year visited by hundreds of thousands who implicitly believe that their waters once received upon their bosoms the wearied limbs of those whose names they bear what is life without the charms of fiction and without the leisure and recreations which these sacred imaginings tend to give to the great mass of those who have nothing but the labour of their hands to depend upon for their subsistence let no such fictions be believed and the holidays and pastimes of the lower orders in every country would soon cease for they have almost everywhere owed their origin and support to some religious dream which has commanded the faith and influenced the conduct of great masses of mankind and prevented one man from presuming to work on the day that another wished to rest from his labours the people were of opinion they told me that the ganges as a sacred stream could last only sixty years more when the nerbudda would take its place the waters of the nerbudda are they say already so much more sacred than those of the ganges that to see them is sufficient to cleanse men from their sins whereas the ganges must be touched before it can have that effect at the temple built on the top of a conical hill at bherāghāt overlooking the river is a statue of a bull carrying siva the god of destruction and his wife pārvatī seated behind him they have both snakes in their hands and siva has a large one round his loins as a waistband there are several demons in human shape lying prostrate under the belly of the bull and the whole are well cut out of one large slab of hard basalt from a dyke in the marble rock beneath they call the whole group gaurī sankar and i found in the fair exposed for sale a brass model of a similar one from jeypore jaipur but not so well shaped and proportioned on noticing this we were told that such difference was to be expected since the brass must have been made by man whereas the gaurī sankar of the temple above was a real pākhān or a conversion of living beings into stone by the gods they were therefore the exact resemblance of living beings while the others could only be rude imitations gaurī or the fair is the name of pārvatī or dēvī when she appears with her husband siva on such occasions she is always fair and beautiful sankar is another name of siva or mahādēo or rudra on looking into the temple at the statue a lady expressed her surprise at the entireness as well as the excellence of the figures while all round had been so much mutilated by the muhammadans they are quite a different thing from the others said a respectable old landholder they are a conversion of real flesh and blood into stone and no human hands can either imitate or hurt them she smiled incredulously while he looked very grave and appealed to the whole crowd of spectators assembled who all testified to the truth of what he had said and added that at no distant day the figures would be all restored to life again the deities would all come back without doubt and reanimate their old bodies again all the people who come to bathe at the fair bring chaplets of yellow jasmine and hang them as offerings round the necks of the god and his consort and at the same time they make some small offerings of rice to each of the many images that stand within the same apartment and also to those which under a stone roof supported upon stone pillarsline the inside of the wall that surrounds the circular area in the centre of which the temple stands the images inside the temple are those of the three great gods brahma vishnu and siva with their primaeval consorts but those that occupy the piazza outside are the representations of the consorts of the different incarnations of these three gods and these consorts are themselves the incarnations of the primaeval wives who followed their husbands in all their earthly ramblings they have all the female form and are about the size of ordinary women and extremely well cut out of fine white and green sandstone but their heads are those of the animals in which their respective husbands became incarnate such as the lion the elephant c or those of the vāhans or animals on which they rode such as the bull the swan the eagle c but these i presume are mere capricios of the founder of the temple the figures are sixtyfour in number all mounted upon their respective vāhans but have been sadly mutilated by the pious muhammadans the old mahant or high priest told us that mahādēo and his wife were in reality our adam and eve they came here together said he on a visit to the mountain kailās and being earnestly solicited to leave some memorial of their visit got themselves turned into stone the popular belief is that some very holy man who had been occupied on the top of this little conical hill where the temple now stands in austere devotions for some few thousand years was at last honoured with a visit from siva and his consort who asked him what they could do for him he begged them to wait till he should bring some flowers from the woods to make them a suitable offering they promised to do so and he ran down plunged into the nerbudda and drowned himself in order that these august persons might for ever remain and do honour to his residence and his name they however left only their mortal coil but will one day return and resume it i know not whether i am singular in the notion or not but i think mahādēo and his consort are really our adam and eve and that the people have converted them into the god and goddess of destruction from some vague idea of their original sin which involved all their race in destruction the snakes which form the only dress of mahādēo would seem to confirm this notion notes the nerbudda narbadā or narmadā river is the boundary between hindustan or northern india and the deccan dakhin or southern india the beautiful gorge of the marble

at the present day chapter hindoo system of religion the hindoo system is this a great divine spirit or essence brahma pervades the whole universe and the soul of every human being is a drop from this great ocean to which when it becomes perfectly purified it is reunited the reunion is the eternal beatitude to which all look forward with hope and the soul of the brahman is nearest to it if he has been a good man his soul becomes absorbed in the brahma and if a bad man it goes to narak hell and after the expiration of its period there of limited imprisonment it returns to earth and occupies the body of some other animal it again advances by degrees to the body of the brahman and thence when fitted for it into the great brahma from this great eternal essence emanate brahma the creator whose consort is sarasvatī vishnu the preserver whose consort is lakshmī and siva alias māhadēo the destroyer whose consort is pārvatī according to popular belief jamrāj yamarāja is the judicial deity who has been appointed by the greater powers to pass the final judgement on the tenor of mens lives according to proceedings drawn up by his secretary chitragupta if mens actions have been good their souls are as the next stage advanced a step towards the great essence brahma and if bad they are thrown back and obliged to occupy the bodies of brutes or of people of inferior caste as the balance against them may be great or small there is an intermediate stage a narak or hell for bad men and a baikunth or paradise for the good in which they find their felicity in serving that god of the three to which they have specially devoted themselves while on earth but from this stage after the period of their sentence is expired men go back to their pilgrimage on earth again there are numerous dēos devas or good spirits of whom indra is the chief and daityas or bad spirits and there have also been a great number of incarnations from the three great gods and their consorts who have made their appearance upon the earth when required for particular purposes all these incarnations are called avatārs or descents vishnu has been eleven times on the globe in different shapes and siva seven times the avatārs of vishnu are celebrated in many popular poems such as the rāmāyana or history of the rape of sitā the wife of rāma the seventh incarnation the mahābhārata and the bhāgavata purāna which describe the wars and amours of this god in his last human shape all these books are believed to have been written either by the hand or by the inspiration of the god himself thousands of years before the events they describe actually took place it was they say as easy for the deity to write or dictate a battle an amour or any other important event ten thousand years before as the day after it took place and i believe ninetenths perhaps ninetynine in a hundred of the hindoo population believe implicitly that these accounts were also written it is now pretty clear that all these works are of comparatively recent date that the great poem of the mahābhārata could not have been written before the year of the christian era and was probably written so late as ad that krishna if born at all must have been born on the th of august ad but was most likely a mere creation of the imagination to serve the purpose of the brahmans of ujain in whom the fiction originated that the other incarnations were invented about the same time and for the same object though the other persons described as incarnations were real princes parasu rāma before christ and rāma born before christ in the mahābhārata krishna is described as fighting in the same army with yudhishthira and his four brothers yudhishthira was a real person who ascended the throne at delhi bc or years before the birth of krishna bentley supposes that the incarnations particularly that of krishna were invented by the brahmans of ujain with a view to check the progress of christianity in that part of the world see his historical view of the hindoo astronomy that we find in no history any account of the alarming progress of christianity about the time these fables were written is no proof that bentley was wrong when monsieur thevenot was at agra in the christian population was roughly estimated at twentyfive thousand families they had all passed away before it became one of our civil and military stations in the beginning of the present century and we might search history in vain for any mention of them see his travels in india part iii one single prince well disposed to give christians encouragement and employment might in a few years get the same number around his capital and it is probable that the early christians in india occasionally found such princes and gave just cause of alarm to the brahman priests who were then in the infancy of their despotic power during the war with nepal in and the division with which i served came upon an extremely interesting colony of about two thousand christian families at betiyā in the tirhūt district on the borders of the tarāi forest this colony had been created by one man the bishop a venetian by birth under the protection of a small hindoo prince the rājā of betiyā this holy man had been some fifty years among these people with little or no support from europe or from any other quarter the only aid he got from the rājā was a pledge that no member of his church should be subject to the purveyance system under which the people everywhere suffered so much and this pledge the rājā though a hindoo had never suffered to be violated there were men of all trades among them and they formed one very largestreet remarkable for the superior style of its buildings and the sober industry of its inhabitants the masons carpenters and blacksmiths of this little colony were working in our camp every day while we remained in the vicinity and better workmen i have never seen in india but they would all insist upon going to divine service at the prescribed hours they had built a splendid pucka dwellinghouse for their bishop and a still more splendid church and formed for him the finest garden i have seen in india surrounded with a good wall and provided with admirable pucka wells the native christian servants who attended at the old bishops table taught by himself spoke latin to him but he was become very feeble and spoke himself a mixture of latin italian his native tongue and hindustānī we used to have him at our messes and take as much care of him as of an infant for he was become almost as frail as one the joy and the excitement of being once more among europeans and treated by them with so much reverence in the midst of his flock were perhaps too much for him for he sickened and died soon after the rājā died soon after him and in all probability the flock has disappeared no europeans except a few indigo planters of the neighbourhood had ever before known or heard of this colony and they seemed to consider them only as a set of great scoundrels who had better carts and bullocks than anybody else in the country which they refused to let out at the same rate as the others and which they the indigo lords were not permitted to seize and employ at discretion roman catholics have a greater facility in making converts in india than protestants from having so much more in their form of worship to win the affections through the medium of the imagination notes men are occasionally exempted from the necessity of becoming a brahman first men of low caste if they die at particular places where it is the

ninety acres of land the bettiah mission still exists and maintains the catholic mission press where publications illustrating the history of the capuchin missions have been printed father felix oc is at work on the subject chapter legend of the nerbudda river the legend is that the nerbudda which flows west into the gulf of cambay was wooed and won in the usual way by the sōn river which rises from the same tableland of amarkantak and flows east into the ganges and bay of bengal all the previous ceremonies having been performed the sōn came with due pomp and circumstance to fetch his bride in the procession called the barāt up to which time the bride and bridegroom are supposed never to have seen each other unless perchance they have met in infancy her majesty the nerbudda became exceedingly impatient to know what sort of a personage her destinies were to be linked to while his majesty the sōn advanced at a slow and stately pace at last the queen sent johilā the daughter of the barber to take a close view of him and to return and make a faithful and particular report of his person his majesty was captivated with the little johilā the barbers daughter at first sight and she nothing loath yielded to his caresses some say that she actually pretended to be queen herself and that his majesty was no further in fault than in mistaking the humble handmaid for her noble mistress but be that as it may her majesty no sooner heard of the good understanding between them than she rushed forward and with one foot sent the sōn rolling back to the east whence he came and with the other kicked little johilā sprawling after him for said the high priest who told us the story you see what a towering passion she was likely to have been in under such indignities from the furious manner in which she cuts her way through the marble rocks beneath us and casts huge masses right and left as she goes along as if they were really so many coconuts and was she asked i to have flown eastward with him or was he to have flown westward with her she was to have accompanied him eastward said the high priest but her majesty after this indignity declared that she would not go a single pace in the same direction with such wretches and would flow west though all the other rivers in india might flow east and west she flows accordingly a virgin queen i asked some of the hindoos about us why they called her mother nerbudda if she was really never married her majesty said they with great respect would really never consent to be married after the indignity she suffered from her affianced bridegroom the sōn and we call her mother because she blesses us all and we are anxious to accost her by the name which we consider to be at once the most respectful and endearing any englishman can easily conceive a poet in his highest calenture of the brain addressing the ocean as a steed that knows his rider and patting the crested billow as his flowing mane but he must come to india to understand how every individual of a whole community of many millions can address a fine river as a living being a sovereign princess who hears and understands all they say and exercises a kind of local superintendence over their affairs without a single temple in which her image is worshipped or a single priest to profit by the delusion as in the case of the ganges it is the river itself to whom they address themselves and not to any deity residing in it or presiding over it the stream itself is the deity which fills their imaginations and receives their homage among the romans and ancient persians rivers were propitiated by sacrifices when vitellius crossed the euphrates with the roman legions to put tiridates on the throne of armenia they propitiated the river according to the rites of their country by the suovetaurilia the sacrifice of the hog the ram and the bull tiridates did the same by the sacrifice of a horse tacitus does not mention the river god but the river itself as propitiated see annals book vi chap plato makes socrates condemn homer for making achilles behave disrespectfully towards the river xanthus though acknowledged to be a divinity in offering to fight him and towards the river sperchius another acknowledged god in presenting to the dead body of patroclus the locks of his hair which he had promised to that river the sōn river which rises near the source of the nerbudda on the tableland of amarkantak takes a westerly course for some miles and then turns off suddenly to the east and is joined by the little stream of the johilā before it descends the great cascade and hence the poets have created this fiction which the mass of the population receive as divine revelation the statue of little johilā the barbers daughter in stone stands in the temple of the goddess nerbudda at amarkantak bound in chains it may here be remarked that the first overtures in india must always be made through the medium of the barber whether they be from the prince or the peasant if a sovereign prince sends proposals to a sovereign princess they must be conveyed through the medium of the barber or they will never be considered as done in due form as likely to prove propitious the prince will of course send some relation or high functionary with him but in all the credentials the barber must be named as the principal functionary hence it was that her majesty was supposed to have sent a barbers daughter to meet her husband the mahātam greatness or holiness of the ganges is said as i have already stated to be on the wane and not likely to endure sixty years longer while that of the nerbudda is on the increase and in sixty years is entirely to supersede the sanctity of her sister if the valley of the nerbudda should continue for sixty years longer under such a government as it has enjoyed since we took possession of it in it may become infinitely more rich more populous and more beautiful than that of the nile ever was and if the hindoos there continue as i hope they will to acquire wealth andhonour under a rule to which they are so much attached the prophecy may be realized in as far as the increase of honour paid to the nerbudda is concerned but i know no ground to expect that the reverence paid to the ganges will diminish unless education and the concentration of capital in manufactures should work an important change in the religious feelings and opinions of the people along the course of that river although this it must be admitted is a consummation which may be looked for more speedily on the banks of the ganges than on those of a stream like the nerbudda which is neither navigable at present nor in my opinion capable of being rendered so commerce and manufactures and the concentration of capital in the maintenance of the new communities employed in them will i think be the great media through which this change will be chiefly effected and they are always more likely to follow the course of rivers

prophecy that the sanctity of the ganges will cease in see note to chapter ante the prophecy was much talked of some years ago but the reverence for the ganges continues undiminished while the development of commerce and manufactures has not affected the religious feelings and opinions of the people railways in fact facilitate pilgrimages and increase their popularity the course of commerce now follows the line of rail not the navigable rivers the author when writing this book evidently never contemplated the possibility of railway construction in india later in life in he fully appreciated the value of the new means of communication journey ii c chapter a suttee on the nerbudda we took a ride one evening to gopālpur a small village situated on the same bank of the nerbudda about three miles up from bherāghāt on our way we met a party of women and girls coming to the fair their legs were uncovered halfway up the thigh but as we passed they all carefully covered up their faces good god exclaimed one of the ladies how can these people be so very indecent they thought it no doubt equally extraordinary that she should have her face uncovered while she so carefully concealed her legs for they were really all modest peasantry going from the village to bathe in the holy stream here there are some very pretty temples built for the most part to the memory of widows who have burned themselves with the remains of their husbands and upon the very spot where they committed themselves to the flames there was one which had been recently raised over the ashes of one of the most extraordinary old ladies that i have ever seen who burned herself in my presence in i prohibited the building of any temple upon the spot but my successor in the civil charge of the district major low was never i believe made acquainted with the prohibition nor with the progress of the work which therefore went on to completion in my absence as suttees are now prohibited in our dominions and cannot be often seen or described by europeans i shall here relate the circumstances of this as they were recorded by me at the time and the reader may rely upon the truth of the whole tale on the th november this old woman then about sixtyfive years of age here mixed her ashes with those of her husband who had been burned alone four days before on receiving civil charge of the district jubbulpore in march i issued a proclamation prohibiting any one from aiding or assisting in suttee and distinctly stating that to bring one ounce of wood for the purpose would be considered as so doing if the woman burned herself with the body of her husband any one who brought wood for the purpose of burning him would become liable to punishment consequently the body of the husband must be first consumed and the widow must bring a fresh supply for herself on tuesday th november i had an application from the heads of the most respectable and most extensive family of brahmans in the district to suffer this old woman to burn herself with the remains of her husband ummēd singh upadhya who had that morning died upon the banks of the nerbudda i threatened to enforce my order and punish severely any man who assisted and placed a police guard for the purpose of seeing that no one did so she remained sitting by the edge of the water without eating or drinking the next day the body of her husband was burned to ashes in a small pit of about eight feet square and three or four feet deep before several thousand spectators who had assembled to see the suttee all strangers dispersed before evening as there seemed to be no prospect of my yielding to the urgent solicitations of her family who dared not touch food till she had burned herself or declared herself willing to return to them her sons grandsons and some other relations remained with her while the rest surrounded my house the one urging me to allow her to burn and the other urging her to desist she remained sitting on a bare rock in the bed of the nerbudda refusing every kind of sustenance and exposed to the intense heat of the sun by day and the severe cold of the night with only a thin sheet thrown over her shoulders on thursday to cut off all hope of her being moved from her purpose she put on the dhajā or coarse red turban and broke her bracelets in pieces by which she became dead in law and for ever excluded from caste should she choose to live after this she could never return to her family her children and grandchildren were still with her but all their entreaties were unavailing and i became satisfied that she would starve herself to death if not allowed to burn by which the family would be disgraced her miseries prolonged and i myself rendered liable to be charged with a wanton abuse of authority for no prohibition of the kind i had issued had as yet received the formal sanction of the government on saturday the th in the morning i rode out ten miles to the spot and found the poor old widow sitting with the dhajā round her head a brass plate before her with undressed rice and flowers and a coconut in each hand she talked very collectedly telling me that she had determined to mix her ashes with those of her departed husband and should patiently wait my permission to do so assured that god would enable her to sustain life till that was given though she dared not eat or drink looking at the sun then rising before her over a long and beautiful reach of the nerbudda river she said calmly my soul has been for five days with my husbands near that sun nothing but my earthly frame is left and this i know you will in time suffer to be mixed with the ashes of his in yonder pit because it is not in your nature or usage wantonly to prolong the miseries of a poor old woman indeed it is notmy object and duty is to save and preserve them sic and i am come to dissuade you from this idle purpose to urge you to live and to keep your family from the disgrace of being thought your murderers i am not afraid of their ever being so thought they have all like good children done everything in their power to induce me to live among them and if i had done so i know they would have loved and honoured me but my duties to themhave now ended i commit them all to your care and i go to attend my husband ummēd singh upadhya with whose ashes on the funeral pile mine have been already three times mixed this was the first time in her long life that she had ever pronounced the name of her husband for in india no woman high or low ever pronounces the name of her husbandshe would consider it disrespectful towards him to do so and it is often amusing to see their embarrassment when asked the question by any european gentleman they look right and left for some one to relieve them from the dilemma of appearing disrespectful either to the querist or to their absent husbandsthey perceive that he is unacquainted with their duties on this point and are afraid he will attribute their silence to disrespect they know that few european gentlemen are acquainted with them and when women go into our courts of justice or other places where they are liable to be asked the names of their husbands they commonly take one of their children or some other relation with them to pronounce the words in their stead when the old lady named her husband as she did with strong emphasis and in a very deliberate manner every one present was satisfied that she had resolved to die i have she continued tasted largely of the bounty of government having been maintained by it with all my large family in ease and comfort upon our rentfree lands and i feel assured that my children will not be suffered to want but with them i have nothing more to do our intercourse and communion here end my soul prān is with ummēd singh upadhya and my ashes must here mix with his again looking to the suni see them together said she with a tone and countenance that affected me a good deal under the bridal canopyalluding to the ceremonies of marriage and i am satisfied that she at that moment really believed that she saw her own spirit and that of her husband under the bridal canopy in paradise i tried to work upon her pride and her fears i told her that it was probable that the rentfree lands by which her family had been so long supported might be resumed by the government as a mark of its displeasure against the children for not dissuading her from the sacrifice that the temples over her ancestors upon the bank might be levelled with the ground in order to prevent their operating to induce others to make similar sacrifices and lastly that not one single brick or stone should ever mark the place where she died if she persisted in her resolution but if she consented to live a splendid habitation should be built for her among these temples a handsome provision assigned for her support out of these rentfree lands her children should come daily to visit her and i should frequently do the same she smiled but held out her arm and said my pulse has long ceased to beat my spirit has departed and i have nothing left but a little earth that i wish to mix with the ashes of my husband i shall suffer nothing in burning and if you wish proof order some fire and you shall see this arm consumed without giving me any pain i did not attempt to feel her pulse but some of my people did and declared that it had ceased to be perceptible at this time every native present believed that she was incapable of suffering pain and her end confirmed them in their opinion satisfied myself that it would be unavailing to attempt to save her life i sent for all the principal members of the family and consented that she should be suffered to burn herself if they would enter into engagements that no other member of their family should ever do the same this they all agreed to and the papers having been drawn out in due form about midday i sent down notice to the old lady who seemed extremely pleased and thankful the ceremonies of bathing were gone through before three oclock while the wood and other combustible materials for a strong fire were collected and put into the pit after bathing she called for a pan betel leaf and ate it then rose up and with one arm on the shoulder of her eldest son and the other on that of her nephew approached the fire i had sentries placed all round and no other person was allowed to approach within five paces as she rose up fire was set to the pile and it was instantly in a blaze the distance was about yards she came on with a calm and cheerful countenance stopped once and casting her eyes upward said why have they kept me five days from thee my husband on coming to the sentries her supporters stopped she walked once round the pit paused a moment and while muttering a prayer threw some flowers into the fire she then walked up deliberately and steadily to the brink stepped into the centre of the flame sat down and leaning back in the midst as if reposing upon a couch was consumed without uttering a shriek or betraying one sign of agony a few instruments of music had been provided and they played as usual as she approached the fire not as is commonly supposed in order to drown screams but to prevent the last words of the victim from being heard as these are supposed to be prophetic and might become sources of pain or strife to the living it was not expected that i should yield and but few people had assembled to witness the sacrifice so that there was little or nothing in the circumstances immediately around to stimulate her to any extraordinary exertions and i am persuaded that it was the desire of again being united to her husband in the next world and the entire confidence that she would be so if she now burned herself that alone sustained her from the morning he died tuesday till wednesday evening she ate pans or betel leaves but nothing else and from wednesday evening she ceased eating them she drank no water from tuesday she went into the fire with the same cloth about her that she had worn in the bed of the river but it was made wet from a persuasion that even the shadow of any impure thing falling upon her from going to the pile contaminates the woman unless counteracted by the sheet moistened in the holy stream i must do the family the justice to say that they all exerted themselves to dissuade the widow from her purpose and had she lived she would assuredly have been cherished and honoured as the first female member of the whole house thereis no people in the world among whom parents are more loved honoured and obeyed than among the hindoos and the grandmother is always more honoured than the mother no queen upon her throne could ever have been approached with more reverence by her subjects than was this old lady by all the members of her family as she sat upon a naked rock in the bed of the river with only a red rag upon her head and a singlewhite sheet over her shoulders soon after the battle of trafalgar i heard a young lady exclaim i could really wish to have had a brother killed in that action there is no doubt that a family in which a suttee takes place feels a good deal exalted in its own esteem and that of the community by the sacrifice the sister of the rājā of rīwā was one of four or five wives who burned themselves with the remains of the rājā of udaipur and nothing in the course of his life will ever be recollected by her brother with so much of pride and pleasure since the udaipur rājā is the head of the rājpūt tribes i asked the old lady when she had first resolved upon becoming a suttee and she told me that about thirteen years before while bathing in the river nerbudda near the spot where she then sat with many other females of the family the resolution had fixed itself in her mind as she looked at the splendid temples on the bank of the river erected by the different branches of the family over the ashes of her female relations who had at different times become suttees two i think were over her aunts and one over the mother of her husband they were very beautiful buildings and had been erected at great cost and kept in good repair she told me that she had never mentioned this her resolution to any one from that time nor breathed a syllable on the subject till she called out sat sat sat when her husband breathed his last with his head in her lap on the bank of the nerbudda to which he had been taken when no hopes remained of his surviving the fever of which he died charles harding of the bengal civil service as magistrate of benares in prevented the widow of a brahman from being burned twelve months after her husbands death she had been goaded by her family into the expression of a wish to burn with some relic of her husband preserved for the purpose the pile was raised to her at rāmnagar some two miles above benares on the opposite side of the river ganges she was not well secured upon the pile and as soon as she felt the fire she jumped off and plunged into the river the people all ran after her along the bank but the current drove her towards benares whence a police boat put off and took her in she was almost dead with the fright and the water in which she had been kept afloat by her clothes she was taken to harding but the whole city of benares was in an uproar at the rescue of a brahmans widow from the funeral pile for such it had been considered though the man had been a year dead thousands surrounded his house and his court was filled with the principal men of the city imploring him to surrender the woman and among the rest was the poor womans father who declared that he could not support his daughter and that she had therefore better be burned as her husbands family would no longer receive her the uproar was quite alarming to a young man who felt all the responsibility upon himself in such a city as benares with a population of three hundred thousand people so prone to popular insurrections or risings en masse very like them he long argued the point of the time that had elapsed and the unwillingness of the woman but in vain until at last the thought struck him suddenly and he said that the sacrifice was manifestly unacceptable to their godthat the sacred river as such had rejected her she had without being able to swim floated down two miles upon its bosom in the face of an immense multitude and it was clear that she had been rejected had she been an acceptable sacrifice after the fire had touched her the river would have received her this satisfied the whole crowd the father said that after this unanswerable argument he would receive his daughter and the whole crowd dispersed satisfied the following conversation took place one morning between me and a native gentleman at jubbulpore soon after suttees had been prohibited by government what are the castes among whom women are not permitted to remarry after the death of their husbands they are sir brahmans rājpūts baniyās shopkeepers kāyaths writers why not permit them to marry now that they are no longer permitted to burn themselves with the dead bodies of their husbands the knowledge that they cannot unite themselves to a second husband without degradation from caste tends strongly to secure their fidelity to the first sir besides if all widows were permitted to marry again what distinction would remain between us and people of lower caste we should all soon sink to a level with the lowest and so you are content to keep up your caste at the expense of the poor widows no they are themselves as proud of the distinction as their husbands are and would they do you think like to hear the good old custom of burning themselves restored some of them would no doubtwhy because they become reunited to their husbands in paradise and are there happy free from all the troubles of this life but you should not let them have any troubles as widows if they behave well they are the most honoured members of their deceased husbands families nothing in such families is ever done without consulting them because all are proud to have the memory of their lost fathers sons and brothers so honoured by their widows but women feel that they are frail and would often rather burn themselves than be exposed all their lives to temptation and suspicion and why do not the men burn themselves to avoid the troubles of life because they are not called to it from heaven as the women are and you think that the women were really called to be burned by the deity no doubt we all believe that they were called and supported by the deity and that no tender beings like women could otherwise voluntarily undergo such torturesthey become inspired with supernatural powers of courage and fortitude when dulī sukul the sihōrā bankers father died the wife of a lodhī cultivator of the town declared all at once that she had been a suttee with him six times before and that she would now go into paradise with him a seventh time nothing could persuade her from burning herself she was between fifty and sixty years of age and had grandchildren and all her family tried to persuade her that it must be a mistake but all in vain she became a suttee and was burnt the day after the body of the banker did not dulī sukuls family who were brahmans try to dissuade her from it she being a lodhī a very low caste they did but they said all things were possible with god and it was generally believed that this was a call from heaven and what became of the bankers widow she said that she felt no divine call to the flames this was thirty years ago and the banker was about thirty years of age when he died then he will have rather an old wife in paradise no sir after they pass through the flames upon earth both become young in paradise sometimes women used to burn themselves with any relic of a husband who had died far from home did they not yes sir i remember a fisherman about twenty years ago who went on some business to benares from jubbulpore and who was to have been back in two months six months passed away without any news of him and at last the wife dreamed that he had died on the road and began forthwith in the middle of the night to call out sat sat sat nothing could dissuade her from burning and in the morning a pile was raised for her on the north bank of the large tank of hanumān where you have planted an avenue of trees there i saw her burned with her husbands turban in her arms and in ten days after her husband came back now the burning has been prohibited a man cannot get rid of a bad wife so easily but she was a good wife sir and bad ones do not often become suttees who made the pile for her some of her family but i forget who they thought it must have been a call from heaven when in reality it was only a dream you are a rājpūt yes do rājpūts in this part of india now destroy their female infants never that practice has ceased everywhere in these parts and is growing into disuse in bundēlkhand where the rājās at the request of the british government have prohibited it among their subjects this was a measure of real good you see girls now at play in villages where the face of one was never seen before nor the voice of one heardbut still those who have them grumble and say that the government which caused them to be preserved should undertake to provide for their marriage is it not so at first they grumbled a little sir but as the infants grew on their affections they thought no more about it gurcharan baboo the principal of the little jubbulpore college called upon me one forenoon soon after this conversation he was educated in the calcutta college speaks and writes english exceedingly well is tolerably well read in english literature and is decidedly a thinking man after talking over the matter which caused his visit i told him of the lodhī womans burning herself with the brahman banker at sihōrā and asked him what he thought of it he said that in all probability this woman had really been the wife of the brahman in some former birthof which transposition a singular case had occurred in his own family his greatgrandfather had three wives who all burnt themselves with his body while they were burning a large serpent came up and ascending the pile was burnt with them soon after another came up and did the same they were seen by the whole multitude who were satisfied that they had been the wives of his greatgrandfather in a former birth and would become so again after this sacrifice when the srāddh or funeral obsequies were performed after the prescribed intervals the offerings and prayers were regularly made for six souls instead of four and to this day every member of his family and every hindoo who had heard the story believed that these two serpents had a just right to be considered among his ancestors and to be prayed for accordingly in all srāddh a few days after this conversation with the principal of the jubbulpore college i had a visit from bholī sukul the present head of the sihōrā bankers family and youngest brother of the brahman with whose ashes the lodhī woman burned herself i requested him to tell me all that he recollected about this singular suttee and he did so as follows when my eldest brother the father of the late dulī sukul who was so long a native collector under you in this district died about twenty years ago at sihōrā a lodhī woman who resided two miles distant in the village of khitolī which has been held by our family for several generations declared that she would burn herself with him on the funeral pile that she had been his wife in three different births had already burnt herself with him three times and had to burn with him four times more she was then sixty years of age and had a husband living of about the same age we were all astounded when she came forward with this story and told her that it must be a mistake as we were brahmans while she was a lodhī she said that there was no mistake in the matter that she in the last birth resided with my brother in the sacred city of benares and one day gave a holy man who came to ask charity salt by mistake instead of sugar with his food that in consequence he told her she should in the next birth be separated from her husband and be of inferior caste but that if she did her duty well in that state she should be reunited to him in the following birth we told her that all this must be a dream and the widow of my brother insisted that if she were not allowed to burn herself the other should not be allowed to take her place we prevented the widow from ascending the pile and she died at a good old age only two years ago at sihōrā my brothers body was burned at sihōrā and the poor lodhī woman came and stole one handful of the ashes which she placed in her bosom and took back with her to khitolī there she prevailed upon her husband and her brother to assist her in her return to her former husband and caste as a brahman no soul else would assist them as we got the then native chief to prohibit it and these three persons brought on their own heads the pile on which she seated herself with the ashes in her bosom the husband and his brother set fire to the pile and she was burned and what is now your opinion after a lapse of twenty years why that she had

religious thought and life in india this version of the story differs in some minute particulars from the version given ante chapter marriages of treesthe tank and the plantainmeteorsrainbows before quitting jubbulpore to which place i thought it very unlikely that i should ever return i went to visit the groves in the vicinity which at the time i held the civil charge of the district in had been planted by different native gentlemen upon lands assigned to them rentfree for the purpose on condition that the holder should bind himself to plant trees at the rate of twentyfive to the acre and keep them up at that rate and that for each grove however small he should build and keep in repair a well lined with masonry for watering the trees and for the benefit of travellers some of these groves had already begun to yield fruit and all had been married among the hindoos neither the man who plants a grove nor his wife can taste of the fruit till he has married one of the mangotrees to some other tree commonly the tamarindtree that grows near it in the same grove the proprietor of one of these groves that stands between the cantonment and the town old barjōr singh had spent so much in planting and watering the grove and building walls and wells of pucka masonry that he could not afford to defray the expense of the marriage ceremonies till one of the trees which was older than the rest when planted began to bear fruit in and poor old barjōr singh and his wife were in great distress that they dared not taste of the fruit whose flavour was so much prized by their children they began to think that they had neglected a serious duty and might in consequence be taken off before another season could come round they therefore sold all their silver and gold ornaments and borrowed all they could and before the next season the grove was married with all due pomp and ceremony to the great delight of the old pair who tasted of the fruit in june the larger the number of the brahmans that are fed on the occasion of the marriage the greater the glory of the proprietor of the grove and when i asked old barjōr singh during my visit to his grove how many he had feasted he said with a heavy sigh that he had been able to feast only one hundred and fifty he showed me the mangotree which had acted the part of the bridegroom on the occasion but the bride had disappeared from his side and where is the bride the tamarind the only tamarind i had in the grove died said the old man before we could bring about the wedding and i was obliged to get a jasmine for a wife for my mango i planted it here so that we might as required cover both bride and bridegroom under one canopy during the ceremonies but after the marriage was over the gardener neglected her and she pined away and died and what made you prefer the jasmine to all other trees after the tamarind because it is the most celebrated of all trees save the rose and why not have chosen the rose for a wife because no one ever heard of marriage between the rose and the mango while they sic take place every day between the mango and the chambēlī jasmine after returning from the groves i had a visit after breakfast from a learned muhammadan now guardian to the young rājā of uchahara who resides part of his time at jubbulpore i mentioned my visit to the groves and the curious notion of the hindoos regarding the necessity of marrying them and he told me that among hindoos the man who went to the expense of making a tank dared not drink of its waters till he had married his tank to some bananatree planted on the bank for the purpose but what said he with a smile could you expect from men who believe that indra is the god who rules the heavens immediately over the earth that he sleeps during eight months in the year and during the other four his time is divided between his duties of sending down rain upon the earth and repelling with his arrows rājā bali who by his austere devotions tapasya has received from the higher gods a promise of the reversion of his dominions the lightning which we see said the learned maulavī they believe to be nothing more than the glittering of these arrows as they are shot from the bow of indra upon his foe rājā bali but my good friend maulavī sāhib there are many good muhammadans who believe that the meteors which we call shooting stars are in reality stars which the guardian angels of men snatch from the spheres and throw at the devil as they see him passing through the air or hiding himself under one or other of the constellations is it not so yes it is but we have the authority of the holy prophet for this as delivered down to us by his companions in the sacred traditions and we are bound to believe it when our holy prophet came upon the earth he found it to be infested with a host of magicians who by their abominable rites and incantations get into their interest certain devils or demons whomthey used to send up to heaven to listen to the orders which the angels received from god regarding men and the world below on hearing these orders they came off and reported them to the magicians who were thereby enabled to foretell the events which the angels were ordered to bring about in this manner they often overheard the orders which the angel gabriel received from god and communicated them to the magicians as soon as he could deliver them to our holy prophet exulting in the knowledge obtained in this diabolical manner these wretches tried to turn his prophecies into ridicule and seeing the evil effects of such practices among men he prayed god to put a stop to them from that time guardian angels have been stationed in different parts of the heavens to keep off the devils and as soon as one of them sees a devil sneaking too near the heaven of heavens he snatches the nearest star and flings it at him this he added was what all true muhammadans believed regarding the shooting of stars he had read nothing about them in the works of plato aristotle hippocrates or galen all of which he had carefully studied and should be glad to learn from me what modern philosophers in europe thought about them i explained to him the supposed distance and bulk of the fixed stars visible to the naked eye their being radiant with unborrowed light and probably every one of them like our own sun the great centre of a solar system of its own embracing the vast orbits of numerous planets revolving around it with their attendant satellites the stars visible to the naked eye being but a very small portion of the whole which the telescope had now made distinctly visible to us and those distinctly visible being one cluster among many thousand with which the genius of galileo newton the herschells and many other modern philosophers had discovered the heavens to be studded i remarked that the notion that these mighty suns the centres of planetary systems should be made merely to be thrown at devils and demons appeared to us just as unaccountable as those of the hindoos regarding indras arrows but said he these foolish hindoos believe still greater absurdities they believe that the rainbow is nothing but the fume of a large snake concealed under the ground that he vomits forth this fume from a hole in the surface of the earth without being himself seen and when you ask them why in that case the rainbow should be in the west while the sun is in the east and in the east while the sun is in the west they know not what to say the truth is my friend maulavī sahib the hindoos like a very great part of every other nation are very much disposed to attribute to supernatural influences effects that the wiser portion of our species know to rise from natural causes the maulavī was right in the mishkātul masābih the authentic traditions of their prophet it is stated that ayesha the widow of muhammad said i heard his majesty say the angels come down to the region next the world and mention the works that have been preordained in heaven and the devils who descend to the lowest region listen to what the angels say and hear the orders predestined in heaven and carry them to fortunetellers therefore they tell a hundred lies with it from themselves ibn abbās said a man of his majestys friends informed me that whilst his majestys friends were sitting with him one night a very bright star shot and his highness said what did you say in the days of ignorance when a star shot like this they said god and his messenger know best we used to say a great man was born tonight and a great man died then his majesty said you mistook because the shootings of these stars are neither for the life nor death of any person but when our cherisher orders a work the bearers of the imperial throne sing hallelujahs and the inhabitants of the regions who are near the bearers repeat it till it reaches the lowest regions after the angels which are near the bearers of the imperial throne say what did your cherisher order then they are informed and so it is handed from one region to another till the information reaches the people of the lowest region then the devils steal it and carry it to their friends that is magicians and these stars are thrown at these devils not for the birth or death of any person then the things which the magicians tell having heard from the devils are true but these magicians tell lies and exaggerate in what they hear kutādah said god has created stars for three uses one of them as a cause of ornament of the regions the second to stone the devil with the third to direct people going through forests and on the sea therefore whoever shall explain them otherwise does wrong and loses his time and speaks from his own invention and embellishes ibn abbās the prophet said whoever attains to the knowledge of astrology for any other explanation than the three aforementioned then verily he has attained to a branch of magic an astrologer is a magician and a magician is a necromancer and a necromancer is an infidel this work contains the precepts and sayings of muhammad as declared by his companions who themselves heard them or by those who heard them immediately from those companions and they are considered to be binding upon the faith and conduct of musalmans though not all delivered from inspiration everything that is written in the korān itself

orthodox muhammadans to accept the results of modern science chapter hindoo marriages certain it is that no hindoo will have a marriage in his family during the four months of the rainy season for among eighty millions of souls not one doubts that the great preserver of the universe is during these four months down on a visit to rājā bali and consequently unable to bless the contract with his presence marriage is a sacred duty among hindoos a duty which every parent must perform for his children otherwise they owe him no reverence a family with a daughter unmarried after the age of puberty is considered to labour under the displeasure of the gods and no member of the other sex considers himself respectable after the age of puberty till he is married it is the duty of his parent or elder brothers to have him suitably married and if they do not do so he reproaches them with his degraded condition the same feeling in a degree pervades all the muhammadan community and nothing appears so strange to them as the apparent indifference of old bachelors among us to their sad condition marriage with all its ceremonies its rights and its duties fills their imagination from infancy to age and i do not believe there is a country upon earth in which a larger portion of the wealth of the community is spent in the ceremonies or where the rights are better secured or the duties better enforced notwithstanding all the disadvantages of the laws of polygamy not one man in ten can afford to maintain more than one wife and not one in ten of those who can afford it will venture upon a sea of troubles in taking a second if he has a child by the first one of the evils which press most upon indian society is the necessity which long usage has established of squandering large sums in marriage ceremonies instead of giving what they can to their children to establish them and enable them to provide for their families and rise in the world parents everywhere feel bound to squander all they can borrow in the festivities of their marriage men in india could never feel secure of being permitted freely to enjoy their property under despotic and unsettled governments the only kind of governments they knew or hoped for and much of the means that would otherwise have been laid out in forming substantial works with a view to a return in income of some sort or another for the remainder of their own lives and of those of their children were expended in tombs temples sarāis tanks groves and other worksuseful and ornamental no doubt but from which neither they nor their children could ever hope to derive income of any kind the same feeling of insecurity gave birth no doubt to this preposterous usage which tends so much to keep down the great mass of the people of india to that grade in which they were born and in which they have nothing but their manual labour to depend upon for their subsistence every man feels himself bound to waste all his stock and capital and exhaust all his credit in feeding idlers during the ceremonies which attend the marriage of his children because his ancestors squandered similar sums and he would sink in the estimation of society if he were to allow his children to be married with less but it could not have been solely because men could not invest their means in profitable works with any chance of being long permitted to enjoy the profits under such despotic and unsettled governments that they squandered them in feeding idle people in marriage ceremonies since temples tanks and groves secured esteem in this life and promised some advantage in the next and an outlay in such works might therefore have been preferred but under such governments a mans title even to the exclusive possession of his wife might not be considered as altogether secure under the mere sanction of religion and the outlay in feeding the family tribe and neighbourhood during the marriage ceremony seems to have been considered as a kind of value in exchange given for her to society there is nothing that she and her husband recollect through life with so much pride and pleasure as the cost of their marriage if it happen to be large for their condition of life it is their amoka their title of nobility and their parents consider it their duty to make it as large as they can a man would hardly feel secure of the sympathy of his family tribe circle of society or rulers for the loss of his ox or his ass or anything that is his if it should happen to have cost him nothing and till he could feel secure of their sympathy for the loss he would not feel very secure in the possession he therefore or those who are interested in his welfare strengthen his security by an outlay which invests his wife with a tangible value in cost well understood by his circle and rulers his family tribe and circle have received the purchase money and feel bound to secure to him the commodity purchased and as they are in all such matters commonly much stronger than the rulers themselves the money spent among them is more efficacious in securing the exclusive enjoyment of the wife than if it had been paid in taxes or fees to them for a marriage licence the pride of families and tribes and the desire of the multitude to participate in the enjoyment of such ceremonies tend to keep up this usage after the cause in which it originated may have ceased to operate but it will it is to be hoped gradually decline with the increased feeling of security to person property and character under our rule nothing is now more common than to see an individual in the humblest rank spending all that he has or can borrow in the marriage of one of many daughters and trusting to providence for the means of marrying the others nor in the higher to find a young man whose estates have during a long minority under the careful management of government officers been freed from very heavy debts with which an improvident father had left them encumbered the moment he attains his majority and enters upon the management borrowing three times theirannual rent at an exorbitant interest to marry a couple of sisters at the same rate of outlay in feasts and fireworks that his grandmother was married with notes the authors figure of eighty millions was a mere guess and probably even in his time was much below the mark the figures of the census of are total population of india excluding burma hindus the proportions in different provinces vary enormously see ante chapter note the word amoka is corrupt and even sir george grierson cannot

marriage fees levied up to that time in bengal by the muhammadan lawofficers but i am disposed to think that a modern finance minister might reconsider the propriety of imposing a moderate tax carefully graduated extravagance in marriage expenses is still one of the principal curses of indian society considerable efforts to secure reform have been made by various castes during recent years but as yet small results only have been attained the editor has seen numerous painful examples of the wreck of fine estates by young proprietors assuming the management after a long term of the careful stewardship of the court of wards chapter the purveyance system we left jubbulpore on the morning of the th november and came on ten miles to baghaurī several of our friends of the th native infantry accompanied us this first stage where they had a good days shooting in i established here some venders in wood to save the people from the miseries of the purveyance system but i now found that a native collector soon after i had resigned the civil charge of the district and gone to sāgar in order to ingratiate himself with the officers and get from them favourable testimonials gave two regiments as they marched over this road free permission to help themselves gratis out of the storerooms of these poor men whom i had set up with a loan from the public treasury declaring that it must be the wish and intention of government to supply their public officers free of cost and consequently that no excuses could be attended to from that time shops and shopkeepers have disappeared wood for all public officers and establishments passing this road has ever since as in former times been collected from the surrounding villages gratis under the purveyance system in which all native public officers delight and which i am afraid is encouraged by european officers either from their ignorance or their indolence they do not like the trouble of seeing the men paid either for their wood or their labour and their head servants of the kitchen or the wardrobe weary and worry them out of their best resolutions on the subject they make the poor men sit aloof by telling them that their master is a tiger before breakfast and will eat them if they approach and they tell their masters that there is no hope of getting the poor men to come for their money till they have bathed or taken their breakfast the latter wait in hopes that the gentleman will come out or send for them as soon as he has been tamed by his breakfast but this meal has put him in good humour with all the world and he is now no longer unwilling to trust the payment of the poor men to his butler or his valet de chambre they keep the poor wretches waiting declaring that they have as yet received no orders to pay them till hungry and weary in the afternoon they all walk back to their homes in utter despair of getting anything if in the meantime the gentleman comes out and finds the men his servants pacify him by declaring either that they have not yet had time to carry his orders into effect that they could not get copper change for silver rupees or that they were anxious to collect all the people together before they paid any lest they might pay some of them twice over it is seldom however that he comes among them at all he takes it for granted that the people have all been paid and passes the charge in the account of his servants who all get what these porters ought to have received or perhaps the gentleman may persuade himself that if he pays his valet or butler these functionaries will never pay the poor men and think that he had better sit quiet and keep the money in his own pocket the native police or revenue officer is directed by his superior to have wood collected for the camp of a regiment or great civil officers and he sends out his myrmidons to employ the people around in felling trees and cutting up wood enough to supply not only the camp but his own cookrooms and those of his friends for the next six months the men so employed commonly get nothing but the native officer receives credit for all manner of superlatively good qualities which are enumerated in a certificate many a fine tree dear to the affections of families and village communities has been cut down in spite or redeemed from the axe by a handsome present to this officer or his myrmidons lambs kids fowls milk vegetables all come flowing in for the great mans table from poor people who are too hopeless to seek for payment or who are represented as too proud and wealthy to receive it such always have been and such always will be some of the evils of the purveyance system if a police officer receives an order from the magistrate to provide a regiment detachment or individual with boats carts bullocks or porters he has all that can be found within his jurisdiction forthwith seizedreleases all those whose proprietors are able and willing to pay what he demands and furnishes the rest which are generally the worst to the persons who require them police officers derive so much profit from these applications that they are always anxious they should be made and will privately defeat all attempts of private individuals to provide themselves by dissuading or intimidating the proprietors of vehicles from voluntarily furnishing them the gentlemans servant who is sent to procure them returns and tells his master that there are plenty of vehicles but that their proprietors dare not send them without orders from the police and that the police tell him they dare not give such orders without the special sanction of the magistrate the magistrate is written to but declares that his police have been prohibited from interfering in such matters without special orders since the proprietors ought to be permitted to send their vehicles to whom they choose except on occasions of great public emergency and as the present cannot be considered as one of these occasions he does not feel authorized to issue such orders on the ganges many men have made large fortunes by pretending a general authority to seize boats for the use of the commissariat or for other government purposes on the ground of having been once or twice employed on that duty and what they get is but a small portion of that which the public lose one of these selfconstituted functionaries has a boat seized on its way down or up the river and the crew who are merely hired for the occasion and have a months wages in advance seeing no prospect of getting soon out of the hands of this pretended government servant desert and leave the boat on the sands while the owner if he ever learns the real state of the case thinks it better to put up with his loss than to seek redress through expensive courts and distant local authorities if the boat happens to be loaded and to have a supercargo who will not or cannot bribe high enough he is abandoned on the sands by his crew in his search for aid from the neighbourhood his helplessness becomes knownhe is perhaps murdered or runs away in the apprehension of being sothe boat is plundered and made a wreck still the dread of the delays and costs of our courts and the utter hopelessness of ever recovering the lost property prevent the proprietors from seeking redress and our government authorities know nothing of the circumstances we

jabalpur the author took charge of the sāgar district in january francolinus vulgaris the purveyance system persian rasad rasānī above described is one of the necessary evils of oriental life it will be observed that the author though so keenly sensitive to the abuses attending the system proposes no substitute for it and confesses that the small attempt he made to check abuse was a failure from time immemorial it has been the custom for government officials in india to be supplied with necessaries by the people of the country through which their camps pass under native governments no officials ever dream of paying for anything in british territory requisitions are limited and in well ordered civil camps nothing is taken without payment except wood coarse earthen vessels and grass the hereditary village potter supplies the pots and this duty is fully recognized as one attaching to his office the landholders supply the wood and grass none of these things are ordinarily procurable by private purchase in sufficient quantity and in most cases could not be bought at all officers commanding troops send in advance requisitions specifying the quantities of each article needed and the indent is met by the civil authorities everything so indented for including wood and grass is supposed to be paid for but in practice it is often impossible with the agency available to ensure actual payment to the persons entitled troops and the people in civil camps must live and all that can be done is to check abuse so far as possible by vigilant administration the obligation of landholders to supply necessaries for troops and officials on the march is so well established that it forms one of the conditions of the contract with government under which proprietors in the permanently settled province of benares hold their lands the extreme abuses of which the system is capable under a lax and corrupt native government are abundantly illustrated in the authors journey

vineyard with me for the last fifteen years with great zeal ability and integrity came to visit me after breakfast with two very pretty and interesting young sons while we were sitting together my wifes underwoman said to some one who was talking with her outside the tentdoor if that were really the case should i not be degraded you see mīr sāhib said i that the very lowest members of society among these hindoos still feel the pride of caste and dread exclusion from their own however low yes said the mīr they are a very strange kind of people and i question whether they ever had a real prophet among them i question mīr sahib whether they really ever had such a person they of course think the incarnations of their three great divinities were beings infinitely superior to prophets being in all their attributes and prerogatives equal to the divinities themselves but we are disposed to think that these incarnations were nothing more than great men whom their flatterers and poets have exalted into godsthis was the way in which men made their gods in ancient greece and egypt these great men were generally conquerors whose glory consisted in the destruction of their fellow creatures and this is the glory which their flatterers are most prone to extol all that the poets have sung of the actions of men is now received as revelation from heaven though nothing can be more monstrous than the actions attributed to the best incarnation krishna of the best of their gods vishnu no doubt said salāmat ali and had they ever had a real prophet among them he would have revealed better things to them strange people when their women go on pilgrimages to gayā they have their heads shaved before the image of their god and the offering of the hair is equivalent to the offer of their heads for heads thank god they dare no longer offer within the companys territories do you mīr sahib think that they continue to offer up human sacrifices anywhere certainly i do there is a rājā at ratanpur or somewhere between mandlā and sambalpur who has a man offered up to dēvī every year and that man must be a brahman if he can get a brahman traveller well and good if not he and his priests offer one of his own subjects every brahman that has to pass through this territory goes in disguise with what energy did our emperor aurangzēb apply himself to put down iniquities like this in the rājputāna states but all in vain if a rājā died all his numerous wives burnt themselves with his bodyeven their servants male and female were obliged to do the same for said his friends what is he to do in the next world without attendants the pile was enormous on the top sat the queen with the body of the prince the servants male and female according to their degree below and a large army stood all round to drive into the fire again or kill all who should attempt to escape this is all very true mīr sāhib but you must admit that though there is a great deal of absurdity in their customs and opinions there is on the other hand much that we might all take an example from the hindoo believes that christians and musalmāns may be as good men in all relations of life as himself and in as fair a way to heaven as he is for he believes that my bible and your korān are as much revelations framed by the deity for our guidance as the shāstras are for his he doubts not that our christ was the son of god nor that muhammad was the prophet of god and all that he asks from us is to allow him freely to believe in his own gods and to worship in his own way nor does one caste or sect of hindoos ever believe itself to be alone in the right way or detest any other for not following in the same path as they have as much of toleration for each other as they have for us true exclaimed salāmat alī too true we have ruined each other we have cut each others throats we have lost the empire and we deserve to lose it you won it and you preserved it by your unionten men with one heart are equal to a hundred men with different hearts a hindoo may feel himself authorized to take in a musalmān and might even think it meritorious to do so but he would never think it meritorious to take in one of his own religion there are no less than seventytwo sects of muhammadans and every one of these sects would not only take in the followers of every other religion on earth but every member of every one of the other seventyone sects and the nearer that sect is to its own the greater the merit in taking in its members something has happened of late to annoy you i fear mīr sāhib something happens to annoy us every day sir where we are more than one sect of us together and wherever you find musalmāns you will find them divided into sectsit is not perhaps known to many of my countrymen in india that in every city and town in the country the right of sweeping the houses and streets is one of the most intolerable of monopolies supported entirely by the pride of caste among the scavengers who are all of the lowest class the right of sweeping within a certain range is recognized by the caste to belong to a certain member and if any other member presumes to sweep within that range he is excommunicatedno other member will smoke out of his pipe or drink out of his jug and he can get restored to caste only by a feast to the whole body of sweepers if any housekeeper within a particular circle happens to offend the sweeper of that range none of his filth will be removed till he pacifies him because no other sweeper will dare to touch it and the people of a town are often more tyrannized over by these people than by any other it is worthy of remark that in india the spirit of combination is always in the inverse ratio to the rank of the class weakest in the highest and strongest in the lowest class all infringements upon the rules of the class are punished by fines every fine furnishes a feast at which every member sits and enjoys himself payment is enforced by excommunication no one of the caste will eat drink or smoke with the convicted till the fine is paid and as every one shares in the fine every one does his best to enforce payment the fines are imposed by the elders who know the circumstances of the culprit and fix the amount accordingly washermen will often at a large station combine to prevent the washermen of one gentleman from washing the clothes of the servants of any other gentleman or the servants of one gentleman from getting their clothes washed by any other person than their own masters washerman this enables them sometimes to raise the rate of washing to double the fair or ordinary rate and at such places the washermen are always drunk with one continued routine of feasts from the fines levied the cost of these fees falls ultimately upon the poor servants or their masters this combination however is not always for bad or selfish purposes i was once on the staff of an officer commanding a brigade on service whose elephant driver exercised an influence over him that was often mischievous and sometimes dangerous for in marching and choosing his ground this man was more often consulted than the quartermastergeneral his bearing was most insolent and became intolerable as well to the european gentlemen as to the people of his caste he at last committed himself by saying that he would spit in the face of another gentlemans elephant driver with whom he was disputing all the elephant drivers in our large camp were immediately assembled and it was determined in council to refer the matter to the decision of the rājā of darbhangas driver who was acknowledged the head of the class we were all breakfasting with the brigadier after muster when the reply camethe distance to darbhanga from nāthpur on the kūsī river where we then were must have been a hundred and fifty miles we saw men running in all directions through the camp without knowing why till at last one came and summoned the brigadiers driver with a face of terror he came and implored the protection of the brigadier who got angry and fumed a good deal but seeing no expression of sympathy on the faces of his officers he told the man to go and hear his sentence he was escorted to a circle formed by all the drivers in camp who were seated on the grass the offender was taken into the middle of the circle and commanded to stand on one leg while the rajas drivers letter was read he did so and the letter directed him to apologize to the offended party pay a heavy fine for a feast and pledge himself to the offended drivers never to offend again all the officers in camp were delighted and some who went to hear the sentence explained declared that in no court in the world could the thing have been done with more solemnity and effect the mans character was quite altered by it and he became the most docile of drivers on the same principle here stated of enlisting the community in the punishment of offenders the new zealanders and other savage tribes who have been fond of human flesh have generally been found to confine the feast to the body of those who were put to death for offences against the state or the individual i and all the officers of my regiment were at one time in the habit of making every servant who required punishment or admonition to bring immediately and give to the first religious mendicant we could pick up the fine we thought just all the religionists in the neighbourhood declared that justice had never been so well administered in any other regiment no servant got any sympathy from themthey were all told that their masters were far too lenient we crossed the hiran river about ten miles from our last ground on the nd and came on two miles to our tents in a mango grove close to the town of katangī and under the vindhya range of sandstone hills which rise almost perpendicular to the height of some eight hundred feet over the town this range from katangī skirts the nerbudda valley to the north as the sātpura range skirts it to the south and both are of the same sandstone formation capped with basalt upon which here and there are found masses of laterite or iron clay nothing has ever yet been found reposing upon this iron clay the strata of this range have a gentle and almost imperceptible dip to the north at right angles to its face which overlooks the valley and this face has everywhere the appearance of a range of gigantic round bastions projecting into what was perhaps a lake and is now a wellpeopled wellcultivated and very happy valley about twenty miles wide the river crosses and recrosses it diagonally near jubbulpore it flows along for some distance close under the sātpura range to the south and crossing over the valley from bheraghāt it reaches the vindhya range to the north at the point where it reaches the hiran river forty miles below notes this is a slip probably due to the printers reader there are no chimneysweepers in india the word should be sweepers the members of this caste and a few other degraded communities such as the doms do all the sweeping scavenging and conservancy work in india washerwomen is another slip

routed by hornetsthe rānī of garhāhornets nests in india on the rd we came on nine miles to sangrāmpur and on the th nine more to the valley of jabērā situated on the western extremity of the bed of a large lake which is now covered by twentyfour villages the waters were kept in by a large wall that united two hills about four miles south of jabērā this wall was built of great cut freestone blocks from the two hills of the vindhiya range which it united it was about half a mile long one hundred feet broad at the base and about one hundred feet high the stones though cut were never apparently cemented and the wall has long given way in the centre through which now falls a small stream that passes from east to west of what was once the bottom of the lake and now is the site of so many industrious and happy little village communities the proprietor of the village of jabērā in whose mango grove our tents were pitched conducted me to the ruins of the wall and told me that it had been broken down by the order of the emperor aurangzēb history to these people is all a fairy tale and this emperor is the great destroyer of everything that the muhammadans in their fanaticism have demolished of the hindoo sculpture or architecture and yet singular as it may appear they never mention his name with any feelings of indignation or hatred with every scene of his supposed outrage against their gods or their temples there is always associated the recollection of some instance of his piety and the hindoos gloryof some idol for instance or column preserved from his fury by a miracle whose divine origin he is supposed at once to have recognized with all due reverence at bherāgarh the high priest of the temple told us that aurangzēb and his soldiers knocked off the heads arms and noses of all the idols saying that if they had really any of the godhead in them they would assuredly now show it and save themselves but when they came to the door of gaurī sankars apartments they were attacked by a nest of hornets that put the whole of the emperors army to the rout and his imperial majesty called out here we have really something like a god and we shall not suffer him to be molested if all your gods could give us proof like this of their divinity not a nose of them would ever be touched the popular belief however is that after aurangzēbs army had struck off all the prominent features of the other gods one of the soldiers entered the temple and struck off the ear of one of the prostrate images underneath their vehicle the bull my dear said gaurī do you see what these saucy men are about her consort turned round his head and seeing the soldiers around him brought all the hornets up from the marble rocks below where there are still so many nests of them and the whole army fled before them to teorī five miles it is very likely that some body of troops by whom the rest of the images had been mutilated may have been driven off by a nest of hornets from within the temple where this statue stands i have seen six companies of infantry with a train of artillery and a squadron of horse all put to the rout by a single nest of hornets and driven off some miles with all their horses and bullocks the officers generally save themselves by keeping within their tents and creeping under their bedclothes or their carpets and servants often escape by covering themselves up in their blankets and lying perfectly still horses are often stung to a state of madness in which they throw themselves over precipices and break their limbs or kill themselves the grooms in trying to save their horses are generally the people who suffer most in a camp attacked by such an enemy i have seen some so stung as to recover with difficulty and i believe there have been instances of people not recovering at all in such a frightful scene i have seen a bullock sitting and chewing the cud as calmly as if the whole thing had been got up for his amusement the hornets seldom touch any animal that remains perfectly still on the bank of the bīnā river at eran in the sāgar district is a beautiful pillar of a single freestone more than fifty feet high surmounted by a figure of krishna with the glory round his head some few of the rays of this glory have been struck off by lightning but the people declare that this was done by a shot fired at it from a cannon by order of aurangzēb as his army was marching by on its way to the deccan before the scattered fragments however could reach the ground the air was filled they say by a swarm of hornets that put the whole army to flight and the emperor ordered his gunners to desist declaring that he was satisfied of the presence of the god there is hardly any part of india in which according to popular belief similar miracles were not worked to convince the emperor of the peculiar merits or sanctity of particular idols or temples according to the traditions of the people derived of course from the inventions of priests i should mention that these hornets suspend their nests to the branches of the highest trees under rocks or in old deserted temples native travellers soldiers and camp followers cook and eat their food under such trees but they always avoid one in which there is a nest of hornets particularly on a still day sometimes they do not discover the nest till it is too late the unlucky wight goes on feeding his fire and delighting in the prospect of the feast before him as the smoke ascends in curling eddies to the nest of the hornets the moment it touches them they sally forth and descend and sting like mad creatures every living thing they find in motion three companies of my regiment were escorting treasure in boats from allahabad to cawnpore for the army under the marquis of hastings in the soldiers all took their dinners on shore every day and one still afternoon a sipāhīsepoy by cooking his dinner under one of those nests without seeing it sent the infuriated swarm among the whole of his comrades who were cooking in the same grove and undressed as they always are on such occasions treasure food and all were immediately deserted and the whole of the party save the european officers were up to their noses in the river ganges the hornets hovered over them and it was amusing to see them bobbing their heads under as the insects tried to pounce upon them the officers covered themselves up in the carpets of their boats and as the day was a hot one their situation was still more uncomfortable than that of the men darkness alone put an end to the conflict i should mention that the poor old rānī or queen of garhā lachhmī kuār came out as far as katangī with us to take leave of my wife to whom she has always been attached she had been in the habit of spending a day with her at my house once a week and being the only european lady from whom she had ever received any attention or indeed ever been on terms of any intimacy with she feels the more sensible of the little offices of kindness and courtesy she has received from her her husband narhar sā was the last of the long line of sixtytwo sovereigns who reigned over these territories from the year ad to the sāgar conquest ad he died a prisoner in the fortress of kūrai in the sāgar district in a d leaving two widows one burnt herself upon the funeral pile and the other was prevented from doing so merely because she was thought too young as she was not then fifteen years of age she received a small pension from the sāgar government which was still further reduced under the nāgpur government which succeeded it in the jubbulpore district in which the pension had been assigned and it was not thought necessary to increase the amount of this pension when the territory came under our dominion so that she has had barely enough to subsist upon about one hundred rupees a month she is now about sixty years of age and still a very goodlooking woman in her youth she must have been beautiful she does not object to appear unveiled before gentlemen on any particular occasion and when lord w bentinck was at jubbulpore in i introduced the old queen to him he seemed much interested and ordered the old lady a pair of shawls none but very coarse ones were found in the storerooms of the governorgenerals representative and his lordship said these were not such as a governorgeneral could present or a queen however poor receive and as his own toshakhāna wardrobe had gone onl he desired that a pair of the finest kind should be purchased and presented to her in his name the orders were given in her presence and mine i was obliged to return to sāgar before they could be carried into effect and when i returned in i found that the rejected shawls had been presented to her and were such coarse things that she was ashamed to wear them as much i really believe on account of the exalted person who had given them as her own she never mentioned the subject till i asked her to let me see the shawls which she did reluctantly and she was too proud to complain how the good intentions of the governorgeneral had been frustrated in this case i have never learned the native officer in charge of the store was dead and the governorgenerals representative had left the place better could not i suppose be got at this time and he did not like to defer giving them notes

escort us to our tents and much do i fear that my poor boy will never again in any part of the world have the blessings of heaven so fervently invoked upon him by so many worthy and respectable men as met us at every stage on our way from jubbulpore i am much attached to the agricultural classes of india generally and i have found among them some of the best men i have ever known the peasantry in india have generally very good manners and are exceedingly intelligent from having so much more leisure and unreserved and easy intercourse with those above them the constant habit of meeting and discussing subjects connected with their own interests in their own fields and under their own figtrees with their landlords and government functionaries of all kinds and degrees prevents their ever feeling or appearing impudent or obtrusive though it certainly tends to give them stentorian voices that often startle us when they come into our houses to discuss the same points with us ninetenths of the immediate cultivators of the soil in india are little farmers who hold a lease for one or more years as the case may be of their lands which they cultivate with their own stock one of these cultivators with a good plough and bullocks and a good character can always get good land on moderate terms from holders of villages those cultivators are i think the best who learn to depend upon their stock and character for favourable terms hold themselves free to change their holdings when their leases expire and pretend not to any hereditary right in the soil the lands are i think best cultivated and the society best constituted in india where the holders of estates of villages have a feeling of permanent interest in them an assurance of an hereditary right of property which is liable only to the payment of a moderate government demand descends undivided by the law of primogeniture and is unaffected by the common law which prescribes the equal subdivision among children of landed as well as other private property among the hindoos and muhammadans and where the immediate cultivators hold the lands they till by no other law than that of common specific contract when i speak of holders of villages i mean the holders of lands that belong to villages the whole face of india is parcelled out into estates of villages the village communities are composed of those who hold and cultivate the land the established village servants priest blacksmith carpenter accountant washerman basketmaker whose wife is ex officio the midwife of the little village community potter watchman barber shoemaker c c to these may be added the little banker or agricultural capitalist the shopkeeper the brazier the confectioner the ironmonger the weaver the dyer the astronomer or astrologer who points out to the people the lucky day for every earthly undertaking and the prescribed times for all religious ceremonies and observances in some villages the whole of the lands are parcelled out among cultivating proprietors and are liable to eternal subdivisions by the law of inheritance which gives to each son the same share in others the whole of the lands are parcelled out among cultivators who hold them on a specific lease for limited periods from a proprietor who holds the whole collectively under government at a rate of rent fixed either permanently or for limited periods these are the two extremes there are but few villages in which all the cultivators are considered as proprietorsat least but few in our nerbudda territories and these will almost invariably be found of a caste of brahmans or a caste of rājpūts descended from a common ancestor to whom the estate was originally given in rentfree tenure or at a quitrent by the existing government for his prayers as a priest or his services as a soldier subsequent governments which resumed unceremoniously the estates of others were deterred from resuming these by a dread of the curses of the one and the swords of the other such communities of cultivating proprietors are of two kinds those among whom the lands are parcelled out each member holding his share as a distinct estate and being individually responsible for the payment of the share of the government demand assessed upon it and those among whom the lands are not parcelled out but the profits divided as among copartners of an estate held jointly they in either case nominate one of their members to collect and pay the government demand or government appoints a man for this duty either as a salaried servant or a lessee with authority to levy from the cultivating proprietors a certain sum over and above what is demandable from him the communities in which the cultivators are considered merely as leaseholders are far more numerous indeed the greater part of the village communities in this part of india are of this description and where the communities are of a mixed character the cultivating proprietors are considered to have merely a right of occupancy and are liable to have their lands assessed at the same rate as those held on a mere lease tenure in all parts of india the cultivating proprietors in such mixed communities are similarly situated they are liable to be assessed at the same rate as others holding the same sort of lands and often pay a higher rate with which others are not encumbered but this is not general it is asmuch the interest of the proprietor to have good cultivating tenants as it is that of the tenants to have good proprietors and it is felt to be the interest of both to adjust their terms amicably among themselves without a reference to a third and superior party which is always costly and commonly ruinous it is a question of very great importance no less morally and politically than fiscally which of these systems deserves most encouragementthat in which the government considers the immediate cultivators to be the hereditary proprietors and through its own public officers parcels out the lands among them and adjusts the rates of rent demandable from every minute partition as the lands become more and more subdivided by the hindoo and muhammadan law of inheritance or that in which the government considers him who holds the area of a whole village or estate collectively as the hereditary proprietor and the immediate cultivators as his leasetenantsleaving the rates of rent to be adjusted among the parties without the aid of public officers or interposing only to enforce the fulfilment of their mutual contracts in the latter of these two systems the land will supply more and better members to the middle and higher classes of the society and create and preserve a better feeling between them and the peasantry or immediate cultivators of the soil and it will occasion the reinvestment upon the soil in works of ornament and utility of a greater portion of the annual returns of rent and profit and a less expenditure in the costs of litigation in our civil courts and bribery to our public officers those who advocate the other system which makes the immediate cultivators the proprietors will for the most part be found to reason upon false premissesupon the assumption that the rates of rent demandable from the immediate cultivators of the soil were everywhere limited and established by immemorial usage in a certain sum of money per acre or a certain share of the crop produced from it and that these rates were not only so limited and fixed but everywhere well known to the people and might consequently have become well known to the government and recorded in public registers now every practical man in india who has had opportunities of becoming well acquainted with the matter knows that the reverse is the case that the rate of rent demandable from these cultivators never was the same upon any two estates at the same time nor even the same upon any one estate at different limes or for any consecutive number of years the rates vary every year on every estate according to the varying circumstances that influence themsuch as greater or less exhaustion of the soil greater or less facilities of irrigation manure transit to market drainageor from fortuitous advantages on one hand or calamities of season on the other or many other circumstances which affect the value of the land and the abilities of the cultivators to pay it is not so much the proprietors of the estate or the government as the cultivators themselves who demand every year a readjustment of the rate demandable upon their different holdings this readjustment must take place and if there is no landlord to effect it government must effect it through its own officers every holding becomes subdivided when the cultivating proprietor dies and leaves more than one child and as the whole face of the country is open and without hedges the division is easily and speedily made thus the fieldmap which represents an estate one year will never represent it fairly five years after in fact we might almost as well attempt to map the waves of the ocean as fieldmap the face of any considerable area in any part of india if there be any truth in my conclusions our government has acted unwisely in going as it has generally done into one or other of the two extremes in its settlement of the land revenue in the zamīndārī settlement of bengal it conferred the hereditary right of property over areas larger than english counties on individuals and left the immediate cultivators mere tenantsatwill these individuals felt no interest in promoting the comfort and welfare of the village communities or conciliating the affections of the cultivators whom they never saw or wished to see and they let out the village or other subdivision of their estates to second parties quite as little interested who again let them out to others so that the system of rackrenting went on over the whole area of the immense possession this was a system more honoured in the breach than in the observance for as the great landholders became involved in the ruin of their cultivators their estates were sold for arrears of revenue due to government and thus the proprietary right of one individual has become divided among many who will have the feelings which the larger holders wanted and so remedy the evil in the other extreme government has constituted the immediate cultivators the proprietors thereby preventing any one who is supported upon the rent of land or the profits of agricultural stock from rising above the grade of a peasant and so depriving society of one of its best and most essential elements the remedy of both is in village settlements in which the estate shall be of moderate size and the hereditary property of the holder descending on the principle of a principality by the right of primogeniture unaffected by the common law this is the system which has been adopted in the nerbudda territory and which i trust will be always adhered to when we enter upon the government of any new territorial acquisition in india we do not require or pretend to change the civil laws of the people because their civil laws and their religion are in reality one and the same and are contained in one and the same code as certainly among the hindoos the muhammadans and the parsees as they were among the israelites by these codes and the established usages everywhere well understood by the people are their rights and duties in marriage inheritance succession caste contract and all the other civil relations of life ascertained and when we displace another government we do not pretend to alter such rights and duties in relation to each other we merely change the machinery and mode of procedure by which these rights are secured and these duties enforcedof criminal law no system was ever either regularly established or administered in any state in india by any government to which we have succeeded and the people always consider the existing government free to adopt that which may seem best calculated to effect the one great object which criminal law has everywhere in viewthe security of life property and character and the enjoyment of all their advantages the actions by which these are affected and endangered the evidence by which such actions require to be proved and the penalties with which they require to be visited in order to prevent their recurrence are or ought to be so much the same in every society that the people never think us bound to search for what muhammad and his companions thought in the wilds of arabia or the sanskrit poets sang about them in courts and cloisters they would be just as well pleased everywhere to find us searching for these things in the writings of confucius and zoroaster as in those of muhammad and manu and much more so to see us consulting our own commonsense and forming a penal code of our own suitable to the wants of such a mixed community the fiscal laws which define the rights and duties of the landed interests and the agricultural classes in relation to each other and to the ruling powers were also everywhere exceedingly simple and well understood by the people what in england is now a mere fiction of law is still in india an essential principle all lands are held directly or indirectly of the sovereign to this rule there is no exception the reigning sovereign is essentially the proprietor of the whole of the lands in every part of india where he has not voluntarily alienated them and he holds these lands for the payment of those public establishments which are maintained for the public good and are supported by the rents of the lands either directly under assignment or indirectly through the sovereign proprietor when a muhammadan or hindoo sovereign assigned lands rentfree in perpetuity it was always understood both by the donor and receiver to be with the small reservation of a right in his successor to resume them for the public good if he should think fit hindoo sovereigns or their priests for them often tried to bar this right by invoking curses on the head of that successor who should exercise it it is a proverb among the people of these territories and i believe among the people of india generally that the lands which pay no rent to government have no barkat blessing from abovethat the man who holds them is not blessed in their returns like the man who pays rent to government and thereby contributes his aid to the protection of the community the fact is that every family that holds rentfree lands must in a few generations become miserable from the minute subdivision of the property and the litigation in our civil courts which it entails upon the holders it is certainly the general opinion of the people of india that no land should be held without paying rent to government or providing for people employed in the service of government for the benefit of the people in its defensive religious judicial educational and other establishments ninetenths of the land in these nerbudda territories are held in lease immediately under government by the heads of villages whose leases have been renewable every five years but they are now to have a settlement for twentyl the other tenth is held by these heads of villages intermediately under some chief who holds several portions of land immediately under government at a quitrent or for service performed or to be performed for government and lets them out to farmers these are for the most part situated in the more hilly and less cultivated parts notes november this observation does not hold good in densely populated tracts which are now numerous these estates of villages are known by the persian name of mauza the topographical division of the country into mauzas which may be also translated by the terms townlands or townships has developed spontaneously some mauzas are uninhabited and are cultivated by the residents of neighbouring villages in some parts of central and southern india the gārpagrī who charms away hailstorms from the crops and bhūmkā who charms away tigers from the people and their cattle are added to the number of village servants w h s in many parts of berār and mālwa every village has its bhūmkā whose office it is to charm the tigers and its gārpagrī whose duty it is to keep off the hailstorms they are part of the village servants and paid by the village community after a severe hailstorm took place in the district of narsinghpur of which i had the civil charge in the office of gārpagrī was restored to several villages in which it had ceased for several generations they are all brahmans and take advantage of such calamities to impress the people with an opinion of their usefulness the bhūmkās are all gōnds or people of the woods who worship their own lares and penates ramaseeana introduction p note very often the government of the country know nothing of these tenures the local authorities allowed them to continue as a perquisite of their own the holders were willing to pay them a good share of the rent assured that they would be resumed if reported by the local authorities to the government these authorities consented to take a moderate share of the rent assured that they should get little or nothing if the lands were resumed w h s rent here means landrevenue of course under modern british administration the particulars of all tenures are known and recorded in great detail since the author wrote these remarks the legal position of cultivating proprietors and tenants has been largely modified by the pressure of population and a long course of legislation the rent acts which began with act x of are now numerous and have been accompanied by a series of land revenue acts and many collateral enactments all the problems of the irish land question are familiar topics to the angloindian courts and legislatures this proposition no doubt was true for the sāgar and nerbudda territories in but it cannot be predicated of the thickly populated and settled districts in the gangetic valley without considerable qualification examples of longestablished unchanged wellknown rentrates are not uncommon in recent years this task of mapping the waves of the ocean has been attempted every periodical settlement of the land revenue in northern india since has been accompanied by the preparation of detailed village maps showing each field even the tiniest a few yards square with a separate number in many cases these maps were roughly constructed under nonprofessional supervision but in many districts they have been prepared by the cadastral branch of the survey department the difficulty mentioned by the author has been severely felt and it constantly happens that beautiful maps become useless in four or five years efforts are made to insert annual corrections in copies of the maps through the agency of the village accountants and the kānūngos or officers who supervise them but the task is an enormous one and only partial success is attained in addition to the maps records of great bulk are annually prepared which give the most minute details about every holding and each field the permanent settlement of bengal effected under the orders of lord cornwallis in was soon afterwards extended to the province of benares now included in the united provinces of agra and oudh illusory provisions were made to protect the rights of tenants but nothing at all effectual was done till the passing of act x of which has been largely modified by later legislation the general principle here stated of respect for personal substantive law in civil matters is still the guide of the indian legislature but the accumulation of privy council and high court rulings combined with the action of codes has effected considerable gradual change direct legislation has anglicized the law of contract and has modified though not so largely the law of marriage inheritance and succession in the authors time the courts of the east india company still followed the muhammadan criminal law as modified by the regulations the indian penal code of placed the substantive criminal law on a thoroughly scientific basis this code was framed with such masterly skill that to this day it has needed little material amendment the first criminal procedure code passed in has been twice recast the law of evidence was codified by sir james fitzjames stephen in the indian evidence act of this proposition in the editors opinion truly states the theory of land tenures in india and it was a generally accurate statement of actual fact in the authors time since then the long continuance of settled government by fostering the growth of private rights has tended to obscure the idea of state ownership the modern revenue codes instead of postulating the ownership of the state enact that the claims of the statethat is to say the landrevenueare the first charge on the land and its produce the malabar coast offers an exception to the general hindu role of state ownership of land the nairs coorgs and tulus enjoyed full

signed the deed resumed the estate without ceremony on being remonstrated with he said that his father while living was of course master and could make him sign what he pleased and give land rentfree to whom he pleased but his successor must now be considered the best judge whether they could be spared or not that if lands were to be alienated in perpetuity by every reigning nawāb for every dose of medicine or dose of prayers that he or the members of his family required none would soon be left for the payment of the soldiers or other necessary public servants of any description this was told

fearful curses on the head of any rash mortal who may dare to revoke the grant usually the pious hope is expressed that if he should be guilty of such wickedness he may rot in filth and be reborn a worm revenue officers commonly observe that revenuefree grants which the author calls rentfree are often ill cultivated the simple reason is that the stimulus of the collectors demand is wanting to make the owner exert himself these leases now carry with them a right of ownership involving the power of alienation subject to the lien of theland revenue as a first charge conversely the modern codes lay down the principle that the revenue settlement must be made with the proprietor the authors rule of agricultural succession by primogeniture in the nerbudda territories has survived only in

the date of publication chapter witchcraft on leaving jabērā i saw an old acquaintance from the eastern part of the jubbulpore district kehrī singh i understand kehrī singh said i that certain men among the gonds of the jungle towards the source of the nerbudda eat human flesh is it so no sir the men never eat people but the gond women do where everywhere sir there is not a parish nay a village among the gonds in which you will not find one or more such women and how do they eat people they eat their livers sir oh i understand you mean witches of course who ever heard of other people eating human beings and you really still think in spite of all that we have done and said that there are such things as witches of course we dodo not we find instances of it every day european gentlemen are too apt to believe that things like this are not to be found here because they are not to be found in their own country major wardlow when in charge of the seonī district denied the existence of witchcraft for a long time but he was at last convinced how one of his troopers one morning after a long march took some milk for his masters breakfast from an old woman without paying for it before the major had got over his breakfast the poor trooper was down upon his back screaming from the agony of internal pains we all knew immediately that he had been bewitched and recommended the major to send for some one learned in these matters to find out the witch he did so and after hearing from the trooper the story about the milk this person at once declared that the woman from whom he got it was the criminal she was searched for found and brought to the trooper and commanded to cure him she flatly denied that she had herself conjured him but admitted that her household gods might unknown to her have punished him for his wickedness this however would not do she was commanded to cure the man and she set about collecting materials for the pūjā worship and before she could get quite through the ceremonies all his pains had left him had we not been resolute with her the man must have died before evening so violent were his torments did not a similar case occur to mr fraser at jubbulpore a chaprāsī of his while he had charge of the jubbulpore district was sent out to mandlā with a message of some kind or other he took a cock from an old gond woman without paying for it and being hungry after a long journey ate the whole of it in a curry he heard the woman mutter something but being a raw unsuspecting young man he thought nothing of it ate his cock and went to sleep he had not been asleep three hours before he was seized with internal pains and the old cock was actually heard crowing in his belly he made the best of his way back to jubbulpore several stages and all the most skilful men were employed to charm away the effect of the old womans spell but in vain he died and the cock never ceased crowing at intervals up to the hour of his death and was mr fraser convinced i never heard but suppose he must have been who ate the livers of the victims the witches themselves or the evil spirits with whom they had dealings the evil spirits ate the livers but they are set on to do so by the witches who get them into their power by such accursed sacrifices and offerings they will often dig up young children from their graves bring them to life and allowthese devils to feed upon their livers as falconers allow their hawks to feed on the breasts of pigeons you sāhib lōg european gentlemen will not believe all this but it is nevertheless all very true the belief in sorcery among these people owes its origin in a great measure to the diseases of the liver and spleen to which the natives and particularly the children are much subject in the jungly parts of central india from these affections children pine away and die without showing any external marks of disease their death is attributed to witchcraft and any querulous old woman who has been in the habit of murmuring at slights and ill treatment in the neighbourhood is immediately set down as the cause men who practise medicine among them are very commonly supposed to be at the same time wizards seeking to inspire confidence in their prescriptions by repeating prayers and incantations over the patient or over the medicine they give him they make him believe that they derive aid from supernatural power and the patient concludes that those who can command these powers to cure can if they will command them to destroy he and his friends believe that the man who can command these powers to cure one individual can command them to cure any other and if he does not do so they believe that it arises from a desire to destroy the patient i have in these territories known a great many instances of medical practitioners having been put to death for not curing young people for whom they were required to prescribe several cases have come before me as a magistrate in which the father has stood over the doctor with a drawn sword by the side of the bed of his child and cut him down and killed him the moment the child died as he had sworn to do when he found the patient sinking under his prescriptions the town of jubbulpore contains a population of twenty thousand souls and they all believed in this story of the cock i one day asked a most respectable merchant in the town nādū chaudhrī how the people could believe in such things when he replied that he had no doubt witches were to be found in every part of india though they abounded most no doubt in the central parts of it and that we ought to consider ourselves very fortunate in having no such things in england but added he of all countries that between mandlā and katāk cuttack is the worst for witches i had once occasion to go to the city of ratanpur on business and was one day about noon walking in the marketplace and eating a very fine piece of sugarcane in the crowd i happened by accident to jostle an old woman as she passed me i looked back intending to apologize for the accident and heard her muttering indistinctly as she passed on knowing the propensities of these old ladies i became somewhat uneasy and on turning round to my cane i found to my great terror that the juice had been all turned to blood not a minute had elapsed such were the fearful powers of this old woman i collected my followers and leaving my agents there to settle my accounts was beyond the boundaries of the old wretchs influence before dark had i remained nothing could have saved me i should certainly have been a dead man before morning it is well known said the old gentleman that their spells and curses can only reach a certain distance ten or twelve miles and if you offend one of them the sooner you place that distance between you the better jangbār khān the representative of the shāhgarh rājā as grave and reverend an old gentleman as ever sat in the senate of venice told me one day that he was himself an eyewitness of the powers of the women of khilautī he was with a great concourse of people at a fair held at the town of rāipur and while sauntering with many other strangers in the fair one of them began bargaining with two women of middle age for some very fine sugarcanes they asked double the fair price for their canes the man got angry and took up one of them when the women seized the other end and a struggle ensued the purchaser offered a fair price seller demanded double the crowd looked on and a good deal of abuse of the female relations on both sides took place at last a sepoy of the governor came up armed to the teeth and called out to the man in a very imperious tone to let go his hold of the cane he refused saying that when people came to the fair to sell they should be made to sell at reasonable prices or be turned out i said jangbār khān thought the man right and told the sepoy that if he took the part of this woman we should take that of the other and see fair play without further ceremony the functionary drew his sword and cut the cane in two in the middle and pointing to both pieces there said he you see the cause of my interference we looked down and actually saw blood running from both pieces and forming a little pool on the ground the fact was that the woman was a sorceress of the very worst kind and was actually drawing the blood from the man through the cane to feed the abominable devil from whom she derived her detestable powers but for the timely interference of the sepoy he would have been dead in another minute for he no sooner saw the real state of the case than he fainted he had hardly any blood left in him and i was afterwards told that he was not able to walk for ten days we all went to the governor to demand justice declaring that unless the women were made an example of at once the fair would be deserted for no strangers life would be safe he consented and they were both sewn up in sacks and thrown into the river but they had conjured the water and would not sink they ought to have been put to death but the governor was himself afraid of this kind of people and let them off there is not continued jangbār a village or a single family without its witch in that part of the country indeed no man will give his daughter in marriage to a family without one saying if my daughter has children what will become of them without a witch to protect them from the witches of other families in the neighbourhood it is a fearful country though the cheapest and most fertile in india we can easily understand how a man impressed with the idea that his blood had all been drawn from him by a sorceress should become faint and remain many days in a languid state but how the people around should believe that they saw the blood flowing from both parts of the cane at the place cut through it is not so easy to conceivei am satisfied that old jangbār believed the whole story to be true and that at the time he thought the juice of the cane red but the little pool of blood grew no doubt by degrees as years rolled on and he related this tale of the fearful powers of the khilautī witches notes ante chapter an orderly or official messenger who wears a chaprās or badge of office on the nerbudda fifty miles southeast of jubbulpore of the supposed powers and dispositions of witches among the romans we have

infection and wept louder than any of them i was obliged to hurry over the interview lest i should feel disposed to do the same the poor old rānī too suffered a good deal in parting from my wife whom she says she can never hope to see again her fine large eyes shed many a tear as she was getting into her palankeen to return between jaberā and harduā the next stage we find a great many of those large forest trees called kalap or kalpa briksha the same which in the paradise of indra grants what is desired with a soft silvery bark and scarcely any leaves we are told that the name of the god rām rāma and his consort sītā will be found written by the hand of god upon all i had the curiosity to examine a good many in the forest on both sides of the road and found the name of this incarnation of vishnu written on everyone in sanskrit characters apparently by some supernatural hand that is there was a softness in the impression as if the finger of some supernatural being had traced the characters nathū one of our belted attendants told me that we might search as deeply as we would in the forest but we should certainly find the name of god upon every one for said he it is god himself who writes it i tried to argue him out of this notion but unfortunately could find no tree without these characterssome high up and some lower down in the trunksome large and others smallbut still to be found on every tree i was almost in despair when we came to a part of the wood where we found one of these trees down in a hollow under the road and another upon the precipice above i was ready to stake my credit upon the probability that no traveller would take the trouble to go up to the tree above or down to the tree below merely to write the name of the god upon them and at once pledged myself to nathū that he should find neither the gods name nor that of his wife i sent one man up and another man down and they found no letters on the trees but this did not alter their opinion on the point god said one had no doubt put his name on these trees but they had somehow or other got rubbed off he would in good time renew them that mens eyes might be blessed with the sight of his holy name even in the deepest forest and on the most leafless tree but said nathū he might not have thought it worth while to write his name upon those trees which no travellers go to see cannot you see said i that these letters have been engraved by man are they not all to be found on the trunk within reach of a mans hand of course they are replied he because people would not be able conveniently to distinguish them if god were to write them higher up shaikh sādī has a very pretty couplet every leaf of the foliage of a green tree is in the eye of a wise man a library to teach him the wisdom of his creator i may remark that where an englishman would write his own name a hindoo would write that of his god his parent or his benefactor this difference is traceable of course to the difference in their governments and institutions if a hindoo built a town he called it after his local governor if a local governor built it he called it after the favourite son of the emperor in well regulated hindoo families one cannot ask a younger brother after his children in presence of the elder brother who happens to be the head of the family it would be disrespectful for him even to speak of his children as his own in such presencethe elder brother relieves his embarrassment by answering for him on the th we reached damoh where our friends the browns were to leave us on their return to jubbulpore damoh is a pretty place the town contains some five or six thousand people and has some very handsome hindoo temples on a hill immediately above it is the shrine of a muhammadan saint which has a very picturesque appearance there are no manufactures at damoh except such as supply the wants of the immediate neighbourhood and the town is supported by the residence of a few merchants a few landholders and agricultural capitalists and the establishment of a native collector the people here suffer much from the guineaworm and consider it to arise from drinking the water of the old tank which is now very dirty and full of weeds i have no doubt that it is occasioned either by drinking the water of this tank or by wading in it for i have known european gentlemen get the worm in their legs from wading in similar lakes or swamps after snipes and the servants who followed them with their ammunition experience the same effect here as in most other parts of india the tanks get spoiled by the waterchestnut singhāra trapa bispinosa which is everywhere as regularly planted and cultivated in fields under a large surface of water as wheat or barley is on the dry plains it is cultivated by a class of men called dhīmars who are everywhere fishermen and palankeen bearers and they keep boats for the planting weeding and gathering the singhāra the holdings or tenements of each cultivator are marked out carefully on the surface of the water by long bamboos stuck up in it and they pay so much the acre for the portion they till the long straws of the plants reach up to the surface of the waters upon which float their green leavesand their pure white flowers expand beautifully among them in the latter part of the afternoon the nut grows under the water after the flowers decay and is of a triangular shape and covered with a tough brown integument adhering strongly to the kernel which is white esculent and of a fine cartilaginous texture the people are very fond of these nuts and they are carried often upon bullocks backs two or three hundred miles to market they ripen in the latter end of the rains or in september and are eatable till the end of november the rent paid for an ordinary tank by the cultivator is about one hundred rupees a year i have known two hundred rupees to be paid for a very large one and even three hundred or thirty pounds a year but the mud increases so rapidly from this cultivation that it soon destroys all reservoirs in which it is permitted and where it is thought desirable to keep up the tank for the sake of the water it should be carefully prohibited this is done by stipulating with the renter of the village at the renewal of the lease that no singhāra shall be planted in the tank otherwise he will never forgo the advantage to himself

at the village of sujaina about ten miles from damoh on the road to hattā a gang of two hundred thugs were encamped in the grove at hindoria in the cold season of when early in the morning seven men well armed with swords and matchlocks passed them bearing treasure from the bank of motī kochia at jubbulpore to their correspondents at bānda to the value of four thousand five hundred rupees the value of their burden was immediately perceived by these keeneyed sportsmen and kosarī drigpāl and faringia three of the leaders with forty of their fleetest and stoutest followers were immediately selected for the pursuit they followed seven miles unperceived and coming up with the treasurebearers in a watercourse half a mile from the village of sujaina they rushed in upon them and put them all to death with their swords while they were doing so a tanner from sujaina approached with his buffalo and to prevent him giving the alarm they put him to death also and made off with the treasure leaving the bodies unburied a heavy shower of rain fell and none of the village people came to the place till the next morning early when some females passing it on their way to hattā saw the bodies and returning to sujaina reported the circumstance to their friends the whole village thereupon flocked to the spot and the body of the tanner was burned by his relations with the usual ceremonies while all the rest were left to be eaten by jackals dogs and vultures who make short work of such things in india we had occasion to examine a very respectable old gentleman at damoh upon the case gobind dās a revenue officer under the former government and now about seventy years of age he told us that he had no knowledge whatever of the murder of the eight men at sujaina but he well remembered another which took place seven years before the time we mentioned at abhāna a stage or two back on the road to jubbulpore seventeen treasurebearers lodged in the grove near that town on their way from jubbulpore to sāgar at night they were set upon by a large gang of thugs and sixteen of them strangled but the seventeenth laid hold of the noose before it could be brought to bear upon his throat pulled down the villain who held it and made his way good to the town the rājā dharak singh went to the spot with all the followers he could collect but he found there nothing but the sixteen naked bodies lying in the grove with their eyes apparently starting out of their sockets the thugs had all gone off with the treasure and their clothes and the rājā searched for them in vain a native commissioned officer of a regiment of native infantry one day told me that while he was on duty over some thugs at lucknow one of them related with great seeming pleasure the following case which seemed to him one of the most remarkable that he had heard them speak of during the time they were under his charge a stout mogul officer of noble bearing and singularly handsome countenance on his way from the punjab to oudh crossed the ganges at garhmuktesar ghāt near meerut to pass through murādābād and bareilly he was mounted on a fine tūrkī horse and attended by his khidmatgār butler and groom soon after crossing the river he fell in with a small party of welldressed and modestlooking men going the same road they accosted him in a respectful manner and attempted to enter into conversation with him he had heard of thugs and told them to be off they smiled at his idle suspicions and tried to remove them but in vain the mogul was determined they saw his nostrils swelling with indignation took their leave and followed slowly the next morning he overtook the same number of men but of a different appearance all musalmāns they accosted him in the same respectful manner talked of the danger of the road and the necessity of their keeping together and taking advantage of the protection of any mounted gentleman that happened to be going the same way the mogul officer said not a word in reply resolved to have no companions on the road they persistedhis nostrils began again to swell and putting his hand to his sword he bid them all be off or he would have their heads from their shoulders he had a bow and quiver full of arrows over his shoulders a brace of loaded pistols in his waistbelt and a sword by his side and was altogether a very formidablelooking cavalier in the evening another party that lodged in the same sarāi became very intimate with the butler and groom they were going the same road and as the mogul overtook them in the morning they made their bows respectfully and began to enter into conversation with their two friends the groom and butler who were coming up behind the moguls nostrils began again to swell and he bid the strangers be off the groom and butler interceded for their master was a grave sedate man and they wanted companions all would not do and the strangers fell in the rear the next day when they had got to the middle of an extensive and uninhabited plain the mogul in advance and his two servants a few hundred yards behind he came up to a party of six poor musalmāns sitting weeping by the side of a dead companion they were soldiers from lahore on their way to lucknow worn down by fatigue in their anxiety to see their wives and children once more after a long and painful service their companion the hope and prop of his family had sunk under the fatigue and they had made a grave for him but they were poor unlettered men and unable to repeat the funeral service from the holy koranwould his highness but perform this last office for them he would no doubt find his reward in thisworld and the next the mogul dismountedthe body had been placed in its proper position with its head towards mecca a carpet was spreadthe mogul took off his bow and quiver then his pistols and sword and placed them on the ground near the bodycalled for water and washed his feet hands and face that he might not pronounce the holy words in an unclean state he then knelt down and began to repeat the funeral service in a clear loud voice two of the poor soldiers knelt by him one on each side in silence the other four went off a few paces to beg that the butler and groom would not come so near as to interrupt the good samaritan at his devotions all being ready one of the four in a low undertone gave the jhirnī signal the handkerchiefs were thrown over their necks and in a few minutes all threethe mogul and his servantswere dead and lying in the grave in the usual manner the head of one at the feet of the one below him all the parties they had met on the road belonged to a gang of jamāldehī thugs of the kingdom of oudh in despair of being able to win the moguls confidence in the usual way and determined to have the money and jewels which they knew he carried with him they had adopted this plan of disarming him dug the grave by the side of the road in the open plain and made a handsome young musalmān of the party the dead soldier the mogul being a very stout man died almost without a struggle as is usually the case with such and his two servants made no resistance people of great sensibility with hearts overcharged with sorrow often appear cold and callous to those who seem to them to feel no interest in their afflictions an instance of this kind i will here mention it is one of thousands that i have met with in my indian rambles it was mentioned to me one day that an old fakīr who lived in a small hut close by a little shrine on the side of the road near the town of morādābād had lately lost his son poisoned by a party of daturiās or professional poisoners that now infest every road throughout india i sent for him and requested him to tell me his story as i might perhaps be able to trace the murderers he did so and a persian writer took it down while i listened with all the coldness of a magistrate who wanted merely to learn facts and have nothing whatever to do with feelings this is his story literally i reside in my hut by the side of the road a mile and a half from the town and live upon the bounty of travellers and the people of the surrounding villages about six weeks ago i was sitting by the side of my shrine after saying prayers with my only son about ten years of age when a man came up with his wife his son and his daughter the one a little older and the other a little younger than my boy they baked and ate their bread near my shrine and gave me flour enough to make two cakes this i prepared and baked my boy was hungry and ate one cake and a half i ate only half a one for i was not hungry i had a few days before purchased a new blanket for my boy and it was hanging in a branch of the tree that shaded the shrine when these people came my son and i soon became stupefied i saw him fall asleep and i soon followed i awoke again in the evening and found myself in a pool of water i had sense enough to crawl towards my boy i found him still breathing and i sat by him with his head in my lap where he soon died it was now evening and i got up and wandered about all night picking strawsi know not why i was not yet quite sensible during the night the wolves ate my poor boy i heard this from travellers and went and gathered up his bones and buried them in the shrine i did not quite recover till the third day when i found that some washerwomen had put me into the pool and left me there with my head out in hopes that this would revive me but they had no hope of my son i was then taken to the police of the town but the landholders had begged me to say nothing about the poisoners lest it might get them and their village community into trouble the man was tall and fair and about thirtyfive the woman short stout and fair and about thirty two of her teeth projected a good deal the boys eyelids were much diseased all this he told me without the slightest appearance of emotion for he had not seen any appearance of it in me or my persian writer and a casual european observer would perhaps have exclaimed what brutes these natives are this fellow feels no more for the loss of his only son than he would for that of a goat but i knew the feeling was there the persian writer put up his paper and closed his inkstand and the following dialogue word for word took place between me and the old man questionwhat made you conceal the real cause of your boys death and tell the police that he had been killed as well as eaten by wolves answerthe landholders told me that they could never bring back my boy to life and the whole village would be worried to death by them if i made any mention of the poison questionand if they were to be punished for this they would annoy you answercertainly but i believed they advised me for my own good as well as their own questionand if they should turn you away from that place could you not make another answerare not the bones of my poor boy there and the trees that he and i planted and watched together for ten years questionhave you no other relations what became of your boys motheranswershe died at that place when my boy was only three months old i have brought him up myself from that age he was my only child and he has been poisoned for the sake of the blanket here the poor old man sobbed as if his heartstrings would break and i was obliged to make him sit down on the floor while i walked up and down the room questionhad you any children before answeryes sir we had several but they all died before their mother we had been reduced to beggary by misfortunes and i had become too weak and ill to work i buried my poor wifes bones by the side of the road where she died raised the little shrine over them planted the trees and there have i sat ever since by her side with our poor boy in my bosom it is a sad place for wolves and we used often to hear them howling outside but my poor boy was never afraid of them when he knew i was near him god preserved him to me till the sight of the new blanket for i had nothing else in the world made these people poison us i bought it for him only a few days before when the rains were coming on out of my savingsit was all i had the poor old man sobbed again and sat down while i paced the room lest i should sob also my heart was becoming a little too large for its apartment i will never continued he quit the bones of my wife and child and the tree that he and i watered for so many years i have not many years to live there i will spend them whatever the landholders may dothey advised me for my own good and will never turn me out i found all the poor man stated to be true the man and his wife had mixed poison with the flour to destroy the poor old man and his son for the sake of the new blanket which they saw hanging in the branch of the tree and carried away with them the poison used on such occasions is commonly the datura and it is sometimes given in the hookah to be smoked and at others in food when they require to poison children as well as grownup people or women who do not smoke they mix up the poison in food the intention is almost always to destroy life as dead men tell no tales but the poisoned people sometimes recover as in the present case and lead to the detection of the poisoners the cases in which they recover are however rare and of those who recover few are ever able to trace the poisoners and of those who recover and trace them very few will ever undertake to prosecute them through the several courts of the magistrate the sessions and that of last instance in a distant district to which the proceedings must be sent for final orders the impunity with which this crime is everywhere perpetrated and its consequent increase in every part of india are among the greatest evils with which the country is at this time affected these poisoners are spread all over india and are as numerous over the bombay and madras presidencies as over that of bengal there is no road free from them and throughout india there must be many hundreds who gain their subsistence by this trade alone they put on all manner of disguises to suit their purpose and as they prey chiefly upon the poorer sort of travellers they require to destroy the greater number of lives to make up their incomes a party of two or three poisoners have very often succeeded in destroying another of eight or ten travellers with whom they have journeyed for some days by pretending to give them a feast on the celebration of the anniversary of some family event sometimes an old woman or man will manage the thing alone by gaining the confidence of travellers and getting near the cookingpots while they go aside or when employed to bring the flour for the meal from the bazaar the poison is put into the flour or the pot as opportunity offers people of all castes and callings take to this trade some casually others for life and others derive it from their parents or teachers they assume all manner of disguises to suit their purposes and the habits of cooking eating and sleeping on the side of the road and smoking with strangers of seemingly the same caste greatly facilitate their designs upon travellers the small parties are unconnected with each other and two parties never unite in the same cruise the members of one party may be sometimes convicted and punished but their conviction is accidental for the system which has enabled us to put down the thug associations cannot be applied with any fair prospect of success to the suppression of these pests to society the thugs went on their adventures in large gangs and two or more were commonly united in the course of an expedition in the perpetration of many murders every man shared in the booty according to the rank he held in the gang or the part he took in the murders and the rank of every man and the part he took generally or in any particular murder were generally well known to all from among these gangs when arrested we found the evidence we required for their convictionor the means of tracing itamong the families and friends of their victims or with persons to whom the property taken had been disposed of and in the graves to which the victims had been consigned to give an idea of the system by which the government of india has been enabled to effect so great a good for the people as the suppression of these associations i will suppose that two sporting gentlemen a at delhi and b in calcutta had both described the killing of a tiger in an island in the ganges near hardwār and mentioned the names of the persons engaged with them among the persons thus named were c who had since returned to america d who had retired to new south wales e to england and f to scotland there were four other persons named who were still in india but they are deeply interested in a and bs story not being believed a says that b got the skin of the tiger and b states that he gave it to c who cut out two of the claws application is made to c d e and f and without the possibility of any collusion or even communication between them their statements correspond precisely with those of a and b as to the time place circumstances and persons engaged their statements are sworn to before magistrates in presenceof witnesses and duly attested c states that he got the skin from b and gave it to the nawāb of rāmpur for a hookah carpet but that he took from the left forefoot two of the claws and gave them to the minister of the king of oudh for a charm for his sick child the nawāb of rāmpur being applied to states that he received the skin from c at the time and place mentioned and that he still smokes his hookah upon it and that it had lost the two claws upon the left forefoot the minister of the king of oudh states that he received the two claws nicely set in gold that they had cured his boy who still wore them round his neck to guard him from the evil eye the goldsmith states that he set the two claws in gold for c who paid him handsomely for his work the peasantry whose cattle graze on the island declare that certain gentlemen did kill a tiger there about the time mentioned and that they saw the body after the skin had been taken off and the vultures had begun to descend upon it to prove that what a and b had stated could not possibly be true the other party appeal to some of their townsmen who are said to be well acquainted with their characters they state that they really know nothing about the matter in dispute that their friends who are opposed to a and b are much liked by their townspeople and neighbours as they have plenty of money which they spend freely but that they are certainly very much addicted to fieldsports and generally absent in pursuit of wild beasts for three or four months every year but whether they were or were not present at the killing of the great garhmuktesar tiger they could not say most persons would after examining this evidence be tolerably well satisfied that the said tiger had really been killed at the time and place and by the persons mentioned by a and b but to establish the fact judicially it would be necessary to bring a b c d e and f the nawāb of rāmpur the minister of the king of oudh and the goldsmith to the criminal court at meerut to be confronted with the person whose interest it was that a and b should not be believed they would all perhaps come to the said court from the different quarters of the world in which they had thought themselves snugly settled but the thing would annoy them so much and be so much talked of that sporting gentlemen nawābs ministers and goldsmiths would in future take good care to have forgotten everything connected with the matter in dispute should another similar reference be made to them and so a and b would never again have any chance thug approvers whose evidence we required were employed in all parts of india under the officers appointed to put down these associations and it was difficult to bring all whose evidence was necessary at the trials to the court of the district in which the particular murder was perpetrated the victims were for the most part moneycarriers whose masters and families resided hundreds of miles from the place where they were murdered or people on their way to their distant homes from foreign service there was no chance of recovering any of the property taken from the victims as thugs were known to spend what they got freely and never to have money by them and the friends of the victims and the bankers whose money they carried were everywhere found exceedingly averse to take share in the prosecution to obviate all these difficulties separate courts were formed with permission to receive whatever evidence they might think likely to prove valuable attaching to each portion whether documentary or oral whatever weight it might seem to deserve such courts were formed at hyderabad mysore indore lucknow gwālior and were presided over by our highest diplomatic functionaries in concurrence with the princes at whose courts they were accredited and who at jubbulpore were under the direction of the representative of the governorgeneral of indial by this means we had a most valuable species of unpaid agency and i believe there is no part of their public life on which these high functionaries look back with more pride than that spent in presiding over such courts and assisting the supreme government in relieving the people of india from this fearful evil notes a town on the allahabad and sāgar road sixtyone miles northeast of sāgar it was the

valuable approver lieutenant brown was suddenly called back to jubbulpore and could not himself go to sujaina he sent however an intelligent native officer to the place but no man could be induced to acknowledge that he had ever seen the bodies or heard of the affair though faringia pointed out to them exactly where they all lay they said it must be quite a mistake that such a thing could not have taken place and they know nothing of it lieutenant brown was aware that all thisaffected ignorance arose entirely from the dread these people have of being summoned to give evidence to any of our district courts of justice and wrote to the officer in the civil charge of the district to request that he would assure them that their presence would not be required mr doolan the assistant magistrate happened to be going through sujaina from sāgar on deputation at the time and sending for all the respectable old men of the place he requested that they would be under no apprehension but tell him the real truth as he would pledge himself that not one of them should ever be summoned to any district court to give evidence they then took him to the spot and pointed out to him where the bodies had been found and mentioned that the body of the tanner had been burned by his friends the banker whose treasure they had been carrying had an equal dislike to be summoned to court to give evidence now that he could no longer hope to recover any portion of his lost money and it was not till after lieutenant brown had given him a similar assurance that he would consent to have his books examined the loss of the four thousand five hundred rupees was then found entered with the names of the men who had been killed at sujaina in carrying it these are specimens of some of the minor difficulties we had to contend with in our efforts to put down the most dreadful of all crimes all the prisoners accused of these murders had just been tried for others or lieutenant brown would not

the remnant of them with their families were kept under surveillance they were employed in a tent and carpet factory known as the school of industry founded in by the author and captain charles brown if released they would certainly have resumed their hereditary occupation which exercised an awful fascination over its votaries most of the thug gangs had been broken up by but cases of thuggee have occurred occasionally since that date a gang of kahārs palanquin bearers committed a series of thug murders in i think at etāwa in the united provinces of agra and oudh the office of superintendent of thuggee and dacoity was kept up until but the officer in charge was more concerned with dacoity that is to say organized gangrobbery with violence in the native states than with the secret crime of thuggee secret crime is now watched by the central criminal intelligence department under the direct control of the government of india and has to deal with novel forms of evildoing in india it is never safe to assume that any ancient practice has been suppressed and i have little doubt that if administrative pressure were relaxed the old form of thuggee would again be heard of the occasional discovery of murdered beggars who could not have been killed for the sake of their property leads me to suppose that the megpunnia variety of thuggee that is to say murder of poor persons in order to kidnap and sell their children is still sometimes practised among the officers named by the author the best known is sir mark cubbon who came to india in and died at suez in during the interval he had

nerbudda valleydeification of a mortal on the th we came on to pathariā a considerable little town thirty miles from sāgar supported almost entirely by a few farmers small agricultural capitalists and the establishment of a native collector on leaving pathariā we ascend gradually along the side of the basaltic hills on our left to the south for three miles to a point whence we see before us this plane of basaltic cappings extending as far as the eye can reach to the west south and north with frequent breaks but still preserving one uniform level on the top of these tables are here and there little conical elevations of laterite or indurated iron clay the cappings everywhere repose immediately upon the sandstone of the vindhya range but they have occasional beds of limestone formed apparently by springs rising from their sides and strongly impregnated with carbonic acid gas for the most part this is mere travertine but in some places they get good lime from the beds for building on the st of december we came to the pretty village of sanodā near the suspension bridge built over the river biās by colonel presgrave while he was assay master of the sāgar mint i was present at laying the foundationstone of this bridge in december mr maddock was the governorgenerals representative in these territories and the work was undertaken more with a view to show what could be done out of their own resources under minds capable of developing them than to supply any pressing or urgent want the work was completed in june and i have several times seen upon the bridge as many as it could hold of a regiment of infantry while it moved over and at other times as many of a corps of cavalry and often several elephants at once the bridge is between the points of suspension two hundred feet and the clear portion of the platform measures one hundred and ninety feet by eleven and a half the whole cost of the work amounted to about fifty thousand rupees and under a less able and careful person than colonel presgrave would have cost perhaps double the amount this work has been declared by a very competent judge to be equal to any structure of the same kind in europe and is eminently calculated to show what genius and perseverance can produce out of the resources of a country even in the rudest state of industry and the arts the river nerbudda neither is nor ever can i fear be made navigable and the produce of its valley would require to find its way to distant markets over the vindhya range of hills to the north or the sātpura to the south if the produce of the soil mines and industry of the valley cannot be transported to distant markets the government cannot possibly find in it any available net surplus revenue in money for it has no mines of the precious metals and the precious metals can flow in only in exchange for the produce of the land and the industry of the valley that flows out if the government wishes to draw a net surplus revenue from the valley or from the districts that border upon it that is a revenue beyond its expenditure in support of the local public establishments it must either draw it in produce or for what can be got for that produce in distant markets hitherto little beyond the rude produce of the soil has been able to find its way into distant markets from the valley of the nerbudda yet this valley abounds in iron mines and its soil where unexhausted by cropping is of the richest quality it is not then too much to hope that in time the iron of the mines will be worked with machinery for manufactures and that multitudes aided by this machinery and subsisted on the rude agricultural produce which now flows out will invest the value of their labour in manufactured commodities adapted to the demand of foreign markets and better able from their superior value compared with their bulk to pay the cost of transport by land then and not till then can we expect to see these territories pay a considerable net surplus revenue to government and abound in a middle class of merchants manufacturers and agricultural capitalists at sanodā there is a very beautiful little fortress or castle now unoccupied though still entire it was built by an officer of the rājā chhatar sāl of bundēlkhand about one hundred and twenty years ago he had a grant on the tenure of military service of twelve villages situated round this place and a man who could build such a castle to defend the surrounding country from the inroads of freebooters and to secure himself and his troops from any sudden impulse of the peoples resentment was as likely to acquire an increase of territorial possession in these parts as he would have been in europe during the middle ages the son of this chief by name rāi singh was soon after the castle had been completed killed in an attack upon a town near chitrakōt and having in the estimation of the people become a god he had a temple and a tomb raised to him close to our encampment i asked the people how he had become a god and was told that some one who had been long suffering from a quartan ague went to the tomb one night and promised rāi singh whose ashes lay under it that if he could contrive to cure his ague for him he would during the rest of his life make offerings to his shrine after that he had never another attack and was very punctual in his offerings others followed his example and with like success till rāi singh was recognized among them universally as a god and a temple raised to his name this is the way that gods were made all over the world at one time and are still made all over india happy had it been for mankind if those only who were supposed to do good had been deifiedon the nd we came on to the village of khojanpur leaving the town and cantonments of sāgar to our left a distance of some fourteen miles the road for a great part of the way was over the bare back of the sandstone strata the covering of basalt having been washed off the hills however are at this distance from the city and cantonments of sāgar nicely wooded and being constantly intersected by pretty little valleys the country we came over was picturesque and beautiful the soil of all these valleys is rich from the detritus of the basalt that forms or caps the hills but it is now in a bad state of cultivation partly from several successive seasons of great calamity under which the people have been suffering and partly from overassessment and this posture of affairs is continued by that loss of energy industry and character among the farmers and cultivators which must everywhere result from these two evils in india where the people have learnt so well to govern themselves from the want of settled government good or bad government really depends almost altogether upon good or bad settlements of the land revenue where the government demand is imposed with moderation and enforced with justice there will the people be generally found happy and contented and disposed to perform their duties to each other and to the state except when they have the misfortune to suffer from drought blight and other calamities of seasonl i have mentioned that the basalt in the sāgar district reposes for the most part immediately upon the sandstone of the vindhya range and it must have been deposited on the sand while the latter was yet at the bottom of the ocean though this range is now i believe nowhere less than from fifteen hundred to two thousand feet above the level of the sea the marks of the ripple of the sea may be observed in some places where the basalt has been recently washed off beautifully defined as if formed only yesterday and there is no other substance to be seen between the two rocks the texture of the sandstone at the surface where it comes in contact with the basalt has in some places been altered by it but in others it seems to have been as little changed as the habitations of the people who were suffocated by the ashes of vesuvius in the city of pompeii i am satisfied from long and careful examination that the greater part of this basalt which covers the tableland of central and southern india must have been held for some time in suspension in the ocean or lake into which it was first thrown in the shape of ashes and then gradually deposited this alone can account for its frequent appearance of stratification for the gentle blending of its particles with those of the sand near the surface of the latter and above all for those level steps or tables lying one above another horizontally in parallel bars on one range corresponding exactly with the same parallel lines one above another on a range twenty or thirty miles across the valley mr scropes theory is i believe that these are all mere flowing coulées of lava which in their liquid state filled hollows but afterwards became of a harder texture as they dried and crystallized than the higher rocks around them the consequence of which is that the latter has been decomposed and washed away while the basalt has been left to form the highest elevations my opinion is that these steps or stairs at one time formed the beds of the ocean or of great lakes and that the substance of which they are composed was for the most part projected into the water and there held in suspension till gradually deposited there are however amidst these steps and beneath them masses of more compact and crystalline basalt that bear evident signs of having been flows of laval reasoning from analogy at jubbulpore where some of the basaltic cappings of the hills had evidently been thrown out of craters long after this surface had been raised above the waters and become the habitation both of vegetable and animal life i made the first discovery of fossil remains in the nerbudda valley i went first to a hill within sight of my house in and searched exactly between the plateau of basalt that covered it and the stratum immediately below and there i found several small trees with roots trunks and branches all entire and beautifully petrified they had been only recently uncovered by the washing away of a part of the basaltic plateau i soon after found some fossil bones of animals going over to sāgar in the end of and reasoning there upon the same analogy i searched for fossil remains along the line of contact between the basalt and the surface upon which it had been deposited and i found a grove of silicified palmtrees within a mile of the cantonments these palmtrees had grown upon a calcareous deposit formed from springs rising out of the basaltic range of hills to the south the commissariat officer had cut a road through this grove and all the european officers of a large military station had been every day riding through it without observing the geological treasure and it was some time before i could convince them that the stones which they had every day seen were really petrified palmtrees the roots and trunks were beautifully

brickdust colour sometimes deepened into dark red apparently the special character which distinguishes laterite from other forms of redcoloured weathering is the presence of hydrous oxide of alumina in varying proportions though there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the way in which laterite was formed the facts which are known of its distribution seem to show that it is a distinct

generally is formed for the most part of the detritus of traprocks that everywhere covered the sandstone of the vindhya and sātpura ranges which run through these territories this basaltic detritus forms what is called the black cotton soil by the english for what reason i know not w h s the reason is that cotton is very largely grown in the nerbudda valley both on the black soil and other soils in bundēlkhand the black friable soil often with a high proportion of organic matter is called mār and is chiefly devoted to raising crops of wheat gram or chickpea cicer arietinum linseed and joār holcus sorghum cotton is also sown in it but not very generally this black soil requires little rain and is fertile without manure it absorbs water too freely to be suitable for irrigation and in most seasons does not need it the black cotton soil is often known as regur a corruption of a tamil word the origin of regur is a doubtful question the dark coloration was attributed by earlier writers to vegetable matter and taken to indicate a large amount of humus in the soil more recent investigations make this doubtful and in all probability the colour is due to mineral constitution rather than to the very scanty organic constituents of the soil it may possibly be formed of windborne dust like the loess plains of china oldham in the oxford survey of the british empire vol ii asia p oxford the

the subaqueous origin of the greater part of the basalt of central and southern india otherwiseknown as the deccan trap series had been supported by numerous excellent geologists but w t blanford proved the theory to be untenable there being clear and unmistakable evidence that the traps were in great part of subaerial formation the intercalation of sedimentary beds with freshwater fossils is conclusive proof that the lavaflows associated with such beds cannot be submarine the hypothesis that the lower beds of traps were poured out in a vast but shallow freshwater lake extending throughout the area over which the intertrappean limestone formation extends appears to be extremely improbable the lava seems to have been poured during a long succession of ages over a land surface uneven and broken in parts with intervals of rest sufficient for lakes stocked with freshwater mollusca to form on the cold surfaces of several of the lavaflows holland in ig i a great tract of the volcanic region appears to have remained almost undisturbed to the present day affected by subaerial erosion alone the geological horizon of the deccan trap cannot be precisely defined but is now vaguely stated as the close of the cretaceous period the steps or conspicuous terraces traceable on the hillsides for great distances are explained as being due to the outcrop of the harder basaltic strata or of those beds which resist best the disintegrating influences of exposure the general horizontality of the deccan trap over an area of not less than square miles and the absence of volcanic hills of the usual conical form are difficulties which have caused much discussion some of the old volcanic vents appear to have existed near poona and mahāblēshwar the entire area has been subjected to

lakeparalysis from eating the grain of the lathyrus sativus the cantonments of sāgar are about two miles from the city and occupied by three regiments of native infantry one of local horse and a company of european artillery the city occupies two sides of one of the most beautiful lakes of india formed by a wall which unites two sandstone hills on the north side the fort and part of the town stands upon this wall which according to tradition was built by a wealthy merchant of the banjāra caste after he had finished it the bed of the lake still remained dry and he was told in a dream or by a priest that it would continue so till he should consent to sacrifice his own daughter then a girl and the young lad to whom she was affianced to the tutelary god of the place he accordingly built a little shrine in the centre of the valley which was to become the bed of the lake put the two children in and built up the doorway he had no sooner done so than the whole of the valley became filled with water and the old merchant the priest the masons and spectators made their escape with much difficulty from that time the lake has been inexhaustible but no living soul of the banjāra caste has ever since been known to drink of its waters certainly all of that caste at present religiously avoid drinking the water of the lake and the old people of the city say that they have always done so since they can remember and that they used to hear from their parents that they had always done so in nothing does the founder of the christian religion appear more amiable than in his injunction suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not in nothing do the hindoo deities appear more horrible than in the delight they are supposed to take in their sacrificeit is everywhere the helpless the female and the infant that they seek to devourand so it was among the phoenicians and their carthaginian colonies human sacrifices were certainly offered in the cities of sāgar during the whole of the marātha government up to the year when they were put a stop to by the local governor āsā sāhib a very humane man and i once heard a very learned brahman priest say that he thought the decline of his family and government arose from this innovation there is said he no sin in not offering human sacrifices to the gods where none have been offered but where the gods have been accustomed to them they are naturally annoyed when the rite is abolished and visit the place and people with all kinds of calamities he did not seem to think that there was anything singular in this mode of reasoning and perhaps three brahman priests out of four would have reasoned in the same manner on descending into the valley of the nerbudda over the vindhya range of hills from bhopal one may see by the side of the road upon a spur of the hill a singular pillar of sandstone rising in two spires one turning above and rising over the other to the height of from twenty to thirty feet on a spur of a hill half a mile distant is another sandstone pillar not quite so high the tradition is that the smaller pillar was the affianced bride of the taller one who was a youth of a family of great eminence in these parts coming with his uncle to pay his first visit to his bride in the procession they call the barāt he grew more and more impatient as he approached nearer and nearer and she shared the feeling at last unable to restrain himself he jumped upon his uncles shoulder and looked with all his might towards the spot where his bride was said to be seated unhappily she felt no less impatient than he did and raised the fringed curtains of her eye as he raised his and they saw each other at the same moment in that moment the bride bridegroom and uncle were all converted into stone pillars and there they stand to this day a monument in the estimation of the people to warn men and womankind against too strong an inclination to indulge curiosity it is a singular fact that in one of the most extensive tribes of the gond population of central india to which this couple is said to have belonged the bride always goes to the bridegroom in the procession of the barāt to prevent a recurrence of this calamity it is the bridegroom who goes to the bride among every other class of the people of india as well muhammadans as hindoos whether the usage grew out of the tradition or the tradition out of the usage is a question that will admit of much being said on both sides i can only vouch for the existence of both i have seen the pillars heard the tradition from the people and ascertained the usage as in the case of that of the sāgar lake the mahādēo sandstone hills which in the sātpura range overlook the nerbudda to the south rise to between four and five thousand feet above the level of the sea and in one of the highest parts a fair was formerly and is perhaps still held for the enjoyment of those who assemble to witness the self devotion of a few young men who offer themselves as a sacrifice to fulfil the vows of their mothers when a woman is without children she makes votive offerings to all the gods who can she thinks assist her and promises of still greater in case they should grant what she wants smaller promises being found of no avail she at last promises her firstborn if a male to the god of destruction mahādēo if she gets a son she conceals from him her vows till he has attained the age of puberty she then communicates it sic to him and enjoins him to fulfil it he believes it to be his paramount duty to obey his mothers call and from that moment he considers himself as devoted to the god without breathing to any living soul a syllable of what she has told him he puts on the habit of a pilgrim or religious mendicant visits all the celebrated temples dedicated to this god in different parts of india and at the annual fair on the mahādēo hills throws himself from a perpendicular height of four or five hundred feet and is dashed to pieces upon the rocks below if the youth does not feel himself quite prepared for the sacrifice on the first visit he spends another year in pilgrimages and returns to fulfil his mothers vow at the next fair some havei believe been known to postpone the sacrifice to a third fair but the interval is always spent in painful pilgrimages to the celebrated temples of the god when sir r jenkins was the governorgenerals representative at the court of nāgpur great efforts were made by him and all the european officers under him to put a stop to these horrors by doing away with the fair and their efforts were assisted by the cholera morbus which broke out among the multitude one season while they were so employed and carried off the greater part of them this seasonable visitation was i believe considered as an intimation on the part of the god that the people ought to have been more attentive to the wishes of the white men for it so happens that mahādēo is the only one of the hindoo gods who is represented with a white face he figures among the dramatis personae of the great pantomime of the rāmlīlā or fight for the recovery of sitā from the demon king of ceylon and is the only one with a white face i know not whether the fair has ever been revived but i think not in the wheat and other spring crops in this and the surrounding villages were destroyed by a severe hailstorm in they were deficient from the want of seasonable rains and in they were destroyed by blight during these three years the teorī or what in other parts of india is called kesārī the lathyrus sativus of botanists a kind of wild vetch which though not sown itself is left carelessly to grow among the wheat and other grain and given in the green and dry state to cattle remained uninjured and thrived with great luxuriance in they reaped a rich crop of it from the blighted wheatfields and subsisted upon its grain during that and the following years giving the stalks and leaves only to their cattle in the sad effects of this food began to manifest themselves the younger part of the population of this and the surrounding villages from the age of thirty downwards began to be deprived of the use of their limbs below the waist by paralytic strokes in all cases sudden but in some cases more severe than in others about half the youth of this village of both sexes became affected during the years and and many of them have lost the use of their lower limbs entirely and are unable to move the youth of the surrounding villages in which the teorī from the same causes formed the chief article of food during the years and have suffered to an equal degree since the year no new case has occurred but no person once attacked had been found to recover the use of the limbs affected and my tent was surrounded by great numbers of the youth in different stages of the disease imploring my advice and assistance under this dreadful visitation some of them were very finelooking young men of good caste and respectable families and all stated that their pains and infirmities were confined entirely to the parts below the waist they described the attack as coming on suddenly often while the person was asleep and without any warning symptoms whatever and stated that a greater portion of the young men were attacked than of the young women it is the prevailing opinion of the natives throughout the country that both horses and bullocks which have been much fed upon teorī are liable to lose the use of their limbs but if the poisonous qualities abound more in the grain than in the stalk or leaves man who eats nothing but the grain must be more liable to suffer from the use of this food than beasts which eat it merely as they eat grass or hay i sent the son of the head man of the village and another who were among the young people least affected into sāgar with a letter to my friend dr foley with a request that he would try what he could do for them and if he had any fair prospect of being able to restore these people to the use of their limbs that measures might be adopted through the civil authorities to provide them with accommodation and the means of subsistence either by private subscription or by application to government the civil authorities however could find neither accommodation nor funds to maintain these people while under dr foleys care and several seasons of calamity had deprived them of the means of maintaining themselves at a distance from their families nor is a medical man in india provided with the means found most effectual in removing such affections such as baths galvanic batteries c it is lamentable to think how very little we have as yet done for the country in the healing art that art which above all others a benevolent and enlightened government should encourage among the people of india all we have as yet done has been to provide medical attendants for our european officers regiments and jails it must not however be supposed that the people of india are without medical advice for there is not a town or considerable village in india without its practitioners the hindoos following the egyptian misrānī and the musalmāns the grecian yunānī practice the first prescribe little physic and much fasting and the second follow the good old rules of hippocrates galen and avicenna with which they are all tolerably well acquainted as far as the office of physician goes the natives of india of all classes high and low have much more confidence in their own practitioners than in ours whom they consider too reckless and better adapted to treat diseases in a cold than a hot climate they cannot afford to give the only fees which european physicians would accept and they see them in their hospital practice trust much to their native assistants who are very few of them able to read any book much less to study the profound doctrines of the great masters of the science of medicine no native ventures to offer an opinion upon this abstruse subject in any circle where he is not known to be profoundly read in either arabic or sanskrit lore nor would he venture to give a prescription without first consulting spectacles on nose a book as large as a church bible the educated class as indeed all classes say that they do not want our physicians but stand much in need of our surgeons here they feel that they are helpless and we are strong and they seek our aid whenever they see any chance of obtaining it as in the present case considering that every european gentleman they meet is more or less a surgeon or hoping to find him so people who are afflicted or have children afflicted with any kind of malformation or malorganization flock round them sic wherever they go and implore their aid but implore in vain for when they do happen to fall in with a surgeon he is a mere passerby without the means or the time to afford relief in travelling over india there is nothing whichdistresses a benevolent man so much as the necessity he is daily under of telling poor parents who with aching hearts and tearful eyes approach him with their suffering children in their arms that to relieve them requires time and means which are not at a travellers command or a species of knowledge which he does not possess it is bitter thus to dash to the ground the cup of hope which our approach has raised to the lip of mother father and child but he consoles himself with the prospect that at no distant period a benevolent and enlightened government will distribute over the land those from whom the afflicted will not seek relief in vain notes the garrison is stated in the gazetteer to consist of a european regiment of infantry two batteries of european artillery one native cavalry and one native

yunānī physicians approve of bleeding and prefer vegetable drugs the older writers on india fancied that the hindoo system of medicine was of enormous antiquity and that the principles of galenical medical science were ultimately derived from india modern investigation has proved that hindoo medicine like hindoo astronomy is largely of greek origin this conclusion has been expressed in an exaggerated form by some writers but its general truth appears to be established the hindoo books treating of medicine are certainly older than wilson supposed for the bower manuscript written in the second half of the fourth century of our era contains three sanskrit medical treatises the writers had however plenty of time to borrow from galen who lived in the second century the indian aversion

down to twentysix degrees of fahrenheits thermometer the village stands upon a gentle swelling hill of decomposed basalt and is surrounded by hills of the same formation the dasān river flows close under the village and has two beautiful reaches one above the other below separated by the dyke of basalt over which lies the ford of the river there are beautiful reaches of the kind in all the rivers in this part of india and they are almost everywhere formed in the same manner at bahrol there is a very unusual number of tombs built over the ashes of women who have burnt themselves with the remains of their husbands upon each tomb stands erect a tablet of freestone with the sun the new moon and a rose engraved upon it in basrelief in one field and the man and woman hand in hand in the other on one stone of this kind i saw a third field below these two with the figure of a horse in basrelief and i asked one of the gentlemen farmers who was riding with me what it meant he told me that he thought it indicated that the woman rode on horseback to bathe before she ascended the pile i asked him whether he thought the measure prohibiting the practice of burning good or bad it is said he in some respects good and in others bad widows cannot marry among us and those who had no prospect of a comfortable provision among their husbands relations or who dreaded the possibility of going astray and thereby sinking into contempt and misery were enabled in this way to relieve their minds and follow their husbands under the full assurance of being happily united to them in the next world when i passed this place on horseback with lord william bentinck he asked me what these tombs were for he had never seen any of the kind before when i told him what they were he said not a word but he must have felt a proud consciousness of the debt of gratitude which india owes to the statesman who had the courage to put a stop to this great evil in spite of all the fearful obstacles which bigotry and prejudice opposed to the measure the seven european functionaries in charge of the seven districts of the newlyacquired territories were requested during the administration of lord amherst in to state whether the burning of widows could or should be prohibited and i believe every one of them declared that it should not and yet when it was put a stop to only a few years after by lord william not a complaint or murmur was heard the replies to the governorgenerals inquiries were i believe throughout india for the most part opposed to the measure on the th we came to dhamonī ten miles the only thing remarkable here is the magnificent fortress which is built upon a small projection of the vindhya range looking down on each side into two enormously deep glens through which the two branches of the dasān river descend over the tableland into the plains of bundēlkhand the rays of the sun seldom penetrate to the bottom of these glens and things are in consequence grown there that could not be grown in parts more exposed every inch of the level ground in the bed of the streams below seems to be cultivated with care this fortress is said to have cost more than a million of money and to have been only one of fiftytwo great works of which a former rājā of bundēlkhand bīrsingh deo laid the foundation in the same happy hour which had been pointed out to him by his astrologers the works form an acute triangle with the base towards the tableland and the two sides hanging perpendicularly over the glens while the apex points to the course of the streams as they again unite and pass out through a deep chasm into the plains of bundēlkhand the fortress is now entirely deserted and the town which the garrison supported is occupied by only a small policeguard stationed here to see that robbers do not take up their abode among the ruins there is no fear of this all old deserted fortresses in india become filled by a dense stream of carbonic acid gas which is found so inimical to animal life that those who attempt to occupy them become ill and sooner or later almost all die of the consequences this gas being specifically much heavier than common air descends into the bottom of such unoccupied fortresses and remains stagnant like water in old reservoirs the current of pure air continually passes over without being able to carry off the mass of stagnant air below and the only way to render such places habitable is to make large openings in the walls on all sides from the top to the bottom so that the foul air may be driven out by the current of pure atmospheric air which will then be continually rushing in when these fortresses are thickly peopled the continual motion within tends i think to mix up this gas with the air above while the numerous fires lighted within by rarefying that below tend to draw down a regular supply of the atmospheric air from above for the benefit of the inhabitants when natives enter upon the occupation of an old fortress of this kind that has remained long unoccupied they always make a solemn religionsceremony of it and having fed the priests the troops and a crowd of followers all rush in at once with beat of drums and as much noise as they can make by this rush and the fires that follow the bad air is perhaps driven off and never suffered to collect again while the fortress remains fully occupied whatever may be the cause the fact is certain that these fortresses become deadly places of abode for small detachments of troops or small parties of any kind they all get ill and few recover from the diseases they contract in them from the year when we first took possession of the sāgar and nerbudda territories almost all the detachments of troops we required to keep at a distance from the headquarters of their regiments were posted in these old deserted fortifications our collections of revenue were deposited in them and in some cases they were converted into jails for the accommodation of our prisoners of the soldiers so lodged i do not believe that one in four ever came out well and of those who came out ill i do not believe that one in four survived five years they were all abandoned one after the other but it is painful to think how many hundreds i may say thousands of our brave soldiers were sacrificed before this resolution was taken i have known the whole of the survivors of strong detachments that went in in robust health three months before brought away mere skeletons and in a hopeless and dying state all were sent to their homes on medical certificate but they almost all died there or in the course of their journey notes december the name of the village is spelled behrole by the author the dasān river rises in the bhopāl state flows through the

translated by a s beveridge calcutta vol ii pp orchhā is described post chapters chapter basaltic cappingsinterview with a native chiefa singular character on the th we came to the village of seorī soon after leaving dhamonī we descended the northern face of the vindhya range into the plains of bundēlkhand the face of this range overlooking the valley of the nerbudda to the south is as i have before stated a series of mural precipices like so many rounded bastions the slight dip of the strata being to the north the northern face towards bundēlkhand on the contrary here descends gradually as the strata dip slightly towards the north and we pass down gently over their back the strata have however been a good deal broken and the road was so rugged that two of our carts broke down in descending from the descent over the northern face of the tableland into bundēlkhand to the descent over the southern face into the valley of the nerbudda must be a distance of one hundred miles directly north and south the descent over the northern face is not everywhere so gradual on the contrary there are but few places where it is at all feasible and some of the rivers of the tableland between jubbulpore and mirzapore have a perpendicular fall of more than four hundred feet over these mural precipices of the northern face of the vindhya range a man if he have good nerve may hang over the summits and suspend in his hand a plummet that shall reach the bottom i should mention that this tableland is not only intersected by ranges but everywhere studded with isolated hills rising suddenly out of basins or valleys these ranges and isolated hills are all of the same sandstone formation and capped with basalt more or less amygdaloidal the valleys and cappings have often a substratum of very compact basalt which must evidently have flowed into them after these islands were formed the question is how were these valleys and basins scooped out time time time says mr scrope grant me only time and i can account for everything i think however that i am right in considering the basaltic cappings of these ranges and isolated hills to have once formed part of continued flat beds of great lakes the flat parallel planes of these cappings corresponding with each other however distantly separated the hills they cover may be would seem to indicate that they could not all have been subject to the convulsions of nature by which the whole substrata were upheaved above the ocean i am disposed to think that such islands and ranges of the sandstone were formed before the deposit of the basalt and that the form of the surface is now returning to what it then was by the gradual decomposition and wearing away of the latter rock much however may be said on both sides of this as of every other question after descending from the sandstone of the vindhya range into bundēlkhand we pass over basalt and basaltic soil reposing immediately on syenitic granite with here and there beds and veins of pure feldspar hornblende and quartz takht singh the younger brother of arjun singh the rājā of shāhgarh came out several miles to meet me on his elephant finding me on horseback he got off from his elephant and mounted his horse and we rode on till we met the rājā himself about a mile from our tents he was on horseback with a large and splendidly dressed train of followers all mounted on fine sleek horses bred in the rājās own stables he was mounted on a snowwhite steed of his own breeding and i have rarely seen a finer animal and dressed in a light suit of silver brocade made to represent the scales of steel armour surmounted by a gold turban takht singh was more plainly dressed but is a much finer and more intelligentlooking man having escorted us to our tents they took their leave and returned to their own which were pitched on a rising ground on the other side of a small stream half a mile distant takht singh resides here in a very pretty fortified castle on an eminence it is a square building with a round bastion at each corner and one on each face rising into towers above the walls a little after midday the rājā and his brother came to pay us a visit and about four oclock i went to return it accompanied by lieutenant thomas as usual he had a nautch dance upon carpets spread upon the sward under awnings in front of the pavilion in which we were received while the women were dancing and singing a very fine panther was brought in to be shown to us he had been caught fullgrown two years before and in the hands of a skilful man was fit for the chase in six months it was a very beautiful animal but for the sake of the sport kept wretchedly thin he seemed especially indifferent to the crowd and the music but could not bear to see the woman whirling about in the dance with her red mantle floating in the breeze and whenever his head was turned towards her he cropped his ears she at last in play swept close by him and with open mouth he attempted to spring upon her but was pulled back by the keeper she gave a shriek and nearly fell upon her back in fright the rājā is a man of no parts or character and his expenditure being beyond his income he is killing his goose for the sake of her eggsthat is he is ruining all the farmers and cultivators of his large estate by exactions and thereby throwing immense tracts of fine land out of tillage he was the heir to the fortress and territory of garhā kotā near sāgar which was taken by sindhias army under the command of jean baptiste filose just before our conquest in i was then with my regiment which was commanded by colonel afterwards majorgeneral g a very singularcharacter when our surgeon dr e received the newspaper announcing the capture of garhā kotā in central india by jeanbaptiste an officer of the corps was with him who called on the colonel on his way home and mentioned this as a bit of news as soon as this officer had left him the colonel wrote off a note to the doctor my dear doctori understand that that fellow john the baptist has got into sindhias service and now commands an armydo send me the newspapers these were certainly the words of his note and at the only time i heard him speak on the subject of religion he discomfited his adversary in an argument at the mess by why sir you do not suppose that i believe in those fellows luther calvin and john the baptist do you nothing could stand this argument all the party burst into a laugh which the old gentleman took for an unequivocal recognition of his victory and his adversary was silenced he was an old man when i first became acquainted with him i put into his hands when in camp miss edgeworths novels in the hope of being able to induce him to read by degrees and i have frequently seen the tears stealing down over his furrowed cheeks as he sat pondering over her pages in the corner of his tent a braver soldier never lived than old g and he distinguished himself greatly in the command of his regiment under lord lake at the battle of laswāri and siege of bharatpur it was impossible ever to persuade him that the characters and incidents of these novels were the mere creations of fancyhe felt them to be truehe wished them to be true and he would have them to be true we were not very anxious to undeceive him as the illusion gave him pleasure and did him good bolingbroke says after an ancient author history is philosophy teaching by example with equal truth may we say that fiction like that of maria edgeworth is philosophy teaching by emotion it certainly taught old g to be a

journals ed the authors theory is untenable he failed to realize the vast effects of subaerial denudation all the evidence shows that the successive lava outflows which make up the deccan trap series ultimately converted the surface of the land over which they welled out into an enormous nearly uniform plain of basalt resting on the vindhyan sandstone and other rocks this great sheet of lava extending east and west from nāgpur to bombay a distance of about five hundred miles was then in succeeding millenniums subjected to the denuding forces of air and water until gradually huge tracts of it were worn away forming beds of conglomerate gravel and clay the flattopped hills have been carved out of the basaltic surface by the agencies which wore away the massive sheet of lava the basaltic

miles over an undulating country with a fine soil of decomposed basalt reposing upon syenite with veins of feldspar and quartz cultivation partial and very bad and population extremely scanty we passed close to a village in which the children were all at play while upon the bushes over their heads were suspended an immense number of the beautiful nests of the sagacious bayā bird or indian yellowhammer all within reach of a grownup boy and one so near the road that a grownup man might actually look into it as he passed along and could hardly help shaking it it cannot fail to strike a european as singular to see so many birds nests situated close to a village remain unmolested within reach of so many boisterous children with their little proprietors and families fluttering and chirping among them with as great a feeling of security and gaiety of heart as the children themselves enjoy in any part of europe not a nest of such a colony could have lived an hour within reach of such a population for the bayā bird has no peculiar respect paid to it by the people here like the wren and robinredbreast in england no boy in india has the slightest wish to molest birds in their nests it enters not into their pastimes and they have no feeling of pride or pleasure in it with us it is differentto discover birds nests is one of the first modes in which a boy exercises his powers and displays his love of art upon his skill in finding them he is willing to rest his first claim to superior sagacity and enterprise his trophies are his string of eggs and the eggs most prized among them are those of the nests that are discovered with most difficulty and attained with most danger the same feeling of desire to display their skill and enterprise in search after birds nests in early life renders the youth of england the enemy almost of the whole animal creation throughout their after career the boy prides himself on his dexterity in throwing a stone or a stick and he practises on almost every animal that comes in his way till he never sees one without the desire to knock it down or at least to hit it and if it is lawful to do so he feels it to be a most serious misfortune not to have a stone within his reach at the time as he grows up he prides himself upon his dexterity in shooting and he never sees a member of the feathered tribe within shot without a desire to shoot it or without regretting that he has not a gun in his hand to shoot it that he is not entirely destitute of sympathy however with the animals he maims for his amusement is sufficiently manifest from his anxiety to put them out of pain the moment he gets them a friend of mine now no more captain medwin was once looking with me at a beautiful landscape painting through a glass at last he put aside the glass saying you may say what you like s but the best landscape i know is a fine black partridge falling before my joe manton the following lines of walter scott in his rokeby have always struck me as very beautifulas yet the conscious pride of art had steeld him in his treacherous part a powerful spring of force unguessed that hath each gentler mood suppressed and reigned in many a human breast from his that plans the rude campaign to his that wastes the woodland reign c among the people of india it is very different children do not learn to exercise their powers either in discovering and robbing the nests of birds or in knocking them down with stones and staves and as they grow up they hardly ever think of hunting or shooting for mere amusement it is with them a matter of business the animal they cannot eat they seldom think of molesting some officers were one day pursuing a jackal with a pack of dogs through my grounds the animal passed close to one of my guard who cut him in two with his sword and held up the reeking blade in triumph to the indignant cavalcade who when they came up were ready to eat him alive what have i done said the poor man to offend you have you not killed the jackal shouted the whipperin in a fury of course i have but were you not all trying to kill him replied the poor man he thought their only object had been to kill the jackal as they would have killed a serpent merely because he was a mischievous and noisy beast the european traveller in india is often in doubt whether the peacocks partridges and ducks which he finds round populous villages are tame or wild till he asks some of the villagers themselves so assured of safety do these creatures become and so willing to take advantage of it for the food they find in the suburbs they very soon find the differencehowever between the whitefaced visitor and the darkfaced inhabitants there is a fine datetree overhanging a kind of school at the end of one of the streets in the town of jubbulpore quite covered with the nests of the bayā birds and they are seen every day and all day fluttering and chirping about there in scores while the noisy children at their play fill the street below almost within arms length of them i have often thought that such a tree so peopled at the door of a school in england might work a great revolution in the early habits and propensities of the youth educated in it the european traveller is often amused to see the pariah dog squatted close in front of the traveller during the whole time he is occupied in cooking and eating his dinner under a tree by the roadside assured that he shall have at least a part of the last cake thrown to him by the stranger instead of a stick or a stone the stranger regards him with complacency as one that reposes a quiet confidence in his charitable disposition and flings towards him the whole or part of his last cake as if his meal had put him in the best possible humour with him and all the world

shells are imbedded in the mountains of the himalaya the spiti valley contains an immense deposit of fossil ammonites and belemnites in limestone rocks now elevated above sixteen thousand feet above the level of the sea and from such beds as these are brought down the fragments which when rounded in their course the poor hindoo takes for representatives of vishnu the preserving god of the hindoo

the war against nepāl captain b who commanded a reconnoitring party from the division in which i served one day brought back to camp some four or five sālagrāms which he had found at the hut of some priest within the enemys frontier he called for a large stone and hammer and proceeded to examine them the hindoos were all in a dreadful state of consternation and expected to see the earth open and swallow up the whole camp while he sat calmly cracking their gods with his hammer as he would have cracked so many walnuts the tulasī is a small sacred shrub ocymum sanctum which is a metamorphosis of sītā the wife of rāma the seventh incarnation of vishnu this little pebble is every year married to this little shrub and the high priest told me that on the present occasion the procession consisted

held sāgar for the payment of the public establishments kept up by the local administration it yielded him about ten thousand a year and when we took possession of the country he got an estate in the sāgar district in rentfree tenure estimated at fifteen hundred a year this is equal to about six thousand pounds a year in england the tastes of native gentlemen lead them always to expend the greater part of their incomes in the wages of trains of followers of all descriptions and in horses elephants c and labour and the subsistence of labour are about four times cheaper in india than in england by the breaking up of public establishments and consequent diminution of the local demand for agricultural produce the value of land throughout all central india after the termination of the mahrātha war in fell by degrees thirty per cent and among the rest that of my poor friend the sarīmant while i had the civil charge of the sāgar district in i represented this case of hardship and government in the spirit of liberality which has generally characterized their measures in this part of india made up to him the difference between what he actually received and what they had intended to give him and he has ever since felt grateful to me he is a very small man not more than five feet high but he has the handsomest face i have almost ever seen and his manners are those of the most perfect native gentleman he came to call upon me after breakfast and the conversation turned upon the number of people that had of late been killed by tigers between sāgar and deorī his ancient capital which lies about midway between sāgar and the nerbudda river one of his followers who stood beside his chair said that when a tiger had killed one man he was safe for the spirit of the man rode upon his head and guided him from all danger the spirit knew very well that the tiger would be watched for many days at the place where he had committed the homicide and always guided him off to some other more secure place when he killed other men without any risk to himself he did not exactly know why the spirit of the man should thus befriend the beast that had killed him but added he there is a mischief inherent in spirits and the better the man the more mischievous is his ghost if means are not taken to put him to rest this is the popular and general belief throughout india and it is supposed that the only sure mode of destroying a tiger who has killed many people is to begin by making offerings to the spirits of his victims and thereby depriving him of their valuable services the belief that men are turned into tigers by eating of a root is no less general throughout india the sarīmant on being asked by me what he thought of the matter observed there was no doubt much truth in what the man said but he was himself of opinion that the tigers which now infest the wood from sāgar to deorī were of a different kindin fact that they were neither more nor less than men turned into tigersa thing which took place in the woods of central india much more often than people were aware of the only visible difference between the two added the sarīmant is that the metamorphosed tiger has no tail while the bora or ordinary tiger has a very long one in the jungle about deorī continued he there is a root which if a man eat of he is converted into a tiger on the spot and if in this state he can eat of another he becomes a man againa melancholy instance of the former of which said he occurred i am told in my own fathers family when i was an infant his washerman raghu was like all washermen a great drunkard and being seized with a violent desire to ascertain what a man felt in the state of a tiger he went one day to the jungle and brought home two of these roots and desired his wife to stand by with one of them and the instant she saw him assume the tiger shape to thrust it into his mouth she consented the washerman ate his root and became instantly a tiger but his wife was so terrified at the sight of her husband in this shape that she ran off with the antidote in her hand poor old raghu took to the woods and there ate a good many of his old friends from neighbouring villages but he was at last shot and recognized from the circumstance of his having no tail you may be quite sure concluded sarīmant when you hear of a tiger without a tail that it is some unfortunate man who has eaten of that root and of all the tigers he will be found the most mischievous how my friend had satisfied himself of the truth of this story i know not but he religiously believes it and so do all his attendants and mine and out of a population of thirty thousand people in the town of sāgar not one would doubt the story of the washerman if he heard it i was one day talking with my friend the rājā of maihar on the road between jubbulpore and mirzapore on the subject of the number of men who had been lately killed by tigers at the katrā pass on that road and the best means of removing the danger nothing said the rājā could be more easy or more cheap than the destruction of these tigers if they were of the ordinary sort but the tigers that kill men by wholesale as these do are you may be sure men themselves converted into tigers by the force of their science and such animals are of all the most unmanageableand how is it rājā sāhib that these men convert themselves into tigers nothing said he is more easy than this to persons who have once acquired the science but how they learn it or what it is we unlettered men know not there was once a high priest of a large temple in this very valley of maihar who was in the habit of getting himself converted into a tiger by the force of this science which he had thoroughly acquired he had a necklace which one of his disciples used to throw over his neck the moment the tigers form became fully developed he had however long given up the practice and all his old disciples had gone off on their pilgrimages to distant shrines when he was one day seized with a violent desire to take his old form of the tiger he expressed the wish to one of his new disciples and demanded whether he thought he might rely on his courage to stand by and put on the necklace assuredly you may said the disciple such is my faith in you and in the god we serve that i fear nothing the high priest upon this put the necklace into his hand with the requisite instructions and forthwith began to change his form the disciple stood trembling in every limb till he heard him give a roar that shook the whole edifice when he fell flat upon his face and dropped the necklace on the floor the tiger bounded over him and out of the door and infested all the roads leading to the temple for many years afterwards do you think rājā sahib that the old high priest is one of the tigers at the katrā pass no i do not but i think they may be all men who have become imbued with a little too much of the high priests sciencewhen men once acquire this science they cant help exercising it though it be to their own ruin and that of others but supposing them to be ordinary tigers what is the simple plan you propose to put a stop to their depredations rājā sahib i propose said he to have the spirits that guide them propitiated by proper prayers and offerings for the spirit of every man or woman who has been killed by a tiger rides upon his head or runs before him and tells him where to go to get prey and to avoid danger get some of the gonds or wild people from the jungles who are well skilled in these matters give them ten or twenty rupees and bid them go and raise a small shrine and there sacrifice to these spirits the gonds will tell them that they shall on this shrine have regular worship and good sacrifices of fowls goats and pigs every year at least if they will but relinquish their offices with the tigers and be quiet if this is done i pledge myself said the raja that the tigers will soon get killed themselves or cease from killing men if they do not you may be quite sure that they are not ordinary tigers but men turned into tigers or that the gonds have appropriated all you gave them to their own use

allahabad on the road from that city to rīwā these myths are based on the wellknown facts that maneating tigers are few and exceptionally wary and cunning the conditions which predispose a tiger to maneating have been much discussed it seems to be established that the animals which seek human prey are generally though not invariably those which owing to old wounds or other physical defects are unable to attack with confidence the stronger animals the conversations given in the text are excellent illustrations of the mode of formation of modern myths and of the kind of reasoning which satisfies the mind of the unconscious mythmaker the text may be compared with the following passage from the journey through the kingdom of oudh vol i p i asked him the rājā of balrāmpur whether the people in the tarāi forest were still afraid to point out tigers to sportsmen i was lately out with a party after a tiger he said which had killed a cowherd but his companions refused to point out any trace of him saying that their relatives spirit must be now riding upon his head to guide him from all danger and we should have no chance of shooting him we did shoot him however said the rājā exultingly and they were all afterwards very glad of it the tigers in the tarāi do not often kill men sir for they find plenty of deer and cattle to eat chapter burning of deorī by a freebootera suttee sarīmant had been one of the few who escaped from the flames which consumed his capital of deorī in the month of april and were supposed to have destroyed thirty thousand souls i asked him to tell me how this happened and he referred me to his attendant a learned old pundit rām chand who stood by his side as he was himself he said then only five years of age and could recollect nothing of it mardān singh said the pundit the father of rājā arpan singh whom you saw at seorī was then our neighbour reigning over garhā kotā and he had a worthless nephew zālim singh who had collected together an army of five thousand men in the hope of getting a little principality for himself in the general scramble for dominion incident on the rise of the pindhārīs and amīr khan and the destruction of all balance of power among the great sovereigns of central india he came to attack our capital which was an emporium of considerable trade and the seat of many useful manufactures in the expectation of being able to squeeze out of us a good sum to aid him in his enterprise while his troops blocked up every gate fire was by accident set to the fence of some mans garden within there had been no rain for six months and everything was so much dried up that the flames spread rapidly and though there was no wind when they began it soon blew a gale the sarīmant was then a little boy with his mother in the fortress where she lived with his father and nine other relations the flames soon extended to the fortress and the powdermagazine blew up the house in which they lived was burned down and every soul except the lieutenant sic himself perished in it his mother tried to bear him off in her arms but fell down in her struggle to get out with him and died his nurse tulsī kurmin snatched him up and ran with him outside of the fortress to the bank of the river where she made him over unhurt to harirām the mārwārī merchant he was mounted on a good horse and making off across the river he carried him safely to his friends at gaurjhāmar but poor tulsī the kurmin fell down exhausted when she saw her charge safe and died the wind appeared to blow in upon the poor devoted city from every side and the troops of zālim singh who at first prevented the people from rushing out at the gates made off in a panic at the horrors before them all our establishments had been driven into the city at the approach of zālim singhs troops and scores of elephants hundreds of camels and thousands of horses and ponies perished in the flames besides twentyfive thousand souls only about five thousand persons escaped out of thirty thousand and these were reduced to beggary and wretchedness by the loss of their dearest relations and their property at the time the flames first began to spread an immense crowd of people had assembled under the fortress on the bank of the sonār river to see the widow of a soldier burn herself her husband had been shot by one of zālim singhs soldiers in the morning and before midday she was by the side of his body on the funeral pile people as usual begged her to tell them what would happen and she replied the city will know in less than four hours in less than four hours the whole city had been reduced to ashes and we all concluded that since the event was so clearly foretold it must have been decreed by god no doubt it was said sarīmant how could it otherwise happen do not all events depend upon his will had it not been his will to save me how could poor tulsī the kurmin have carried me upon her shoulders through such a scene as this when every other member of our family perished no doubt said rām chand all these things are brought about by the will of god and it is not for us to ask why i have heard this event described by many other people and i believe the account of the old pundit to be a very fair one one day in october the horse of the district surgeon doctor spry as he was mounting him reared fell back with his head upon a stone and died upon the spot the doctor was not much hurt and the little sarīmant called a few days after and offered his congratulations upon his narrow escape the cause of so quiet a horse rearing at this time when he had never been known to do so before was discussed and he said that there could be no doubt that the horse or the doctor himself must have seen some unlucky face before he mounted that morningthat he had been in many places in his life but in none where a man was liable to see so many ugly or unfortunate faces and for his part he never left his house till an hour after sunrise lest he should encounter them many natives were present and every one seemed to consider the sarīmants explanation of the cause quite satisfactory and philosophical some days after spry was going down to sleep in the bungalow where the accident happened his native assistant and all his servants came and prayed that he would not attempt to sleep in the bungalow as they were sure the horse must have been frightened by a ghost and quoted several instances of ghosts appearing to people there he however slept in the bungalow and to their great astonishment saw no

detritus of the syenitic rock and poor both from its quality and want of depth about three miles from our last territory we entered the boundary of the orchhā rājās territory at the village of aslōn which has a very pretty little fortified castle built upon ground slightly elevated in the midst of an open grass plain this and all the villages we have lately passed are built upon the bare back of the syenitic rock which seems to rise to the surface in large but gentle swells like the broad waves of the ocean in a calm after a storm a great difference appeared to me to be observable between the minds and manners of the people among whom we were now travelling and those of the people of the sāgar and nerbudda territories they seemed here to want the urbanity and intelligence we find among our subjects in the latter quarters the apparent stupidity of the people when questioned upon points the most interesting to them regarding their history their agriculture their tanks and temples was most provoking and their manners seemed to me more rude and clownish than those of people in any other part of india i had travelled over i asked my little friend the sarīmant who rode with me what he thought of this i think said he that it arises from the harsh character of the government under which they live it makes every man wish to appear a fool in order that he may be thought a beggar and not worth the plundering it strikes me my friend sarīmant that their government has made them in reality the beggars and the fools that they appear to be god only knows said sarīmant certain it is that they are neither in mind nor in manners what the people of our districts are the rājā had no notice of our approach till intimation of it reached him at ludhaura the day before we came in he was there resting and dismissing the people after the ceremonies of the marriage between the salagrām and the tulasī ludhaura is twentyseven miles northwest of tehrī on the opposite side from that on which i was approaching he sent off two men on camels with a kharītā letter requesting that i would let him know my movements and arrange a meeting in a manner that might prevent his appearing wanting in respect and hospitality that is in plain terms which he was too polite to use that i would consent to remain one stage from his capital till he could return and meet me halfway with all due pomp and ceremony these men reached me at bamhaurī a distance of thirtynine miles in the evening and i sent back a kharītā which reached him by relays of camels before midnight he set out for his capital to receive me and as i would not wait to be met halfway in due form he reached his palace and we reached our tents at the same time under a salute from his two brass fieldpieces we halted at tehrī on the th and about eleven oclock the rājā came to pay his visit of congratulation with a magnificent cortège of elephants camels and horses all mounted and splendidly caparisoned and the noise of his band was deafening i had had both my tents pitched and one of them handsomely fitted up as it always is for occasions of ceremony like the present he came to within twenty paces of the door on his elephant and from its back as it sat down he entered his splendid litter without alighting on the ground in this vehicle he was brought to my tent door where i received him and after the usual embraces conducted him up through two rows of chairs placed for his followers of distinction and my own who are always anxious to assist in ceremonies like these at the head of this lane we sat upon chairs placed across and facing down the middle of the two rows and we conversed upon all the subjects usually introduced on such occasions but more especially upon the august ceremonies of the marriage of the salagrām with the tulasī in which his highness had been so piously engaged at ludhaura after he had sat with me an hour and a half he took his leave and i conducted him to the door whence he was carried to his elephant in his litter from which he mounted without touching the ground this litter is called a nālkī it is one of the three great insignia which the mogul emperors of delhi conferred upon independent princes of the first class and could never be used by any person upon whom or upon whose ancestors they had not been so conferred these were the nālkī the order of the fish and the fan of the peacocks feathers these insignia could be used only by the prince who inherited the sovereignty of the one on whom they had been originally conferred the order of the fish or mahī marātib was first instituted by khusrū parvīz king of persia and grandson of the celebrated naushīrvān the just having been deposed by his general bahrām khusrū fled forprotection to the greek emperor maurice whose daughter shīrīn he married and he was sent back to persia with an army under the command of narses who placed him on the throne of his ancestors in the year ad he ascertained from his astrologer araz khushasp that when he ascended the throne the moon was in the constellation of the fish and he gave orders to have two balls made of polished steel which were to be called kaukabas planets and mounted on long poles these two planets with large fish made of gold upon a third pole in the centre were ordered to be carried in all regal processions immediately after the king and before the prime minister whose cortège always followed immediately after that of the king the two kaūkabas are now generally made of copper and plated and in the shape of a jar instead of quite round as at first but the fish is still made of gold two planets are always considered necessary to one fish and they are still carried in all processions between the prince and his prime minister the court of this prince khusrū pārvīz was celebrated throughout the east for its splendour and magnificence and the chaste love of the poet farhad for his beautiful queen shīrīn is the theme of almost as many poems in the east as that of petrarchs for laura is in the west nūh samānī who ascended the throne of persia after the sassanians ascertained that the moon was in the sign leo at the time of his accession and ordered that the gold head of a lion should thenceforward accompany the fishes and the two balls in all royal processions the persian order of knighthood is therefore that of the fish the moon and the lion and not the lion and sun as generally supposed the emperors of the house of taimūr in hindustan assumed the right of conferring the order upon all whom they pleased and they conferred it upon the great territorial sovereigns of the country without distinction as to religion he only who inherits the sovereignty can wear the order and i believe no prince would venture to wear or carry the order who was not generally reputed to have received the investiture from one of the emperors of delhi as i could not wait another day it was determined that i should return his visit in the afternoon and about four oclock we set out upon our elephantlieutenant thomas sarīmant and myself attended by all my troopers and those of sarīmant we had our silverstick men with us but still all made a sorry figure compared with the splendid cortège of the rājā we dismounted at the foot of the stairs leading to the rājās hall of audience and were there met by his two chief officers of state who conducted us to the entrance of the hall when we were received by the rājā himself who led us up through two rows of chairs laid out exactly as mine had been in the morning in front were assembled a party of native comedians who exhibited a few scenes of the insolence of office in the attendants of great men and the obtrusive importunity of placeseekers in a manner that pleased us much more than a dance would have done conversation was kept up very well and the visit passed off without any feeling of ennui or anything whatever to recollect with regret the ladies looked at us from their apartments through gratings and without our being able to see them very distinctly we were anxious to see the tombs of the late rājā the elder brother of the present who lately died and that of his son which are in progress in a very fine garden outside the city walls and in consequence we did not sit above half an hour the rājā conducted us to the head of the stairs and the same two officers attended us to the bottom and mounted their horses and attended us to the tombs after the dust of the town raised by the immense crowd that attended us and the ceremonies of the day a walk in this beautiful garden was very agreeable and i prolonged it till dark the rājā had given orders to have all the cisterns filled during our stay under the impression that we should wish to see the garden and as soon as we entered the jets deau poured into the air their little floods from a hundred mouths our old cicerone told us that if we would take the old capital of orchhā in our way we might there see the thing in perfection and amidst the deluges of the rains of sāwān and bhādon july and august see the lightning and hear the thunder the rājās of this the oldest principality in bundēlkhand were all formerly buried or burned at the old capital of orchhā even after they had changed their residence to tehrī these tombs over the ashes of the rājā his wife and son are the first

which the life of divine kings or priests is regulated the first is that the divine personage maynot touch the ground with his foot this prohibition applies to the mikado of japan and many other sacred personages the second rule is that the sun may not shine upon the sacred person this second rule explains the use of the umbrella as a royal appendage in india and burma frazer the golden bough

resumed the reins of government and held them till his death he was a man of considerable capacity but of a harsh and unscrupulous character his son resembled him but the present rājā is a man of mild temper and disposition though of weak intellect the fate of the last three prime ministers will show the character of the rājā and his son and the nature of their rule the minister at the time the old man made over the reins of government to his son was khānjū purōhit wishing to get rid of him a few years after this son rājā bahādur employed muhram singh one of his feudal rājpūt barons to assassinate him as a reward for this service he received the seals of office and the rājā confiscated all the property of the deceased amounting to four lakhs of rupees and resumed the whole of the estates held by the family the young rājā died soon after and his father when he resumed the reins of government wishing to remove the new minister got him assassinated by gambhīr singh another feudal rājpūt baron who as his reward received in his turn the seals of office this man was a most atrocious villain and employed the public establishments of his chief to plunder travellers on the high road in his followers robbed four men who were carrying treasure to the amount of ten thousand rupees from sāgar to jhānsī through tehrī and intended to murder them but by the sagacity of one of the party and a lucky accident they escaped made their way back to sāgar and complained to the magistrate the minister discovered the nature of their burdens as they lodged at tehrī on their way and sent after them a party of soldiers with orders to put them in the bed of a rivulet that separated the territory of orchhā from that of the jhānsī rājā one of the treasure party discovered their object and on reaching the bank of the rivulet in a deep grass jungle he threw down his bundle dashed unperceived through the grass and reached a party of travellers whom he saw ascending a hill about half a mile in advance the myrmidons of the minister when they found that one had escaped were afraid to murder the others but took their treasure in spite of great obstacles and with much danger to the families of three of those men who resided in the capital of tehrī the magistrate of sāgar brought the crime home to the minister and the rājā anxious to avail himself of the occasion to fill his coffers got him assassinated the rājā was then about eighty years of age and his minister was a strong athletic and brave man one morning while he was sitting with him in private conversation the former pretended a wish to drink some of the water in which his household god had been washed the chandan mirt and begged the minister to go and fetch it from the place where it stood by the side of the idol in the court of the palace as a man cannot take his sword before the idol the minister put it down as the rājā knew he would and going to the idol prostrated himself before it preparatory to taking away the water in that state he was cut down by bihārī another feudal rājpūt baron who aspired to the seals and some of his friends who had been placed there on purpose by the rājā he obtained the seals by his service and as he was allowed to place one brother in command of the forces and to make another chamberlain he hoped to retain them longer than any of his predecessors had done gambhīr singhs brother jhujhār singh and the husband of his sister hearing of his murder made off but were soon pursued and put to death the widows were all three put into prison and all the property and estates were confiscated the movable property amounted to three lakhs of rupees the rājā boasted to the governorgenerals representative in bundēlkhand of this act of retributive justice and pretended that it was executed merely as a punishment for the robbery but it was with infinite difficulty the merchants could recover from him any share of the plundered property out of that confiscated the rājā alleged that according to our rules the chief within whose boundary the robbery might have been committed was obliged to make good the property on inspection it was found that the robbery was perpetrated upon the very boundary line and in spite of pride in erring reasons spite the jhānsī rājā was made to pay onehalf of the plundered treasure the old rājā bikramājīt died in june and though his death had been some time expected he no sooner breathed his last than charges of dīnaī slow poison were got up as usual in the zenana seraglio here the widow of rājā bahādur a violent and sanguinary woman was supreme and she persuaded the present rājā a weak old man to take advantage of the funeral ceremonies to avenge the death of his brother he did so and bihārī and his three brothers with above fifty of his relations were murdered the widows of the four brothers were the only members of all the families left alive one of them had a son four months old another one of two years the four brothers had no other children immediately after the death of their husbands the two children were snatched from their mothers breasts and threatened with instant death unless their mothers pointed out all their ornaments and other property they did so and the spoilers having got from them property to the amount of one hundred and fifty thousand rupees and been assured that there was no more threw the children over the high wall by which they were dashed to pieces the poorwidows were tendered as wives to four sweepers the lowest of all low castes but the tribe of sweepers would not suffer any of its members to take the widows of men of such high caste and station as wives notwithstanding the tempting offer of five hundred rupees as a present and a village in rentfree tenure i secured a promise while at tehrī that these poor widows should be provided for as they had up to that time been preserved by the good feeling of a little community of the lowest of castes on whom they had been

days the most useless of the people of india the devotee followers bairāgīs of the god vishnu and tend to no purpose either useful or ornamental to the state or to the people this marriage of a stone to a shrub which takes place every year is supposed to cost the rājā at the most moderate estimate three lakhs of rupees a year or onefourth of his annual revenue the highest officers of which his government is composed receive small beggarly salaries hardly more than sufficient for their subsistence and the money they make by indirect means they dare not spend like gentlemen lest the rājā might be tempted to take their lives in order to get hold of it all his feudal barons are of the same tribe as himself that is rājpūts but they are divided into three clansbundēlas pawārs and chandēls a bundēla cannot marry a woman of his own clan he must take a wife from the pawārs or chandēls and so of the other two clansno member of one can take a wife from his own clan but must go to one of the other two for her they are very much disposed to fight with each other but not less are they disposed to unite against any third party not of the same tribe braver men do not i believe exist than the rājpūts of bundēlkhand who all carry their swords from their infancy it may be said of the rājpūts of mālwa and central india generally that the mogul emperors of delhi made the same use of them that the emperors of germany and the popes made of the military chiefs and classes of europe during the middle ages industry and the peaceful arts being reduced to agriculture alone under bad government or no government at all the land remained the only thing worth appropriating and it accordingly became appropriated by those alone who had the power to do soby the hindoo military classes collected around the heads of their clans and powerful in their union these held it under the paramount power on the feudal tenure of military service as militia or it was appropriated by the paramount power itself who let it out on allodial tenure to peaceful peasantry the one was the zamīndārī and the other the mālguzārī tenure of india the military chiefs essentially either soldiers or robbers were continually fighting either against each other or against the peasantry or public officers of the paramount power like the barons of europe and that paramount power or its delegates often found that the easiest way to crush one of these refractory vassals was to put him as such men had been put in germany to the ban of the empire and offer his lands his castles and his wealth to the victor this victor brought his own clansmen to occupy the lands and castles of the vanquished and as these were the only things thought worth living for the change commonly involved the utter destruction of the former occupants the new possessors gave the name of their leader their clan or their former place of abode to their new possession and the tract of country over which they spread thus were founded the bundēlas pawārs and chandēls sic upon the ruin of the chandēls of bundēlkhand the baghēlas in baghēlkhand or rīwā the kachhwāhās the sakarwārs and others along the chambal river and throughout all parts of india these classes have never learnt anything or considered anything worth learning but the use of the sword and a rājpūt chief next to leading a gang of his own on great enterprises delights in nothing so much as having a gang or two under his patronage for little ones there is hardly a single chief of the hindoo military class in the bundēlkhand or gwālior territories who does not keep a gang of robbers of some kind or other and consider it as a very valuable and legitimate source of revenue or who would not embrace with cordiality the leader of a gang of assassins by profession who should bring him home from every expedition a good horse a good sword or a valuable pair of shawls taken from their victims it is much the same in the kingdom of oudh where the lands are for the most part held by the same hindoo military classes who are in a continual state of war with each other or with the government authorities threefourths of the recruits for native infantry regiments are from this class of military agriculturists of oudh who have been trained up in this school of contest and many of the lads when they enter our ranks are found to have marks of the cold steel upon their persons a braver set of men is hardly anywhere to be found or one trained up with finer feelings of devotion towards the power whose salt they eat a good many of the other fourth of the recruits for our native infantry are drawn from among the ujainī rājpūts or rājpūts from ujain who were established many generations ago in the same manner at bhōjpur on the bank of the

central provinces and partly in native states it is bounded on the north by the jumna on the north and west by the chambal river on the south by the central provinces and on the south and east by rīwā

high but is now of little political importance see nwp gazetteer st ed vol vii p the paramount power often assigned a portion of its reserved lands in jāgīr to public officers for the establishments they required for the performance of the duties military or civil which were expected from them other portions were assigned in rentfree tenure for services already performed or to favourites but in both cases the rights of the village or land owner or allodial proprietors were supposed to be unaffected as the government was presumed to assign only its own claim to a certain portion as revenue w h s the term ryotwar raiyatwār is commonly used to designate the system under which the cultivators hold their lands direct from the state the subject of tenures is further discussed by the author in chapters for elaborate comparisons between the rājpūt policy and the feudal system of europe tods rajasthān may be consulted the parallel is not really so close as it appears to be at first sight in some respects the organization of the highland clans is more similar to that of the rājpūts than the feudal system is the chambal river rises in mālwā and after a course of some five hundred and seventy miles falls into the jumna forty miles below etāwa the statement in the text concerning the succession of clans is confused the ruling family of rīwā still belongs to the baghēl clan the maharājā of jaipur jeypore is a kachhwāha the barbarous habit of alliance and connivance with robber gangs is by no means confined to rājpūt nobles and landholders men of all creeds and castes yield to the temptation and magistrates are sometimes startled to find that honorary magistrates members of district boards and others of apparently the highest respectability are the abettors and secret organizers of robber bands a modern example of this fact was discovered in the meerut and muzaffarnagar districts of the united provinces in and in this case the wealthy supporters of the banditti were jāts and muhammadans the unfortunate condition of oudh previous to the annexation in is vividly described in the authors journey through the kingdom of oude published in the tour took place in

india near tehrī we saw the people irrigating a field of wheat from a tank by means of a canoe in a mode quite new to me the surface of the water was about three feet below that of the field to be watered the inner end of the canoe was open and placed to the mouth of a gutter leading into the wheatfield the outer end was closed and suspended by a rope to the outer end of a pole which was again suspended to crossbars on the inner end of this pole was fixed a weight of stones sufficient to raise the canoe when filled with water and at the outer end stood five men who pulled down and sank the canoe into the water as often as it was raised by the stones and emptied into the gutter the canoe was more curved at the outer end than ordinary canoes are and seemed to have been made for the purpose the lands round the town generally were watered by the persian wheel but where it scil the water is near the surface this scil the canoe arrangement i should think a better method on the th we came on to the village of bilgaī twelve miles over a bad soil badly cultivated the hard syenitic rock rising either above or near to the surface all the wayin some places abruptly in small hills decomposing into large rounded bouldersin others slightly and gently like the backs of whales in the oceanin others the whole surface of the country resembled very much the face of the sea not after but really in a storm full of waves of all sizes contending with each other in most admired disorder after the dust of tehrī and the fatiguing ceremonies of its court the quiet morning i spent in this secluded spot under the shade of some beautiful trees with the surviving canary singing my boy playing and my wife sleeping off the fatigues of her journey was to me most delightful henry was extremely ill when we left jubbulpore but the change of air and all the other changes incident to a march have restored him to health during the scarcity of two hundred people died of starvation in this village alone and were all thrown into one large well which has of course ever since remained closed autumn crops chiefly are cultivated and they depend entirely on the sky for water while the poor people of the village depend upon the returns of a single season for subsistence during the whole year they lingered on in the hope of aid from above till the greater part had become too weak from want of food to emigrate the rājā gave half a crown to every family but this served merely to kindle their hopes of more and to prolong their misery till the people have a better government they can never be secure from frequent returns of similar calamities such security must depend upon a greater variety of crops and better means of irrigation better roads to bring supplies over from distant parts which have not suffered from the same calamities and greater means in reserve of paying for such supplies when broughtthings that can never be hoped for under a government like this which allows no man the free enjoyment of property close to the village a large wall has been made to unite two small hills and form a small lake but the wall is formed of the rounded boulders of the syenitic rock without cement and does not retain the water the land which was to have formed the bed of the lake is all in tillage and i had some conversation with the man who cultivated it he told me that the wall had been built with the money of sin and not the money of piety pāp kē paisā sē na pun kē paisā sē banā that the man who built it must have laid out his money with a worldly and not a religious mind nīyat that on such occasions men generally assembled brahmans and other deserving people and fed and clothed them and thereby consecrated a great work and made it acceptable to god and he had heard from his ancestors that the man who had built this wall had failed to do this that the construction could never of course answer the purpose for which it was intendedand that the builders name had actually been forgotten and the work did him no good either in this world or the next this village which a year or two ago was large and populous is now reduced to two wretched huts inhabited by two very miserable families bundēlkhand suffers more often and more severely from the want of seasonable showers of rain than any other part of india while the province of mālwa which adjoins it on the west and south hardly ever suffers at all there is a couplet which like all other good couplets on rural subjects is attributed to sahdēo sahadeva one of the five demigod brothers of the mahābhārata to this effect if you hear not the thunder on such a night you father go to mālwa i to gujarātthat is there will be no rain and we must seek subsistence where rains never fail and the harvests are secure the province of mālwa is well studded with hills and groves of fine trees which intercept the clouds as they are wafted by the prevailing westerly winds from the gulf of cambay to the valley of the ganges and make them drop their contents upon a soil of great natural powers formed chiefly from the detritus of the decomposing basaltic rocks which cap and intersect these hills during the famine of as on all similar occasions grain of every kind attracted by high prices flowed up in largestreams from this favoured province towards bundēlkhand and the population of bundēlkhand as usual in such times of dearth and scarcity flowed off towards mālwa against the stream of supply under the assurance that the nearer they got to the source the greater would be their chance of employment and subsistence every village had its numbers of the dead and the dying and the roads were all strewed with them but they were mostly concentrated upon the great towns and civil and military stations where subscriptions were opened for their support by both the european and native communities the funds arising from these subscriptions lasted till the rains had set fairly in when all ablebodied persons could easily find employment in tillage among the agricultural communities of villages around after the rains have fairly set in the sick and helpless only should be kept concentrated upon large towns and stations where little or no employment is to be found for the oldest and youngest of those who are able to work can then easily find employment in weeding the cotton rice sugarcane and other fields under autumn crops and in preparing the lands for the reception of the wheat gram and other spring seeds and get advances from the farmers agricultural capitalists and other members of the village communities who are all glad to share their superfluities with the distressed and to pay liberally for the little service they are able to give in return it is very unwise to give from such funds what may be considered a full rate of subsistence to ablebodied persons as it tends to keep concentrated upon such points vast numbers who would otherwise be scattered over the surface of the country among the village communities who would be glad to advance them stock and the means of subsistence upon the pledge of their future services when the season of tillage commences the rate of subsistence should always be something less than what the ablebodied person usually consumes and can get for his labour in the field for the sick and feeble this rate will be enough and the healthy and ablebodied with unimpaired appetites will seek a greater rate by the offer of their services among the farmers and cultivators of the surrounding country by this precaution the mass of suffering will be gradually diffused over the country so as best to receive what the country can afford to give for its relief as soon as the rains set in all the ablebodied men women and children should be sent off with each a good blanket and a rupee or two as the funds can afford to last them till they can engage themselves with the farmers not a farthing after that day should be given out except to the feeble and sick who may be considered as hospital patients at large places where the greater numbers are concentrated the scene becomes exceedingly distressing for in spite of the best dispositions and greatest efforts on the part of government and its officers and the european and native communities thousands commonly die of starvation at sāgar mothers as they lay in the streets unable to walk were seen holding up their infants and imploring the passing stranger to take them in slavery that they might at least live hundreds were seen creeping into gardens courtyards and old ruins concealing themselves under shrubs grass mats or straw where they might die quietly without having their bodies torn by birds and beasts before the breath had left them respectable families who left home in search of the favoured land of mālwa while yet a little property remained finding all exhausted took opium rather than beg and husband wife and children died in each others arms still more of such families lingered on in hope till all had been expended then shut their doors took poison and died all together rather than expose their misery and submit to the degradation of begging all these things i have myself known and seen and in the midst of these and a hundred other harrowing scenes which present themselves on such occasions the european cannot fail to remark the patient resignation with which the poor people submit to their fate and the absence of almost all those revolting acts which have characterized the famines of which he has read in other countries such as the living feeding on the dead and mothers devouring their own children no such things are witnessed in indian famines here all who suffer attribute the disaster to its real cause the want of rain in due season and indulge in no feelings of hatred against their rulers superiors or more fortunate equals in society who happen to live beyond the range of such calamities they gratefully receive the superfluities which the more favoured are always found ready to share with the afflicted in india and though their sufferings often subdue the strongest of all pride the pride of caste they rarely ever drive the people to acts of violence the stream of emigration guided as it always is by that of the agricultural produce flowing in from the more favoured countries must necessarily concentrate upon the communities along the line it takes a greater number of people than they have the means of relieving however benevolent their dispositions and i must say that i have never either seen or read of a nobler spirit than seems to animate all classes of these communities in india on such distressing occasions in such seasons of distress we often in india hear of very injudicious interference with grain dealers on the part of civil and military authorities who contrive to persuade themselves that the interest of these corndealers instead of being in accordance with the interests of the people are entirely opposed to them and conclude that whenever grain becomes dear they have a right to make them open their granaries and sell their grain at such price as they in their wisdom may deem reasonable if they cannot make them do this by persuasion fine or imprisonment they cause their pits to be opened by their own soldiers or native officers and the grain to be sold at an arbitrary price if in a hundred pits thus opened they find one in which the corn happens to be damaged by damp they come to the sage conclusion that the proprietors must be what they have all along supposed them to be and treated as suchthe common enemies of mankindwho blind alike to their own interests and those of the people purchase up the superabundance of seasons of plenty not to sell it again in seasons of scarcity but to destroy it and that the whole of the grain in the other ninetynine pits but for their timely interference must have inevitably shared the same fate during the season here mentioned grain had become very dear at sāgar from the unusual demand in bundēlkhand andother districts to the north as usual supplies of land produce flowed up from the nerbudda districts along the great roads to the east and west of the city but the military authorities in the cantonments would not be persuaded out of their dread of a famine there were three regiments of infantry a corps of cavalry and two companies of artillery cantoned at that time at sāgar they were a mile from the city and the grain for their supply was exempted from town duties to which that for the city was liable the people in cantonments got their supply in consequence a good deal cheaper than the people in the city got theirs and none but persons belonging bona fide to the cantonments were ever allowed to purchase grain within them when the dread of famine began the commissariat officer major gregory apprehended that he might not be permitted to have recourse to the markets of the city in times of scarcity since the people of the city had not been suffered to have recourse to those of the cantonments in times of plenty but he was told by the magistrate to purchase as much as he liked since he considered every man as free to sell his grain as his cloth or pots and pans to whom he chose he added that he did not share in the fears of the military authoritiesthat he had no apprehension whatever of a famine or when prices rose high enough they would be sure to divert away into the city from the streams then flowing up from the valley of the nerbudda and the districts of mālwa towards bundēlkhand a supply of grain sufficient for all this new demand upon the city increased rapidly the price of grain and augmented the alarm of the people who began to urge the magistrate to listen to their prayers and coerce the sordid corndealers who had no doubt numerous pits yet unopened the alarm became still greater in the cantonments where the commanding officer attributed all the evil to the inefficiency of the commissariat and the villany of the corndealers and major gregory was in dread of being torn to pieces by the soldiery only one days supply was left in the cantonment bazaarsthe troops had become clamorous almost to a state of mutinythe people of the town began to rush in upon every supply that was offered for sale and those who had grain to dispose of could no longer venture to expose it the magistrate was hard pressed on all sides to have recourse to the old salutary method of searching for and forcibly opening the grain pits and selling the contents at such price as might appear reasonable the kotwāl of the town declared that the lives of his police would be no longer safe unless this great and neverfailing remedy which had now unhappily been too long deferred were immediately adopted the magistrate who had already taken every other means of declaring his resolution never to suffer any mans granary to be forcibly opened now issued a formal proclamation pledging himself to see that such granaries should be as much respected as any other property in the citythat every man might keep his grain and expose it for sale wherever and whenever he pleased and expressing a hope that as the people knew him too well not to feel assured that his word thus solemnly pledged would never be broken he trusted they would sell what stores they had and apply themselves without apprehension to the collecting of more this proclamation he showed to major gregory assuring him that no degree of distress or clamour among the people of the city or the cantonments should ever make him violate the pledge therein given to the corndealers and that he was prepared to risk his situation and reputation as a public officer upon the result after issuing this proclamation about noon he had his police establishments augmented and so placed and employed as to give to the people entire confidence in the assurances conveyed in it the graindealers no longer apprehensive of danger opened their pits of grain and sent off all their available means to bring in more in the morning the bazaars were all supplied and every man who had money could buy as much as he pleased the troops got as much as they required from the city major gregory was astonished and delighted the colonel a fine old soldier from the banks of the indus who had commanded a corps of horse under the former government came to the magistrate in amazement every shop had become full of grain as if by supernatural agency kāle ādmī kī akl kahān talak chalēgī said he how little could a black mans wisdom serve him in such an emergency there was little wisdom in all this but there was a firm reliance upon the truth of the general principle which should guide all public officers on such occasions the magistrate judged that there were a great many pits of grain in the town known only to their own proprietors who were afraid to open them or get more grain while there was a chance of the civil authorities yielding to the clamours of the people and the anxiety of the officers commanding the troops and that he had only to remove these fears by offering a solemn pledge and manifesting the means and the will to abide by it in order to induce the proprietors not only to sell what they had but to apply all their means to the collecting of more but it is a singular fact that almost all the officers of the cantonments thought the conduct of the magistrate in refusing to have the grain pits opened under such pressing circumstances extremely reprehensible had he done so he might have given the people of the city and the cantonments the supply at hand but the injury done to the corndealers by so very unwise a measure would have recoiled upon the public since every one would have been discouraged from exerting himself to renew the supply and from laying up stores to meet similar necessities in future by acting as he did he not only secured for the public the best exertions of all the existing corndealers of the place but actually converted for the time a great many to that trade from other employments or from idleness a great many families who had never traded before employed their means in bringing a supply of grain and converted their dwellings into corn shops induced by the high profits and assurance of protection during the time when he was most pressed themagistrate received a letter from captain robinson who was in charge of the bazaars at elichpur in the hyderabad territory where the dearth had become even more felt than at sāgar requesting to know what measures had been adopted to regulate the price and secure the supply of grain for the city and cantonments at sāgar since no good seemed to result from those hitherto pursued at elichpur he told him in reply that these things had hitherto been regulated at sāgar as he thought they ought to be regulated everywhere else by being left entirely to the discretion of the corndealers themselves whose selfinterest will always prompt them to have a sufficient supply as long as they may feel secure of being permitted to do what they please with what they collect the commanding officer in his anxiety to secure food for the people had hitherto been continually interfering to coerce sales and regulate prices and continually aggravating the evils of the dearth by so doing on the receipt of the sāgar magistrates letter a different course was adopted the same assurances were given to the corndealers the same ability and inclination to enforce them manifested and the same result followed the people and the troops were steadily supplied and all were astonished that so very simple a remedy had not before been thought of the ignorance of the first principles of political economy among european gentlemen of otherwise firstrate education and abilities in india is quite lamentable for there are really few public officers even in the army who are not occasionally liable to be placed in the situations where they may by false measures arising out of such ignorance aggravate the evils of dearth among great bodies of their fellow men a soldier may however find some excuse for such ignorance because a knowledge of these principles is not generally considered to form any indispensable part of a soldiers education but no excuse can be admitted for a civil functionary who is so ignorant since a thorough acquaintance with the principles of political economy must be and indeed always is considered as an essential branch of that knowledge which is to fit him for public employment in india in india unfavourable seasons produce much more disastrous consequences than in europe in england not more than onefourth of the population derive their incomes from the cultivation of the lands around them threefourths of the people have incomes independent of the annual returns from those lands and with these incomes they can purchase agricultural produce from other lands when the crops upon them fail the farmers who form so large a portion of the fourth class have stock equal in value to four times the amount of the annual rent of their lands they have also a great variety of crops and it is very rare that more than one or two of them fail or are considerably affected the same season if they fail in one district or province the deficiency is very easily supplied to a people who have equivalents to give for the produce of another the sea navigable rivers fine roads all are open and ready at all times for the transport of the superabundance of one quarter to supply the deficiencies of another in india the reverse of all this is unhappily to be found more than threefourths of the whole population are engaged in the cultivation of the land and depend upon its annual returns for subsistence the farmers and cultivators have none of their stock equal in value to more than half the amount of the annual rent of their lands they have a great variety of crops but all are exposed to the same accidents and commonly fail at the same time the autumn crops are sown in june and july and ripen in october and november and if seasonable showers do not fall during july august and september all fail the spring crops are sown in october and november and ripen in march and if seasonable showers do not happen to fall during december or january all save what are artificially irrigated fail if they fail in one district or province the people have few equivalents to offer for a supply of land produce from any other their roads are scarcely anywhere passable for wheeled carriages at any season and nowhere at all seasonsthey have nowhere a navigable canal and only in one line a navigable river their land produce is conveyed upon the backs of bullocks that move at the rate of six or eight miles a day and add one hundred per cent to the cost of every hundred miles they carry it in the best seasons and more than two hundred in the worst what in europe is felt merely as a dearth becomes in india under all these disadvantages a scarcity and what is there a scarcity becomes here a famine tens of thousands die here of starvation under calamities of season which in europe would involve little of suffering to any class here man does everything and he must have his daily food or starve in england machinery does more than threefourths of the collective work of society in the production preparation and distribution of mans physical enjoyments and it stands in no need of this daily food to sustain its powers they are independent of the seasons the water fire air and other elemental powers which they require to render them subservient to our use are always available in abundance this machinery is the great assistant of the present generation provided for us by the wisdom and industry of the past wanting no food itself it can always provide its proprietors with the means of purchasing what they require from other countries when the harvests of their own fail when calamities of season deprive men of employment for a time in tillage they can in england commonly find it in other branches of industry because agricultural industry forms so small a portion of the collective industry of the nation and because every man can without prejudice to his status in society take to what branch of industry he pleases but when these calamities of season throw men out of employment in tillage for a time in india they cannot find it in any other branch because agricultural industry forms so very large a portion of the collective industry of every part of the country and because men are often prevented by the prejudices of caste from taking to that which they can find in societies constituted like that of india the trade of the corndealer is more essentially necessary for the welfare of thecommunity than in any other for it is among them that the superabundance of seasons of plenty requires most to be stored up for seasons of scarcity and if public functionaries will take upon themselves to seize such stores and sell them at their own arbitrary prices whenever prices happen to rise beyond the rate which they in their shortsighted wisdom think just no corndealer will ever collect such stores hitherto whenever grain has become dear at any military or civil station we have seen the civil functionaries urged to prohibit its egressto search for the hidden stores and to coerce the proprietors to the sale in all manner of ways and if they do not yield to the ignorant clamour they are set down as indifferent to the sufferings of their fellow creatures around them and as blindly supporting the worst enemies of mankind in the worst species of iniquity if those who urge them to such measures are asked whether silversmiths or linendrapers who should be treated in the same manner as they wish the corndealers to be treated would ever collect and keep stores of plate and cloth for their use they readily answerno they see at once the evil effects of interfering with the free disposal of the property of the one but are totally blind to that which must as surely follow any interference with that of the other whose entire freedom is of so much more vital importance to the public there was a time and that not very remote when grave historians like smollett could even in england fan the flame of this vulgar prejudice against one of the most useful classes of society that day is thank god past and no man can now venture to write such trash in his history or even utter it in any wellinformed circle of english society and if any man were to broach such a subject in an english house of commons he would be considered as a fit subject for a madhouse but some who retain their prejudices against corndealers and are yet ashamed to acknowledge their ignorance of the first principles of political economy try to persuade themselves and their friends that however applicable these may be to the state of society in european or christian countries they are not so to countries occupied by hindoos and muhammadans this is a sad delusion and may be a very mischievous one when indulged by

glossary of angloindian words sv agricultural capitalist is a rather large phrase for the humble village moneylender whose transactions are usually on a very small scale the authors advice on the subject of famine relief is weighty and perfectly sound it is in accordance with the policy formulated by the government of india in the famine relief code based on the report of the famine commission which followed the terrible madras famine of this statement is too general examples of the horror alluded to are recorded in several indian famines cases of cannibalism occurred during the madras famine of but it is true that horrors of the kind are rare in india and the authors praise of the patient resignation of the people is fully justified an admirable summary of the history of indian famines will be found in the articles famines and food in balfour cyclopaedia rd ed for further and more recent information see ig vol iii chap no european officer military or civil could now venture to adopt such arbitrary measures in a native state they might very probably be enforced the magistrate was the author himself the chief police officer of a town in the modern reorganized system he

made over in lord dalhousies time to british administration in order to defray the cost of the armed force called the hyderabad contingent since berār has ceased to be a separate province it is now merely a division attached to the central provinces from the same date the hyderabad contingent lost its separate existence being redistributed and merged in the indian army political economy was for many years a compulsory subject for the selected candidates for the civil service of india but since its study has been optional the census of shows that about per cent of the inhabiting india excluding burma are supported by the cultivation of the soil and the care of cattle the proportion varies widely in different provinces this proposition does not apply fully to northern india at the present day the amount of capital invested is small although not quite so small as is stated in the text the times of harvest vary slightly with the latitude being later towards the north the coldweather rains of december and january are variable and uncertain and rarely last more than a few days the spring crops depend largely on the heavy dews which occur daring the cold season daring the years which have elapsed since the famine of great changes have taken place in india and many of the authors remarks are only partially applicable to the present time the great canals above all the wonderful ganges canal have protected immense areas of northern india from the possibility of absolute famine and southern india has also been to a considerable though less extent protected by similar works a few new staples of which potatoes are the most important have been introduced the whole system of distribution has been revolutionized by the development of railways metalled roads wheeled vehicles motors telegraphs and navigable canals carriage on the backs of animals whether bullocks camels or donkeys now plays a very subordinate part in the distribution of agricultural produce prices are in great measure dependent on the rates prevailing in liverpool odessa and chicago food grains now stand ordinarily at prices which in the authors time would have been reckoned famine rates the changes which have taken place in england are too familiar to need comment since the authors time certain industries the most important being cottonpressing cottonspinning and jutespinning have sprung up and assumed in bombay calcutta cawnpore and a few other places proportions which absolutely are large but india is so vast that these local developments of manufactures large though they are seem to be as nothing when regarded in comparison with the country as a whole india is still and to all appearance always must be essentially an agricultural country the authors teaching concerning freedom of trade in times of famine and the function of dealers in corn is as sound as his doctrine of famine relief the vulgar prejudice which he denounces still flourishes and the sad delusion which he deplores still obscures the truth as each period of scarcity or famine comes round the old cries are again heard and the executive authorities are implored and adjured to forbid export to fix fair prices and to clip the profits of the corn merchant during the bengal famine of the demand for the prohibition of the export of rice was urged by men who should have known better and lord northbrook is entitled to no small credit for having firmly withstood the clamour the more recent experiences of the russian government should be remembered when the clamour is again raised as it will be the principles on which the author acted in the crisis at sāgar in should guide every magistrate who finds himself in a similar position and should be applied with unhesitating firmness and decision chapter epidemic diseasesscapegoat in the evening after my conversation with the cultivator upon the wall that united the two hills i received a visit from my little friend the sarīmant his fine rosecoloured turban is always put on very gracefully every hair of his jetblack eyebrows and mustachios seems to be kept always most religiously in the same place and he has always the same charming smile upon his little face which was never i believe distorted into an absolute laugh or frown no man was ever more perfectly master of what the natives call the art of rising or sitting nishisht wa barkhāst namely good manners i should as soon expect to see him set the nerbudda on fire as commit any infringement of the convenances on this head established in good indian society or be guilty of anything vulgar in speech sentiment or manners i asked him by what means it was that the old queen of sāgar drove out the influenza that afflicted the people so much in while he was there on a visit to me he told me that he took no part in the ceremonies nor was he aware of them till awoke one night by the noise when his attendants informed him that the queen and the greater part of the city were making offerings to the new god hardaul lāla he found next morning that a goat had been offered up with as much noise as possible and with good effect for the disease was found to give way from that moment about six years before when great numbers were dying in his own little capital of pithoria from a similar epidemic he had he said tried the same thing with still greater effect but on that occasion he had the aid of a man very learned in such matters this man caused a small carriage to be made up after a plan of his own for a pair of scapegoats which were harnessed to it and driven during the ceremonies to a wood some distance from the town where they were let loose from that hour the disease entirely ceased in the town the goats never returned had they come back said sarīmant the disease must have come back with them so he took them a long way into the woodindeed he believed the man to make sure of them had afterwards caused them to be offered up as a sacrifice to the shrine of hardaul lāla in that very wood he had himself never seen a pūjā religious ceremony so entirely and immediately efficacious as this and much of its success was no doubt attributable to the science of the man who planned the carriage and himself drove the pair of goats to the wood no one had ever before heard of the plan of a pair of scapegoats being driven in a carriage but it was likely he thought to be extensively adopted in future sarīmants man of affairs mentioned that when lord hastings took the field against the pindhārīs in and the division of the grand army under his command was encamped near the grove in bundēlkhand where repose the ashes of hardaul lāla under a small shrine a cow was taken into this grove to be converted into beef for the use of the europeans the priest in attendance remonstrated but in vainthe cow was killed and eaten the priest complained and from that day the cholera morbus broke out in the camp and from this central point it was he said generally understood to have spread all over india the story of the cow travelled at the same time and the spirit of hardaul lāla was everywhere supposed to be riding in the whirlwind and directing the storm temples were everywhere erected and offerings made to appease him and in six years after he had himself seen them as far as lahore and in almost every village throughout the whole course of his journey to that distant capital and back he is one of the most sensible and freely spoken men that i have met with up to within the last few years added he the spirit of hardaul lāla had been propitiated only in cases of cholera morbus but now he is supposed to preside over all kinds of epidemic diseases and offerings have everywhere been made to his shrine during late influenzas this of course arises i observed from the industry of his priests who are now spread all over the country and you know that there is hardly a village or hamlet in which there are not some of them to be found subsisting upon the fears of the people i have no doubt replied he that the cures which the people attribute to the spirit of hardaul lāla often arise merely from the firmness of their faith itikād in the efficacy of their offerings and that any other ceremonies that should give to their minds the same assurance of recovery would be of great advantage in cases of epidemic diseases i remember a singular instance of this said he when jeswant rāo holkar was flying before lord lake to the banks of the hyphasis a poor trooper of one of his lordships irregular corps when he tied the grainbag to his horses mouth said take this in the name of jeswant rāo holkar for to him you and i owe all that we have the poor man had been suffering from an attack of ague and fever but from that moment he felt himself relieved and the fever never returned at that time this fever prevailed more generally among the people of hindustan than any i have ever known though i am now an old man the speech of the trooper and the supposed result soon spread and others tried the experiment with similar success and it acted everywhere like a charm i had the fever myself and though by no means a superstitious man and certainly no lover of jeswant rāo holkar i tried the experiment and the fever left me from that day from that time till the epidemic disappeared no man from the nerbudda to the indus fed his horse without invoking the spirit of jeswant rāo though the chief was then alive and well some one had said he found great relief from plunging into the stream during the paroxysms of the fever others followed the example and some remained for half an hour at a timeand the sufferers generally found relief the streams and tanks throughout the districts between the ganges and jumna became crowded till the propitiatory offering to the spirit of the living jeswant rāo holkar were sic found equally good and far less troublesome to those who had horses that must have got their grain whether in holkars name or not there is no doubt that the great mass of those who had nothing but their horses and their good blades to depend upon for their subsistence did most fervently pray throughout india for the safety of this marāthā chief when he fled before lord lakes army for they considered that with his fall the companys dominion would become everywhere securely established and that good soldiers would be at a discount company kē amal men kuchh rozgār nahin hai there is no employment in the companys dominion is a common maxim not only among the men of the sword and the spear but among those merchants who lived by supporting native civil and military establishments with the luxuries and elegancies which under the new order of things they have no longer the means to enjoy the noisy pūjā worship about which our conversation began took place at sāgar in april while i was at that station more than fourfifths of the people of the city and cantonments had been affected by a violent influenza which commenced with a distressing cough was followed by fever and in some cases terminated in death i had an application from the old queen dowager of sāgar who received a pension of ten thousand pounds a year from the british government and resided in the city to allow of a noisy religious procession to implore deliverance from this great calamity men women and children in this procession were to do their utmost to add to the noise by raising their voices in psalmody beating upon their brass pots and pans with all their might and discharging firearms where they could get them and before the noisy crowd was to be driven a buffalo which had been purchased by a general subscription in order that every family might participate in the merit they were to follow it out for eight miles where it was to be turned loose for any man who would take it if the animal returned the disease it was said must return with it and the ceremony be performed over again i was requested to intimate the circumstance to the officer commanding the troops in cantonments in order that the hideous noise they intended to make might not excite any alarm and bring down upon them the visit of the soldiery it was however subsequently determined that the animal should be a goat and he was driven before the crowd accordingly i have on several occasions been requested to allow of such noisy pūjās in cases of epidemics and the confidence they feel in their efficiency has no doubt a good effect while in civil charge of the district of narsinghpur in the valley of the nerbudda in april the cholera morbus raged in almost every house of narsinghpur and kandelī situated near each otherl and one of them close to my dwellinghouse and court the european physicians lost all confidence in their prescriptions and the people declared that the hand of god was upon them and by appeasing him could they alone hope to be saved a religious procession was determined upon but the population of both towns was divided upon the point whether a silent or a noisy one would be most acceptable to god hundreds were dying around me when i was applied to to settle this knotty point between the parties i found that both in point of numbers and respectability the majority was in favour of the silent procession and i recommended that this should be adopted the procession took place about nine the same night with all due ceremony but the advocates for noise would none of them assist in it strange as it may appear the disease abated from that moment and the great majority of the population of both towns believed that their prayers had been heard and i went to bed with a mind somewhat relieved by the hope that this feeling of confidence might be useful about one oclock i was awoke from a sound sleep by the most hideous noise that i had ever heard and not at that moment recollecting the proposal for the noisy procession ran out of my house in expectation of seeing both towns in flames i found that the advocates for noise resolving to have their procession had assembled together about midnight and apprehensive that they might be borne down by the advocates for silence and my police establishment had determined to make the most of their time and put in requisition all the pots pans shells trumpets pistols and muskets that they could muster all opened at once about one oclock and had there been any virtue in discord the cholera must soon have deserted the place for such another hideous compound of noises i never heard the disease which seemed to have subsided with the silent procession before i went to bed now returned with double violence as i was assured by numbers who flocked to my house in terror and the whole population became exasperated with the leaders of the noisy faction who had they believed been the means of bringing back among them all the horrors of this dreadful scourge i asked the hindoo sadar amīn or head native judicial officer at sāgar a very profound sanskrit scholar what he thought of the efficacy of these processions in checking epidemic diseases he said that there could be nothing more clear than the total inefficiency of medicine in such cases and when medicine failed a mans only resource was in prayers that the diseases of mankind were to be classed under three general heads first those suffered for sins committed in some former births second those suffered for sins committed in the present birth third those merely accidental now said the old gentleman it must be clear to every unprejudiced mind that the third only can be cured or checked by the physician epidemics he thought must all be classed under the second head and as inflicted by the deity for some very general sin consequently to be removed only by prayers and whether silent or noisy was he thought matter of little importance provided they were offered in the same spirit i believe that among the great mass of the people of india threefourths of the diseases of individuals are attributed to evil spirits and evil eyes and for every physician among them there are certainly ten exorcisers the faith in them is very great and very general and as the gift is supposed to be supernatural it is commonly exercised without fee or reward the gifted person subsists upon some other employment and exorcises gratisa child of one of our servants was one day in convulsions from its sufferings in cutting its teeth the civil surgeon happened to call that morning and he offered to lance the childs gums the poor mother thanked him but stated that there could be no possible doubt as to the source of her childs sufferingsthat the devil had got into it during the night and would certainly not be frightened out by his little lancet but she expected every moment my old tentpitcher whose exorcisms no devil of this description had ever yet been able to withstand the smallpox had been raging in the town of jubbulpore for some time during one hot season that i was there and a great many children had died from it the severity of the disease was considered to have been a good deal augmented by a very untoward circumstance that had taken place in the family of the principal banker of the town khushhāl chand sēwā rām sēth the old man had lately died leaving two sons ram kishan the eldest and khushhāl chand the second the eldest gave up all the management of the sublunary concerns of the family and devoted his mind entirely to religious duties they had a very fine family temple of their own in which they placed an image of their god vishnu cut out of the choicest stone of the nerbudda and consecrated after the most approved form and with very expensive ceremonies this idol rām kishan used every day to wash with his own hands with rosewater and anoint with precious ointments one day while he had the image in his arms and was busily employed in anointing it it fell to the ground upon the stone pavement and one of the arms was broken to live after such an untoward accident was quite out of the question and poor rām kishan proceeded at once quietly to hang himself he got a rope from the stable and having tied it over the beam in the room where he had let the god fall upon the stone pavement he was putting his head calmly into the noose when his brother came in laid hold of him called for assistance and put him under restraint a conclave of the priests of that sect was immediately held in the town and rām kishan was told that hanging himself was not absolutely necessary that it might do if he would take the stone image broken arm and all upon his own back and carry it two hundred and sixty miles to benares where resided the high priest of the sect who would no doubt be able to suggest the proper measures for pacifying the god at this time the only son of his brother khushhāl chand an interesting little boy of about four years of age was extremely ill of the smallpox and it is a rule with hindoos never to undertake any journey even one of pilgrimage to a holy shrine while any member of the family is afflicted with this disease they must all sit at home clothed in sackcloth and ashes he was told that he had better defer his journey to benares till the child should recover but he could neither sleep nor eat so great was his terror lest some dreadful calamity should befall the whole family before he could expiate his crime or take the advice of his high priest as to the best means of doing it and he resolved to leave the decision of the question to god himself he took two pieces of paper and having caused benares to be written upon one and jubbulpore upon the other he put them both into a brass vessel after shaking the vessel well he drew forth that on which benares had been written it is the will of god said rām kishan all the family who were interested in the preservation of the poor boy implored him not to set out lest dēvī who presides over smallpox should become angry it was all in vain he would set out with his household god and unable to carry it himself he put it into a small litter upon a pole and hired a bearer to carry it at one end while he supported it at the other his brother khushhāl chand sent his second wife at the same time with offerings for dēvī to ward off the effects of his brothers rashness from his child by the time the brother had got with his god to adhartāl three miles from jubbulpore on the road to benares he heard of the death of his nephew but he seemed not to feel this slight blow in his terror of the dreadful but undefined calamity which he felt to be impending over him and the whole family and he trotted on his road soon after an infant son of their uncle died of the same disease and the whole town became at once divided into two partiesthose who held that the children had been killed by dēvī as a punishment for rām kishans presuming to leave jubbulpore before they recovered and those who held that they were killed by the god vishnu himself for having been so rudely deprived of one of his arms khushhāl chands wife sickened on the road and died on reaching mirzapore of fever and as dēvī was supposed to have nothing to do with fevers this event greatly augmented the advocates of vishnu it is a rule with the hindoos to bury and not to burn the bodies of those who die of the smallpox for say they the smallpox is not only caused by the goddess dēvī but is in fact dēvī herself and to burn the body of the person affected with this disease is in reality neither more nor less than to burn the goddess khushhāl chand was strongly urged to bury and not burn his child particularly as it was usual with hindoos to bury infants and children of that age of whatever disease they might die but he insisted upon having his boy burned with all due pomp and ceremony and burned he was accordingly from that moment it is said the disease began to rage with increased violence throughout the town of jubbulpore at least onehalf of the children affected had before survived but from that hour at least three out of four died and instead of the condolence which he expected from his fellow citizens poor khushhāl chand a very amiable and worthy man received nothing but their execrations for bringing down so many calamities upon their heads first by maltreating his own god and then by setting fire to theirs i had a few days after a visit from gangādhar rāo the sadar amīn or head native judicial officer of this district whose father had been for a short time the ruler of the district under the former government and i asked him whether the smallpox had diminished in the town since the rains had now set in he told me that he thought it had but that a great many children had been taken off by the disease i understand rāo sahib that khushhāl chand the banker is supposed to have augmented the virulence of the diseaseby burning his boy was it so certainly said my friend with a grave long face the disease was much increased by this mans folly i looked very grave in my turn and he continued not a child escaped after he had burned his boy such incredible folly to set fire to the goddess in the midst of a population of twenty thousand souls it might have brought destruction on us all what makes you think that the disease is itself the goddess because we always say when any member of a family becomes attacked by the smallpox dēvī nikalī that is dēvī has shown herself in that family or in that individual and the person affected can wear nothing but plain white clothing not a silken or coloured garment nor an ornament of any kind nor can he or any of his family undertake a journey or participate in any kind of rejoicings lest he give offence to her they broke the arm of their god and he drove them all madl the elder brother set out on a journey with it and his nephew cousin and sisterinlaw fell victims to his temerity and then khushhāl chand brings down the goddess upon the whole community by burning his boy no doubt he was very fond of his childso we all areand wished to do him all honour but some regard is surely due to the people around us and i told him so when he was making preparations for the funeral but he would not listen to reason a complicated religious code like that of the hindoos is to the priest what a complicated civil code like that of the english is to the lawyers a hindoo can do nothing without consulting his priest and an englishman can do nothing without consulting his lawyer notes ante chapter following note sāgar was ceded by the peshwa

upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness the subject of scapegoats is discussed at length and copiously illustrated by mr frazer in the

governorgeneral the marquis of hastings organized an army in several divisions to crush the marauders and himself joined the central division in october the operations were ended by the capture of asīrgarh in march the people in the sāgar territories used to show several decayed mangotrees in groves where european troops had encamped during the campaigns of and and declared that they had been seen to wither from the day that beef for the use of these troops had been tied to their branches the only coincidence was in the decay of the trees and the encamping of the troops in the groves that the withering trees were those to which the beef had been tied was of course taken for granted w h s the hindoo veneration for the cow amounts to a passion and its intensity is very inadequately explained by the current utilitarian explanations the best analysis of the motives underlying the passionate hindoo feeling on the subject is to be found in mr william crookes article the veneration of the cow in india folklore sept pp in modern times an active though absolutely hopeless agitation has been kept up directed against the reasonable liberty of those communities in india who are not members of the hindoo system this agitation for the prohibition of cowkilling has caused some riots and has evoked much illfeeling the editor had to deal with it in the muzaffarnagar district in and had much trouble to keep the peace the local leaders of the movement went so far as to send telegrams direct to the government of india many other magistrates have had similar experiences the authorities take every precaution to protect hindoo susceptibilities from needless wounds but they are equally bound to defend the lawful liberty of subjects who are not hindoos the government of the united provinces on one occasion yielded to the hindoo demands so far as to prohibit cowkilling in at least one town where the practice was not fully established but the legality and expediency of such an order are both open to criticism the administrative difficulty is much enhanced by the fact that the indian muhammadans profess to be under a religious obligation to sacrifice cows at the īdul bakr festival cholera has been known to exist in india at least since the seventeenth century balfour cyclopaedia of india rd ed sv the cultus of hardaul is further discussed post in chapter in the

famous bīr singh deo bundēla of orchhā was born at datiyā his brother jhajhār singh suspected him of undue intimacy with his wife and at a feast poisoned him with all his followers after this tragedy it happened that the daughter of kunjāvatī the sister of jhajhār and hardaul was about to be married kunjāvatī accordingly sent an invitation to jhajhār singh requesting him to attend the wedding he refused and mockingly replied that she had better invite her favourite brother hardaul thereupon she went in despair to his tomb and lamented aloud hardaul from below answered her cries and said that he would come to the wedding and make all arrangements the ghost kept his promise and arranged the nuptials as befitted the honour of his house subsequently he visited at night the bedside of akbar and besought the emperor to command chabūtras to be erected and honour paid to him in every village throughout the empire promising that if he were duly honoured a wedding should never be marred by storm or rain and that no one who first presented a share of his meal to hardaul should ever want for food akbar complied with these requests and since that time hardauls ghost has been worshipped in every village he is chiefly honoured at weddings and in baisākh aprilmay during which month the women especially those of the lower castes visit his chabūtra and eat there his chabūtra is always built

brother called him to the throne many people were returning from the ceremonies of the marriage of sālagrām with tulasī who told me that the concourse had been immenseat least one hundred and fifty thousand and that the rājā had feasted them all for four days during the progress of the ceremonies but that they were obliged to defray their expenses going and coming except when they came by special invitation to do honour to the occasion as in the case of my little friend the sāgar high priest jānkī sewak they told me that they called this festival the dhanuk jag and that janakrāj the father of sītā had in his possession the dhanuk or immortal bow of parasrām the sixth incarnation of vishnu with which he exterminated all the kshatriyas or original military class of india and which required no less than four thousand men to raise it on one end the prince offered his daughter in marriage to any man who should bend this bow hundreds of heroes and demigods aspired to the hand of the fair sītā and essayed to bend the bow but all in vain till young rām the seventh incarnation of vishnu then a lad of only ten years of age came and at the touch of his great toe the bow flew into a thousand pieces which are supposed to have been all taken up into heaven sītā became the wife of rām and the popular poem of the rāmāyana describes the abduction of the heroine by the monster king of ceylon rāvana and her recovery by means of the monkey general hanumān every word of this poem the people assured me was written if not by the hand of the deity himself at least by his inspiration which was the same thing and it must consequently be true ninetynine out of a hundred among the hindoos implicitly believe not only every word of this poem but every word of every poem that has ever been written in sanskrit if you ask a man whether he really believes any very egregious absurdity quoted from these books he replies with the greatest naïveté in the world is it not written in the book and how should it be there written if not true the hindoo religion reposes upon an entire prostration of mind that continual and habitual surrender of the reasoning faculties which we are accustomed to make occasionally while engaged at the theatre or in the perusal of works of fiction we allow the scenes characters and incidents to pass before our minds eye and move our feelings without asking or stopping a moment to ask whether they are real or true there is only this difference that with people of education among us even in such short intervals of illusion or abandon any extravagance in acting or flagrant improbability in the fiction destroys the charm breaks the spell by which we have been so mysteriously bound stops the smooth current of sympathetic emotion and restores us to reason and to the realities of ordinary life with the hindoos on the contrary the greater the improbability the more monstrous and preposterous the fiction the greater is the charm it has over their minds and the greater their learning in the sanskrit the more are they under the influence of this charm believing all to be written by the deity or by his inspiration and the men and things of former days to have been very different from the men and things of the present day and the heroes of these fables to have been demigods or people endowed with powers far superior to those of the ordinary men of their own day the analogies of nature are never for a moment considered nor do questions of probability or possibility according to those analogies ever obtrude to dispel the charm with which they are so pleasingly bound they go on through life reading and talking of these monstrous fictions which shock the taste and understanding of other nations without once questioning the truth of one single incident or hearing it questioned there was a time and that not very distant when it was the same in england and in every other european nation and there are i am afraid some parts of europe where it is so still but the hindoo faith so far as religious questions are concerned is not more capacious or absurd than that of the greeks and romans in the days of socrates and cicerothe only difference is that among the hindoos a greater number of the questions which interest mankind are brought under the head of religion there is nothing in the hindoos more absurd than the piety of tiberius in offering up sacrifices in the temple and beforethe image of augustus while he was solicited by all the great cities of the empire to suffer temples to be built and sacrifices to be made to himself while still living or than alexanders attempt to make a goddess of his mother while yet alive that he might feel the more secure of being made a god himself after his death in all religions there are points at which the professors declare that reason must stop and cease to be a guide to faith the pious man thinks that all which he cannot comprehend or reconcile to reason in his own religion must be above it the superstitions of the people of india will diminish before the spread of science art and literature and good works of history and fiction would i think make far greater havoc among these superstitions even than good works in any of the sciences save the physical such as astronomy chemistry c in the evening we went out with the intention of making an excursion of the lake in boats that had been prepared for our reception by tying three or four fishing canoes together but on reaching the ridge of quartz hills which runs along the southeast side we preferred moving along its summit to entering the boats the prospect on either side of this ridge was truly beautiful a noble sheet of clear water about four miles long by two broad on our right and on our left a no less noble sheet of rich wheat cultivation irrigated from the lake by drains passing between small breaks in the ridges of the hills the persian wheel is used to raise the water this sheet of rich cultivation is beautifully studded with mango groves and fields of sugarcane the lake is almost double the size of that of sāgar and the idea of its great utility for purposes of irrigation made it appear to me far more beautiful but my little friend the sarīmant who accompanied us in our walk said that it could not be so handsome since it had not a fine city and castle on two sides and a fine government house on the third but said i no mans field is watered from that lake no replied he but for every man that drinks of the waters of this fifty drink of the waters of that from that lake thirty thousand people get ārām comfort every day this lake is called kēwlas after kēwal varmma the chandēl prince by whom it was formed his palace now in ruins stood on the top of the ridge of rocks in a very beautiful situation from the summit about eight miles to the west we could see a still larger lake called the nandanvārā lake extending under a similar range of quartz hills running parallel with that on which we stood that lake we were told answered upon a much larger scale the same admirable purpose of supplying water for the fields and securing the people from the dreadful effects of droughts the extensive level plains through which the rivers of central india generally cut their way have for the most part been the beds of immense natural lakes and there rivers sink so deep into their beds and leave such ghastly chasms and ravines on either side that their waters are hardly ever available in due season for irrigation it is this characteristic of the rivers of central india that makes such lakes so valuable to the people particularly in seasons of droughtl the river nerbudda has been known to rise seventy feet in the course of a couple of days in the rains and during the season when its waters are wanted for irrigation they can nowhere be found within that distance of the surface while a level piece of ground fit for irrigation is rarely to be met with within a mile of the stream the people appeared to improve as we advanced farther into bundēlkhand in appearance manners and intelligence there is a bold bearing about the bundēlas which at first one is apt to take for rudeness or impudence but which in time he finds not to be so the employés of the rājā were everywhere attentive frank and polite and the peasantry seemed no longer inferior to those of our sāgar and nerbudda territories the females of almost all the villages through which we passed came out with their kalas in procession to meet usone of the most affecting marks of respect from the peasantry for their superiors that i know one woman carries on her head a brass jug brightly polished full of water while all the other families of the village crowd around her and sing in chorus some rural song that lasts from the time the respected visitor comes in sight till he disappears he usually puts into the kalas a rupee to purchase gur coarse sugar of which all the females partake as a sacred offering to the sex no member of the other sex presumes to partake of it and during the chorus all the men stand aloof in respectful silence this custom prevails all over india or over all parts of it that i have seen and yet i have witnessed a governorgeneral of india with all his suite passing by this interesting group without knowing or asking what it was i lingered behind and quietly put my silver into the jug as if from the governorgeneral the man who administers the government over these seven villages in all its branches civil criminal and fiscal receives a salary of only two hundred rupees a year he collects the revenues on the part of government and with the assistance of the heads and the elders of the villages adjusts all petty matters of dispute among the people both civil and criminal disputes of a more serious character are sent to be adjusted at the capital by the rājā and his ministers the person who reigns over the seven villages of the lake is about thirty years of age of the rājpūt caste and i think one of the finest young men i have ever seen his ancestors have served the orchhā state in the same station for seven generations and he tells me that he hopes his posterity will serve them sic for as many more provided they do not forfeit their claims to do so by their infidelity or incapacity this young man seemed to have the respect and affection of every member of the little communities of the villages through which we passed and it was evident that he deserved theirattachment i have rarely seen any similar signs of attachment to one of our own native officers this arises chiefly from the circumstance of their being less frequently placed in authority among those upon whose good feelings and opinions their welfare and comfort as those of their children are likely permanently to depend in india under native rule office became hereditary because officers expended the whole of their incomes in religious ceremonies or works of ornament and utility and left their families in hopeless dependence upon the chief in whose service they had laboured all their lives while they had been educating their sons exclusively with the view of serving that chief in the same capacity that their fathers had served him before them it is in this case and this alone that the law of primogeniture is in force in india among muhammadans as well as hindoos all property real and personal is divided equally among the children but the duties of an office will not admit of the same subdivision and this therefore when hereditary as it often is descends to the eldest son with the obligation of providing for the rest of the family the family consists of all the members who remain united to the parent stock including the widows and orphans of the sons or brothers who were so up to the time of their death the old chobdār or silverstick bearer who came with us from the rājā gets fifteen rupees a month and his ancestors have served the rājā for several generations the dīwān who has charge of the treasury receives only one thousand rupees a year and the bakshī or paymaster of the army who seems at present to rule the state as the prime favourite the same these latter are at present the only two great officers of state and though they are no doubt realizing handsome incomes by indirect means they dare not make any display lest signs of wealth might induce the rājā or his successors to treat them as their predecessors in office were treated for some time past the jāgīrdārs or feudal chiefs as i have before stated are almost all of the same family or class as the rājā and they spend all the revenues of their estates in the maintenance of military retainers upon whose courage and fidelity they can generally rely these jāgīrdārs are bound to attend the prince on all great occasions and at certain intervals and are made to contribute something to his exchequer in tribute almost all live beyond their legitimate means and make up the deficiency by maintaining upon their estates gangs of thieves robbers and murderers who extend their depredations into the country around and share the prey with these chiefs and their officers and undertenants they keep them as poachers keep their dogs and the paramount power whose subjects they plunder might as well ask them for the best horse in the stable as for the best thief that lives under their protection i should mention an incident that occurred during the rājās visit to me at tehrī lieutenant thomas was sitting next to the little sarīmant and during the interview he asked him to allow him to look at his beautiful little goldhilted sword the sarīmant held it fast and told him that he should do himself the honour of waiting upon him in his tent in the course of the day when he would show him the sword and tell him its history after the rājā left me thomas mentioned this and said he felt very much hurt at the incivility of my little friend but i told him that he was in everything he did and said so perfectly the gentleman that i felt quite sure he would explain all to his satisfaction when he called upon him during his visit to thomas he apologized for not having given over his sword to him and said you european gentlemen have such perfect confidence in each other that you can at all times and in all situations venture to gratify your curiosity in these matters and draw your swords in a crowd just as well as when alone but had you drawn mine from the scabbard in such a situation with the tent full of the rājās personal attendants and surrounded by a devoted and not very orderly soldiery it might have been attended by very serious consequences any man outside might have seen the blade gloaming and not observing distinctly why it had been drawn might have suspected treachery and called out to the rescue when we should all have been cut downthe lady child and all thomas was not only satisfied with the sarīmants apology but was so much delighted with him that he has ever since been longing to get his portrait for he says it was really his intention to draw the sword had the sarīmant given it to him as i have said his face is extremely beautiful quite a model for a painter or a statuary and his figure though small is handsome he dresses with great elegance mostly in azurecoloured satin surmounted by a rosecoloured turban and a waistband of the same colour all his motions are graceful and his manners have an exquisite polish a greater master of all the convenances i have never seen though he is of slender capacity and as i have said in stature less than five feet high a poor halfnaked man reduced to beggary by the late famine ran along by my horse to show me the road and to the great amusement of my attendants exclaimed that he felt exactly as if he were always falling down a well meaning as if he were immersed in cold water he said that the cold season was suited only to gentlemen who could afford to be well clothed but to a poor man like himself and the great mass of people in bundēlkhand at least the hot season was much better he told me that the late rājā though a harsh was thought to be a just man and that his good sense and above all his good fortune ikbāl had preserved the principality entire but that god only and the forbearance of the honourable company could now serve it under such an imbecile as the present chief he seemed quite melancholy at the thought of living to see this principality the oldest in bundēlkhand lose its independence even this poor unclothed and starving wretch had a feeling of patriotism a pride of country though that country had been so wretchedly governed and was now desolated by a famine just such a feeling had the impressed seamen who fought our battles in the great struggle no nation has ever had a more disgraceful institution than that of the pressgang of england this institution if so it can be called must be an eternal stain upon her gloryposterity will never be able to read the history of her naval victories without a blush without reproaching her lawgivers who could allow them to be purchased with the blood of such men as those whofought for us the battles of the nile and trafalgar england expected every man to do his duty on that day but had england done her duty to every man who was on that day to fight for her was not every english gentleman of the lords and commons a david sending his uriah to battle the intellectual stock which we require in good seamen for our navy and which is acquired in scenes of peril upon the high and giddy mast is as much their property as that which other men acquire in schools and colleges and we had no more right to seize and employ these seamen in our battles upon the wages of common uninstructed labour than we should have had to seize and employ as many clergymen barristers and physicians when i have stood on the quarterdeck of a ship in a storm and seen the seamen covering the yards in taking in sail with the thunder rolling and the lightning flashing fearfully around themthe sea covered with foam and each succeeding billow as it rushed by seeming ready to sweep them all from their frail footing into the fathomless abyss belowi have asked myself are men like these to be seized like common felons torn from their wives and children as soon as they reach their native land subject every day to the lash and put in front of those battles on which the wealth the honour and the independence of the nation depend merely because british legislators know that when there a regard for their own personal character among their companions in danger will make them fight like englishmen this feeling of nationality which exists in the little states of bundēlkhand arises from the circumstance that the mass of the landholders are of the same class as the chief bundēlas and that the public establishments of the state are recruited almost exclusively from that mass the states of jhānsī and jālaun are the only exceptions there the rulers are brahmans and not rājpūts and they recruit their public establishments from all classes and all countries the landed aristocracy however there as elsewhere are rājpūtseither pawārs chandēls or bundēlas the rājpūt landholders of bundēlkhand are linked to the soil in all their grades from the prince to the peasant as the highlanders of scotland were not long ago and the holder of a hundred acres is as proud as the holder of a million he boasts the same descent and the same exclusive possession of arms and agriculture to which unhappily the industry of their little territories is almost exclusively confined for no other branch can grow up among so turbulent a set whose quarrels with their chiefs or among each other are constantly involving them in civil wars which render life and property exceedingly insecure besides as i have stated their propensity to keep bands of thieves robbers and murderers in their baronial castles as poachers keep their dogs has scared away the wealthy and respectable capitalist and peaceful and industrious manufacturer all the landholders are uneducated and unfit to serve in any of our civil establishments or in those of any very civilized governments and they are just as unfitted to serve in our military establishments where strict discipline is required the lands they occupy are cultivated because they depend almost entirely upon the rents they get from them for subsistence and because every petty chief and his family hold their lands rentfree or at a trifling quitrent on the tenure of military service and their residue forms all the market for land produce which the cultivators require they dread the transfer of the rule to our government because they now form almost exclusively all the establishments of their domestic chief civil as well as military and know that were our rule to be substituted they would be almost entirely excluded from these at least for a generation or two in our regiments horse or foot there is hardly a man from bundēlkhand for the reasons above stated nor are there any in the gwālior regiments and contingents which are stationed in the neighbourhood though the land among them is become minutely subdivided and they are obliged to seek service or starve they are all too proud for manual labour even at the plough no bundēlkhand rājpūt will i believe condescend to put his hand to one among the marāthā states sikhs and muhammadans there is no bond of union of this kind the establishments military as well as civil are everywhere among them composed for the most part of foreigners and the landed interests under such governments would dread nothing from the prospect of a transfer to our rule on the contrary they and the mass of the people would almost everywhere hail it as a blessing there are two reasons why we should leave these small native states under their own chiefs even when the claim to the succession is feeble or defective first because it tends to relieve the minds of other native chiefs from the apprehension already too prevalent among them that we desire by degrees to absorb them all because we think our government would do better for the people and secondly because by leaving them as a contrast we afford to the people of india the opportunity of observing the superior advantages of our rule tis distance lends enchantment to the view in governments as well as in landscapes and if the people of india instead of the living proofs of what perilous things native governments whether hindoo or muhammadan are in reality were acquainted with nothing but such pictures of them as are to be found in their histories and in the imaginations of their priests and learned men who lose much of their influence and importance under our rule they would certainly with proneness like theirs to delight in the marvellous be far from satisfied as they now are that they never had a government so good as ours and that they never could hope for another so good were ours removed for the advantages which we derive from leaving them independent we are no doubt obliged to pay a heavy penalty in the plunder of our wealthy native subjects by the gangs of robbers of all descriptions whom they foster but this evil maybe greatly diminished by a judicious interposition of our authority to put down such bands in bundēlkhand at present the government and the lands of the native chiefs are in the hands of three of the hindoo military classes bundēlas dhandēlas and pawārs the principal chiefs are of the first and their feudatories are chiefly of the other two a bundēla cannot marry the daughter of a bundēla he must take his wife from one or other of the other two tribes nor can a member of either of the other two take his wife from his own tribe he must take her from the bundēlas or the other tribe the wives of the greatest chiefs are commonly from the poorest families of their vassals nor does the proud family from which she has been taken feel itself exalted by the alliance neither does the poorest vassal among the pawārs and dhandēls feel that the daughter of his prince has condescended in becoming his wife all they expect is a service for a few more yeomen of the family among the retainers of the sovereign the people are in this manner from the prince to the peasant indissolubly linked to each other and to the soil they occupy for where industry is confined almost exclusively to agriculture the proprietors of the soil and the officers of government who are maintained out of its rents constitute nearly the whole of the middle and higher classes about onehalf of the lands of every state are held on service tenure by vassals of the same family or clan as the chief and there is hardly one of them who is not connected with that chief by marriage the revenue derived from the other half is spent in the maintenance of establishments formed almost exclusively of the members of these families they are none of them educated for civil offices under any other rule nor could they for a generation or two be induced to submit to wear military uniform or learn the drill of regular soldiers they are mere militia brave as men can be but unsusceptible of discipline they have therefore a natural horror at the thought of their states coming under any other than a domestic rule for they could have no chance of employment in the civil or military establishments of a foreign power and their lands would they fear be resumed since the service for which they had been given would be no longer available to the rulers it is said that in the long interval from the commencement of the reign of alexander the third to the end of that of david the second not a single baron could be found in scotland able to sign his own name the bundēlkhand barons have never i believe been quite so bad as this though they have never yet learned enough to fit them for civil offices under us many of them can write and read their own language which is that common to the other countries around them bundēlkhand was formerly possessed by another tribe of rājpūts the proud chandēls who have now disappeared altogether from this province if one of that tribe can still be found it is in the humblest rank of the peasant or the soldier but its former strength is indicated by the magnificent artificial lakes and ruined castles which are traced to them and by the reverence which is still felt by the present dominant classes of sic their old capital of mahoba within a certain distance around that ruined city no one now dares to beat the nakkāra or great drum used in festivals or processions lest the spirits of the old chandēl chiefs who there repose should be roused to vengeance and a kingdom could not tempt one of the bundēlas pawārs or chandēls to accept the government of the parish mauza in which it is situated they will take subordinate offices there under others with fear and trembling but nothing could induce one of them to meet the governor when the deadly struggle between these two tribes took place cannot now be discovered in the time of akbar the chandēls were powerful in mahoba as the celebrated durgāvatī the queen of garhā mandlā whose reign extended over the sāgar and nerbudda territories and the greater part of berār was a daughter of the reigning chandēl prince of mahoba he condescended to give his daughter only on condition that the gond prince who demanded her should to save his character come with an army of fifty thousand men to take her he did so and nothing loth durgāvatī departed to reign over a country where her name is now more revered than that of any other sovereign it has ever had she was killed above two hundred and fifty years ago about twelve miles from jubbulpore while gallantly leading on her troops in their third and last attempt to stem the torrent of muhammadan invasion her tomb is still to be seen where she fell in a narrow defile between two hills and a pair of large rounded stones which stand near are according to popular belief her royal drums turned into stone which in the dead of night are still heard resounding through the woods and calling the spirits of her warriors from their thousand graves around her the travellers who pass this solitary spot respectfully place upon the tomb the prettiest specimen they can find of the crystals which abound in the neighbourhood and with so much of kindly feeling had the history of durgāvatī inspired me that i could not resist the temptation of adding one to the number when i visited her tomb some sixteen years ago i should mention that the rājā of samthar in bundēlkhand is by caste a gūjar and he has not yet any landed aristocracy like that of the bundēlas about him one of his ancestors not long ago seized upon a fine open plain and built a fort upon it and the family has ever since by means of this fort kept possession of the country around and drawn part of their revenues from depredations upon their neighbours and travellers the jhānsī and jālaun chiefs are brahmans of the same family as the peshwā in the states governed by chiefs of the military classes nearly the whole produce of the land goes to maintain soldiers or military retainers who are always ready to fight or rob for their chief in those governed by the brahmanical class nearly the whole produce goes to maintain priests and the other chiefs would soon devour them as the black ants devour the white were not the paramount power to interpose and save them while the peshwā lived he interposed but all hisdominions were running into priesthood like those in sāgar and bundēlkhand and must soon have been swallowed up by the military chiefs around him had we not taken his place jālaun and jhānsī are preserved only by us for with all their religious it is impossible for them to maintain efficient military establishments and the bundēla chiefs have always a strong desire to eat them up since these states were all sliced out of their principalities when the peshwā was allpowerful in hindustan the chhatarpur rājā is a pawār his father had been in the service of the bundēla rājā but when we entered upon our duties as the paramount power in bundēlkhand the son had succeeded to the little principality seized upon by his father and on the principle of respecting actual possession he was recognized by us as the sovereign the bundela rājās east of the dasān river are descended from rājā chhatarsāl and are looked down upon by the bundēla rājās of orchhā chandērī and datiyā west of the dasān as chhatarsāl was in the service of one of their ancestors from whom he wrested the estates which his descendants now enjoy chhatarsāl in his will gave onethird of the dominion he had thus acquired to the strongest power then in india the peshwā in order to secure the other twothirds to his two sons hardī sā and

exaggeration their accumulation of sanguinary horrors and their childish triviality few of the classical myths exhibit these characteristics the vanity or policy of tiberius and alexander in believing themselves to be or wishing to be believed divine has nothing in common with the grotesque imagination of puranic hinduism the roots of hinduism are so deeply fixed in a thick soil of custom and inherited sentiment the growth of thousands of years that english education has less effect than might be expected in loosening the bonds of beliefs which seem to every one but a hindoo the merest superstition hindoos who can read english with fluency and write it with accuracy are often extremely devout and hindoo devoutness must ever appear to an outsider even to a european as sympathetic as the author to be no better than superstition a hindoo able to read english with ease has at his command all the rich stores of the knowledge of the west but very often does not care to taste them enmeshed in a web of ritual and belief inseparable from himself he remains as much as ever a hindoo and uses his skill in english merely as an article of professional equipment good works of history and fiction do not interest him and he usually fails to digest and assimilate the physical or biological science administered to him at school or college in fact he does not believe it the monstrous legends of the purānas continue to be for his mind the realities while the truths of science are to him phantoms shadowy and unsubstantial the outlandish notions of alien and casteless unbelievers these observations of course are not universally true and a few hindoos growing in number are able to heartily accept and thoroughly assimilate the facts of history and the results of inductive science but such hindoos are few and it may well be doubted if it is possible for a man really to believe the amount of history and science known to an ordinary english schoolboy and still be a devout hindoo the old bottles cannot contain the new wine the hindoo scriptures do not treat of history and science in a merely incidental way they teach after their fashion both history and science formally and systematically grammar logic medicine astronomy the history of gods and men are all taught in books which form part of the sacred canon inductive science and matteroffact history are absolutely destructive of and irreconcilable with veneration for the hindoo scriptures as authoritative and infallible guides it is impossible within the narrow limits of a note to discuss the problems suggested

exhaustive the author was mistaken in supposing that the power of the chandēls was broken by the bundēlas the last chandēl king who ruled over an extensive dominion was paramardi deva or parmāl this prince was defeated in a pitched battle or rather a series of battles near the betwa river by prithīrāj chauhān king of kanauj in the year a few years later the victor was himself vanquished and slain by the advancing muhammadans mahoba and the surrounding territories then passed through many vicissitudes imperfectly recorded in the pages of history and were ruled from time to time by musalmāns

the theme of the songs of many popular rhapsodists the story is of course encrusted with a thick deposit of miraculous legend and none of the details can be relied on but the fact and the date of the war are fully proved by incontestable evidence the marriage of durgāvatī is no proof that her father the chandēl rājā was powerful in mahoba in the time of akbar it is rather an indication that he was poor and weak if he had been rich and strong he would probably have refused his daughter to a gond even though complaisant bards might invent a rājpūt genealogy for the bridegroom the story about the army of fifty thousand men cannot be readily accepted as sober fact it looks like a courtly invention to explain a mésalliance the inducement really offered to the proud but poor chandēl was in all likelihood a large sum of money according to the usual practice in such cases several indications exist of close relations between the gonds and chandēls in earlier times early in akbars reign in the year āsaf khān the imperial viceroy of karrā mānikpur obtained permission to invade the gond territory the young rājā of garhā mandlā bīr narāyan was then a minor and the defence of the kingdom devolved on durgāvatī the dowager queen she first took up her position at the great fortress of singaurgarh northwest of jabalpur and being there defeated retired through garhā to the southeast towards mandlā after an obstinately contested fight the invaders were again successful and broke the queens stout resistance mounted on an elephant she refused to retire though she was severely wounded until her troops had time to recover the shock of the first discharge of artillery and notwithstanding that she had received an arrowwound in her eye bravely defended the pass in person but by an extraordinary coincidence the river in the rear of her position which had been nearly dry a few hours before the action commenced began suddenly to rise and soon became unfordable finding her plan of retreat thus frustrated and seeing her troops give way she snatched a dagger from her elephantdriver and plunged it into her bosom of all the sovereigns of this dynasty she lives most in the recollection of the people she carried out many highly useful works in different parts of her kingdom and one of the large reservoirs near jabalpur is still called the rānī talāo in memory of her

and was killed in battle in june chapter blights i had a visit from my little friend the sarīmant and the conversation turned upon the causes and effects of the dreadful blight to which the wheat crops in the nerbudda districts had of late years been subject he said that the people at first attributed this great calamity to an increase in the crime of adultery which had followed the introduction of our rule and which he said was understood to follow it everywhere that afterwards it was by most people attributed to our frequent measurement of the land and inspection of fields with a view to estimate their capabilities to pay which the people considered a kind of incest and which he himself the deity can never tolerate the land is said he considered as the mother of the prince or chief who holds itthe great parent from whom he derives all that maintains himhis family and his establishments if well treated she yields this in abundance to her son but if he presumes to look upon her with the eye of desire she ceases to be fruitful or the deity sends down hail or blight to destroy all that she yields the measuring the surface of the fields and the frequent inspecting the crops by the chief himself or by his immediate agents were considered by the people in this light and in consequence he never ventured upon these things they were he thought fully satisfied that we did it more with a view to distribute the burthen of taxation equally upon the people than to increase it collectively still he thought that either we should not do it at all or delegate the duty to inferior agents whose close inspection of the great parent could not be so displeasing to the deity rām chand pundit said that there was no doubt much truth in what sarīmant sāhib had stated that the crops of late had unquestionably suffered from the constant measuring going on upon the lands but that the people as he knew had now become unanimous in attributing the calamities of season under which these districts had been suffering so much to the eating of beef this was he thought the great source of all their sufferings sarīmant declared that he thought his pundit was right and that it would no doubt be of great advantage to them and to their rulers if government could be prevailed upon to prohibit the eating of beef that so great and general were the sufferings of the people from these calamities of seasons and so firm and now so general the opinion that they arose chiefly from the practice of killing and eating cows that in spite of all the other superior blessings of our rule the people were almost beginning to wish their old marāthā rulers in power again i reminded him of the still greater calamities the people of bundēlkhand had been suffering under true said he but among them there are crimes enough of everyday occurrence to account for these things but under your rule the deity has only one or other of these three things to be offended with and of these three it must be admitted that the eating of beef so near the sacred stream of the nerbudda is the worst the blight of which we were speaking had for several seasons from the year destroyed the greater part of the wheat crops over extensive districts along the line of the nerbudda and through mālwā generally and old people stated that they recollected two returns of this calamity at intervals from twenty to twentyfour years the pores with which the stalks are abundantly supplied to admit of their readily taking up the aqueous particles that float in the air seem to be more open in an easterly wind than in any other and when this wind prevails at the same time that the air is filled with the farina of the small parasitic fungus whose depredations on the corn constitute what they call the rust mildew or blight the particles penetrate into these pores speedily sprout and spread their small roots into the cellular texture where they intercept and feed on the sap in its ascent and the grain in the ear deprived of its nourishment becomes shrivelled and the whole crop is often not worth the reaping it is at first of a light beautiful orangecolour and found chiefly upon the alsī linseed which it does not seem much to injure but about the end of february the fungi ripen and shed their seeds rapidly and they are taken up by the wind and carried over the cornfields i have sometimes seen the air tinted of an orange colour for many days by the quantity of these seeds which it has contained and that without the wheat crops suffering at all when any but an easterly wind has prevailed but when the air is so charged with this farina let but an easterly wind blow for twentyfour hours and all the wheat crops under its influence are destroyed nothing can save them the stalks and leaves become first of an orange colour from the light colour of the farina which adheres to them but this changes to deep brown all that part of the stalk that is exposed seems as if it had been pricked with needles and had exuded blood from every puncture and the grain in the ear withers in proportion to the number of fungi that intercept and feed upon its sap but the parts of the stalks that are covered by the leaves remain entirely uninjured and when the leaves are drawn off from them they form a beautiful contrast to the others which have been exposed to the depredations of these parasitic plants every pore it is said may contain from twenty to forty of these plants and each plant may shed a hundred seeds so that a single shrub infected with the disease may disseminate it over the face of a whole district for in the warm monthof march when the wheat is attaining maturity these plants ripen and shed their seeds in a week and consequently increase with enormous rapidity when they find plants with their pores open ready to receive and nourish them i went over a rich sheet of wheat cultivation in the district of jubbulpore in january which appeared to me devoted to inevitable destruction it was intersected by slips and fields of alsī which the cultivators often sow along the borders of their wheatfields which are exposed to the road to prevent trespass all this alsī had become of a beautiful light orange colour from these fungi and the cultivators who had had every field destroyed the year before by the same plant surrounded my tent in despair imploring me to tell them of some remedy i knew of none but as the alsī is not a very valuable plant i recommended them as their only chance to pull it all up by the roots and fling it into large tanks that were everywhere to be found they did so and no alsī was intentionally left in the district for like drowning men catching at a straw they caught everywhere at the little gleam of hope that my suggestion seemed to offer not a field of wheat was that season injured in the district of jubbulpore but i was soon satisfied that my suggestion had had nothing whatever to do with their escape for not a single stalk of the wheat was i believe affected while some stalks of the affected alsī must have been left by accident besides in several of the adjoining districts where the alsī remained in the ground the wheat escaped i found that about the time when the blight usually attacks the wheat westerly winds prevailed and that it never blew from the east for many hours together the common belief among the natives was that the prevalence of an east wind was necessary to give full effect to the attack of this disease though they none of them pretended to know anything of its modus operandi indeed they considered the blight to be a demon which was to be driven off only by prayers and sacrifices it is worthy of remark that hardly anything suffered from the attacks of these fungi but the wheat the alsī upon which it always first made its appearance suffered something certainly but not much though the stems and leaves were covered with them the gram cicer arietinum suffered still lessindeed the grain in this plant often remained uninjured while the stems and leaves were covered with the fungi in the midst of fields of wheat that were entirely destroyed by ravages of the same kind none of the other pulses were injured though situated in the same manner in the midst of the fields of wheat that were destroyed i have seen rich fields of uninterrupted wheat cultivation for twenty miles by ten in the valley of the nerbudda so entirely destroyed by this disease that the people would not go to the trouble of gathering one field in four for the stalks and the leaves were so much injured that they were considered as unfit or unsafe for fodder and during the same season its ravages were equally felt in the districts along the tablelands of the vindhya range north of the valley and i believe those upon the sātpura range south the last time i saw this blight was in march in the sāgar district where its ravages were very great but partial and i kept bundles of the blighted wheat hanging up in my house for the inspection of the curious till the beginning of when i assumed charge of the district of sāgar in the opinion among the farmers and landholders generally was that the calamities of season under which we had been suffering were attributable to the increase of adultery arising as they thought from our indifference as we seemed to treat it as a matter of little importance whereas it had always been considered under former governments as a case of life and death the husband or his friends waited till they caught the offending parties together in criminal correspondence and then put them both to death and the death of one pair generally acted they thought as a sedative upon the evil passions of a whole district for a year or two nothing can be more unsatisfactory than our laws for the punishment of adultery in india where the muhammadan criminal code has been followed though the people subjected to it are not onetenth muhammadans this law was enacted by muhammad on the occasion of his favourite wife ayesha being found under very suspicious circumstances with another man a special direction from heaven required that four witnesses should swear positively to the fact ayesha and her paramour were of course acquitted and the witnesses being less than four received the same punishment which would have been inflicted upon the criminals had the fact been proved by the direct testimony of the prescribed numberthat is eighty stripes of the korā almost equal to a sentence of death see korān chap and chap this became the law among all muhammadans ayeshas father succeeded muhammad and omar succeeded abū bakr soon after his accession to the throne omar had to sit in judgement upon mughīra a companion of the prophet the governor of basrah who had been accidentally seen in an awkward position with a lady of rank by four men while they sat in an adjoining apartment the door or window which concealed the criminal parties was flung open by the wind at the time when they wished it most to remain closed three of the four men swore directly to the point mughīra was omars favourite and had been appointed to the government by him zāid the brother of one of the three who had sworn to the fact hesitated to swear to the entire fact i think said omar that i see before me a man whom god would not make the means of disgracing one of the companions of the holy prophet zāid then described circumstantially the most unequivocal position that was perhaps ever described in a public court of justice but still hesitating to swear to the entire completion of the crime the criminals were acquitted and his brother and the two others received the punishment described this decision of the brutus of his age and country settled the law of evidence in these matters and no muhammadan judge would now give a verdict against any person charged with adultery without the four witnesses to the entire fact no man hopes for a conviction for this crime in our courts and as he would have to drag his wife or paramour through no less than threethat of the police officer the magistrate and thejudgeto seek it he has recourse to poison either secretly or with his wifes consent she will commonly rather die than be turned out into the streets a degraded outcast the seducer escapes with impunity while his victim suffers all that human nature is capable of enduring where husbands are in the habit of poisoning their guilty wives from the want of legal means of redress they will sometimes poison those who are suspected upon insufficient grounds no magistrate ever hopes to get a conviction in the judges court if he commits a criminal for trial on this charge under regulation of and therefore he never does commit regulation of authorizes a magistrate to punish any person convicted of enticing away a wife or unmarried daughter for anothers use and an indignant functionary may sometimes feel disposed to stretch a point that the guilty man may not altogether escape redress for these wrongs is never sought in our courts because they can never hope to get it but it is a great mistake to suppose that the people of india want a heavier punishment for the crime than we are disposed to inflictall they want is a fair chance of conviction upon such reasonable proof as cases of this nature admit of and such a measure of punishment as shall make it appear that their rulers think the crime a serious one and that they are disposed to protect them from it sometimes the poorest man would refuse pecuniary compensation but generally husbands of the poorer classes would be glad to get what the heads of their caste or circle of society might consider the expenses of a second marriage they do not dare to live in adultery they would be outcasts if they did they must be married according to the forms of their caste and it is reasonable that the seducer of the wife should be obliged to defray the coats of the injured husbands second marriage the rich will of course always refuse such a compensation but a law declaring the man convicted of this crime liable to imprisonment in irons at hard labour for two years but entitled to his discharge within that time on an application from the injured husband or father would be extremely popular throughout india the poor man would make the application when assured of the sum which the elders of his caste consider sufficient and they would take into consideration the means of the offender to pay the woman is sufficiently punished by her degraded condition the fatwa of a muhammadan law officer should be dispensed with in such cases in the people began to search for other causes scilicet of bad seasons the frequent measurements of the land with a view to equalize the assessments were thought of even the operations of the trigonometrical survey which were then making a great noise in central india where their fires were seen every night burning upon the peaks of the highest ranges were supposed to have had some share in exasperating the deity and the services of the most holy brahmans were put in requisition to exorcise the peaks from which the engineers had taken their angles the moment their instruments were removed in many places to the great annoyance and consternation of the engineers the landmarks which they had left to enable them to correct their work as they advanced were found to have been removed during their short intervals of absence and they were obliged to do their work over again the priests encouraged the disposition on the part of the peasantry to believe that men who required to do their work by the aid of fires lighted in the dead of the night upon high places and work which no one but themselves seemed able to comprehend must hold communion with supernatural beings a communion which they thought might be displeasing to the deity at last in the year a very holy brahman who lived in his cloister near the iron suspension bridge over the biās river ten miles from sāgar sat down with a determination to wrestle with the deity till he should be compelled to reveal to him the real cause of all these calamities of season under which the people were groaningl after three days and nights of fasting and prayer he saw a vision which stood before him in a white mantle and told him that all these calamities arose from the slaughter of cows and that under former governments this practice had been strictly prohibited and the returns of the harvest had in consequence been always abundant and subsistence cheap in spite of invasion from without insurrection within and a good deal of misrule and oppression on the part of the local government the holy man was enjoined by the vision to make this revelation known to the constituted authorities and to persuade the people generally throughout the district to join in the petition for the prohibition of beefeating throughout our nerbudda territories he got a good many of the most respectable of the landholders around him and explained the wishes of the vision of the preceding night a petition was soon drawn up and signed by many hundreds of the most respectable people in the district and presented to the governorgenerals representative in these parts mr f c smith others were presented to the civil authorities of the district and all stating in the most respectful terms how sensible the people were of the inestimable benefits of our rule and how grateful they all felt for the protection to life and property and to the free employment of all their advantages which they had under it and for the frequent and large reduction in the assessments and remission in the demand on account of calamities of seasons these they stated were all that government could do to relieve a suffering people but they had all proved unavailing and yet under this truly paternal rule the people were suffering more than under any former government in its worst period of misrulethe hand of an incensed god was upon them and as they had now at last after many fruitless attempts discovered the real cause of this anger of the deity they trusted that we would listen to their prayers and restore plenty and all its blessings to the country by prohibiting the eating of beef all these dreadful evils had they said unquestionably originated in the sadr bāzār great market of the cantonments where for the first time within one hundred miles of the sacred stream of the nerbudda men had purchased and eaten cows flesh these people were all much attached to us and to our rule and were many of them on the most intimate terms of social intercourse with us and at the time they signed this petition were entirely satisfied that they had discovered the real cause of all their sufferings and impressed with the idea that we should be convinced and grant their prayersl theday is past beef continued to be eaten with undiminished appetite the blight nevertheless disappeared and every other sign of vengeance from above and the people are now i believe satisfied that they were mistaken they still think that the lands do not yield so many returns of the seed under us as under former rulers that they have lost some of the barkat blessings which they enjoyed under themthey know not why the fact is that under us the lands do not enjoy the salutary fallows which frequent invasions and civil wars used to cause under former governments those who survived such civil wars and invasions got better returns for their seed during the discussion of the question with the people i had one day a conversation with the sadr amīn or head native judicial officer whom i have already mentioned he told me that there could be no doubt of the truth of the conclusion to which the people had at length come there are he said some countries in which punishments follow crimes after long intervals and indeed do not take place till some future birth in others they follow crimes immediately and such is the country bordering the stream of mother nerbudda this said he is a stream more holy than that of the great ganges herself since no man is supposed to derive any benefit from that stream unless he either bathe in it or drink from it but the sight of the nerbudda from a distant hill could bless him and purify him in other countries the slaughter of cows and bullocks might not be punished for ages and the harvest in such countries might continue good through many successive generations under such enormities indeed he was not quite sure that there might not be countries in which no punishment at all would inevitably follow but so near the nerbudda this could not be the casel providence could never suffer beef to be eaten so near her sacred majesty without visiting the crops with blight hail or some other calamity and the people with cholera morbus smallpox and other great pestilences as for himself he should never be persuaded that all these afflictions did not arise wholly and solely from this dreadful habit of eating beef i declare concluded he that if the government would but consent to prohibit the eating of beef it might levy from the lands three times the revenue that they now pay the great festival of the holī the saturnalia of india terminates on the last day of phālgun or th of march on that day the holī is burned and on that day the ravages of the monster for monster they will have it to be are supposed to cease any field that has remained untouched up to that time is considered to be quite secure from the moment the holī has been committed to the flames what gave rise to the notion i have never been able to discover but such is the general belief i suppose the siliceous epidermis must then have become too hard and the pores in the stem too much closed up to admit of the further depredation of the fungi in the latter end of while i was at sāgar a cowherd in driving his cattle to water at a reach of the biās river called the nardhardhār near the little village of jasrathī was reported to have seen a vision that told him the waters of that reach taken up and conveyed to the fields in pitchers would effectually keep off the blight from the wheat provided the pitchers were not suffered to touch the ground on the way on reaching the field a small hole was to be made in the bottom of the pitcher so as to keep up a small but steady stream as the bearer carried it round the borders of the field that the water might fall in a complete ring except at a small openingwhich was to be kept dry in order that the monster or demon blight might make his escape through it not being able to cross over any part watered by the holy stream the waters of the bias river generally are not supposed to have any peculiar virtues the report of this vision spread rapidly over the country and the people who had been suffering under so many seasons of great calamity were anxious to try anything that promised the slightest chance of relief every cultivator of the district prepared pots for the conveyance of the water with tripods to support them while they rested on the road that they might not touch the ground the spot pointed out for taking the water was immediately under a fine large pīpaltreel which had fallen into the river and on each bank was seated a bairāgī or priest of vishnu the blight began to manifest itself in the alsī linseed in january but the wheat is never considered to be in danger till late in february when it is nearly ripe and during that month and the following the banks of the river were crowded with people in search of the water some of the people came more than one hundred miles to fetch it and all seemed quite sure that the holy water would save them each person gave the bairāgī priest of his own side of the river two halfpence copper pice two pice weight of ghī clarified butter and two pounds of flour before he filled his pitcher to secure his blessings from it these priests were strangers and the offerings were entirely voluntary the roads from this reach of the bias river up to the capital of the orchhā rājā more than a hundred miles were literally lined with these watercarriers and i estimated the number of persons who passed with the water every day for six weeks at ten thousand a day after they had ceased to take the water the banks were long crowded with people who flocked to see the place where priests and waters had worked such miracles and to try and discover the source whence the water derived its virtues it was remarked by some that the pīpaltree which had fallen from the bank above many years before had still continued to throw out the richest foliage from the branches above the surface of the water others declared that they saw a monkey on the bank near the spot which no sooner perceived it was observed than it plunged into the stream and disappeared others again saw some flights of steps under the water indicating that it had in days of yore been the site of a temple whose god no doubt gave to the waters the wonderful virtues it had been found to possess the priests would say nothing but that it was the work of god and like all his works beyond the reach of mans understanding they made their fortunes and got up the vision and miracle no doubt for that especial purposel as to the effect i was told by hundreds of farmers who had tried the waters that though it had not anywhere kept the blight entirely off from the wheat it was found that the fields which had not the advantages of water were entirely destroyed and where the pot had been taken all round the field without leaving any dry opening for the demon to escape through it was almost as bad but when a small opening hadbeen left and the water carefully dropped around the field elsewhere the crops had been very little injured which showed clearly the efficacy of the water when all the ceremonies and observances prescribed by the vision had been attended to i could never find the cowherd who was said to have seen this vision and in speaking to my old friend the sadr amīn learned in the shāstras on the subject i told him that we had a short saying that would explain all this a drowning man catches at a straw yes said he without any hesitation and we have another just as good for the occasion sheep will follow each other though it should be into a well notes we are told in samuel chap xxiv that the deity was displeased at a census of the people taken by joab by the order of david and destroyed of the people of israel seventy thousand

very steep the whole being a bed of brown syenite generally exposed to the surface in a decomposing state intersected by veins and beds of quartz rocks and here and there a narrow and shallow bed of dark basalt one of these beds of basalt was converted into grey syenite by a large granular mixture of white quartz and feldspar with the black hornblende from this rock the people form their sugarmills which are made like a pestle and mortar the mortar being cut out of the hornblende rock and the pestle out of wood we saw a great many of these mortars during the march that could not have been in use for the last halfdozen centuries but they are precisely the same as those still used all over india the driver sits upon the end of the horizontal beam to which the bullocks are yoked and in cold mornings it is very common to see him with a pair of good hot embers at his buttocks resting upon a little projection made behind him to the beam for the purpose of sustaining it sic i am disposed to think that the most productive parts of the surface of bundēlkhand like that of some of the districts of the nerbudda territories which repose upon the back of the sandstone of the vindhya chain is sic fast flowing off to the sea through the great rivers which seem by degrees to extend the channels of their tributary streams into every mans field to drain away its substance by degrees for the benefit of those who may in some future age occupy the islands of their delta i have often seen a valuable estate reduced in value to almost nothing in a few years by some new antennae if i may so call them thrown out from the tributary streams of great rivers into their richest and deepest soils declivities are formed the soil gets nothing from the cultivator but the mechanical aid of the plough and the more its surface is ploughed and crossploughed the more of its substance is washed away towards the bay of bengal in the ganges or the gulf of cambay in the nerbudda in the districts of the nerbudda we often see these black hornblende mortars in which sugarcanes were once pressed by a happy peasantry now standing upon a bare and barren surface of sandstone rock twenty feet above the present surface of the culturable lands of the country there are evident signs of the surface on which they now stand having been that on which they were last worked the people get more juice from their small strawcoloured canes in these pestleandmortar mills than they can from those with cylindrical rollers in the present rude state of the mechanical arts all over india and the strawcoloured cane is the only kind that yields good sugar the large purple canes yield a watery and very inferior juice and are generally and almost universally sold in the markets as a fruit the strawcoloured canes from being crowded under a very slovenly system with little manure and less weeding degenerate into a mere reed the otaheite cane which was introduced into india by me in has spread over the nerbudda and many other territories but that that will degenerate in the same manner under the same slovenly system of tillage is too probable notes the lake known as barwā sāgar was formed by a bundēla chief who constructed an embankment nearly threequarters of a mile long to retain the waters of the barwā stream a tributary of the betwā the work was begun in and completed in the

i pp and the rude sketch given here in the authors text is not worth reproduction the pestleandmortar pattern of mill above described is the indigenous model formerly in universal use in india but in most parts of the country where stone is not available the mortar portion was made of wood the stone mills are expensive in the bānda and hamīrpur districts of bundēlkhand sugarcane is now grown only in the small areas where good loam soil is found the method of cultivation differs in several respects from that practised in the gangetic plains but the editor never observed the slovenliness of which the author complains he always found the cultivation in sugarcane villages to be extremely careful and laborious ancient stone mills are sometimes found in black soil country and it is difficult to understand how sugarcane can ever have been grown there the author was mistaken in supposing that the indigenous pattern of mill is superior to a good roller mill the indigenous mill has been completely superseded in most parts of the panjāb united provinces and bihār by the roller mill patented by messrs mylne and thompson of bihīa in and largely improved by subsequent modifications the original patent having expired thousands of roller mills are annually made by native artisans with little regard to the rights of the bihīa firm the iron rollers cast in delhi and other places are completed on costly lathes in many country towns the mills are generally hired out for the season and kept in repair by the speculator the rājā of nāhan or sirmūr in the panjāb who has a foundry employing six hundred men does a large business of this kind and finds it profitable since the first patent was taken out manyimprovements in the design have been effected and the best mills squeeze the cane absolutely dry messrs mylne and thompson have been successful in introducing other improved machinery for the manufacture of sugar in villages the rosa factory near shahjahānpur in the united provinces makes sugar on a large scale by european methods when the author says that the large canes are sold as a fruit he means that the canes are used for eating or rather sucking like a sugarstick the varieties of sugarcane are numerous and the names vary much in different districts according to balfour the otaheite tahiti cane is probably saccharum violaceum the ordinary indian kinds belong to the species saccharum officinarum the otaheite cane was introduced into the west indies about and came to india from the mauritius it is more suitable for the roller mill than for the indigenous mill the stems being hard cyclopaedia of india rd ed sv saccharum in a letter dated december the author refers to his introduction of the otaheite cane and mentions that the indian agricultural society awarded him a gold medal for this service the cane was first planted in the government botanical garden at calcutta chapter interview with the chiefs of jhānsīdisputed succession on the th we came on fourteen miles to jhānsī about five miles from our last ground we crossed the baitantī river over a bed of syenite at this river we mounted our elephant to cross as the water was waistdeep at the ford my wife returned to her palankeen as soon as we had crossed but our little boy came on with me on the elephant to meet the grand procession which i knew was approaching to greet us from the city the rājā of jhānsī rām chandar rāo died a few months ago leaving a young widow and a mother but no child he was a young man of about twentyeight years of age timid but of good capacity and most amiable disposition my duties brought us much into communication and though we never met we had conceived a mutual esteem for each other he had been long suffering from an affection of the liver and had latterly persuaded himself that his mother was practising upon his life with a view to secure the government to the eldest son of her daughter which would she thought ensure the real power to her for life that she wished him dead with this view i had no doubt for she had ruled the state for several years up to during what she was pleased to consider his minority and she surrendered the power into his hands with great reluctance since it enabled her to employ her paramour as minister and enjoy his society as much as she pleased under the pretence of holding privy councils upon affairs of great public interest he used to communicate his fears to me and i was not without apprehension that his mother might some day attempt to hasten his death by poison about a month before his death he wrote to me to say that spears had been found stuck in the ground under the water where he was accustomed to swim with their sharp points upwards and had he not contrary to his usual practice walked into the water and struck his foot against one of them he must have been killed this was no doubt a thing got up by some designing person who wanted to ingratiate himself with the young man for the mother was too shrewd a woman ever to attempt her sons life by such awkward means about four months before i reached the capital this amiable young prince died leaving two paternal uncles a mother a widow and one sister the wife of one of our sāgar pensioners morīsar rāo the mother claimed the inheritance for her grandson by this daughter a very handsome young lad then at jhānsī on the pretence that her son had adopted him on his deathbed she had his head shaved and made him go through all the other ceremonies of mourning as for the death of his real father the eldest of his uncles raghunāth rāo claimed the inheritance as the next heir and all his party turned the young lad out of caste as a brahman for daring to go into mourning for a father who was yet alive one of the greatest of crimes according to hindoo law for they would not admit that he had been adopted by the deceased prince the question of inheritance had been referred for decision to the supreme government through the prescribed channel when i arrived and the decision was every day expected the mother with her daughter and grandson and the widow occupied the castle situated on a high hill overlooking the city while the two uncles of the deceased occupied their private dwellings in the city below raghunāth rāo the eldest headed the procession that came out to meet me about three miles mounted upon a fine female elephant with his younger brother by his side the minister nārū gopāl followed mounted upon another on the part of the mother and widow some of the rājās relations were upon two of the finest male elephants i have ever seen and some of their friends with the bakshī or paymaster always an important personage upon two others raghunāth rāos elephant drew up on the right of mine and that of the minister on the left and after the usual compliments had passed between us all the others fell back and formed a line in our rear they had about fifty troopers mounted upon very fine horses in excellent condition which curvetted before and on both sides of us together with a good many men on camels and some four or five hundred foot attendants all well dressed but in various costumes the elephants were so close to each other that the conversation which we managed to keep up tolerably well was general almost all the way to our tents every man taking a part as he found the opportunity of a pause to introduce his little compliment to the honourable company or to myself which i did my best to answer or divert i was glad to see the affectionate respect with which the old man was everywhere received for i had in my own mind no doubt whatever that the decision of the supreme government would be in his favour the whole cortège escorted me through the town to my tent which was pitched on the other side and then they took their leave still seated on their elephants while i sat on mine with my boy on my knee till all had made their bow and departed the elephants camels and horses were all magnificently caparisoned and the housings of the whole were extremely rich a good many of the troopers were dressed in chainarmour which worn outside their lightcoloured quilted vests looked very like black gauze scarfs my little friend the sarīmants own elephant had lately died and being unable to go to the cost of another with all its appendages he had come thus far on horseback a native gentleman can never condescend to ride an elephant without a train of at least a dozen attendants on horsebackhe would almost as soon ride a horse without a tail having been considered at one time as the equal of all these rājās i knew that he would feel a little mortified at finding himself buried in the crowd and dust and invited him as we approached the city to take a seat by my side this gained himconsideration and evidently gave him great pleasure it was late before we reached our tents as we were obliged to move slowly through the streets of the city as well for our own convenience as for the safety of the crowd on foot before and around us my wife who had gone on before to avoid the crowd and dust reached the tents halt an hour before us in the afternoon when my second large tent had been pitched the minister came to pay me a visit with a large train of followers but with little display and i found him a very sensible mild and gentlemanly man just as i expected from the high character he bears with both parties and with the people of the country generally any unreserved conversation here in such a crowd was of course out of the question and i told the minister that it was my intention early next morning to visit the tomb of his late master where i should be very glad to meet him if he could make it convenient to come without any ceremony he seemed much pleased with the proposal and next morning we met a little before sunrise within the railing that encloses the tomb or cenotaph and there had a good deal of quiet and i believe unreserved talk about the affairs of the jhānsī state and the family of the late prince he told me that a few hours before the rājās death his mother had placed in his arms for adoption the son of his sister a very handsome lad of ten years of agebut whether the rājā was or was not sensible at the time he could not say for he never after heard him speak that the mother of the deceased considered the adoption as complete and made her grandson go through the funeral ceremonies as at the death of his father which for nine days were performed unmolested but when it came to the tenth and lastwhich had it passed quietly would have been considered as completing the title of adoptionraghunāth rāo and his friends interposed and prevented further proceedings declaring that while there were so many male heirs no son could be adopted for the deceased prince according to the usages of the family the widow of the rājā a timid amiable young woman of twentyfive years of age was by no means anxious for this adoption having shared the suspicions of her husband regarding the practices of his mother and found his sister who now resided with them in the castle a most violent and overbearing woman who would be likely to exclude her from all share in the administration and make her life very miserable were her son to be declared the rājā her wish was to be allowed to adopt in the name of her deceased husband a young cousin of his sadāsheo the son of nānā bhāo gangādhar the younger brother of raghunāth rāo was exceedingly anxious to have his elder brother declared rājā because he had no sons and from the debilitated state of his frame must soon die and leave the principality to him every one of the three parties had sent agents to the governorgenerals representative in bundēlkhand to urge their claim and till the final decision the widow of the late chief was to be considered the sovereign the minister told me that there was one unanswerable argument against raghunāth rāos succeeding which out of regard to his feelings he had not yet urged and about which he wished to consult me as a friend of the late prince and his widow this was that he was a leper and that the signs of the disease were becoming every day more and more manifest i told him that i had observed them in his face but was not aware that any one else had noticed them i urged him however not to advance this as a ground of exclusion since they all knew him to be a very worthy man while his younger brother was said to be the reverse and more especially i thought it would be very cruel and unwise to distress and exasperate him by so doing as i had no doubt that before this ground could be brought to their notice government would declare in his favour right being so clearly on his side after an agreeable conversation with this sensible and excellent man i returned to my tents to prepare for the reception of raghunāth rāo and his party they came about nine oclock with a much greater display of elephants and followers than the minister had brought with him he and his friends kept me in close conversation till eleven oclock in spite of my wifes many considerate messages to say breakfast was waiting he told me that the mother of the late rājā his nephew was a very violent woman who had involved the state in much trouble during the period of her regency which she managed to prolong till her son was twentyfive years of age and resigned with infinite reluctance only three years ago that her minister during her regency gangadhar mūlī was at the same time her paramour and would be surely restored to power and to her embraces were her grandsons claim to the succession recognized that it was with great difficulty he had been able to keep this atrocious character under surveillance pending the consideration of their claims by the supreme government that by having the head of her grandson shaved and making him go through all the other funeral ceremonies with the other members of the family she had involved him and his young innocent wife who had unhappily continued to drink out of the same cup with her husband in the dreadful crime of mourning for a father whom they knew to be yet alive a crime that must be expiated by the prāyaschit whichwould be exacted from the young couple on their return to sāgar before they could be restored to caste from which they were now considered as excommunicated as for the young widow she was everything they could wish but she was so timid that she would be governed by the old lady if she should have any ostensible part assigned her in the administration i told the old gentleman that i believed it would be my duty to pay the first visit to the widow and mother of the late prince as one of pure condolence and that i hoped my doing so would not be considered any mark of disrespect towards him who must now be looked up to as the head of the family he remonstrated against this most earnestly and at last tears came into his eyes as he told me that if i paid the first visit to the castle he should never again be able to show his face outside his door so great would be the indignity he would be considered to have suffered but rather than i should do this he would come to my tents and escort me himself to the castle much was to be said on both sides of the weighty question but at last i thought that the arguments were in his favourthat if i went to the castle first he might possiblyresent it upon the poor woman and the prime minister when he came into power as i had no doubt he soon wouldand that i might be consulting their interest as much as his feelings by going to his house first in the evening i received a message from the old lady urging the necessity of my paying the first visit of condolence for the death of my young friend to the widow and mother the rights of mothers said she are respected in all countries and in india the first visit of condolence for the death of a man is always due to the mother if alive i told the messenger that my resolution was unaltered and would i trusted be found the best for all parties under present circumstances i told him that i dreaded the resentment towards them of raghunāth rāo if he came into power never mind that said he my mistress is of too proud a spirit to dread resentment from any onepay her the compliment of the first visit and let her enemies do their worst i told him that i could leave jhānsī without visiting either of them but could not go first to the castle and he said that my departing thus would please the old lady better than the second visit the minister would not have said thisthe old lady would not have ventured to send such a message by himthe man was an understrapper and i left him to mount my elephant and pay my two visits with the best cortège i could muster i went to raghunāth rāos where i was received with a salute from some large guns in his courtyard and entertained with a party of dancing girls and musicians in the usual manner attar of roses and pān were given and valuable shawls put before me and refused in the politest terms i could think of such as pray do me the favour to keep these things for me till i have the happiness of visiting jhānsī again as i am going through gwālior where nothing valuable is a moment safe from thieves after sitting an hour i mounted my elephant and proceeded up to the castle where i was received with another salute from the bastions i sat for half an hour in the hall of audience with the minister and all the principal men of the court as raghunāth rāo was to be considered as a private gentleman till the decision of the supreme government should be made known and the handsome lad krishan rāo whom the old woman wished to adopt and whom i had often seen at sāgar was at my request brought in and seated by my side by him i sent my message of condolence to the widow and mother of his deceased uncle couched in the usual termsthat the happy effects of good government in the prosperity of this city and the comfort and happiness of the people had extended the fame of the family all over india and that i trusted the reigning member of that family whoever he might be would be sensible that it was his duty to sustain that reputation by imitating the example of those who had gone before him after attar of roses and pān had been handed round in the usual manner i went to the summit of the highest tower in the castle which commands an extensive view of the country around the castle stands upon the summit of a small hill of syenitic rock the elevation of the outer wall is about one hundred feet above the level of the plain and the top of the tower on which i stood about one hundred feet more as the buildings rise gradually from the sides to the summit of the hill the city extends out into the plain to the east from the foot of the hill on which the castle stands around the city there is a good deal of land irrigated from four or five tanks in the neighbourhood and now under rich wheat crops and the gardens are very numerous and abound in all the fruit and vegetables that the people most like oranges are very abundant and very fine and our tents have been actually buried in them and all the other fruits and vegetables which the kind people of jhānsī have poured in upon us the city of jhānsī contains about sixty thousand inhabitants and is celebrated for its manufacture of carpets there are some very beautiful temples in the city all built by gosāins one sic of the priests of siva who here engage in trade and accumulate much wealth the family of the chief do not build tombs and that now raised over the place where the late prince was buried is dedicated as a temple to siva and was made merely with a view to secure the place from all danger of profanation the face of the country beyond the influence of the tanks is neither rich nor interesting the cultivation seemed scanty and the population thin owing to the irremediable sterility of soil from the poverty of the primitive rock from whose detritus it is chiefly formed raghunāth rāo told me that the wish of the people in the castle to adopt a child as the successor to his nephew arose from the desire to escape the scrutiny into the past accounts of disbursements which he might be likely to order i told him that i had myself no doubt that he would be declared the rājā and urged him to turn all his thoughts to the future and to allow no inquiries to be made into the past with a view to gratify either his own resentment or that of others that the rajas of jhānsī had hitherto been served by the most respectable able and honourable men in the country while the other chiefs of bundēlkhand could get no man of this class to do their work for themthat this was the only court in bundēlkhand in which such men could be seen simply because it was the only one in which they could feel themselves securewhile other chiefs confiscated the property of ministers who had served them with fidelity on the pretence of embezzlement the wealth thus acquired however soon disappearing and its possessors being obliged either to conceal it or go out of the country to enjoy it such rulers thus found their courts and capitals deprived of all those men of wealth and respectability who adorned the courts of princes in other countries and embellished not merely their capitals but the face of their dominions in general with their chateaus and other works of ornament and utility much more of this sort passed between us and seemed to make an impression upon him for he promised to do all that i had recommended to him poor man he can have but a short and miserable existence for that dreadful disease the leprosy is making sad inroads in his system already his uncle raghunāth rāo was afflicted with it and having understood from the priests that by drowning himself in the ganges taking the samādh he should remove all traces of it from his family he went to benares and there drowned himself some twenty years ago he had no children and is said to have been the first of his family in whom the disease showed

grief some months after my visit her spirits never rallied after the death of her husband and she never ceased to regret that she had not burned herself with his remains the people of jhānsī generally believe that the princes mother brought about his death by dīnāī slow poison and i am afraid that that was the impression on the mind of the poor widow the minister who was entirely on her side and a most worthy and able man was quite satisfied that this suspicion was without any foundation whatever in truth w h s considering the fact that till the final decision the widow of the late chief was to be considered the sovereign it would be difficult to justify the anthors decision the reigning sovereign was clearly entitled to the first visit questions of precedence salutes and etiquette are as

been taught by his spiritual teachers to consider as a duty towards his family and we must admire the man while we condemn the religion and the priests there is no country in the world where parents are more reverenced than in india or where they more readily make sacrifices of all sorts for their children or for those they consider as such we succeeded in june to all the rights of the peshwā in

into the merits of their claims the governorgenerals agent assumed the administration ultimately gangādhar rāo younger brother of the leper was appointed rājā the disorder in the state rendered

the th we came on nine miles to amabāi the frontier village of the jhānsī territory bordering upon datiyā where i had to receive the farewell visits of many members of the jhānsī parties who came on to have a quiet opportunity to assure me that whatever may be the final order of the supreme government they will do their best for the good of the people and the state for i have always considered jhānsī among the native states of bundēlkhand as a kind of oasis in the desert the only one in which a man can accumulate property with the confidence of being permitted by its rulers freely to display and enjoy it i had also to receive the visit of messengers from the rājā of datiyā at whose capital we were to encamp the next day and finally to take leave of my amiable little friend the sarīmant who here left me on his return to sāgar with a heavy heart i really believe we talked of the common belief among the agricultural classes of villages being haunted by the spirits of ancient proprietors whom it was thought necessary to propitiate he knew he said many instances where these spirits were so very froward that the present heads of villages which they haunted and the members of their little communities found it almost impossible to keep them in good humour and their cattle and children were in consequence always liable to serious accidents of one kind or another sometimes they were bitten by snakes sometimes became possessed by devils and at others were thrown down and beaten most unmercifully any person who falls down in an epileptic fit is supposed to be thrown down by a ghost or possessed by a devil they feel little of our mysterious dread of ghosts a sound drubbing is what they dread from them and he who hurts himself in one of the fits is considered to have got it as for himself whenever he found any one of the villages upon his estate haunted by the spirit of an old patēl village proprietor he always made a point of giving him a neat little shrine and having it well endowed and attended to keep him in good humour this he thought was a duty that every landlord owed to his tenants rāmchand the pundit said that villages which had been held by old gond mountaineer proprietors were more liable than any other to those kinds of visitations that it was easy to say what village was and was not haunted but often exceedingly difficult to discover to whom the ghost belonged this once discovered his nearest surviving relation was of course expected to take steps to put him to rest but said he it is wrong to suppose that the ghost of an old proprietor must be always doing mischief he is often the best friend of the cultivators and of the present proprietor too if he treats him with proper respect for he will not allow the people of any other village to encroach upon their boundaries with impunity and they will be saved all the expense and annoyance of a reference to the adālat judicial tribunals for the settlement of boundary disputes it will not cost much to conciliate these spirits and the money is generally well laid out several anecdotes were told me in illustration and all that i could urge against the probability or possibility of such visitation appeared to them very inconclusive and unsatisfactory they mentioned the case of the family of village proprietors in the sāgar district who had for several generations at every new settlement insisted upon having the name of the spirit of the old proprietor inserted in the lease instead of their own and thereby secured his good graces on all occasions mr fraser had before mentioned this case to me in august while engaged in the settlement of the land revenue of the sāgar district for twenty years he was about to deliver the lease of the estate made out in due form to the head of the family a very honest and respectable old gentleman when he asked him respectfully in whose name it had been made out in yours to be sure have you not renewed your lease for twenty years the old man in a state of great alarm begged him to have it altered immediately or he and his family would all be destroyedthat the spirit of the ancient proprietor presided over the village community and its interests and that all affairs of importance were transacted is his name he is said the old man a very jealous spirit and will not admit of any living man being considered for a moment as a proprietor or joint proprietor of the estate it has been held by me and my ancestors immediately under government for many generations but the lease deeds have always been made out in his name and ours have been inserted merely as his managers or bailiffswere this good old rule under which we have so long prospered to be now infringed we should all perish under his anger mr fraser found upon inquiring that this had really been the case and to relieve the old man and his family from their fears he had the papers made out afresh and the ghost inserted as the proprietor the modes of flattering and propitiating these beings natural and supernatural who are supposed to have the power to do mischief are endless while i was in charge of the district of narsinghpur in the valley of the nerbudda in a cultivator of the village of bēdū about twelve miles distant from my court was one day engaged in the cultivation of his field on the border of the village of barkharā which was supposed to be haunted by the spirit of an old proprietor whose temper was so froward and violent that the lands could hardly be let for anything for hardly any man would venture to cultivate them lest he might unintentionally incur his ghostships displeasure the poor cultivator after begging his pardon in secret ventured to drive his plough a few yards beyond the proper line of his boundary and thus add half an acre of barkharā to his own little tenement which was situated in bēdū that very night his only son was bitten by a snake and his two bullockswere seized with the murrain in terror he went of to the village temple confessed his sin and vowed not only to restore the halfacre of land to the village of barkharā but to build a very handsome shrine upon the spot as a perpetual sign of his repentance the boy and the bullocks all three recovered and the shrine was built and is i believe still to be seen as the boundary mark the fact was that the village stood upon an elevated piece of ground rising out of a moist plain and a colony of snakes had taken up their abode in it the bites of these snakes had on many occasions proved fatal and such accidents were all attributed to the anger of a spirit which was supposed to haunt the village at one time under the former government no one would take a lease of the village on any terms and it had become almost entirely deserted though the soil was the finest in the whole district with a view to remove the whole prejudices of the people the governor goroba pundit took the lease himself at the rent of one thousand rupees a year and in the month of june went from his residence twelve miles with ten of his own ploughs to superintend the commencement of so perilous an undertaking on reaching the middle of the village situated on the top of the little hill he alighted from his horse sat down upon a carpet that had been spread for him under a large and beautiful banyantree and began to refresh himself with a pipe before going to work in the fields as he quaffed his hookah and railed at the follies of the men whose absurd superstitions had made them desert so beautiful a village with so noble a tree in its centre his eyes fell upon an enormous black snake which had coiled round one of its branches immediately over his head and seemed as if resolved at once to pounce down and punish him for his blasphemy he gave his pipe to his attendant mounted his horse from which the saddle had not yet been taken and never pulled rein till he got home nothing could ever induce him to visit this village again though he was afterwards employed under me as a native collector and he has often told me that he verily believed this was the spirit of the old landlord that he had unhappily neglected to propitiate before taking possession my predecessor in the civil charge of that district the late mr lindsay of the bengal civil service again tried to remove the prejudices of the people against the occupation and cultivation of this fine village it had never been measured and all the revenue officers backed by all the farmers and cultivators of the neighbourhood declared that the spirit of the old proprietor would never allow it to be so mr lindsay was a good geometrician and had long been in the habit of superintending his revenue surveys himself and on this occasion be thought himself particularly called upon to do so a new measuring cord was made for the occasion and with fear and trembling all his officers attended him to the first field but in measuring it the rope by some accident broke poor lindsay was that morning taken ill and obliged to return to narsinghpur where he died soon after from fever no man was ever more beloved by all classes of the people of his district than he was and i believe there was not one person among them who did not believe him to have fallen a victim to the resentment of the spirit of the old proprietor when i went to the village some years afterwards the people in the neighbourhood all declared to me that they saw the cord with which he was measuring fly into a thousand pieces the moment the men attempted to straighten it over the first field a very respectable old gentleman from the concan or malabar coast told me one day that every man there protects his field of corn and his fruittree by dedicating it to one or other of the spirits which there abound or confiding it to his guardianship he sticks up something in the field or ties on something to the tree in the name of the said spirit who from that moment feels himself responsible for its safe keeping if any one without permission from the proprietor presumes to take either an ear of corn from the field or fruit from the tree he is sure to be killed outright or made extremely ill no other protection is required said the old gentleman for our fields and fruittrees in that direction though whole armies should have to march through them i once saw a man come to the proprietor of a jacktree embrace his feet and in the most piteous manner implore his protection he asked what was the matter i took said the man a jack from your tree yonder three days ago as i passed at night and i have been suffering dreadful agony in my stomach ever since the spirit of the tree is upon me and you only can pacify him the proprietor took up a bit of cowdung moistened it and made a mark with it upon the mans forehead in the name of the spirit and put some of it into the knot of hair on the top of his head he had no sooner done this than the mans pains all left him and he went off vowing never again to give similar cause of offence to one of these guardian spirits men said my old friend do not die there in the same regulated spirit with their thoughts directed exclusively towards god as in other parts and whether a mans spirit is to haunt the world or not after his death all depends on that notes december datiyā datia dutteeah is a small state with an area of about square miles

dry and poor soil thinly and only partially covering a bed of brown and grey syenite with veins of quartz and feldspar and here and there dykes of basalt and a few boulders scattered over the surface the old rājā parīchhit on one elephant and his cousin dalīp singh upon a second and several of their relations upon others all splendidly caparisoned came out two miles to meet us with a very large and splendid cortège my wife as usual had gone on in her palankeen very early to avoid the crowd and dust of this istikbāl or meeting and my little boy henry went on at the same time in the palankeen having got a slight fever from too much exposure to the sun in our slow and stately entrance into jhānsī there were more men in steel chain armour in this cortège than in that of jhānsī and though the elephants were not quite so fine they were just as numerous while the crowd of foot attendants was still greater they were in fancy dresses individually handsome and collectively picturesque though being all soldiers not quite pleasing to the eye of a soldier i remarked to the rājā as we rode side by side on our elephants that we attached much importance to having our soldiers all in uniform dresses according to their corps while he seemed to care little about these matters yes said the old man with a smile with me every man pleases himself in his dress and i care not what he wears provided it is neat and clean they certainly formed a body more picturesque from being allowed individually to consult their own fancies in their dresses for the native taste in dress is generally very good our three elephants came on abreast and the rājā and i conversed as freely as men in such situations can converse he is a stout cheerful old gentleman as careless apparently about his own dress as about that of his soldiers and a much more sensible and agreeable person than i expected and i was sorry to learn from him that he had for twelve years been suffering from an attack of sciatica on one side which had deprived him of the use of one of his legs i was obliged to consent to halt the next day that i might hunt in his preserve ramnā in the morning and return his visit in the evening in the rājās cortege there were several men mounted on excellent horses who carried guitars and played upon them and sang in a very agreeable style i had never before seen or heard of such a band and was both surprised and pleased the great part of the wheat gram and other exportable land produce which the people consume as far as we have yet come is drawn from our nerbudda districts and those of mālwa which border upon them and par conséquent the price has been rapidly increasing as we recede from them in our advance northward were the soil of those nerbudda districts situated as they are at such a distance from any great market for their agricultural products as bad as it is in the parts of bundēlkhand that i came over no net surplus revenue could possibly be drawn from them in the present state of arts and industry the high prices paid here for land produce arising from the necessity of drawing a great part of what is consumed from such distant lands enables the rājās of these bundēlkhand states to draw the large revenue they do these chiefs expend the whole of their revenue in the maintenance of public establishments of one kind or other and as the essential articles of subsistence wheat and gram c which are produced in their own districts or those immediately around them are not sufficient for the supply of these establishments they must draw them from distant territories all this produce is brought on the backs of bullocks because there is no road from the districts whence they obtain it over which a wheeled carriage can be drawn with safety and as this mode of transit is very expensive the price of the produce when it reaches the capitals around which these local establishments are concentrated becomes very high they must pay a price equal to the collective cost of purchasing and bringing this substance from the most distant districts to which they are at any time obliged to have recourse for a supply or they will not be supplied and as there cannot be two prices for the same thing in the same market the wheat and gram produced in the neighbourhood of one of these bundēlkhand capitals fetch as high a price there as that brought from the most remote districts on the banks of the nerbudda river while it costs comparatively nothing to bring it from the former lands to the markets such lands in consequence yield a rate of rent much greater compared with their natural powers of fertility than those of the remotest districts whence produce is drawn for these markets or capitals and as all the lands are the property of the rājās they drew all those rents as revenue were we to take this revenue which the rajas now enjoy in tribute for the maintenance of public establishments concentrated at distant seats all these local establishments would of course be at once disbanded and all the effectual demand which they afford for the raw agricultural produce of distant districts would cease the price of this produce would diminish in proportion and with it the value of the lands of the districts around such capitals hence the folly of conquerors and paramount powers from the days of the greeks and romans down to those of lord hastings and sir john malcolm who were all bad political economists supposing that conquered and ceded territories could always be made to yield to a foreign state the same amount of gross revenue as they had paid to their domestic government whatever their situation with reference to the markets for their producewhatever the state of their arts and their industry and whatever the character and extent of the local establishments maintained out of it the settlements of the land revenue in all the territories acquired in central india during the marāthā war which ended in were made upon thesupposition that the lands would continue to pay the same rate of rent under the new as they had paid under the old government uninfluenced by the diminution of all local establishments civil and military to onetenth of what they had been that under the new order of things all the waste lands must be brought into tillage and be able to pay as high a rate of rent as before tillage and consequently that the aggregate available net revenue must greatly and rapidly increase those who had the making of the settlements and the governing of these new territories did not consider that the diminution of every establishment was the removal of a market of an effectual demand for land produce and that when all the waste lands should be brought into tillage the whole would deteriorate in fertility from the want of fallows under the prevailing system of agriculture which afforded the lands no other means of renovation from overcropping the settlements of land which were made throughout our new land acquisitions upon these fallacious assumptions of course failed during a series of quinquennial settlements the assessment has been everywhere gradually reduced to about twothirds of what it was when our rule began to less than onehalf of what sir john malcolm and all the other local authorities and even the worthy marquis of hastings himself under the influence of their opinions expected it would be the land revenues of the native princes of central india who reduced their public establishments which the new order of things seemed to render useless and thereby diminished the only markets for the raw produce of their lands have been everywhere falling off in the same proportion and scarcely one of them now draws twothirds of the income he drew from the same lands in there are in the valley of the nerbudda districts that yield a great deal more produce every year than either orchhā jhānsī or datiyā and yet from the want of the same domestic markets they do not yield onefourth of the amount of land revenue the lands are however rated equally high to the assessment in proportion to their value to the farmers and cultivators to enable them to yield a larger revenue to government they require to have larger establishments as markets for land produce these establishments may be either public and paid by government or they may be private as manufactories by which the land produce of these districts would be consumed by people employed in investing the value of their labour in commodities suited to the demand of distant markets and more valuable than land produce in proportion to their weight and bulk these are the establishments which government should exert itself to introduce and foster since the valley of the nerbudda in addition to a soil exceedingly fertile has in its whole line from its source to its embouchure rich beds of coal reposing for the use of future generations under the sandstone of the sātpura and vindhya ranges and beds no less rich of very fine iron these advantages have not yet been justly appreciated but they will be so by and by about halfpast four in the afternoon of the day we reached datiyā i had a visit from the rājā who came in his palankeen with a very respectable but not very numerous or noisy train and he sat with me about an hour my large tents were both pitched parallel to each other about twenty paces distant and united to each other at both ends by separate kanāts or cloth curtains my little boy was present and behaved extremely well in steadily refusing without even a look from me a handful of gold mohurs which the rājā pressed several times upon his acceptance i received him at the door of my tent and supported him upon my arm to his chair as he cannot walk without some slight assistance from the affection already mentioned in his leg a salute from the guns at his castle announced his departure and return to it after the audience lieutenant thomas and i ascended to the summit of a palace of the former rājās of this state which stands upon a high rock close inside the eastern gate of the city whence we could see to the west of the city a still larger and handsomer palace standing i asked our conductors the rājās servants why it was unoccupied no prince these degenerate days said they could muster a family and court worthy of such a palacethe family and court of the largest of them would within the walls of such a building feel as if they were in a desert such palaces were made for princes of the older times who were quite different beings from those of the present day from the deserted palace we went to the new garden which is preparing for the young rājā an adopted son of about ten years of age it is close to the southern wall of the city and is very extensive and well managed the orangetrees are all grafted and sinking under the weight of as fine fruit as any in india attempting to ascend the steps of an empty bungalow upon a raised terrace at the southern extremity of the garden the attendants told us respectfully that they hoped we would take off our shoes if we wished to enter as the ancestor of the rājā by whom it was built rām chand had lately become a god and was there worshipped the roof is of stone supported on carved stone pillars on the centre pillar upon a ground of whitewash is a hand or trident this is the only sign of a sacred character the building has yet assumed and i found that it owed this character of sanctity to the circumstance of some one having vowed an offering to the manes of the builder if he obtained what his soul most desired and having obtained it all the people believe that those who do the same at the same place in a pure spirit of faith will obtain what they pray for i made some inquiries about hardaul lāla the son of bīrsingh deo who built the fort of dhamonī one of the ancestors of the datiyā rājā and found that he was as much worshipped here at his birthplace as upon the banks of the nerbudda as the supposed great originator of the cholera morbus there is at datiyā a temple dedicated to him and much frequented and one of the priests brought me a flower in his name and chanted something indicating that hardaul lāla was now worshipped even so far as the british capital of calcutta i asked the old prince what he thought of the origin of the worship of this his ancestor and he told me that when the cholera broke out first in the camp of lord hastings then pitched about three stages from his capital on the bank of the sindh at chāndpur sunārī several people recovered from the disease immediately after making votive offerings in his name and that he really thought the spirit of his greatgrandfather had worked some wonderful cures upon people afflicted with this dreadful malady the town of datiyā contains a population of between forty and fifty thousand souls the streets are narrow for in buildings as in dress the rājā allows every man to consult his own inclinations there are however a great many excellent houses in datiyā and the appearance of the place is altogether very good many of his feudatory chiefs reside occasionally in the city and have all their establishments with them a practice which does not i believe prevail anywhere else among these bundēlkhand chiefs and this makes the capital much larger handsomer and more populous than that of tehrī this indicates more of mutual confidence between the chief and his vassals and accords well with the character they bear in the surrounding countries some of the houses occupied by these barons are very pretty they spend the revenue of their distant estates in adorning them and embellishing the capital which they certainly could not have ventured to do under the late rājās of tehrī and may not possibly be able to do under the future rajas of datiyā the present minister of datiyā ganēsh is a very great knave and encourages the residence upon his masters estate of all kinds of thieves and robbers who bring back from distant districts every season vast quantities of booty which they share with him the chief himself is a mild old gentleman who would not suffer violence to be offered to any of his nobles though he would not perhaps quarrel with his minister for getting him a little addition to his revenue from without by affording a sanctuary to such kind of people as in tehrī so here the pickpockets constitute the entire population of several villages and carry their depredations northward to the banks of the indus and southward to bombay and madras but colonies of thieves and robbers like these abound no less in our own territories than in those of native states there are more than a thousand families of them in the districts of muzaffarnagar sahāranpur and meerut in the upper doāb all well enough known to the local authorities who can do nothing with them they extend their depredations into remote districts and the booty they bring home with them they share liberally with the native police and landholders under whose protection they live many landholders and police officers make large fortunes from the share they get of this booty magistrates do not molest them because they would despair of ever finding the proprietors of the property that might be found upon them and if they could trace them they would never be able to persuade them to come and enter upon a worse sea of troubles in prosecuting them these thieves and robbers of the professional classes who have the sagacity to avoid plundering near home are always just as secure in our best regulated districts as they are in the worst native states from the only three things which such depredators care about the penal laws the odium of the society in which they move and the vengeance of the god they worship and they are always well received in the society around them as long as they can avoid having their neighbours annoyed by summons to give evidence for or against them in our courts they feel quite sure of the goodwill of the god they worship provided they give a fair share of their booty to his priests and no less secure of immunity from penal laws except on very rare

castes is very great and the larger of these communities such as the sānsias each comprise many thousands of members diffused over an enormous area in several provinces it is therefore impossible to put them down except by the use of drastic measures such as no civilized european government could propose or sanction the criminal tribes or castes are to a large extent races but in many of these castes fresh blood is constantly introduced by the admission of outsiders who are willing to eat with the members of the tribe and so become for ever incorporated in the brotherhood the gipsies of

chapter sporting at datiyāfidelity of followers to their chiefs in indialaw of primogeniture wanting among muhammadans the morning after we reached datiyā i went out with lieutenant thomas to shoot and hunt in the rājās large preserve and with the humane and determined resolution of killing no more game than our camp would be likely to eat for we were told that the deer and wild hogs were so very numerous that we might shoot just as many as we pleasedl we were posted upon two terraces one near the gateway and the other in the centre of the preserve and after waiting here an hour we got each a shot at a hog hares we saw and might have shot but we had loaded all our barrels with ball for other game we left the ramnā which is a quadrangle of about one hundred acres of thick grass shrubs and brushwood enclosed by a high stone wall there is one gate on the west side and this is kept open during the night to let the game out and in it is shut and guarded during the day when the animals are left to repose in the shade except on such occasions as the present when the rājā wants to give his guests a mornings sport on the plains and woods outside we saw a good many large deer but could not manage to get near them in our own way and had not patience to try that of the natives so that we came back without killing anything or having had any occasion to exercise our forbearance the rājās people as soon as we left them went about their sport after their own fashion and brought us a fine buck antelope after breakfast they have a bullock trained to go about the fields with them led at a quick pace by a halter with which the sportsman guides him as he walks along with him by the side opposite to that facing the deer he is in pursuit of he goes round the deer as he grazes in the field shortening the distance at every circle till he comes within shot at the signal given the bullock stands still and the sportsman rests his gun upon his back and fires they seldom miss others go with a fine buck and doe antelope tame and trained to browse upon the fresh bushes which are woven for the occasion into a kind of handhurdle behind which a man creeps along over the fields towards the herd of wild ones or sits still with his matchlock ready and pointed out through the leaves the herd seeing the male and female strangers so very busily and agreeably employed upon their apparently inviting repast advance to accost them and are shot when they get within a secure distance the hurdle was filled with branches from the dhau lythrum fructuosum tree of which the jungle is for the most part composed plucked as we went along and the tame antelopes having been kept long fasting for the purpose fed eagerly upon them we had also two pairs of falcons but a knowledge of the brutal manner in which these birds are fed and taught is enough to prevent any but a brute from taking much delight in the sport they afford the officer who conducted us was evidently much disappointed for he was really very anxious as he knew his master the rājā was that we should have a good days sport on our way back i made him ride by my side and talk to me about datiyā since he had been unable to show me any sport i got his thoughts into a train that i knew would animate him if he had any soul at all for poetry or poetical recollections as i thought he had the noble works in palaces and temples said he which you see around you sir mouldering in ruins were built by princes who had beaten emperors in battle and whose spirits still hover over and protect the place several times under the late disorders which preceded your paramount rule in hindustan when hostile forces assembled around us and threatened our capital with destruction lights and elephants innumerable were seen from the tops of those battlements passing and repassing under the walls ready to defend them had the enemy attempted an assault whenever our soldiers endeavoured to approach near them they disappeared and everybody knew that they were spirits of men like bīrsingh deo and hardaul lāla that had come to our aid and we never lost confidence it is easy to understand the devotion of men to their chiefs when they believe their progenitors to have been demigods and to have been faithfully served by their ancestors for several generations we neither have nor ever can have servants so personally devoted to us as these men are to their chiefs though we have soldiers who will fight under our banners with as much courage and fidelity they know that their grandfathers served the grandfathers of these chiefs and they hope their grandchildren will serve their grandsons the one feels as much pride and pleasure in so serving as the other in being so served and both hope that the link which binds them may never be severed our servants on the contrary private and public are always in dread that some accident some trivial fault or some slight offence not to be avoided will sever for ever the link that binds them to their master the fidelity of the military classes of the people of india to their immediate chief or leader whose salt they eat has been always very remarkable and commonly bears little relation to his moral virtues or conduct to his superiors they feel that it is their duty to serve him who feeds and protects them and their families in all situations and under all circumstances and the chief feels that while he has a right to their services it is his imperative duty so to feed and protect them and their families he may change sides as often as he pleases but the relations between him and his followers remain unchanged about the side he chooses to take in a contest for dominion they ask no questions and feel no responsibility god has placed their destinies in dependence upon his and to him they cling to the last in mālwa bhopāl and other parts of central india the muhammadan rule could be established over that of the rājpūt chief only by the annihilation of the entire race of their followers in no part of the world has the devotion of soldiers to their immediate chief been more remarkable than in india among the rājpūts and in no part of the world bas the fidelity ofthese chiefs to the paramount power been more unsteady or their devotion less to be relied upon the laws of muhammad which prescribe that the property in land be divided equally among the sons leaves no rule for succession to territorial or political dominion it has been justly observed by hume the right of primogeniture was introduced with the feudal law an institution which is hurtful by producing and maintaining an unequal division of property but it is advantageous in another respect by accustoming the people to a preference for the eldest son and thereby preventing a partition or disputed succession in the monarchy among the muhammadan princes there was no law that bound the whole members of a family to obey the eldest son of a deceased prince every son of the emperor of hindustan considered that he had a right to set up his claim to the throne vacated by the death of his father and in anticipation of that death to strengthen his claim by negotiations and intrigues with all the territorial chiefs and influential nobles of the empire however prejudicial to the interests of his elder brother such measures might be they were never considered to be an invasion of his rights because such rights had never been established by the laws of their prophet as all the sons considered that they had an equal right to solicit the support of the chiefs and nobles so all the chiefs and nobles considered that they could adopt the cause of whichever son they chose without incurring the reproach of either treason or dishonour the one who

spite of the enormous pension the head of the family receives for their maintenance the city of datiyā is surrounded by a stone wall about thirty feet high with its foundation on a solid rock but it has no ditch or glacis and is capable of little or no defence against cannon in the afternoon i went accompanied by lieutenant thomas and followed by the best cortège we could muster to return the rājās visit he resides within the walls of the city in a large square garden enclosed with a high wall and filled with fine orangetrees at this time bending under the weight of the most delicious fruit the old chief received us at the bottom of a fine flight of steps leading up to a handsome pavilion built upon the wall of one of the faces of this garden it was enclosed at the back and in front looked into the garden through open arcades the floors were spread with handsome carpets of the jhānsī manufacture in front of the pavilion was a wide terrace of polished stone extending to the top of the flight of the steps and in the centre of this terrace and directly opposite to us as we looked into the garden was a fine jet deau in a large basin of water in full play and with its shower of diamonds showing off the rich green and red of the orangetrees to the best advantage the large quadrangle thus occupied is called the kila or fort and the wall that surrounds it is thirty feet high with a round embattled tower at each corner on the east face is a fine large gateway for the entrance with a curtain as high as the wall itself inside the gate is a piece of ordnance painted red with the largest calibre i ever saw this is fired once a year at the festival of the dasahra our arrival at the wall was announced by a salute from some fine brass guns upon the bastions near the gateway as we advanced from the gateway up through the garden to the pavilion we were again serenaded by our friends with their guitars and excellent voices they were now on foot and arranged along both sides of the walk that we had to pass through the open garden space within the walls appeared to me to be about ten acres it is crossed and recrossed at right angles by numerous walks having rows of plantain and other fruit trees on each side and orange pomegranate and other small fruit trees to fill the space between and anything more rich and luxuriant one can hardly conceive in the centre of the north and west sides are pavilions with apartments for the family above behind and on each side of the great reception room exactly similar to that in which we were received on the south face the whole formed i think the most delightful residence that i have seen for a hot climate there is however no doubt that the most healthy stations in this and every other hot climate are those situated upon dry open sandy plains with neither shrubberies nor basins we were introduced to the young rājā the old mans adopted son a lad of about ten years of age who is to be married in february next he is plain in person but has a pleasing expression of countenance and if he be moulded after the old man and not after his minister the country may perhaps have in him the lucky accident of a good governor i have rarely seen a finer or more prepossessing man than the rājā and all his subjects speak well of him we had an elephant a horse abundance of shawls and other fine clothes placed before us as presents but i prayed the old gentleman to keep them all for me till i returned as i was a mere voyageur without the means of carrying such valuable things in safety but he would not be satisfied till i had taken two plain hilts of swords and spears the manufacture of datiyā and of little value which lieutenant thomas and i promised to keep for his sake the rest of the presents were all taken back to their places after an hours talk with the old man and his ministers attar of roses and pān were distributed and we took our leave to go and visit the old palace which as yet we had seen only from a distance therewere only two men besides the rājā his son and ourselves seated upon chairs all the other principal persons of the court sat around crosslegged on the carpet but they joined freely in the conversation i was told by these courtiers how often the young chief had during the day asked when he could have the happiness of seeing me and the old chief was told in my hearing how many good things i had said since i came into his territories all tending to his honour and my credit this is a species of barefaced flattery to which we are all doomed to submit in our intercourse with these native chiefs but still to a man of sense it never ceases to be distressing and offensive for he can hardly ever help feeling that they must think him a mere child before they could venture to treat him with it this is however to put too harsh a construction upon what in reality the people mean only as civility and they who can so easily consider the grandfathers of their chiefs as gods and worship them as such may be suffered to treat us as heroes and sayers of good things without offence we ascended to the summit of the old palace and were well repaid for the trouble by the view of an extremely rich sheet of wheat gram and other spring crops extending to the north and east as far as the eye could reach from the dark belt of forest three miles deep with which the rājā has surrounded his capital on every side as hunting grounds the lands comprised in this forest are for the most part exceedingly poor and water for irrigation is unattainable within them so that little is lost by this taste of the chief for the sports of the field in which however he cannot himself now indulge on the th we left datiyā and after emerging from the surrounding forest came over a fine plain covered with rich spring crops for ten miles till we entered among the ravines of the river sindh whose banks are like those of all rivers in this part of india bordered to a great distance by these deep and ugly inequalities here they are almost without grass or shrubs to clothe their hideous nakedness and have been formed by the torrents which in the season of the rains rush from the extensive plain as from a wide ocean down to the deep channel of the river in narrow streams these streams cut their way easily through the soft alluvial soil which must once have formed the bed of a vast lake on coming through the forest before sunrise we discovered our error of the day before for we found excellent deershooting in the long grass and brushwood which grow luxuriantly at some distance from the city had we come out a couple of miles the day before we might have had noble sport and really required the forbearance and humanity to which we had so magnanimously resolved to sacrifice our pride of art as sportsmen for we saw many herds of the nīlgāi antelope and spotted deer browsing within a few paces of us within the long grass and brushwood on both sides of the road we could not stay however to indulge in much sport having a long march before us notes some readers may be shocked at the notion of the author shooting pig but in bundēlkhand where pigsticking or hoghunting as the

zoologists chapter bhūmiāwat though no doubt very familiar to our ancestors during the middle ages this is a thing happily but little understood in europe at the present day bhūmiāwat in bundēlkhand signifies a war or fight for landed inheritance from bhūm the land earth c bhūmia a landed proprietor when a member of the landed aristocracy no matter how small has a dispute with his ruler he collects his followers and levies indiscriminate war upon his territories plundering and burning his towns and villages and murdering their inhabitants till he is invited back upon his own terms during this war it is a point of honour not to allow a single acre of land to be tilled upon the estate which he has deserted or from which he has been driven and he will murder any man who attempts to drive a plough in it together with all his family if he can the smallest member of this landed aristocracy of the hindoo military class will often cause a terrible devastation during the interval that he is engaged in his bhūmiāwat for there are always vast numbers of loose characters floating upon the surface of indian society ready to gird up their loins and use their sharp swords in the service of marauders of this kind when they cannot get employment in that of the constituted authorities of government such a marauder has generally the sympathy of nearly all the members of his own class and clan who are apt to think that his case may one day be their own he is thus looked upon as contending for the interests of all and if his chief happens to be on bad terms with other chiefs in the neighbourhood the latter will clandestinely support the outlaw and his cause by giving him and his followers shelter in the hills and jungles and concealing their families and stolen property in their castles it is a maxim in india and in the less settled parts of it a very true one that one pindhāra or robber makes a hundred that is where one robber by a series of atrocious murders and robberies frightens the people into nonresistance a hundred loose characters from among the peasantry of the country will take advantage of the occasion and adopt his name in order to plunder with the smallest possible degree of personal risk to themselves some magistrates and local rulers under such circumstances have very unwisely adopted the measure of prohibiting the people from carrying or having arms in their houses the very thing which above all others such robbers most wish for they know though such magistrates and rulers do not that it is the innocent only and the friends to order who will obey the command the robber will always be able to conceal his arms or keep with them out of reach of the magistrate and he is now relieved altogether from the salutary dread of a shot from a door or window he may rob at his leisure or sit down like a gentleman and have all that the people of the surrounding towns and villages possess brought to him for no man can any longer attempt to defend himself or his family weak governments are obliged soon to invite back the robber on his own terms for the people can pay them no revenue being prevented from cultivating their lands and obliged to give all they have to the robbers or submit to be plundered of it jhānsī and jālaun are exceedingly weak governments from having their territories studded with estates held rentfree or at a quitrent by pawār bundēla and dhandēl barons who have always the sympathy of the numerous chiefs and their barons of the same class around in the year the pawār barons of the estates of noner jignī udgāon and bilharī in jhānsī had some cause of dissatisfaction with their chief and this they presented to lord william bentinck as he passed through the province in december his lordship told them that these were questions of internal administration which they must settle among themselves as the supreme government would not interfere they had therefore only one way of settling such disputes and that was to raise the standard of bhūmiāwat and cry to your tents o israel this they did and though the jhānsī chief had a military force of twelve thousand men they burnt down every town and village in the territory that did not come into their terms and the chief had possession of only two jhānsī the capital and the large commercial town of mau when the bundēla rājās of orchhā and datiyā who had hitherto clandestinely supported the insurgents consented to become the arbitrators a suspension of arms followed the barons got all they demanded and the bhūmiāwat ceased but the jhānsī chief who had hitherto lent large sums to the other chiefs in the province was reduced to the necessity of borrowing from them all and from gwālior and mortgaging to them a good portion of his lands gwālior is itself weak in the same way a great portion of its lands are held by barons of the hindoo military classes equally addicted to bhūmiāwat and one or more of them is always engaged in this kind of indiscriminate warfare and it must be confessed that unless they are always considered to be ready to engage in it they have very little chance of retaining their possessions on moderate terms for these weak governments are generally the most rapacious when they have it in their power a good deal of the lands of the muhammadan sovereign of oudh are in the same manner held by barons of the rājpūttribe and some of them are almost always in the field engaged in the same kind of warfare against their sovereign the baron who pursues it with vigour is almost sure to be invited back upon his own terms very soon if his lands are worth a hundred thousand a year he will get them for ten and have this remitted for the next five years until he is ready for another bhūmiāwat on the ground of the injuries sustained during the last from which his estate has to recover the baron who is peaceable and obedient soon gets rackrented out of his estate and reduced to beggary in some companies of my regiment were for several months employed in oudh after a young bhūmiāwatī of this kind sheo ratan singh he was the nephew and heir of the rājā of partābgarh who wished to exclude him from his inheritance by the adoption of a brother of his young bride sheo ratan had a small village for his maintenance and said nothing to his old uncle till the governor of the province ghulām husani accepted an invitation to be present at the ceremony of adoption he knew that if he acquiesced any longer he would lose his inheritance and cried to your tents israel he got a small band of three hundred rājpūts with nothing but their swords shields and spears to follow him all of the same clan and true men they were bivouacked in a jungle not more than seven miles from our cantonments at partābgarh when ghulām husain marched to attack them with three regiments of infantry one of cavalry and two ninepounders he thought he should surprise them and contrived so that he should come upon them about daybreak sheo ratan knew all his plans he placed one hundred and fifty of his men in ambuscade at the entrance to the jungle and kept the other hundred and fifty by him in the centre when they had got well in the party in ambush rushed upon the rear while he attacked them in front after a short resistance ghulām husains force took to flight leaving five hundred men dead on the field and their guns behind them ghulām husain was so ashamed of the drubbing he got that he bribed all the newswriters within twenty miles of the place to say nothing about it in their reports to court and he never made any report of it himself a detachment of my regiment passed over the dead bodies in the course of the day on their return to cantonments from detached command or we should have known nothing about it it is true we heard the firing but that we heard every day and i have seen from my bungalow half a dozen villages in flames at the same time from this species of contest between the rājpūt landholders and the government authorities our cantonments were generally full of the women and children who had been burnt out of house and home in oudh such contests generally begin with the harvests during the season of tillage all is quiet but when the crops begin to ripen the governor begins to rise in his demands for revenue and the rājpūt landholders and cultivators to sharpen their swords and burnish their spears one hundred of them always consider themselves a match for one thousand of the kings troops in a fair field because they have all one heart and soul while the kings troops have many while the pawārs were ravaging the jhānsī state with their bhūmiāwat a merchant of sāgar had a large convoy of valuable cloths to the amount i think of forty thousand rupees intercepted by them on its way from mirzāpur to rājputāna i was then at sāgar and wrote off to the insurgents to say that they had mistaken one of our subjects for one of the jhānsī chiefs and must release the convoy they did so and not a piece of the cloth was lost this bhūmiāwat is supposed to have cost the jhānsī chief above twenty lākhs of rupees and his subjects double that sum gopāl singh a bundēla who had been in the service of the chief of pannā took to bhūmiāwat in and kept a large british force employed in pursuit through bundēlkhand and the sāgar territories for three years till he was invited back by our government in the year by the gift of a fine estate on the banks of the dasān river yielding twenty thousand rupees a year which his son now enjoys and which is to descend to his posterity many of whom will no doubt animated by their fortunate ancestors example take to the same trade he had been a man of no note till he took to this trade but by his predatory exploits he soon became celebrated throughout india and when i came to the country no other mans chivalry was so much talked of a bundēla or other landholder of the hindoo military class does not think himself nor is he indeed thought by others in the slightest degree less respectable for having waged this indiscriminate war upon the innocent and unoffending provided he has any cause of dissatisfaction with his liege lord that is provided he cannot get his land or his appointment in his service upon his own terms because all others of the same class and clan feel more or less interested in his success they feel that their tenure of land or of office is improved by the mischief he does because every peasant he murders and every field he throws out of tillage affects their liege lord in his most tender point his treasury and indisposes him to interfere with their salaries their privileges or their rents he who wages this war goes on marrying his sisters or his daughters to the other barons or landholders of the same clan and receiving theirs in marriage during the whole of his bhūmiāwat as if nothing at all extraordinary had happened and thereby strengthening his hand at the game he is playing umrāo singh of jaklōn in chandērī a district of gwālior bordering upon sāgar has been at this game for more than fifteen years out of twenty but his alliances among the baronial families around have not been in the slightest degree affected by it his sons and his grandsons have perhaps made better matches than they might had the old man been at peace with all the world during the time that he has been desolating one district by his atrocities and demoralizing allthose around it by his example and by inviting the youth to join him occasionally in his murderous enterprises neither age nor sex is respected in their attacks upon towns or villages and no muhammadan can take more pride and pleasure in defacing idolsthe most monstrous idolthan a bhūmiāwatī takes in maiming an innocent peasant who presumes to drive his plough in lands that he chooses to put under the ban in the kingdom of oudh this bhūmiāwat is a kind of nursery for our native army for the sons of rājpūt yeomen who have been trained in it are all exceedingly anxious to enlist in our native infantry regiments having no dislike to their drill or their uniform the same class of men in bundēlkhand and the gwālior state have a great horror of the drill and uniform of our regular infantry and nothing can induce them to enlist in our ranks both are equally brave and equally faithful to their saltthat is to the person who employs them but the oudh rājpūt is a much more tameable animal than the bundēla in oudh this class of people have all inherited from their fathers a respect for our rule and a love for our service in bundēlkhand they have not yet become reconciled to our service and they still look upon our rule as interfering a good deal too much with their sporting propensities notes since the

suiciderelations between parents and children in india the day before we left datiyā our cook had a violent dispute with his mother a thing of almost daily occurrence for though a very fat and handsome old lady she was a very violent one he was a quiet man but unable to bear any longer the abuse she was heaping upon him he first took up a pitcher of water and flung it at her head it missed her and he then snatched up a stick and for the first time in his life struck her he was her only son she quietly took up all her things and walking off towards a temple said she would leave him for ever and he having passed the rubicon declared that he was resolved no longer to submit to the parental tyranny which she had hitherto exercised over him my water carrier however prevailed upon her with much difficulty to return and take up her quarters with him and his wife and five children in a small tent we had given them maddened at the thought of a blow from her son the old lady about sunset swallowed a large quantity of opium and before the circumstance was discovered it was too late to apply a remedy we were told of it about eight oclock at night and found her lying in her sons armstried every remedy at hand but without success and about midnight she died she loved her son and he respected her and yet not a day passed without their having some desperate quarrel generally about the orphan daughter of her brother who lived with them and was to be married as soon as the cook could save out of his pay enough money to defray the expenses of the ceremonies the old woman was always reproaching him for not saving money fast enough this little cousin had now stolen some of the cooks tobacco for his young assistant and the old lady thought it right to admonish her the cook likewise thought it right to add his admonitions to those of his mother but the old lady would have her niece abused by nobody but herself and she flew into a violent passion at his presuming to interfere this led to the sons outrage and the mothers suicide the son is a mild goodtempered young man who bears an excellent character among his equals and is a very good servant had he been less mild it had perhaps been better for his mother would by degrees have given up that despotic sway over her child which in infancy is necessary in youth useful but in manhood becomes intolerable god defend us from the anger of the mild in spirit said an excellent judge of human nature muhammad the founder of this cooks religion and certainly the mildest tempers are those which become the most ungovernable when roused beyond a certain degree and the proud spirit of the old woman could not brook the outrage which her son so roused had been guilty of from the time that she was discovered to have taken poison till she breathed her last she lay in the arms of the poor man who besought her to live that her only son might atone for his crime and not be a parricide there is no part of the world i believe where parents are so much reverenced by their sons as they are in india in all classes of society this is sufficiently evinced in the desire that parents feel to have sons the duty of daughters is from the day of their marriage transferred entirely to their husbands and their husbands parents on whom alone devolves the duty of protecting and supporting them through the wedded and the widowed state the links that united them to their parents are broken all the reciprocity of rights and duties which have bound together the parent and child from infancy is considered to end with the consummation of her marriage nor does the stain of any subsequent female backsliding ever affect the family of her parents it can affect that only of her husband who is held alone responsible for her conduct if a widow inherits the property of her husband on her death the property would go to her husbands brother supposing neither had any children by their husbands in preference to her own brother but between the son and his parents this reciprocity of rights and duties follows them to the grave one is delighted to see in sons this habitual reverence for the mother but as in the present case it is too apt to occasion a domineering spirit which produces much mischief even in private families but still more in sovereign ones a prince when he attains the age of manhood and ought to take upon himself the duties of the government is often obliged to witness a great deal of oppression and misrule from his inability to persuade his widowed mother to resign the power willingly into his hands he often tamely submits to see his country ruined and his family dishonoured as at jhānsī before he can bring himself by some act of desperate resolution to wrest it from her grasp in order to prevent his doing so or to recover the reins he has thus obtained the mother has often been known to poison her own son and many a princess in india like isabella of england has i believe destroyed her husband to enjoy more freely the society of her paramour and hold these reins during the minority of her son in the exercise of dominion from behind the curtain for it is those who live behind the curtain that seem most anxious to hold it women select ministers who to secure duration to their influence become their paramours or at least make the world believe that they are so to serve their own selfish purposes the sons are tyrannized over through youth by their mothers who endeavour to subdue their spirit to the yoke which they wish to bind heavy upon their necks for life and they remain through manhood timid ignorant and altogether unfitted for the conduct of public affairs and for the government of men under a despotic rule whose essential principle is a salutary fear of the prince in all his public officers every unlettered native of india is as sensible of this principle as montesquieu was and will tell us that in countries like india a chief to govern well must have a smack of the devil shaitān in him for if he has not his public servants will prey upon his innocent and industrious subjects in india there are no universities or public schools inwhich young men might escape as they do in europe from the enervating and stultifying influence of the zanāna the state of mental imbecility to which a youth of naturally average powers of mind born to territorial dominion is in india often reduced by a haughty and ambitious mother would be absolutely incredible to a man bred up in such schools they are often utterly unable to act think or speak for themselves if they happen as they sometimes do to get well informed in reading and conversation they remain hamletlike nervous and diffident and however speculatively or ruminatively wise quite unfit for action or for performing their part in the great drama of life in my evening ramble on the bank of the river which was flowing against the wind and rising into waves my mind wandered back to the hours of infancy and boyhood when i sat with my brothers watching our little vessels as they scudded over the ponds and streams of my native land and then of my poor brothers john and louis whose bones now he beneath the ocean as we advance in age the dearest scenes of early days must necessarily become more and more associated in our recollection with painful feelings for they who enjoyed such scenes with us must by degrees pass away and be remembered with sorrow even by those who are conscious of having fulfilled all their duties in life towards thembut with how much more by those who can never remember them without thinking of occasions of kindness and assistance neglected or disregarded many of them have perhaps left behind them widows and children struggling with adversity and soliciting from us aid which we strive in vain to give during my visit to the rājā a person in the disguise of one of my sipāhīs went to a shop and purchased for me fiveandtwenty rupees worth of fine europe chintz for which he paid in good rupees which were forthwith assayed by a neighbouring goldsmith the sipāhī put these rupees into his own purse and laid it down saying that he should go and ascertain from me whether i wished to keep the whole of the chintz or not and if not he should require back the same moneythat i was to halt tomorrow when he would return to the shop again just as he was going away however he recollected that he wanted a turban for himself and requested the shopkeeper to bring him one they were sitting in the verandah and the shopkeeper had to go into his shop to bring out the turban when he came out with it the sipāhī said it would not suit his purpose and went off leaving the purse where it lay cautioning the shopkeeper against changing any of the rupees as he should require his own identical money back if his master rejected any of the chintz the shopkeeper waited till four oclock in the afternoon of the next day without looking into the purse hearing then that i had left datiyā and seeing no signs of the sipāhī he opened the purse and found that the rupees were all copper with a thin coating of silver the man had changed them while he went into the shop for a turban and substituted a purse exactly the same in appearance after ascertaining that the story was true and that the ingenious thief was not one of my followers i insisted upon the mans taking the money from me

any such phrase in the works of montesquieu in chapter of book iii of lesprit des lois that author lays down the principle that il faut de la crainte dans un gouvernement despotique pour la vertu elle ny est point nécessaire it can no longer be said that universities do not exist at least in name in india calcutta bombay madras lahore and allahabad are the seats of universities and new foundations at dacca and patna are promised the indian universities when first established were mere examining bodies on the model of the university of london but changes initiated by lord curzon are in progress and the university of london is being remodelled the indian institutions are not frequented by young princes and nobles and have little influence on their education attempts have been made with partial success to provide special boarding schools or chiefs colleges for the sons of ruling princes and native nobles the most notable of such institution are the colleges at ajmēr rājkōt in kāthiāwār and indore the influence of the zanāna is invariably directed against every proposal to remove a young nobleman from home for the purpose of education and obstacles of many kinds render the task of rightly educating such a youth extraordinarily difficult and unsatisfactory in some cases a considerable degree of success has been attained armed follower the word is more familiar in the corrupt form sepoy chapter gwālior plain once the bed of a laketameness of peacocks on the th th and st we came on forty miles to the village of antrī in the gwālior territory over a fine plain of rich alluvial soil under spring crops this plain bears manifest signs of having been at no very remote period like the kingdom of bohemia the bed of a vast lake bounded by the ranges of sandstone hills which now seem to skirt the horizon all round and studded with innumerable islands of all shapes and sizes which now rise abruptly in all directions out of the cultivated plain the plain is still like the unruffled surface of a vast lake and the rich green of the spring crops which cover the surface in one wide sheet unintersected by hedges tends to keep up the illusion which the rivers have little tendency to dispel for though they have cut their way down immense depths to their present beds through this soft alluvial deposit the traveller no sooner emerges from the hideous ravines which disfigure their banks than he loses all trace of them their course is unmarked by trees large shrubs or any of the signs which mark the course of rivers in other quarters the soil over the vast plain is everywhere of good quality and everywhere cultivated or rather worked for we can hardly consider a soil cultivated which is never either irrigated or manured or voluntarily relieved by fallows or an alternation of crops till it has descended to the last stage of exhaustion the prince rackrents the farmer the farmer rackrents the cultivator and the cultivator rackrents the soil soon after crossing the sindh river we enter upon the territories of the gwālior chief sindhia the villages are everywhere few and their communities very small the greater part of the produce goes for sale to the capital of gwālior when the money it brings is paid into the treasury in rent or revenue to the chief who distributes it in salaries among his establishments who again pay it for land produce to the cultivators farmers and agricultural capitalists who again pay it back into the treasury in land revenue no more people reside in the villages than are absolutely necessary to the cultivation of the land because the chief takes all the produce beyond what is necessary for their bare subsistence and out of what he takes maintains establishments that reside elsewhere there is nowhere any jungle to be seen and very few of the villages that are scattered over the plains have any fruit or ornamental trees left and when the spring crops to which the tillage is chiefly confined are taken off the ground the face of the country must have a very naked and dreary appearance near one village on the road i saw some men threshing corn in a field and among them a peacock which of course i took to be domesticated breakfasting very comfortably upon the grain as it flew around him a little farther on i saw another quietly working his way into a stack of corn as if he understood it to have been made for his use alone it was so close to me as i passed that i put out my stick to push it off in play and to my surprise it flew off in a fright at my white face and strange dress and was followed by the others i found that they were all wild if that term can be applied to birds that live on such excellent terms with mankind on reaching our tents we found several feeding in the cornfields close around them undisturbed by our host of campfollowers and were told by the villagers who had assembled to greet us that they were all wild why said they should we think of keeping birds that live among us on such easy terms without being kept i asked whether they ever shot them and was told that they never killed or molested them but that any one who wished to shoot them might do so since they had here no religions regard for them like the pariah dogs the peacocks seem to disarm the people by confiding in themtheir tameness is at once the cause and the effect of their security the members of the little communities among whom they live on such friendly terms would not have the heart to shoot them and travellers either take them to be domesticated or are at once disarmed by their tameness at antrī a sufficient quantity of salt is manufactured for the consumption of the people of the town the earth that contains most salt is dug up at some distance from the town and brought to small reservoirs made close outside the walls water is here poured over it as over tea and coffee passing through the earth it flows out below into a small conduit which takes it to small pits some yards distance whence it is removed in buckets to small enclosed platforms where it is exposed to the suns rays till the water evaporates and leaves the salt dry the want of trees over this vast plain of fine soil from the sindh river is quite lamentable the people of antrī pointed out the place close to my tents where a beautiful grove of mangotrees had been lately taken off to gwālior for guncarriages and firewood in spite of all the proprietor could urge of the detriment to his own interest in this world and to those of his ancestors in that to which they had gone wherever the army of this chief moved they invariably swept off the groves of fruittrees in the same reckless manner parts of the country which they merely passed through have recovered their trees because the desire to propitiate the deity and to perpetuate their name by such a work will always operate among hindoos as a sufficient incentive to secure groves wherever man has be made to feel that their rights of property in the trees will be respected the lands around the village which had a well for irrigation paid four times as much as those of the same quality which had none and were made to yield two crops in the year as everywhere else so here those lands into which water flows from the town and can be made to stand for a time are esteemed the best as this water brings downwith it manures of all kinds i had a good deal of talk with the cultivators as i walked through the fields in the evenings and they seemed to dwell much upon the good faith which is observed by the farmers and cultivators in the honourable companys territories and the total absence of it in those of sindhias where no work requiring an outlay of capital from the land is in consequence ever thought ofboth

which are seemingly continuations of the vindhyan range hills of indurated brown and red iron clay repose upon and intervene between these ranges with strata generally horizontal but occasionally bearing signs of having been shaken by internal convulsions these convulsions are also indicated by some dykes of compact basalt which cross the road nothing can be more unprepossessing than the approach to gwālior the hills being naked black and ugly with rounded tops devoid of grass or shrubs and the soil of the valleys a poor red dust without any appearance of verdure or vegetation since the few autumn crops that lately stood upon them have been removed from antrī to gwālior there is no sign of any human habitation save that of a miserable police guard of four or five who occupy a wretched hut on the side of the road midway and seem by their presence to render the scene around more dreary the road is a mere footpath unimproved and unadorned by any single work of art and except in this footpath and the small police guard there is absolutely no single sign in all this long march to indicate the dominion or even the presence of man and yet it is between two contiguous sic capitals one occupied by one of the most ancient and the other by one of the greatest native sovereigns of hindustan one cannot but feel that he approaches the capital of a dynasty of barbarian princes who like attila would choose their places of residence as devils choose their pandemonia for their ugliness and rather reside in the dreary wastes of tartary than on the shores of the bosphorus there are within the dominions of sindhia seats for a capital that would not yield to any in india in convenience beauty and salubrity but in all these dominions there is not perhaps another place so hideously ugly as gwālior or so hot and unhealthy it has not one redeeming quality that should recommend it to the choice of a rational prince particularly to one who still considers his capital as his camp and makes every officer of his army feel that he has as little of permanent interest in his house as he would have in his tent phūl bāgh or the flowergarden was suggested to me as the best place for my tents where sindhia had built a splendid summerhouse as i came over this most gloomy and uninteresting march in which the heart of a rational man sickens as he recollects that all the revenues of such an enormous extent of dominion over the richest soil and the most peaceable people in the world should have been so long concentrated upon this point and squandered without leaving one sign of human art or industry i looked forward with pleasure to a quiet residence in the flowergarden with good foliage above and a fine sward below and an atmosphere free from dust such as we find in and around all the residences of muhammadan princes on reaching my tents i found them pitched close outside the flowergarden in a small dusty plain without a blade of grass or a shrub to hide its deformityjust such a place as the pigkeepers occupy in the suburbs of other towns on one side of this little plain and looking into it was the summerhouse of the prince without one inch of green sward or one small shrub before it around the wretched little flowergarden was a low naked and shattered mud wall such as we generally see in the suburbs thrown up to keep out and in the pigs that usually swarm in such placesand the swine they crawled out and the swine they crawled in when i cantered up to my tentdoor a sipāhī of my guard came up and reported that as the day began to dawn a gang of thieves had stolen one of my best carpets all the brass brackets of my tentpoles and the brass bell with which the sentries on duty sounded the hour all lieutenant thomass cooking utensils and many other things several of which they had found lying between the tents and the princes pleasurehouse particularly the contents of a large heavy box of geological specimens they had in consequence concluded the gang to be lodged in the princes pleasurehouse the guard on duty at this place would make no answer to their inquiries and i really believe that they were themselves the thieves the tents of the rājā of raghugarh who had come to pay his respects to the sindhia his liege lord were pitched near mine he had the day before had five horses stolen from him with all the plate jewels and valuable clothes he possessed and i was told that i must move forthwith from the flowergarden or cut off the tail of every horse in my camp without tails they might not be stolen with them they certainly would having had sufficient proof of their dexterity we moved our tents to a grove near the residency four miles from the flowergarden and the court as a citizen of the world i could not help thinking that it would be an immense blessing upon a large portion of our species if an earthquake were to swallow up this court of gwālior and the army that surrounds it nothing worse could possibly succeed and something better might it is lamentable to think how much of evil this court and camp inflict upon the people who are subject to them in january i was passing with a party of gentlemen through the town of bhīlsā which belongs to this chief and lies between sāgar and bhopal when we found lying and bleeding in one of the streets twelve men belonging to a merchant at mirzapore who had the day before been wounded and plundered by a gang of robbers close outside the walls of the town those who were able ran in to the āmil or chief of the district whoresides in the town and begged him to send some horsemen after the banditti and intercept them as they passed over the great plains send your own people said he or hire men to send am i here to look after the private affairs of merchants and travellers or to collect the revenues of the prince neither he nor the prince himself nor any other officer of the public establishments ever dreamed that it was their duty to protect the life property or character of travellers or indeed of any other human beings save the members of their own families in this pithy question the āmil of bhīlsā described the nature and character of the government all the revenues of his immense dominions are spent entirely in the maintenance of the court and camps of the prince and every officer employed beyond the boundary of the court and camp considers his duties to be limited to the collection of the revenue protected from all external enemies by our military forces which surround him on every side his whole army is left to him for purposes of parade and display and having according to his notions no use for them elsewhere he concentrates them around his capital where he lives among them in the perpetual dread of mutiny and assassination he has nowhere any police nor any establishment whatever for the protection of the life and property of his subjects nor has he any more than his predecessors ever i believe for one moment thought that those from whose industry and frugality he draws his revenues have any right whatever to expect from him the use of such establishments in return they have never formed any legitimate part of the marāthā government and i fear never will the misrule of such states situated in the midst of our dominions is not without its use there is as gibbon justly observes a strong propensity in human nature to depreciate the advantages and to magnify the evils of the present times and if the people had not before their eyes such specimens of native rule to contrast with ours they would think more highly than they do of that of their past muhammadan and hindoo sovereigns and be much less disposed than they are to estimate fairly the advantages of being under ours the native governments of the present day are fair specimens of what they have always beengrinding military despotismstheir whole history is that of saul has killed his thousands and david his tens of thousands as if rulers were made merely to slay and the ruled to be slain in politics as in landscape tis distance lends enchantment to the view and the past might be all couleur de rose in the imaginations of the people were it not represented in these illgoverned states where the lucky accident of a good governor is not to be expected in a century and where the secret of the responsibility of ministers to the people is yet undiscovered the fortress of gwālior stands upon a tableland a mile and a half long by a quarter of a mile wide at the northeast end of a small insulated sandstone hill running northeast and southwest and rising at both ends about three hundred and forty feet above the level of the plain below at the base is a kind of glacis which runs up at an angle of fortyfive from the plain to within fifty and in some places within twenty feet of the foot of the wall the interval is the perpendicular face of the horizontal strata of the sandstone rock the glacis is formed of a bed of basalt in all stages of decomposition with which this like the other sandstone hills of central india was once covered and of the debris and chippings of the rocks above the walls are raised a certain uniform height all round upon the verge of the precipice and being thus made to correspond with the edge of the rock the line is extremely irregular they are rudely built of the fine sandstone of the rock on which they stand and have some square and some semicircular bastions of different sizes few of these raised above the level of the wall itself on the eastern face of the rock between the glacis and foot of the wall are cut out in bold relief the colossal figures of men sitting bareheaded under canopies on each side of a throne or temple and in another place the colossal figure of a man standing naked and facing outward which i took to be that of buddhal the town of gwālior extends along the foot of the hill on one side and consists of a single street above a mile long there is a very beautiful mosque with one end built by a muhammad khan ad of the white sandstone of the rock above it it looks as fresh as if it had not been finished a month and struck as i passed it with so noble a work apparently new and under such a government i alighted from my horse went in and read the inscription which told me the date of the building and the name of the founder there is no stuccowork over any part of it nor is any required on such beautiful materials and the stones are all so nicely cut that cement seems to have been considered useless it has the usual two minarets or towers and over the arches and alcoves are carved as customary passages from the korān in the beautiful kufic characters the court and camp of the chief extends out from the southern end of the hill for several miles the whole of the hill on which the fort of gwālior stands had evidently at no very distant period been covered by a mass of basalt surmounted by a crust of indurated brown and red iron clay with lithomarge which often assumes the appearance of common laterite the boulders of basalt which still cap some part of the hill and form the greater part of the glacis at the bottom are for the most part in a state of rapid decomposition but some of them are still so hard and fresh that the hammer rings upon them as upon a bell and their fracture is brilliantly crystalline the basalt is the same as that which caps the sandstone hills of the vindhya range throughout mālwā the sandstone hills around gwālior all rise in the same abrupt manner from the plain as those through mālwā generally and they have almost all of them the same basaltic glacis at their base with boulders of that rock scattered over the top all indicating that they were at one time buried in the same manner under one great mass of volcanic matter thrown out from their submarine craters in streams of lava or diffused through the ocean or lakes in ashes and deposited in strata the geological character of thecountry about gwālior is very similar to that of the country about sāgar and i may say the same of the vindhya range generally as far as i have seen it from mirzapore on the ganges to bhopāl in mālwāhills of sandstone rising suddenly from alluvial plain and capped or bearing signs of having been capped by basalt reposing immediately upon it and partly covered in its turn

led by a very distinguished and most promising officer captain bruce brother of the celebrated traveller it was made over to us by the rānā of gohad who had been our ally in the war failing in his engagement to us he was afterwards abandoned to the resentment of mādhojī sindhia chief of the marāthās in gwālior was invested by mādhojī sindhias troops under the command of one of the most extraordinary men that have ever figured in indian history the justly celebrated general de boigne after many unsuccessful attempts to take it by escalade he bought over part of the garrison and made himself master of the place gohad itself was taken soon after in but the rānā chhatarpat made his escape he was closely pursued made prisoner at karaulī and confined in the fortress of gwālior where he died in the year he left no son and his claims upon gohad devolved upon his nephew kīrat singh who at the close of our war with the marāthās got from lord lake in lieu of these claims the estate of dholpur situated on the left banks of the river chambal which is estimated at the annual value of three hundred thousand or three lākhs of rupees he died this year and has been succeeded by his son

hoard of rupees buried in pits in the fort valued at five millions sterling was exhumed and lent to the government of india to be usefully employed the passive opposition of a court like that of gwālior to the effectual execution of reforms is continuous and difficult to overcome the authors description of the ordinary asiatic government at almost all times and in all places as a grinding

mythical as that of ireland what persia now is that would india be if she had been left to her own devices sir a cunningham was stationed at gwālior for five years and had thus an exceptionally accurate knowledge of the fortress his account which corrects the text in some particulars is as followsthe great fortress of gwālior is situated on a precipitous flattopped and isolated hill of sandstone which rises feet above the town at the north end but only feet at the upper gate of the principal entrance the hill is long and narrow its extreme length from north to south being one mile and threequarters while its breadth varies from feet opposite the main entrance to feet in the middle opposite the great temple the walls are from to feet in height and the rock immediately below them is steeply but irregularly scarped all round the hill the long line of battlements which crowns the steep scarp on the east is broken only by the lofty towers and fretted domes of the noble palace of rājā mān singh on the opposite side the line of battlements is relieved by the deep recess of the urwāhi valley and by the zigzag and serrated parapets and loopholed bastions which flank the numerous gates of the two western entrances at the northern end where the rock has been quarried for ages the jagged masses of the overhanging cliff seem ready to fall upon the city beneath them to the south the hill is less lofty but the rock has been steeply scarped and is generally quite inaccessible midway over all towers the giant form of a massive hindu temple grey with the moss of ages altogether

in ig chapter content for empire between the sons of shāh jahān under the emperors of delhi the fortress of gwālior was always considered as an imperial state prison in which they confined those rivals and competitors for dominion whom they did not like to put to a violent death they kept a large menagerie and other things for their amusement among the best of the princes who ended their days in this great prison was sulaimān shikoh the eldest son of the unhappy dārā a narrative of the contest for empire between the four sons of shāh jahān may perhaps prove both interesting and instructive and as i shall have occasion in the course of my rambles to refer to the characters who figured in it i shall venture to give it a place notes the prisons of gwālior are situated in a small outwork on the western side of the fortress immediately above the dhondha gateway they are called nau chaukī or the nine cells and are both well lighted and well ventilated but in spite of their height from fifteen to twentysix feet they must be insufferably close in the hot season these were the state prisons in which akbar confined his rebellious cousins and aurangzēb the troublesome sons of dārā and murād as well as his own more dangerous son muhammad during these times the fort was strictly guarded and no one was allowed to enter without a pass asr vol ii p sulaimān shikoh whom manucci credits

events of which the author will have frequent occasion to refer and it is introduced in this place from its connexion with gwālior the state prison in which some of its actors ended their days w h s

reflections on the preceding history the contest for the empire of india here described is very like that which preceded it between the sons of jahāngīr in which shāh jahān succeeded in destroying all his brothers and nephews and that which succeeded it forty years after in which muazzam the second of the four sons of aurangzēb did the same and it may like the rest of indian history teach us a few useful lessons first we perceive the advantages of the law of primogeniture which accustoms people to consider the right of the eldest son as sacred and the conduct of any man who attempts to violate it as criminal among muhammadans property as well real as personal is divided equally among the sons and their korān which is their only civil and criminal as well as religions code makes no provision for the successions to sovereignty the death of every sovereign is in consequence followed by a contest between his sons unless they are overawed by some paramount power and he who succeeds in this contest finds it necessary for his own security to put all his brothers and nephews to death lest they should be rescued by factions and made the cause of future civil wars but sons who exercise the powers of viceroys and command armies cannot where the succession is unsettled wait patiently for the natural death of their fatherdelay may be dangerous circumstances which now seem more favourable to their views than to those of their brothers may alter the military aristocracy depend upon the success of the chief they choose in the enterprise and the army more upon plunder than regular pay both may desert the cause of the more wary for that of the more daring each is flattered into an overweening confidence in his own ability and good fortune and all rush on to seize upon the throne yet filled by their wretched parent who in the history of his own crimes now reads those of his children gibbon has justly observed chap the superior prerogative of birth when it has obtained the sanction of time and popular opinion is the plainest and least invidious of all distinctions among mankind the acknowledged right extinguishes the hopes of faction and the conscious security disarms the cruelty of the monarch to the firm establishment of this idea we owe the peaceful succession and mild administration of european monarchies to the defect of it we must attribute the frequent civil wars through which an asiatic despot is obliged to cut his way to the throne of his fathers yet even in the east the sphere of contention is usually limited to the princes of the reigning house and as soon as the fortunate competitor has removed his brethren by the sword and the bowstring he no longer entertains any jealousy of his meaner subjects among hindoos both real and personal property is divided in the same manner equally among the sons but a principality is among them considered as an exception to this rule and every large estate within which the proprietor holds criminal jurisdiction and maintains a military establishment is considered a principality in such cases the law of primogeniture is rigorously enforced and the death of the prince scarcely ever involves a contest for power and dominion between his sons the feelings of the people who are accustomed to consider the right of the eldest son to the succession as religiously sacred would be greatly shocked at the attempt of any of his brothers to invade it the younger brothers never for a moment supposing they could be supported in such a sacrilegious attempt feel for their eldest brother a reverence inferior only to that which they feel for their father and the eldest brother never supposing such attempts on their part as possible feels towards them as towards his own children all the members of such a family commonly live in the greatest harmony in the laws usages and feelings of the people upon this subject we had the means of preventing that eternal subdivision of landed property which ever has been and ever will be the bane of everything that is great and good in india but unhappily our rulers have never had the wisdom to avail themselves of them in a great part of india the property or the lease of a village held in farm under government was considered as a principality and subject strictly to the same laws of primogenitureit was a fief held under government on condition of either direct service rendered to the state in war in education or charitable or religions duties or of furnishing the means in money or in kind to provide for such service in every part of the sāgar and nerbudda territories the law of primogeniture in such leases was in force when we took possession and has been ever since preserved the eldest of the sons that remain united with the father at his death succeeds to the estate and to the obligation of maintaining all the widows and orphan children of those of his brothers who remained united to their parent stock up to their death all his unmarried sisters and above all his mother all the younger brothers aid him in the management and are maintained by him till they wish to separate when a division of the stock takes place and is adjusted by the elders of the village the member who thus separates from the parent stock from that time forfeits for ever all claims to support from the possessor of the ancestral estate either for himself his widow or his orphan children next it is obvious that no existing government in india could in case of invasion or civil war count upon the fidelity of their aristocracy either of land or of office it is observed by hume in treating of the reign of king john in england that men easily change sides in a civil war especially where the power is founded upon an hereditary and independent authority and is not derived from the opinion and favour of the peoplethat is upon the people collectively or the nation for the hereditary and independent authority of the english baron in the time of king john was founded upon the opinion and fidelity of only that portion of the people over which he ruled in the same manner as that of the hindoochiefs of india in the time of shāh jahān but it was without reference either to the honesty of the cause he espoused or to the opinion and feeling of the nation or empire generally regarding it the hindoo territorial chiefs like the feudal barons of the middle ages in europe employed all the revenues of their estates in the maintenance of military followers upon whose fidelity they could entirely rely whatever side they might themselves take in a civil war and the more of these resources that were left at their disposal the more impatient they became of the restraints which settled governments imposed upon them under such settled governments they felt that they had an arm which they could not use and the stronger that arm the stronger was their desire to use it in the subjugation of their neighbours the reigning emperors tried to secure their fidelity by assigning to them posts of honour about their court that required their personal attendance in all their pomp of pride and by taking from each a daughter in marriage if any one rebelled or neglected his duties he was either crushed by the imperial forces or put to the ban of the empire and his territories were assigned to any one who would undertake to conquer them their attendance at our viceroyal court would be a sad encumbrance and our governorgeneral could not well conciliate them by matrimonial alliances unless we were to alter a good deal in their favour our law against polygamy nor would it be desirable to let slip the dogs of war once more throughout the land by adopting the plan of putting the refractory chiefs to the ban of the empire their troops would be of no use to us in the way they are organized and disciplined even if we could rely upon their fidelity in time of need and this i do not think we ever can if it be the duty of all such territorial chiefs to contribute to the support of the public establishments of the paramount power by which they are secured in the possession of their estates and defended from all external danger as it most assuredly is it is the duty of that power to take such contribution in money or the means of maintaining establishments more suited to its purpose than their rude militia can ever be and thereby to impair the powers of that arm which they are so impatient to wield for their own aggrandizement and to the prejudice of their neighbours and to strengthen that of the paramount power by which the whole are kept in peace harmony and security we give to india what india never had before our rule and never could have without it the assurance that there will always be at the head of the government a sensible ruler trained up to office in the best school in the world and that the security of the rights and the enforcement of the duties presented or defined by law will not depend upon the will or caprice of individuals in power these assurances the people in india now everywhere thoroughly understand and appreciate they see in the native states around them that the lucky accident of an able governor is too rare ever to be calculated upon while all that the people have of property office or character depends not only upon their governor but upon every change that he may make in his ministers the government of the muhammadans was always essentially military and the aristocracy was always one of military office there was nothing else upon which an aristocracy could be formed all high civil offices were combined with the military commands the emperor was the great proprietor of all the lands and collected and distributed their rents through his own servants every musalmān with his korān in his hand was his own priest and his own lawyer and the people were nowhere represented in any municipal or legislative assemblythere was no bar bench senate corporation art science or literature by which men could rise to eminence and power capital had nowhere been concentrated upon great commercial or manufacturing establishments there were in short no great men but the military servants of government and all the servants of government held their posts at the will and pleasure of their sovereign if a man was appointed by the emperor to the command of five thousand the whole of this five thousand depended entirely on his favour for their employment and upon their employment for their subsistence whether paid from the imperial treasury or by an assignment of land in some distant province in our armies there is a regular gradation of rank and every officer feels that he holds his commission by a tenure as high in origin as secure in possession and as independent in its exercise as that of the general who commands and the soldiers all know and feel that the places of those officers who are killed or disabled in action will be immediately filled by those next in rank who are equally trained to command and whose authority none will dispute in the muhammadan armies there was no such gradation of rank every man held his office at the will of the chief whom he followed and he was every moment made to feel that all his hopes of advancement must depend upon his pleasure the relation between them was that of patron and client the client felt bound to yield implicit obedience to the commands of his patron whatever they might be and the patron in like manner felt bound to protect and promote the interests of his client as long as he continued to do so as often as the patron changed sides in a civil war his clients all blindly followed him and when he was killed they instantly dispersed to serve under any other leader whom they might find willing to take their services on the same terms the hindoo chiefs of the military class had hereditary territorial possessions and the greater part of these possessions were commonly distributed on conditions of military service among their followers who were all of the same clan but the highest muhammadan officers of the empire had not an acre more of land than they required for their dwellinghouses gardens and cemeteries they had nothing but their office to depend upon and were always naturally anxious to hold it under the strongest side in any competition for dominion when the star of the competitor under whom they served seemed to be on the wane they soon found some plausible excuse to make their peace with his rival and serve under his banners each competitor fought for his own life and those of his children the imperial throne could be filled by only one man and that man dared not leave one single brother alive his father had taken good care to dispose of all his ownbrothers and nephews in the last contest the subsistence of the highest as well as that of the lowest officer in the army depended upon their employment in the public service and all such employments would be given to those who served the victor in the struggle under such circumstances one is rather surprised that the history of civil wars in india exhibits so many instances of fidelity and devotion the mass of the people stood aloof in such contests without any feeling of interest save the dread that their homes might become the seat of the war or the tracks of armies which were alike destructive to the people in their course whatever side they might follow the result could have no effect upon their laws and institutions and little upon their industry and property as ships are from necessity formed to weather the storms to which they are constantly liable at sea so were the indian village communities framed to weather those of invasion and civil war to which they were so much accustomed by land and in the course of a year or two no traces were found of ravages that one might have supposed it would have taken ages to recover from the lands remained the same and their fertility was improved by the fallow every man carried away with him the implements of his trade and brought them back with him when he returned and the industry of every village supplied every necessary article that the community required for their food clothing furniture and accommodation each of these little communities when left unmolested was in itself sufficient to secure the rights and enforce the duties of all the different members and all they wanted from their government was moderation in the land taxes and protection from external violence arrian says if any intestine war happens to break forth among the indians it is deemed a heinous crime either to seize the husbandmen or spoil their harvest all the rest wage war against each other and kill and slay as they think convenient while they live quietly and peaceably among them and employ themselves at their rural affairs either in their fields or vineyards i am afraid armies were not much more disposed to forbearance in the days of alexander than at present and that his followers must have supposed they remained untouched merely because they heard of their sudden rise again from their ruins by that spirit of moral and political vitality with which necessity seems to have endowed them during the early part of his life and reign aurangzēb was employed in conquering and destroying the two independent kingdoms of golconda and bījāpur in the deccan which he formed into two provinces governed by viceroys each had had an army of above a hundred thousand men while independent the officers and soldiers of these armies had nothing but their courage and their swords to depend upon for their subsistence finding no longer any employment under settled and legitimate authority in defending the life property and independence of the people they were obliged to seek it around the standards of lawless freebooters and upon the ruins of these independent kingdoms and their disbanded armies rose the marāthā power the hydraheaded monster which aurangzēb thus created by his ambition and spent the last twenty years of his life in vain attempts to crush the monster has been since crushed by being deprived of its peshwā the head which alone could infuse into all the members of the confederacy a feeling of nationality and direct all their efforts when required to one common object sindhia the chief of gwālior is one of the surviving members of this great confederacythe rest are the holkars of indore the bhōnslās of nāgpur and the gaikwārs of barodā the grandchildren of the commandants of predatory armies who formed capital cities out of their standing camps in the countries they invaded and conquered in the name of their head the sātārā rājā and afterwards in that of his mayor of the palace the peshwā there is not now the slightest feeling of nationality left among the marāthā states either collectively or individually there is not the slightest feeling of sympathy between the mass of the people and the chief who rules over them and his public establishments to maintain these public establishments he everywhere plunders the people who most heartily detest him and them these public establishments are composed of men of all religions and sects gathered from all quarters of india and bound together by no common feeling save the hope of plunder and promotion not one in ten is from or has his family in the country where he serves nor is one in ten of the same clan with his chief not one of them has any hope of a provision either for himself when disabled from wounds or old age from serving his chief any longer or for his family should he lose his life in his service in india there are a great many native chiefs who were enabled during the disorders which attended the decline and fall of the muhammadan power and the rise and progress of the marāthās and english to raise and maintain armies by the plunder of their neighbours the paramount power of the british being now securely established throughout the country they are prevented from indulging any longer in such sporting propensities and might employ their vast revenues in securing the blessing of good civil government for the territories in the possession of which they are secured by our military establishment but these chiefs are not much disposed to convert their swords into ploughshares they continue to spend their revenues on useless military establishments for purposes of parade and show a native prince would they say be as insignificant without an army as a native gentleman upon an elephant without a cavalcade or upon a horse without a tail but the said army have learnt from their forefathers that they were to look to aggressions upon their neighboursto pillage plunder and conquest for wealth and promotion and they continue to prevent their prince from indulging in any disposition to turn his attention to the duties of civil government they all live in the hope of some disaster to the paramount power which secures the increasing wealth of the surrounding countries from their grasp and threatened innovations from the northwest raise their spirits and hopes in proportion as they depress those of the classes engaged in all branches of peaceful industry there are in all parts of india thousands and tens of thousands who have lived by the sword or who wish to live by the sword but cannot find employment suited to their tastes these would all flock to the standard of the first lawless chiefwho could offer them a fair prospect of plunder and to them all wars and rumours of war are delightful the moment they hear of a threatened invasion from the northwest they whet their swords and look fiercely around upon those from whose breasts they are to cut their pound of flesh

exact date from which the beginning of aurangzēbs reign should be reckoned is obscured by the conflict of authorities and has given rise to much discussion the results may be stated briefly as follow aurangzēb formally took possession of the throne in a garden outside delhi on the st zūl qadah ah july ad but subsequently orders were passed to antedate the beginning of the reign to st ramazān in the same year equivalent to june after the destruction of shāh shujā aurangzēb returned to delhi in may ad and was again enthroned with full ceremonial on june ah some authors consequently assume the accession to have taken place in but the reign certainly began in ad and should be reckoned as running from the official date june of that year the dates given above are in new style ns if recorded in old style os they would be ten days earlier see irvine and hoernle in jasb part i vol lxii pp and irvine in ind ant vol xl pp the author invariably ignores the fact that daughters and other female relatives inherit under muhammadan law hindoo law does not ordinarily recognize any right of succession for daughters and so differs essentially from the law of islam the exceptions to this general rule are unimportant the experience of most officials does not confirm this statement the statement now requires modification after the central provinces were constituted in the principle of succession by primogeniture was maintained only in the hoshangābād chhindwāra chāndā and chhattīsgarh districts but even there the legal effect of the restrictions on alienation and partition is not quite free from doubt ig x the tendency of the law courts is to apply everywhere uniform rules taken from the hindoo law books see ante chapter notes the gradual conversion of tenure by leases from government into proprietary right in land has brought the land under the operation of the ordinary hindoo law and each member of a joint family can now enforce partition of the land as well as of the stock upon it the evils resulting from incessant partition are obvious but no remedy can be devised the people insist on partition and will effect it privately if the law imposes obstacles to a formal public division these remarks attribute too much system to the disorderly working of an asiatic despotism no institution resembling the formal ban of the empire ever really existed in india the rājās at simla might now be considered by some people as an encumbrance the author could not foresee the gallant service to be rendered by the chiefs of the panjāb and other territories in the mutiny nor the institution of the imperial service troops those troops first organized in in response to the voluntary offers made by many princes as a reply to the russian aggression on panjdeh are select bodies picked from the soldiery of certain native states and equipped and drilled in the european manner cashmere kāshmīr and many states in the panjāb and elsewhere furnish troops of this kind officered by local gentlemen under the guidance of english inspecting officers the kāshmīr imperial service troops did excellent service during the campaign of in hunza and nagar the system so happily introduced is likely to be much further developed in the authorized strength was a little over ig iv pp in rome as in egypt and india many of the great works which in modern nations form the basis of gradations of rank in society were executed by government out of public revenue or by individuals gratuitously for the benefit of the public for instance roads canals aqueducts bridges c from which no one derived an income though all derived benefit there was no capital invested with a view to profit in machinery railroads canals steamengines and other great works which in the preparation and distribution of mans enjoyments save the labour of so many millions to the nations of modern europe and america and supply the incomes of many of the most useful and most enlightened members of their middle and higher classes of society during the republic and under the first emperors the laws were simple and few derived any considerable income from explaining them still fewer derived their incomes from expounding the religion of the people till the establishment of christianity man was the principal machine in which property was invested with a view to profit and the concentration of capital in hordes of slaves and the farm of the public revenues of conquered provinces and tributary states were with the land the great basis of the aristocracies of rome and the roman world generally the senatorial and equestrian orders were supported chiefly by lending out their slaves as gladiators and artificers and by farming the revenues and lending money to the oppressed subjects of the provinces and to vanquished princes at an exorbitant interest to enable them to pay what the state or its public officers demanded the slaves throughout the roman empire were about equal in number to the free population and they were for the most part concentrated in the hands of the members of the upper and middle classes who derived their incomes from lending and employing them they were to those classes in the old world what canals railroads steamengines c are to those of modern days some roman citizens had as many as five thousand slaves educated to the one occupation of gladiators for the public shows of rome julius caesar had this number in italy waiting his return from gaul and gordianus used commonly to give five hundred pair for a public festival and never less than one hundred and fifty in india slavery is happily but little knowna the church had no hierarchy either among the hindoos or muhammadans nor had the law any high interpreters in all its civil branches of marriage inheritance succession and contract it was to the people of the two religions as simple as the laws of the twelve tables and contributed just as little to the support of the aristocracy as they did in all these respects china is much the same the land belongs to the sovereign and is minutely subdivided among those who farm and cultivate itthe great works in canals aqueducts bridges roads c are made by government and yield no private income capital is nowhere concentrated in expensive machinery their church is without a hierarchy their law without barristerstheir higher classes are therefore composed almost exclusively of the public servants of the government the rule which prescribes that princes of the blood shall not be employed in the government of provinces and the command of armies and that the reigning sovereign shall have the nomination of his successor has saved china from a frequent return of the scenes which i have described none of the princes are put to death because it is known that all will acquiesce in the nomination when made known supported as it always is bythe popular sentiment throughout the empire w h s a the

india from time immemorial and still flourished in slavery so far as the law can abolish it was abolished by the indian act v of but the final blow was not dealt until january l when sections c of the indian penal code came into force in practice domestic servitude exists to this day in great muhammadan households and multitudes of agricultural labourers have a very dim consciousness of personal freedom the criminal law commissioners who reported previous to the passage of act v of estimated that in british india as then constituted the proportion of the slave to the free population varied from onesixth to twofifths sir bartle frere estimated the slave population of the territories included in british india in the year as being between eight and nine millions slaves were heritable and

life and needs as expounded by the author in the preceding passage human societies with a low standard of comfort and a simple scheme of life are like individual organisms of lowly structure and few

kohinūr with which they have nothing to do they seem to belong properly to chapter and are therefore inserted here the observations in both paragraphs are merely repetitions of remarks already recorded it need hardly be said that these fireeaters no longer exist chapter the great diamond of kohinūr the foregoing historical episode occupies too large a space in what might otherwise be termed a personal narrative but still i am tempted to append to it a sketch of the fortunes of that famous diamond called with oriental extravagance the mountain of light which by exciting the cupidity of shāh jahān played so important a part in the drama after slumbering for the greater part of a century in the imperial treasury it was afterwards taken by nādir shāh the king of persia who invaded india under the reign of muhammad shāh in the year nadir shāh in one of his mad fits had put out the eyes of his son razā kulī mirzā and when he was assassinated the conspirators gave the throne and the diamond to this sons son shāhrukh mirza who fixed his residence at meshed ahmad shāh the abdālī commanded the afghān cavalry in the service of nādir shāh and had the charge of the military chest at the time he was put to death with this chest he and his cavalry left the camp during the disorders that followed the murder of the king and returned with all haste to kandahār where they met tarīkī khān on his way to nādir shāhs camp with the tribute of the five provinces which he had retained of his indian conquests kandahār kābul tatta bakkar multān and peshāwar they gave him the first news of the death of the king seized upon his treasure and with the aid of this and the military chest ahmad shāh took possession of these five provinces and formed them into the little independent kingdom of afghānistan over which he long reigned and from which he occasionally invaded india and khurāsān shāhrukh mirzā had his eyes put out some time after by a faction ahmad shāh marched to his relief put the rebels to death and united his eldest son taimūr shāh in marriage to the daughter of the unfortunate prince from whom he took the diamond since it could be of no use to a man who could no longer see its beauties he established taimūr as his viceroy at herāt and his youngest son at kandahār and fixed his own residence at kābul where he died he was succeeded by taimūr shāh who was succeeded by his eldest son zamān shāh who after a reign of a few years was driven from his throne by his younger brother mahmūd he sought an asylum with his friend ashīk who commanded a distant fortress and who betrayed him to the usurper and put him into confinement he concealed the great diamond in a crevice in the wall of the room in which he was confined and the rest of his jewels in a hole made in the ground with his dagger as soon as mahmūd received intimation of the arrest from ashīk he sent for his brother had his eyes put out and demanded the jewels but zamān shāh pretended that he had thrown them into the river as he passed over two years after this the third brother the sultān shujā deposed mahmūd ascended the throne by the consent of his elder brother and as a fair specimen of his notions of retributive justice he blew away from the mouths of cannon not only ashīk himself but his wife and all his innocent and unoffending children he intended to put out the eyes of his deposed brother mahmūd but was dissuaded from it by his mother and zamān shāh who now pointed out to him the place where he had concealed the great diamond mahmūd made his escape from prison raised a party drove out his brothers and once more ascended the throne the two brothers sought an asylum in the honourable companys territories and have from that time resided at an out frontier station of lūdiāna upon the banks of the hyphasis upon a liberal pension assigned for their maintenance by our government on their way through the territories of the sikh chief ranjit singh shujā was discovered to have this great diamond the mountain of light about his person and he was by a little torture skilfully applied to the mind and body made to surrender it to his generous host mahmūd was succeeded in the government of the fortress and province of herāt by his son kāmrān but the throne of kābul was seized by the mayor of the palace who bequeathed it to his son dost muhammad a man in all the qualities requisite in a sovereign immeasurably superior to any member of the house of ahmad shāh abdālī ranjit singh had wrested from him the province of peshāwar in times of difficulty and as we would not assist him in recovering it from our old ally he thought himself justified in seeking the aid of those who would the russians and persians who were eager to avail themselves of so fair an occasion to establish a footing in india such a footing would have been manifestly incompatible with the peace and security of our dominions in india and we were obliged in selfdefence to give to shujā the aid which he had so often before in vain solicited to enable him to recover the throne of his very limited number of legal ancestors notes nādir shāh was crowned king of persia in entered the panjāb at the close of and occupied delhi in march having perpetrated an awful massacre of the inhabitants he retired after a stay of fiftyeight days he was assassinated in may meshed properly mashhad the place

it is hardly necessary to observe much disputed and the authors confident defence of lord aucklands action cannot be accepted chapter pindhārī systemcharacter of the marāthā administrationcause of their dislike to the paramount power the attempt of the marquis of hastings to rescue india from that dreadful scourge the pindhārī system involved him in a war with all the great marāthā states except gwālior that is with the peshwā at pūnā holkār at indore and the bhonslā at nāgpur and gwālior was prevented from joining the other states in their unholy league against us only by the presence of the grand division of the army under the personal command of the marquis in the immediate vicinity of his capital it was not that these chiefs liked the pindhārīs or felt any interest in their welfare but because they were always anxious to crush that rising paramount authority which had the power and had always manifested the will to interpose and prevent the free indulgence of their predatory habitsthe free exercise of that weapon a standing army which the disorders incident upon the decline and fall of the muhammadan army had put into their hands and which a continued series of successful aggressions upon their neighbours could alone enable them to pay or keep under control they seized with avidity any occasion of quarrel with the paramount power which seemed likely to unite them all in one great effort to shake it off and they are still prepared to do the same because they feel that they could easily extend their depredations if that power were withdrawn and they know no other road to wealth and glory but such successful depredations their ancestors rose by them their states were formed by them and their armies have been maintained by them they look back upon them for all that seems to them honourable in the history of their families their bards sing of them in all their marriage and funeral processions and as their imaginations kindle at the recollection they detest the arm that is extended to defend the wealth and the industry of the surrounding territories from their grasp as the industrious classes acquire and display their wealth in the countries around during a long peace under a strong and settled government these native chiefs with their little disorderly armies feel precisely as an english country gentleman would feel with a pack of foxhounds in a country swarming with foxes and without the privilege of hunting them their armies always took the auspices and set out kingdom taking mulk gīrī after the dasahra in november as regularly as english gentlemen go partridgeshooting on the st of september and i may here give as a specimen the excursion of jean baptiste filose who sallied forth on such an expedition at the head of a division of sindhias army just before this pindhārī war commenced from gwālior he proceeded to karaulī and took from that chief the district of sabalgarh yielding four lākhs of rupees yearly he then took the territory of the rājā of chandērī mor pahlād one of the oldest of the bundēlkhand chiefs which then yielded about seven lākhs of rupees but now yields only four the rājā got an allowance of forty thousand rupees a year he then took the territories of the rājās of raghugarh and bajranggarh yielding three lākhs a year and bahādurgarh yielding two lākhs a year and the three princes got fifty thousand rupees a year for subsistence among them he then took lopar yielding two lākhs and a half and assigned the rājā twentyfive thousand he then took garhā kota whose chief gets subsistence from our government baptiste had just completed his kingdom taking expedition when our armies took the field against the pindhārīs and on the termination of that war in all these acquisitions were confirmed and guaranteed to his master sindhia by our government it cannot be supposed that either he or his army can ever feel any great attachment towards a paramount authority that has the power and the will to interpose and prevent their indulging in such sporting excursions as these or any great disinclination to take advantage of any occasion that may seem likely to unite all the native chiefs in a common effort to crush it the nepalese have the same feeling as the marāthās in a still stronger degree since their kingdomtaking excursions had been still greater and more successful and being all soldiers from the same soil they were easily persuaded by a long series of successful aggressions that their courage was superior to that of all other men in the year the gwālior territory yielded a net revenue to the treasury of ninetytwo lākhs of rupees after discharging all the local costs of the civil and fiscal administration of the different districts in officers establishments charitable institutions religions endowments military fiefs c in the remote districts which are much infested by the predatory tribes of bhīls and in consequence badly peopled and cultivated the net revenue is estimated to be about onethird of the gross collections but in the districts near the capital which are tolerably well cultivated the net revenue brought to the treasury is about fivesixths of the gross collections and these collections are equal to the whole annual rent of the land for every man by whom the land is held or cultivated is a mere tenant at will liable every season to be turned out to give place to any other man that may offer more for the holding there is nowhere to be seen upon the land any useful or ornamental work calculated to attach the people to the soil or to their villages and as hardly any of the recruits for the regiments are drawn from the peasantry of the country the agricultural classes have nowhere any feeling of interest in the welfare or existence of the government i am persuaded that there is not a single village in all the gwālior dominions in which ninetenths of the people would not be glad to see that government destroyed under the persuasion that they could not possibly have a worse and would be very likely to find a betterthe present force at gwālior consists of three regiments of infantry under colonel alexander six under the command of apājī the adopted son of the late bālā bāī eleven under colonel jacobs and his son five under colonel jean baptiste filose two under the command of the māmū sāhib the maternal uncle of the mahārājā three in what is called bābū bāolīs camp in all thirty regiments consisting when complete of six hundred men each with four fieldpieces the jinsī or artillery consists of two hundred guns of different calibre there are but few corps of cavalry and these are not considered very efficient i believe robbers and murderers of all descriptions have always been in the habit of taking the field in india immediately after the festival of the dasahrā at the end of october from the sovereign of a state at the head of his armies down to the leader of a little band of pickpockets from the corner of some obscure village all invoke the deity and take the auspices to ascertain his will nearly in the same way and all expect that he will guide them successfully through their enterprises as long as they find the omens favourable no one among them ever dreams that his undertaking can be less acceptable to the deity than that of another provided he gives him the same due share of what he acquires in his thefts his robberies or his conquests in sacrifices and offerings upon his shrines and in donations to his priests nor does the robber often dream that he shall be considered a less respectable citizen by the circle in which he moves than the soldier provided he spends his income as liberally and discharges all his duties in his relations with them as well and this he generally does to secure their goodwill whatever may be the character of his depredations upon distant circles of society and communities the man who returned to oudh or rohilkhand after a campaign under a pindhārī chief was as well received as one who returned after serving one under sindhia holkār or ranjīt singh a friend of mine one day asked a leader of a band of dacoits or banditti whether they did not often commit murder god forbid said he that we should ever commit murder but if people choose to oppose us we of course strike and kill but you do the same i hear that there is now a large assemblage of troops in the upper provinces going to take foreign countries if they are opposed they will kill people we only do the same the history of the rise of every nation in the world unhappily bears out the notion that princes are only robbers upon a large scale till their ambition is curbed by a balance of power among nations on the th we came on to dhamēlā fourteen miles over a plain with the range of sandstone hills on the left receding from us to the west and that on the right receding still more to the east here and there were some insulated hills of the same formation rising abruptly from the plain to our right all the villages we saw were built upon masses of this sandstone rock rising abruptly at intervals from the surface of the plain in horizontal strata these hillocks afford the people stone for building and great facilities for defending themselves against the inroads of freebooters there is not i suppose in the world a finer stone for building than these sandstone hills afford and we passed a great many carts carrying them off to distant places in slabs or flags from ten to sixteen feet long two to three feet wide and six inches thick they are white with very minute pink spots and of a texture so very fine that they would be taken for indurated clay on a slight inspection the houses of the poorest peasants are here built of this beautiful freestone which after two hundred years looks as if it had been quarried only yesterday about three miles from our tents we crossed over the little river ghorapachhār flowing over a bed of this sandstone the soil all the way very light and the cultivation scanty and bad except within the enclosures of mens houses scarcely a tree to be anywhere seen to give shelter and shade to the weary traveller and we could find no ground for our camp with a shrub to shelter man or beast all are swept away to form guncarriages for the gwālior artillery with a philosophical disregard to the comforts of the living the repose of the dead who planted them with a view to a comfortable berth in the next world and to the will of the gods to whom they are dedicated there is nothing left upon the land of animal or vegetable life to enrich it nothing of stock but what is necessary to draw from the soil an annual crop and which looks to one harvest for its entire return the sovereign proprietor of the soil lets it out by the year in farms or villages to men who depend entirely upon the years return for the means of payment he in his turn lets the lands in detail to those who till them and who depend for their subsistence and for the means of paying their rents upon the returns of the single harvest there is no manufacture anywhere to be seen save of brass pots and rude cooking utensils no trade or commerce save in the transport of the rude produce of the land to the great camp at gwālior upon the backs of bullocks for want of roads fit for wheeled carriages no one resides in the villages save those whose labour is indispensably necessary to the rudest tillage and those who collect the dues of government and are paid upon the lowest possible scale such is the state of the gwālior territories in every part of india where i have seen them the miseries and misrule of the oudh hyderabad and other muhammadan governments are heard of everywhere because there are under these governments a middle and higher class upon the land to suffer and proclaim them but those of the gwālior state are never heard of because no such classes are ever allowed to grow up upon the land had russia governed poland and turkey greece in the way that gwālior has governed her conquered territories we should never have heard of the wrongs of the one or the other in my mornings ride the day before i left gwālior i saw a fine leopard standing by the side of the most frequented road and staring at every one who passed it was held by two men who sat by and talked to it as if it had been a human being i thought it was an animal for show and i was about to give them something when they told me that they were servants of the mahārājā and were training the leopard to bear the sight and society of man it had they said been caught about three months ago in the jungles where it could never bear the sight and society of man or of any animalthat it could not prey upon and must be kept upon the most frequented road till

has kindly communicated the following information on the subject of the above note in a letter dated th december the custom of looting some banias shops on the installation of a new maharaja in gwālior is still observed it was observed when the present mādho rāo sindhia was installed on the gadī on rd july and the looting was stopped by the police on the owners of the shops calling out dohai mādho mahārājkī five shops were looted on the occasion and compensation to the amount of rs was paid to the owners my informant tells me that the custom has apparently no connexion with religion but is believed to refer to the days when the period between the decease of one ruler and the accession of his successor was one of disorder and plunder the maintenance of the custom is supposed to notify to the people that they must now look to the new ruler for protection according to another informant some banias are called by the palace officers and directed to open their shops in the palace precincts and money is given them to stock their shops the poor people are then allowed to loot them no shops are allowed to be looted in the bazaar i cannot learn that any particular name is given to the ceremony and there appears to be some doubt as to its meaning but the best information seems to show that the reason assigned above is the correct one i cannot give any information as to the

with the intention of following it in the afternoon but about three oclock a thunderstorm came on so heavily that i was afraid that which we occupied would come down upon us and putting my wife and child in a palankeen i took them to the dwelling of an old bairāgī about two hundred yards from us he received us very kindly and paid us many compliments about the honour we had conferred upon him he was a kind and i think a good old man and had six disciples who seemed to reverence him very much a large stone image of hanumān the monkeygod painted red and a good store of buffaloes very comfortably sheltered from the pitiless storm were in an inner court the peacocks in dozens sought shelter under the walls and in the tree that stood in the courtyard and i believe that they would have come into the old mans apartment had they not seen our white faces there i had a great deal of talk with him but did not take any notes of it these old bairāgīs who spend the early and middle parts of life as disciples in pilgrimages to the celebrated temples of their god vishnu in all parts of india and the latter part of it as high priests or apostles in listening to the reports of the numerous disciples employed in similar wanderings are perhaps the most intelligent men in the country they are from all the castes and classes of society the lowest hindoo may become a bairāgī and the very highest are often tempted to become so the service of the god to which they devote themselves levelling all distinctions few of them can write or read but they are shrewd observers of men and things and often exceedingly agreeable and instructive companions to those who understand them and can make them enter into unreserved conversation our tent stood out the storm pretty well but we were obliged to defer our march till the next day on the afternoon of the th we went on twelve miles over a plain of deep alluvion through which two rivers have cut their way to the chambal and as usual the ravines along their banks are deep long and dreary about halfway we were overtaken by one of the heaviest showers of rain i ever saw it threatened us from neither side but began to descend from an apparently small bed of clouds directly over our heads which seemed to spread out on every side as the rain fell and fill the whole vault of heaven with one dark and dense mass the wind changed frequently and in less than half an hour the whole surface of the country over which we were travelling was under water this dense mass of clouds passed off in about two hours to the east but twice when the sun opened and beamed divinely upon us in a cloudless sky to the west the wind changed suddenly round and rushed back angrily from the east to fill up the space which had been quickly rarefied by the genial heat of its rays till we were again enveloped in darkness and began to despair of reaching any human habitation before night some hail fell among the rain but not large enough to hurt any one the thunder was loud and often startling to the strongest nerves and the lightning vivid and almost incessant we managed to keep the road because it was merely a beaten pathway below the common level of the country and we could trace it by the greater depth of the water and the absence of all shrubs and grass all roads in india soon become watercoursesthey are nowhere metalled and being left for four or five months every year without rain their soil is reduced to powder by friction and carried off by the winds over the surrounding country i was on horseback but my wife and child were secure in a good palankeen that sheltered them from the rain the bearers were obliged to move with great caution and slowly and i sent on every person i could spare that they might keep moving for the cold blast blowing over their thin and wet clothes seemed intolerable to those who were idle my childs playmate gulāb a lad of about ten years of age resolutely kept by the side of the palankeen trotting through the water with his teeth chattering as if he had been in an ague the rain at last ceased and the sky in the west cleared up beautifully about half an hour before sunset little gulāb threw off his stuffed and quilted vest and got a good dry english blanket to wrap round him from the palankeen we soon after reached a small village in which i treated all who had remained with us to as much coarse sugar gur as they could eat and as people of all castes can eat of sweetmeats from the hands of confectioners without prejudice to their caste and this sugar is considered to be the best of all good things for guarding against colds in man or beast they all ate very heartily and went on in high spirits as the sun sank below us on the left a bright moon shone out upon us from the right and about an hour after dark we reached our tents on the north bank of the kuārī river where we found an excellent dinner for ourselves and good fires and good shelter for our servants little rain had fallen near the tents and the river kuārī over which we had to cross had not fortunately much swelled nor did much fall on the ground we had left and as the tents there had been struck and laden before it came on they came up the next morning early and went on to our next ground on the th we went on to dhōlpur the capital of the jāt chiefs of gohad on the left bank of the chambal over a plain with a variety of crops but not one that requires two seasons to reach maturity the soil excellent in quality and deep but not a tree anywhere to be seen nor any such thing as a work of ornament or general utility of any kind we saw the fort of dhōlpur at a distance of six miles rising apparently from the surface of the level plain but in reality situated on the summit of the opposite and high bank of a large river its foundation at least one hundred feet above the level of the water the immense pandemonia of ravines that separated us from this fort were not visible till we began todescend into them some two or three miles from the bed of the river like all the ravines that border the rivers in these parts they are naked gloomy and ghastly and the knowledge that no solitary traveller is ever safe in them does not tend to improve the impression they make upon us the river is a beautiful clear stream here flowing over a bed of fine sand with a motion so gentle that one can hardly conceive it is she who has played such fantastic tricks along the borders and made such frightful gashes in them as we passed over this noble reach of the river chambal in a ferryboat the boatman told us of the magnificent bridge formed here by the baiza bāī for lord william bentinck in from boats brought down from agra for the purpose little said they did it avail her with the governorgeneral in her hour of need the town of dhōlpur lies some short way in from the north bank of the chambal at the extremity of a range of sandstone hills which runs diagonally across that of gwālior this range was once capped with basalt and some boulders are still found upon it in a state of rapid decomposition it was quite refreshing to see the beautiful mango groves on the dhōlpur side of the river after passing through a large tract of country in which no tree of any kind was to be seen on returning from a long ride over the range of sandstone hills the morning after we reached dhōlpur i passed through an encampment of camels taking rude iron from some mines in the hills to the south towards agra they waited here within the frontier of a native state for a pass from the agra custom house lest any one should after they enter our frontier pretend that they were going to smuggle it and thus get them into trouble are you not said i afraid to remain here so near the ravines of the chambal when thieves are said to be so numerous not at all replied they i suppose thieves do not think it worth while to steal rude iron thieves sir think it worth while to steal anything they can get but we do not fear them much here where then do you fear them much we fear them when we get into the companys territories and how is this when we have good police establishments and the dhōlpur people none when the dhōlpur people get hold of a thief they make him disgorge all that he has got of our property for us and they confiscate all the rest that he has for themselves and cut off his nose or his hands and turn him adrift to deter others you on the contrary when you get hold of a thief worry us to death in the prosecution of your courts and when we have proved the robbery to your satisfaction you leave all this illgotten wealth to his family and provide him with good food and clothing for himself while he works for you a couple of years on the roads the consequence is that here fellows are afraid to rob a traveller if they find him at all on his guard as we generally are while in your districts they rob us where and when they like but my friends you are sure to recover what we do get of your property from the thieves not quite sure of that neither said they or the greater part is generally absorbed on its way back to us through the officers of your court and we would always rather put up with the first loss than run the risk of a greater by prosecution if we happen to get robbed within the companys territories the loss and annoyances to which prosecutors and witnesses are subject in our courts are a source of very great evil to the country they enable policeofficers everywhere to grow rich upon the concealment of crimes the man who has been robbed will bribe them to conceal the robbery that he may escape the further loss of the prosecution in our courts generally very distant and the witnesses will bribe them to avoid attending to give evidence the whole village communities bribe them because every man feels that they have the power of getting him summoned to the court in some capacity or other if they like and that they will certainly like to do so if not bribed the obstacles which our system opposes to the successful prosecution of robbers of all denominations and descriptions deprive our government of all popular support in the administration of criminal justice and this is considered everywhere to be the worst and indeed the only radically bad feature of our government no magistrate hopes to get a conviction against one in four of the most atrocious gang of robbers and murderers of his district and his only resource is in the security laws which enable him to keep them in jail under a requisition of security for short periods to this an idle or apathetic magistrate will not have recourse and under him these robbers have a free licence in england a judicial acquittal does not send back the culprit to follow the same trade in the same field as in india for the published proceedings of the court bring down upon him the indignation of societythe moral and religions feelings of his fellow men are arrayed against him and from these salutary checks no flaw in the indictment can save him not so in india there no moral or religions feelings interpose to assist or to supply the deficiencies of the penal law provided he eats drinks smokes marries and makes his offerings to his priest according to the rules of his caste the robber and the murderer incurs no odium in the circle in which he moves either religious or moral and this is the only circle for whose feelings he has any regard the man who passed off his bad coin at datiyā passed off more at dhōlpur while my advanced people were coming in pretending that he wanted things for me and was in a great hurry to be ready with them at my tents by the time i came up the bad rupees were brought to a native officer of my guard who went with the shopkeepers in search of the knave but he could nowhere be found the gates of the town were shut up all night at my suggestion and in the morning every lodginghouse in the town was searched for him in vainhe had gone on i had left some sharp men behind me expecting that he would endeavour to pass off his bad money immediately after my departure but in expectation of this he was now evidently keeping a little in advance of me i sent on some men with the shopkeepers whom he had cheatedto our next stage in the hope of overtaking him but he had left the place before they arrived without passing any of his bad coin and gone on to agra the shopkeepers could not be persuaded to go any further after him for if they caught him they should they said have infinite trouble in prosecuting him in our courts without any chance of recovering from him what they had lost on the th we remained at dhōlpur to receive and return the visits of the young rājā or as he is called the young rānā a lad of about fifteen years of age very plain and very dull he came about ten in the forenoon with a very respectable and welldressed retinue and a tolerable show of elephants and horses the uniforms of his guards were made after those of our own soldiers and did not please me half so much as those of the datiyā guards who were permitted to consult their own tastes and the music of the drums and fifes seemed to me infinitely inferior to that of the mounted minstrels of my old friend parīchhit the lad had with him about a dozen old public servants entitled to chairs some of whom had served his father above thirty years while the ancestors of others had served his grandfathers and greatgrandfathers and i could not help telling the lad in their presence that these were the greatest ornament of a princes throne and the best signs and pledges of a good government they were all evidently much pleased at the compliment and i thought they deserved to be pleased from the good character they bore among the peasantry of the country i mentioned that i had understood the boatmen of the chambal at dhōlpur never caught or ate fish the lad seemed embarrassed and the minister took upon himself to reply that there was no market for it since the hindoos of dhōlpur never ate fish and the muhammadans had all disappeared i asked the lad whether he was fond of hunting he seemed again confounded and the minister said that his highness never either hunted or fished as people of his caste were prohibited from destroying life and yet said i they have often showed themselves good soldiers in battle they were all pleased again and said that they were not prohibited from killing tigers but that there was no jungle of any kind near dhōlpur and consequently no tigers to be found the jāts are descendants of the getae and were people of very low caste or rather of no caste at all among the hindoos and they are now trying to raise themselves by abstaining from killing and eating animals among hindoos this is everything a man of low caste is sab kuchh khātā sticks at nothing in the way of eating and a man of high caste is a man who abstains from eating anything but vegetable or farinaceous food if at the same time he abstains from using in his cookroom all woods but one and has that one washed before he uses it he is canonized having attained to military renown and territorial dominion in the usual way by robbery the jāts naturally enough seek the distinction of high caste to enable them the better to enjoy their position in society it had been stipulated that i should walk to the bottom of the steps to receive the rānā as is the usage on such occasions and carpets were accordingly spread thus far here he got out of his chair and i led him into the large room of the bungalow which we occupied during our stay followed by all his and my attendants the bungalow had been built by the former resident at gwālior the honourable r cavendish for his residence during the latter part of the rains when gwālior is considered to be unhealthy at his departure the rānā purchased this bungalow for the use of european gentlemen and ladies passing through his capital in the afternoon about four oclock i went to return his visit in a small palace not yet finished a pretty piece of miniature fortification surrounded by what they call their chhāonī or cantonments the streets are good and the buildings neat and substantial but there is nothing to strike or particularly interest the stranger the interview passed off without anything remarkable and i was more than ever pleased with the people by whom this young chief is surrounded indeed i had much reason to be pleased with the manners of all the people on this side of the chambal they are those of a people well pleased to see english gentlemen among them and anxious to make themselves useful and agreeable to us they know that their chief is indebted to the british government for all the country he has and that he would be swallowed up by sindhias greedy army were not the sevenfold shield of the honourable company spread over him his establishments civil and military like those of the bundēlkhand chiefs are raised from the peasantry and yeomanry or the country who all in consequence feel an interest in the prosperity and independent respectability of their chief on the gwālior side the members of all the public establishments know and feel that it is we who interpose and prevent their master from swallowing up all his neighbours and thereby having increased means of promoting their interest and that of their friends and they detest us all most cordially in consequence the peasantry of the gwālior territory seem to consider their own government as a kind of minotaur which they would be glad to see destroyed no matter how or by whom since it gives no lucrative or honourable employment to any of their members so as to interest either their pride or their affections nor throws back among them for purposes of local advantage any of the produce of their land and labour which it exacts it is worthy of remark that though the dhōlpur chief is peculiarly the creature of the british government and indebted to it for all he has or ever will have and though he has never had anything and never can have or can hope to have anything from the poor pageant of the house of tīmūr who now sits upon the throne of delhi yet on his seal of office he declares himself to be the slave and creature of that imperial warrior for the faith of islam as he abstains from eating the good fish of the river chambal to enhance his claim to caste among hindoos so he abstains from acknowledging his deep debt of gratitude to the honourable company or the british government with a view to give the rust of age to his rank and title to acknowledge himself a creature of the british government were to acknowledge that he was a man of yesterday to acknowledge himself the slave of the emperor is to claim for his poor veins the blood of a line of kings the petty chiefs of bundēlkhand who are in the same manner especially dependent on the british government do the same thingat dhōlpur there are some noble old mosques and mausoleums built three hundred years ago in the reign of the emperor humāyūn by some great officers of his government whose remains still rest undisturbed among them though the names of their families have been for many ages forgotten and no men of their creed now live near to demand for them the respect of the living these tombs are all elaborately built and worked out of the fine freestone of the country and the trelliswork upon some of their stone screens is still as beautiful as when first made there are persian and arabic inscriptions upon all of them and i found from them that one of the mosques had been built by the emperor shāh jahān in ad when he little dreamed that his three sons would here meet to fight the great fight for the throne while he yet sat upon it notes december the authors remark that in india the roads are nowhere metalled must seem hardly credible to a modern traveller who sees the country intersected by thousands of miles of metalled road the grand trunk road from calcutta to lahore constructed in lord dalhousies time alone measures about miles the development of roads since ha been enormous and yet the mileage of good roads would have to be increased tenfold to put india on an equality with the more advanced countries of europe ante chanter notes the baiza bāī was the widow of daulat rāo sindhia he had died on march with the consent of the government of india she adopted a boy as his successor but being an ambitions and intriguing woman she tried to keep all power in her own hands the young mahārājā fled from her and took refuge in the residency in october in december of the same year lord william bentinck visited gwālior and assumed an attitude of absolute neutrality the result was that trouble continued and seven months later the mahārājā again fled to the residency the troops then revolted against the baiza bāī and compelled her to retire to dhōlpur this event put an end to her political activity ultimately she was allowed to return to gwālior and died there in malleson the native states of india pp the author wrote an unpublished history of baiza bāī ante bibliography long

given up the prisoners are now as a rule employed only on the jail promises and cannot be utilized for outside work except under special circumstances by special sanction the notes to this edition have recorded many changes in india but no change has taken place in the difficulties which beset the administration of criminal law they are still those which the author describes and police commissions cannot remove them the power to exact security for good behaviour from known bad characters still exists and when discreetly used is of great value the conviction of atrocious robbers and murderers is perhaps less rare than it was in the authors time though many still escape even the minor penalty of arrest the want of a sound moral public opinion is the fundamental difficulty in indian police administrationa truth fully understood by the author but rarely realized by members of parliament the title of the dhōlpur chief is now mahārājā rānā in his reduced army numbered of all ranks i g the force is not of serious military value the identification of the jāts or jats with the getae is not even probable the anchor exaggerates the lowness of the social rank of the jāts who cannot properly be described as people of very low caste they are and have long been numerous and powerful in the panjāb and the neighbouring countries it is true that they hate brahmans care little for brahman notions of propriety either as regards food or marriage and to a certain extent stand outside the orthodox hindoo system but they are heterodox rather than lowcaste the rājās of bharatpur dhōlpur nābha patiālā and jīnd are all jāts the jāts are a fine and interesting people who seem to suffer little deterioration from the notorious laxity of their matrimonial arrangements they are skilled and industrious cultivators a saying has been current in upper india that if the british power is ever broken the succession will pass to the jāts this is the brahman and baniyā theory a highspirited rājpūt of rājputāna full of pride in his long ancestry and yet fond of wild boars flesh would indeed be wroth if denounced as a lowcaste man it is however unfortunately quite true that all races which become entangled in the meshes of hinduism tend to gradually surrender their freedom and to become proud of submission to the senseless formalities and restrictions which the brahman

irrigated and those that are not one day in the middle of the season of the rains i asked my gardener while walking with him over my grounds how it was that some of the fine clusters of bamboos had not yet begun to throw out their shoots we have not yet had a thunderstorm sir replied the gardener what in the name of god has the thunderstorm to do with the shooting of the bamboos asked i in amazement i dont know sir said he but certain it is that no bamboos begin to throw out their shoots well till we get a good deal of thunder and lightning the thunder and lightning came and the bamboo shoots soon followed in abundance it might have been a mere coincidence or the tall bamboo may bring down from the passing clouds and convey to the roots the electric fluid they require for nourishment or for conductors of nourishment in the isle of france people have a notion that the mushrooms always come up best after a thunderstorm electricity has certainly much more to do in the business of the world than we are yet aware of in the animal mineral and vegetable developments at our ground this day i met a very respectable and intelligent native revenue officer who had been employed to settle some boundary disputes between the yeomen of our territory and those of the adjoining territory of dhōlpur the honourable companys rights and those of its yeomen must said he be inevitably sacrificed in all such cases for the dhōlpur chief or his minister says to all their witnesses you are of course expected to speak the truth regarding the land in dispute but by the sacred stream of the ganges if you speak so as to lose this estate one inch of it you lose both your earsand most assuredly would they lose them continued he if they were not to swear most resolutely that all the land in question belonged to dhōlpur had i the same power to cut off the ears of witnesses on our side we should meet on equal terms were i to threaten to cut them off they would laugh in my face there was much truth in what the poor man said for the dhōlpur witnesses always make it appear that the claims of their yeomen are just and moderate and a salutary dread of losing their ears operates no doubt very strongly the threatened punishment of the prince is quick while that of the gods however just is certainly very slow ut sit magna tamen certe lenta ira deorum est on the st of january we went on sixteen miles to agra and when within about six miles of the city the dome and minarets of the tāj opened upon us from behind a small grove of fruittrees close by us on the side of the road the morning was not clear but it was a good one for a first sight of this building which appeared larger through the dusty haze than it would have done through a clear sky for fiveandtwenty years of my life had i been looking forward to the sight now before me of no building on earth had i heard so much as of this which contains the remains of the emperor shāh jahān and his wife the father and mother of the children whose struggles for dominion have been already described we had ordered our tents to be pitched in the gardens of this splendid mausoleum that we might have our fill of the enjoyment which everybody seemed to derive from it and we reached them about eight oclock i went over the whole building before i entered my tent and from the first sight of the dome and minarets on the distant horizon to the last glance back from my tentropes to the magnificent gateway that forms the entrance from our camp to the quadrangle in which they stand i can truly say that everything surpassed my expectations i at first thought the dome formed too large a portion of the whole building that its neck was too long and too much exposed and that the minarets were too plain in their design but after going repeatedly over every part and examining the tout ensemble from all possible positions and in all possible lights from that of the full moon at midnight in a cloudless sky to that of the noonday sun the mind seemed to repose in the calm persuasion that there was an entire harmony of parts a faultless congregation of architectural beauties on which it could dwell for ever without fatigue after my quarter of a century of anticipated pleasure i went on from part to part in the expectation that i must by and by come to something that would disappoint me but no the emotion which one feels at first is never impaired on the contrary it goes on improving from the first coup dœil of the dome in the distance to the minute inspection of the last flower upon the screen round the tomb one returns and returns to it with undiminished pleasure and though at everyreturn ones attention to the smaller parts becomes less and less the pleasure which he derives from the contemplation of the greater and of the whole collectively seems to increase and he leaves with a feeling of regret that he could not have it all his life within his reach and of assurance that the image of what he has seen can never be obliterated from his mind while memory holds her seat i felt that it was to me in architecture what kemble and his sister mrs siddons had been to me a quarter of a century before in actingsomething that must stand alonesomething that i should never cease to see clearly in my minds eye and yet never be able clearly to describe to others the emperor and his queen he buried side by side in a vault beneath the building to which we descend by a flight of steps their remains are covered by two slabs of marble and directly over these slabs upon the floor above in the great centre room under the dome stand two other slabs or cenotaphs of the same marble exquisitely worked in mosaic upon that of the queen amid wreaths of flowers are worked in black letters passages from the korān one of which at the end facing the entrance terminates with and defend us from the tribe of unbelievers that very tribe which is now gathered from all quarters of the civilized world to admire the splendour of the tomb which was raised to perpetuate her name on the slab over her husband there are no passages from the korānmerely mosaic work of flowers with his name and the date of his death i asked some of the learned muhammadan attendants the cause of this difference and was told that shāh jahān had himself designed the slab over his wife and saw no harm in inscribing the words of god upon it but that the slab over himself was designed by his more pious son aurangzēb who did not think it right to place these holy words upon a stone which the foot of man might some day touch though that stone covered the remains of his own father such was this man of prayers this namāzī as dara called him to the last he knew mankind well and above all that part of them which he was called upon to govern and which he governed for forty years with so much ability the slab over the queen occupies the centre of the apartments above and in the vault below and that over her husband lies on the left as we enter at one end of the slab in the vault her name is inwrought mumtāzimahal bānū bēgam the ornament of the palace bānū bēgam and the date of her death that of her husband and the date of his death are inwrought upon the other she died in giving birth to a daughter who is said to have been heard crying in the womb by herself and her other daughters she sent for the emperor and told him that she believed no mother had ever been known to survive the birth of a child so heard and that she felt her end was near she had she said only two requests to make first that he would not marry again after her death and get children to contend with hers for his favour and dominions and secondly that he would build for her the tomb with which he had promised to perpetuate her name she died in giving birth to the child as might have been expected when the emperor in his anxiety called all the midwives of the city and all his secretaries of state and privy counsellors to prescribe for her both her dying requests were granted her tomb was commenced upon immediately no woman ever pretended to supply her place in the palace nor had shāh jahān that we know of children by any other tavernier saw this building completed and finished and tells us that it occupied twenty thousand men for twentytwo years the mausoleum itself and all the buildings that appertain to it cost three karōr seventeen lākhs fortyeight thousand and twentysix rupees or sterlingthree million one hundred and seventyfour thousand eight hundred and two i asked my wife when she had gone over it what she thought of the building i cannot said she tell you what i think for i know not how to criticize such a building but i can tell you what i feel i would die tomorrow to have such another over me this is what many a lady has felt no doubt the building stands upon the north side of a large quadrangle looking down into the clear blue stream of the river jumna while the other three sides are enclosed with a high wall of red sandstone the entrance to this quadrangle is through a magnificent gateway in the south side opposite the tomb and on the other two sides are very beautiful mosques facing inwards and corresponding exactly with each other in size design and execution that on the left or west side is the only one that can be used as a mosque or church because the faces of the audience and those of all men at their prayers must be turned towards the tomb of their prophet to the west the pulpit is always against the dead wall at the back and the audience face towards it standing with their backs to the open front of the building the church on the east side is used for the accommodation of visitors or for any secular purpose and was built merely as a jawāb answer to the real one the whole area is laid out in square parterres planted with flowers and shrubs in the centre and with fine trees chiefly the cypress all round the borders forming an avenue to every road these roads are all paved with slabs of freestone and have running along the centre a basin with a row of jets deau in the middle from one extremity to the other these are made to play almost every evening when the gardens are much frequented by the european gentlemen and ladies of the station and by natives of all religions and sects the quadrangle is from east to west nine hundred and sixtyfour feet and from north to south three hundred and twentyninel the mausoleum itself the terrace upon which it stands and the minarets are all formed of the finest white marble inlaid with precious stones the wall around the quadrangle including the river face of the terrace is made of red sandstone with cupolas and pillars of the same white marble the insides of the churches and apartments in and upon the walls are all lined with marble or with stucco work that looks like marble but on the outside the red sandstone resembles uncovered bricks the dazzling white marble of the mausoleum itself rising over the red wall is apt at first sight to make a disagreeable impression from the idea of a whitewashed head to an unfinished building but this impression is verysoon removed and tends perhaps to improve that which is afterwards received from a nearer inspection the marble was all brought from the jeypore territories upon wheeled carriages a distance i believe of two or three hundred miles and the sandstone from the neighbourhood of dhōlpur and fathpur sīkrī shāh jāhan is said to have inherited his partiality for this colour from his grandfather akbar who constructed almost all his buildings from the same stone though he might have had the beautiful white freestone at the same cost what was figuratively said of augustus may be most literally said of shāh jahān he found the cities agra and delhi all brick and left them all marble for all the marble buildings and additions to buildings were formed by him this magnificent building and the palaces at agra and delhi were i believe designed by austin de bordeaux a frenchman of great talent and merit in whose ability and integrity the emperor placed much reliance he was called by the natives ustān sic isā nādirulasr the wonderful of the age and for his office of naksha navīs or plandrawer he received a regular salary of one thousand rupees a month with occasional presents that made his income very large he had finished the palace at delhi and the mausoleum and palace of agra and was engaged in designing a silver ceiling for one of the galleries in the latter when he was sent by the emperor to settle some affairs of great importance at goa he died at cochin on his way back and is supposed to have been poisoned by the portuguese who were extremely jealous of his influence at court he left a son by a native called muhammad sharīf who was employed as an architect on a salary of five hundred rupees a month and who became as i conclude from his name a musalmān shāh jahān had commenced his own tomb on the opposite side of the jumna and both were to have been united by a bridge the death of austin de bordeaux and the wars between his scil shāh jahāns sons that followed prevented the completion of these magnificent works we were encamped upon a fine green sward outside the entrance to the south in a kind of large court enclosed by a high cloistered wall in which all our attendants and followers found shelter colonel and mrs king and some other gentlemen were encamped in the same place and for the same purpose and we had a very agreeable party the band of our friend major godbys regiment played sometimes in the evening upon the terrace of the tāj but of all the complicated music ever heard upon earth that of a flute blown gently in the vault below where the remains of the emperor and his consort repose as the sound rises to the dome amidst a hundred arched alcoves around and descends in heavenly reverberations upon those who sit or recline upon the cenotaphs above the vault is perhaps the finest to an inartificial car we feel as if it were from heaven and breathed by angels it is to the ear what the building itself is to the eye but unhappily it cannot like the building live in our recollections all that we can in after life remember is that it was heavenly and produced heavenly emotions we went all over the palace in the fort a very magnificent building constructed by shāh jahān within fortifications raised by his grandfather akbar the fretwork and mosaic upon the marble pillars and panels are equal to those of the tāj or if possible superior nor is the design or execution in any respect inferior and yet a european feels that he could get a house much more commodious and more to his taste for a much less sum than must have been expended upon it the marquis of hastings when governorgeneral of india broke up one of the most beautiful marble baths of this palace to send home to george iv of england then prince regent and the rest of the marble of the suite of apartments from which it had been taken with all its exquisite fretwork and mosaic was afterwards sold by auction on account of our government by order of the then governorgeneral lord w bentinck had these things fetched the price expected it is probable that the whole of the palace and even the tāj itself would have been pulled down and sold in the same manner we visited the motī masjid or pearl mosque it was built by shāh jahān entirely of white marble and completed as we learn from an inscription on the portico in the year ad there is no mosaic upon any of the pillars or panels of this mosque but the design and execution of the flowers in basrelief are exceedingly beautiful it is a chaste simple and majestic building and is by some people admired even more than the tāj because they have heard less of it and their pleasure is heightened by surprise we feel that it is to all other mosques what the tāj is to all other mausoleums a facile princeps few however go to see the mosque of pearls more than once stay as long as they will at agra and when they go the building appears less and less to deserve their admiration while they go to the tāj as often as they can and find new beauties in it or new feelings of pleasure from it every time i went out to visit this tomb of the emperor akbar at sikandara a magnificent building raised over him by his son the emperor jahāngīr his remains he deposited in a deep vault under the centre and are covered by a plain slab of marble without fretwork or mosaic on the top of the building which is three or four stories high is another marble slab corresponding with the one in the vault below this is beautifully carved with the nau nauwē nāmthe ninetynine names or attributes of the deity from the korān it is covered by an awning not to protect the tomb but to defend the words of god from the rain as my cicerone assured me he told me that the attendants upon this tomb used to have the hay of the large quadrangle of forty acres in which it stands in addition to their small salaries and that it yielded them some fifty rupees a year but the chief native officer of the tāj establishment demanded half of the sum andwhen they refused to give him so much he persuaded his master the european engineer with much difficulty to take all this hay for the public cattle and why could you not adjust such a matter between you without pestering the engineer is not this the way said he with emotion that hindustan has cut its own throat and brought in the stranger at all times have they ever had or can they ever have confidence in each other or let each other alone to enjoy the little they have in peace considering all the circumstances of time and place akbar has always appeared to me among sovereigns what shakespeare was among poets and feeling as a citizen of the world i reverenced the marble slab that covers his bones more perhaps than i should that over any other sovereign with whose history i am acquainted notes december it is not perhaps generally known though it deserves to be so that the bamboo seeds only once and dies immediately after seeding all bamboos from the same seed die at the same time whenever they may have been planted the life of the common large bamboo is about fifty years w h s the period is said to vary between thirty and sixty years bamboo seed is eaten as rice when obtainable the authors theories about electricity are more ingenious than satisfactory better known as the mauritius this proposition may be accepted with confidence electricity is a great mystery which becomes more mysterious the more it is studied a letter of the authors dated th march is extant in which he gives a full description of the performance of macbeth at the haymarket by kemble and mrs siddons on saturday th march the author sailed in the devonshire on the th march no european had ever before i believe noted this w h s moīnuddīn p says that this phrase thou art our patron help

seeled all within with pure sheet gold richly inwrought the reason for omitting the dome is not recorded the area is much larger than acres being really about acres each side is approximately furlongs this remarkable eulogium is quoted with approval by another enthusiastic admirer of akbar count von noer prince frederick augustus of schleswigholstein who observes that as akbar was unique amongst

unsatisfactory though it is in many respects is still the best exiting modern account of akbars reign the competent scholar who will undertake the exhaustive treatment of the life and reign of akbar will be in possession of perhaps the finest great historical subject as yet unappropriated the editor long cherished the idea of writing such an exhaustive work but if he should now attempt to deal with the fascinating theme he must be content with a less ambitions performance colonel mallesons little book in the rulers of india series although serviceable as a sketch adds nothing to the worlds knowledge akbars reign was almost exactly coincident with that of queen elizabeth the character and deeds of the indian monarch will bear criticism as well as those of his great english contemporary in dealing observes mr lanepoole with the difficulties arising in the government of a peculiarly heterogeneous empire he stands absently supreme among oriental sovereigns and may even challenge

aurangzēb was actively at war with shivā jī scil the marāthās the villagers of whom i spoke before broke into the mausoleum in the year in words and after stealing all the stones and all the gold work

me a new dome within the fort one of the emperors of course said he what makes you think so because such things are made only by emperors replied the man quietly without relaxing his pull at the oar true very true said an old musalmān trooper with large white whiskers and moustachios who had dismounted to follow me across the river with a melancholy shake of the head very true who but emperors could do such things as these encouraged by the trooper the boatman continuedthe jāts and the marāthās did nothing but pull down and destroy while they held their accursed dominion here and the

the remains of the other members of his family repose in rooms all round them and are covered with slabs of marble richly cut it is an exceedingly beautiful building but a great part of the most valuable stones of the mosaic work have been picked out and stolen and the whole is about to be sold by auction by a decree of the civil court to pay the debt of the present proprietor who is entirely unconnected with the family whose members repose under it and especially indifferent as to what becomes of their bones the building and garden in which it stands were some sixty years ago given away i believe by nājīf khān the prime minister to one of his nephews to whose family it still belongs khwaja ghiās a native of western tartary left that country for india where he had some relations at the imperial court who seemed likely to be able to secure his advancement he was a man of handsome person and of good education and address he set out with his wife a bullock and a small sum of money which he realized by the sale of all his other property the wife who was pregnant rode upon the bullock while he walked by her side their stock of money had become exhausted and they had been three days without food in the great desert when she was taken in labour and gave birth to a daughter the mother could hardly keep her seat on the bullock and the father had become too exhausted to afford her any support and in their distress they agreed to abandon the infant they covered it over with leaves and towards evening pursued their journey when they had gone on about a mile and had lost sight of the solitary shrub under which they had left their child the mother in an agony of grief threw herself from the bullock upon the ground exclaiming my child my child ghiās could not resist this appeal he went back to the spot took up his child and brought it to its mothers breast some travellers soon after came up and relieved their distress and they reached lahore where the emperor akbar then held his court āsaf khan a distant relation of ghiās held a high place at court and was much in the confidence of the emperor he made his kinsman his private secretary much pleased with his diligence and ability āsaf soon brought his merits to the special notice of akbar who raised him to the command of a thousand horse and soon after appointed him master of the household from this he was promoted afterwards to that of itimāduddaula or high treasurer one of the first ministers the daughter who had been born in the desert became celebrated for her great beauty parts and accomplishments and won the affections of the eldest son of the emperor the prince salīm who saw her unveiled by accident at a party given by her father she had been betrothed before this to shēr afgan a turkoman gentleman of rank at court and of great repute for his high spirit strength and courage salīm in vain entreated his father to interpose his authority to make him resign his claim in his favour and she became the wife of shēr afgan salīm dare not during his fathers life make any open attempt to revenge himself but he and those courtiers who thought it their interest to worship the rising sun soon made his afgans residence at the capital disagreeable and he retired with his wife to bengal where he obtained from the governor the superintendency of the district of bardwān salīm succeeded his father on the throne and no longer restrained by his scil akbars rigid sense of justice he recalled shēr afgan to court at delhi he was promoted to high offices and concluded that time had removed from theemperors mind all feelings of love for his wife and of resentment against his successful rivalbut he was mistaken salīm had never forgiven him nor had the desire to possess his wife at all diminished a muhammadan of such high feeling and station would the emperor knew never survive the dishonour or suspected dishonour of his wife and to possess her he must make away with the husband he dared not do this openly because he dreaded the universal odium in which he knew it would involve him and he made several unsuccessful attempts to get him removed by means that might not appear to have been contrived or executed by his orders at one time he designedly in his own presence placed him in a situation where the pride of the chief made him contend singlehanded with a large tiger which he killed and at another with a mad elephant whose proboscis he cut off with his sword but the emperors motives in all these attempts to put him foremost in situations of danger became so manifest that shēr afgan solicited and obtained permission to retire with his wife to bengal the governor of this province kutb having been made acquainted with the emperors desire to have the chief made away with hired forty ruffians who stole into his house one night there happened to be nobody else in the house but one of the party touched by remorse on seeing so fine a man about to be murdered in his sleep called out to him to defend himself he seized his sword placed himself in one corner of the room and defended himself so well that nearly onehalf of the party are said to have been killed or wounded the rest all made off persuaded that he was endowed with supernatural force after this escape he retired from tānda the capital of bengal to his old residence of bardwān soon after kutb came to the city with a splendid retinue on pretence of making a tour of inspection through the provinces under his charge but in reality for the sole purpose of making away with shēr afgan who as soon as he heard of his approach came out some miles to meet him on horseback attended by only two followers he was received with marks of great consideration and he and the governor rode on for some time side by side talking of their mutual friends and the happy days they had spent together at the capital at last as they were about to enter the city the governor suddenly called for his elephant of state and mounted saying it would be necessary for him to pass through the city on the first visit in some state shēr sat on horseback while he mounted but one of the governors pikemen struck his horse and began to drive him before them shēr drew his sword and seeing all the governors followers with theirs ready drawn to attack him he concluded at once that the affront had been put upon him by the orders of kutb and with the design to provoke him to an unequal fight determined to have his life first he spurred his horse upon the elephant and killed kutb with his spear he now attacked the principal of officers and five noblemen of the first rank fell by his sword all the crowd now rolled back and formed a circle round shēr and his two companions and galled them with arrows and musket balls from a distance his horse fell under him and expired and having received six balls and several arrows in his body shēr himself at last fell exhausted to the ground and the crowd seeing the sword drop from his grasp rushed in and cut him to piecesl his widow was sent nothing loth to court with her only child a daughter she was graciously received by the emperors mother and had apartments assigned her in the palace but the emperor himself is said not to have seen her for four years during which time the fame of her beauty talents and accomplishments filled the palace and city after the expiration of this time the feelings whatever they were which prevented his seeing her subsided and when he at last surprised her with a visit he found her to exceed all that his imagination had painted since their last separation in a few days their marriage was celebrated with great magnificence and from that hour the emperor resigned the reins of government almost entirely into her hands and till his death under the name first of nūr mahall light of the palace and afterwards of nūr jahān light of the world she ruled the destinies of this great empire her father was now raised from the station of high treasurer to that of prime minister her two brothers obtained the titles of āsaf jāh and itikād khan and the relations of the family poured in from tartary in search of employment as soon as they heard of their success nūr jahān had by sher afgan as i have stated one daughter but she had never any child by the emperor jahāngīr āsaf jāh became prime minister on the death of his father and in spite of his sister he managed to secure the crown to shāh jahān the third son of jahāngīr who had married his daughter the lady over whose remains the tāj was afterwards built jahāngīrs eldest son khusrū had his eyes put out by his fathers orders for repeated rebellions to which he had been instigated by a desire to revenge his mothers murder and by the ambition of her brother the hindoo prince mān singh who wished to see his own nephew on the throne and by his wifes father the prime minister of akbar khan azam nūr jahān had invited the mother of khusrū the sister of rājā mān singh to look with her down a well in the courtyard of her apartments by moonlight and as she did so she threw her in as soon as she saw that she had ceased to struggle she gave the alarm and pretended that she had fallen in by accident by the murder of the mother of the heirapparent she expected to secure the throne to a creature of her own khusrū was treated with great kindness by his father after he had been barbarously deprived of sight but when his brother shāh jahān was appointed to the government of southern india he pretended great solicitude about the comforts of his poor blind brother which he thought would not be attended to at court and took him with him to his government in the deccan where he got him assassinated as the only sure mode of securing the throne to himself parwīz the second son died a natural death so also did his only son and so also dāniyāl the fourth son of the emperor nūr jahāns daughter by shēr afgan had married shahryār a young son of the emperor by a concubine and just before his death he the emperor at the instigation of nūr jahān named this son as his successor in his will he was placed uponthe throne and put in possession of the treasury and at the head of a respectable army but the empresss brother āsaf designed the throne for his own soninlaw shāh jahān and as soon as the emperor died he put up a puppet to amuse the people till he could come up with his army from the deccanbulākī the eldest son of the deceased khusrū shahryārs troops were defeated he was taken prisoner and had his eyes put out forthwith and the empress was put into close confinement as shāh jahān approached lahore with his army āsaf put his puppet bulākī and his younger brother with the two young sons of dāniyāl into prison where they were strangled by a messenger sent on for the purpose by shāh jahān with the sanction of āsaf this measure left no male heir alive of the house of tīmūr tamerlane in hindustan save shāh jahān himself and his four sons dārā was then thirteen years of age shujā twelve aurangzēb ten and murād four and all were present to learn from their father this sad lessonthat such of them who might be alive on his death save one must with their sons be hunted down and destroyed like mad dogs lest they might get into the hands of the disaffected and be made the tools of faction monsieur de thevenot who visited agra as i have before stated in says some affirm that there are twentyfive thousand christian families in agra but all do not agree in that the dutch have a factory in the town but the english have now none because it did not turn to account the number must have been great or so sober a man as monsieur thevenot would not have thought such an estimate worthy to be quoted without contradiction they were all except those connected with the single dutch factory maintained from the salaries of office and they gradually disappeared as their offices became filled with muhammadans and hindoos the duties of the artillery its arsenals and foundries were the chief foundation upon which the superstructure of christianity then stood in india these duties were everywhere entrusted exclusively to europeans and all europeans were christians and under shāh jahān permitted freely to follow their own modes of worship they were too roman catholic and spent the greater part of their incomes in the maintenance of priests but they could never forget that they were strangers in the land and held their offices upon a precarious tenure and consequently they never felt disposed to expend the little wealth they had in raising durable tombs churches and other public buildings to tell posterity who or what they were present physical enjoyment and the prayers of their priests for a good berth in the next world were the only objects of their ambition muhammadans and hindoos soon learned to perform duties which they saw bring to the christians so much of honour and emolument and as they did so they necessarily sapped the walls of the fabric christianity never became independent of office in india and i am afraid never will even under our rule it still mainly rests upon that foundation notes the

the midst of a garden surrounded by a wall measuring feet on each side in the centre of this on a raised platform stands the tomb itself a square measuring feet on each side it is two stories in height and at each angle is an octagonal tower surmounted by an open pavilion the towers however are rather squat in proportion and the general design of the building very far from being so pleasing as that of many less pretentious tombs in the neighbourhood had it indeed been built in red sandstone or even with an inlay of white marble like that of humāyūn it would not have attracted much attention its real merit consists in being wholly in white marble and being covered throughout with a mosaic in pietra durathe first apparently and certainly one of the most splendid examples of that class of ornamentation in india as one of the first the tomb of itimāduddaula was certainly one of the least successful specimens of its class the patterns do not quite fit the places where they are put and the spaces are not always those best suited for this style ofdecoration altogether i cannot help fancying that the italians had more to do with the design of this building than was at all desirable and they are to blame for its want of gracea but on the other hand the beautiful tracery of the pierced marble slabs of its windows which resemble those of salīm chishtīs tomb at fatehpur

and inconsistent with the correct statement in the heading of the chapter that nūr jahān daughter of ghiāsuddīn was aunt of the lady of the tāj the author makes out ghiāsuddīn whom he corruptly calls aeeas to be a distant relation of āsaf khan in reality āsaf khān whose original name was mirzā abūl hasan was the second son of ghiāsud dīn and was elder brother of nūr jahān the genealogy so far as relevant is best shown in a tabular form thus alī qulī beg from persia entered akbars service and in the war with the rānā of chitōr served under prince salīm jahāngīr who gave him the title of shēr

the province and the wife was placed under the care of one of akbars widows with whom she remained four years and then married jahāngīr there is nothing to justify a suspicion of the emperors

one evening and major godby took occasion to ask him at table what progress our religion was making among the people progress said he why what progress can we ever hope to make among a people who the moment we begin to talk to them about the miracles performed by christ begin to tell us of those infinitely more wonderful performed by krishna who lifted a mountain upon his little finger as an umbrella to defend his shepherdesses at govardhan from a shower of rain the hindoos never doubt any part of the miracles and prophecies of our scripturethey believe every word of them and the only thing that surprises them is that they should be so much less wonderful than those of their own scriptures in which also they implicitly believe men who believe that the histories of the wars and amours of rām and krishna two of the incarnations of vishnu were written some fifty thousand years before these wars and amours actually took place upon the earth would of course easily believe in the fulfilment of any prophecy that might be related to them out of any other book and as to miracles there is absolutely nothing too extraordinary for their belief if a christian of respectability were to tell a hindoo that to satisfy some scruples of the corinthians st paul had brought the sun and moon down upon the earth and made them rebound off again into their places like tennis balls without the slightest injury to any of the three planets sic i do not think he would feel the slightest doubt of the truth of it but he would immediately be put in mind of something still more extraordinary that krishna did to amuse the milkmaids or to satisfy some sceptics of his day and relate it with all the naïveté imaginable i saw at agra mirzā kām baksh the eldest son of sulaimān shikoh the eldest son of the brother of the present emperor he had spent a season with us at jubbulpore while prosecuting his claim to an estate against the rājā of rīwā the emperor shāh ālam in his flight before our troops from bengal struck off the high road to delhi at mirzapore and came down to rīwā where he found an asylum during the season of the rains with the rīwā rājā who assigned for his residence the village of makanpur his wife the empress was here delivered of a son the present emperor of hindustān akbar shāh and the rājā assigned to him and his heirs for ever the fee simple of this village as the members of this family increased in geometrical ratio under the new system which gave them plenty to eat with nothing to do the emperor had of late been obliged to hunt round for little additions to his income and in his search he found that makanpur gave name to a pargana or little district of which it was the capital and that a good deal of merchandize passed through this district and paid heavy dues to the rājā nothing he thought would be lost by trying to get the whole district instead of the village and for this purpose he sent down kām baksh the ablest man of the whole family to urge and prosecute his claim but the rājā was a close shrewd man and not to be done out of his revenue and kām baksh was obliged to return minus some thousand rupees which he had spent in attempting to keep up appearances the best of us europeans feel our deficiencies in conversation with muhammadans of high rank and education when we are called upon to talk upon subjects beyond the everyday occurrences of life a muhammadan gentleman of education is tolerably acquainted with astronomy as it was taught by ptolemy with the logic and ethics of aristotle and plato with the works of hippocrates and galen through those of avicenna or as they call him abū alīsīna and he is very capable of talking upon all subjects of philosophy literature science and the arts and very much inclined to do so and of understanding the nature of the improvements that have been made in them in modern times but however capable we may feel of discussing these subjects or explaining these improvements in our own language we all feel ourselves very much at a loss when we attempt to do it in theirs perhaps few europeans have mixed and conversed more freely with all classes than i have and yet i feel myself sadly deficient when i enter as i often do into discussions with muhammadan gentlemen of education upon the subject of the character of the governments and institutions of different countriestheir effects upon the character and condition of the people the arts and the sciences the faculties and operations of the human mind and the thousand other things which are subjects of everyday conversation among educated and thinking men in our country i feel that they could understand me quite well if i could find words for my ideas but these i cannot find though their languages abound in them nor have i ever met the european gentleman who could east indians can but they commonly want the ideas as much as we want the language the chief cause of this deficiency is the want of sufficient intercourse with men in whose presence we should be ashamed to appear ignorant this is the great secret and all should know and acknowledge it we are not ashamed to convey our orders to our native servants in a barbarous language military officers seldom speak to their sipāhīs sepoys and native officers about anything but arms accoutrements and drill or to other natives about anything but the sports of the field and as long as they are understood they care not one straw in what language they express themselves the conversation of the civil servants with their native officers takes sometimes a wider range but they have the same philosophical indifference as to the language in which they attempt to convey their ideas and i haveheard some of our highest diplomatic characters talking without the slightest feeling of shame or embarrassment to native princes on the most ordinary subjects of everyday interest in a language which no human being but themselves could understand we shall remain the same till some change of system inspire us with stronger motives to please and conciliate the educated classes of the native community they may be reconciled but they can never be charmed out of their prejudices or the errors of their preconceived opinions by such language as the european gentlemen are now in the habit of speaking to them we must learn their language better or we must teach them our own before we can venture to introduce among them those free institutions which would oblige us to meet them on equal terms at the bar on the bench and in the senate perhaps two of the best secular works that were ever written upon the facilities and operations of the human mind and the duties of men in their relations with each other are those of imāmuddīn ghazzālī and nasīruddīn of tūs their idol was plato but their works are of a more practical character than his and less dry than those of aristotle i may here mention the following among many instances that occur to me of the amusing mistakes into which europeans are liable to fall in their conversation with natives mr j wn of the bengal civil service commonly known by the name of beau wn was the honourable companys opium agent at patna when i arrived at dinapore to join my regiment in he had a splendid house and lived in excellent style and was never so happy as when he had a dozen young men from the dinapore cantonments living with him he complained that year as i was told that he had not been able to save more than one hundred thousand rupees that season out of his salary and commission upon the opium purchased by the government from the cultivators the members of the civil service in the other branches of public service were all anxious to have it believed by their countrymen that they were well acquainted with their duties and able and willing to perform them but the honourable companys commercial agents were on the contrary generally anxious to make their countrymen believe that they neither knew nor cared anything about their duties because they were ashamed of them they were sinecure posts for the drones of the service or for those who had great interest and no capacity had any young man made it appear that he really thought wn knew or cared anything about his duties he would certainly never have been invited to his house again and if any one knew certainly no one seemed to know that he had any other duty than that of entertaining his guests no one ever spoke the native language so badly because no man had ever so little intercourse with the natives and it was i have been told to his ignorance of the native languages that his bosom friend mr pst owed his life on one occasion w sat by the sickbed of his friend with unwearied attention for some days and nights after the doctors had declared his case entirely hopeless he proposed at last to try change of air and take him on the river ganges the doctors thinking that he might as well die in his boat on the river as in his house at calcutta consented to his taking him on board they got up as far as hooghly when p said that he felt better and thought he could eat something what should it be a little roasted kid perhaps the very thing that he was longing for w went out upon the deck to give orders for the kid that his friend might not be disturbed by the gruff voice of the old khānsāmā butler p heard the conversation however khānsāmā said the beau w you know that my friend mr p is very ill yes sir and that he has not eaten anything for a month a long time for a man to fast sir yes khānsāmā and his stomach is now become very delicate and could not stand anything strong certainly not sir well khānsāmā then he has taken a fancy to a roasted mare mādiyān meaning a halwān or kid a roasted mare sir yes khānsāmā a roasted mare which you must have nicely prepared what the whole sir not the whole at one time but have the whole ready as there is no knowing what part he may like best the old butter had heard of the tartars eating their horses when in robust health but the idea of a sick man not able to move in his bed without assistance taking a fancy to a roasted mare quite staggered him but sir i may not be able to get such a thing as a mare at a moments notice and if i get her she will be very dearnever mind khānsāmā get you the mare cost what she will if she costs a thousand rupees my friend shall have her he has taken a fancy to the mare and the mare he shall have if she costs a thousand rupees the butter made his salaam said he would do his best and took his leave requesting that the boats might be kept at the bank of the river till he came back w went into his sick friend who with great difficulty managed to keep his countenance while he complained of the liberties old servants were in the habit of taking with their masters they think themselves privileged said w to conjure up difficulties in the way of everything that one wants to have done yes said pst we like to have old and faithful servants about us particularly when we are sick but they are apt to take liberties which new ones will not in about two hours the butlers approach was announced from the deck and w walked out to scold him for his delay the old gentleman was coming down over the bank followed by about eight men bearing the four quarters of an old mare the butler was very fat and the proud consciousness of having done his duty and met his masters wishes in a very difficult and important point had made him a perfect falstaff he marshalled his men in front of the cookingboat and then came towards his master who for some time stood amazed and unable to speak at last he roared out and what the devil have you here why the mare that the sick gentleman took a fancy for and dear enough she has cost me not a farthing less than two hundred rupees would the fellow take for his mare pst could contain himself no longer he burst into an immoderate fit of laughter during which the abscess in his liver burst into the intestines and he felt himself relieved as if by enchantment the mistake was rectifiedhe got his kid and in ten days he was taken back to calcutta a sound man to the great astonishment of all the doctors during the first campaign against nepāl in colonel now majorgeneral oh who commanded the regiment n i had to march with his regiment through the town of darbhanga the capital of the rājā who came to pay his respects to him he brought a number of presents but the colonel a highminded amiable man never took anything himself nor suffered any person in his camp to do so in the districts they passed through without paying for it he politely declined to take any of the presents but said that he had heard that darbhanga produced crows kauwā and should be glad to get some of them if the rājā could spare themmeaning coffee or kahwā the rājā stared and said that certainly they had abundance of crows in darbhanga but he thought they were equally abundant in all parts of india quite the contrary rājā sāhib i assure you said the colonel there is not such a thing as a crow to be found in any part of the companys dominions that i have seen and i have been all over them very strange said the rājā turning round to his followers yes replied they it is very strange rājā sāhib but such is your ikbāl good fortune that everything thrives under it and if the colonel should wish to have a few crows we could easily collect them for him if said the colonel greatly delighted you could provide us with a few of these crows we should really feel very much obliged to you for we have a long and cold campaign before us among the bleak hills of nepal and we are all fond of crows indeed returned the rājā i shall be happy to send you as many as you wish much and many are expressed by the same term then we should be glad to have two or three bags full if it would not be robbing you not in the least said the rājā i will go home and order them to be collected immediately in the evening as the officers with the colonel at their head were sitting down to dinner a man came up to announce the rājās present three fine large bags were brought in and the colonel requested that one might be opened immediately it was opened accordingly and the mess butler khansāmān drew out by the legs a fine old crow the colonel immediately saw the mistake and laughed as heartily as the rest at the result a polite message was sent to the rājā requesting that he would excuse his having made itfor he had had half a dozen men out shooting crows all day with their matchlocks few europeans spoke the language better than general and i do not believe that one european in a thousand at this very moment makes any difference or knows any difference in the sound of the two termskām baksh had one sister married to the king of oudh and another to mirzā salīm the younger son of the emperor mirzā salīm and his wife could not agree and a separation took place and she went to reside with her sister the queen of oudh the king saw her frequently and finding her more beautiful than his wife he demanded her also in marriage from her father who resided at lucknow the capital of oudh on a pension of five thousand rupees a month from the king he would not consent and demanded his daughter the king finding her willing to share his bed and board with her sister would not give her up the father got his old friend colonel gardiner who had married a muhammadan woman of rank to come down and plead his cause the king gave up the young woman but at the same time stopped the fathers pension and ordered him and all his family out of his dominions he set out with colonel gardiner and his daughter on his road to delhi through kāsganj the residence of the colonel who was one day recommending the prince to seek consolation for the loss of his pension in the proud recollection of having saved the honour of the house of tamerlane when news was brought to them that the daughter had run off from camp with his colonel gardiners son james who had accompanied him to lucknow the prince and the colonel mounted their horses and rode after him but they were so much heavier and older than the young ones that they soon gave up the chase in despair sulaimān shikoh insisted upon the colonel immediately fighting him after the fashion of the english with swords or pistols but was soon persuaded that the honour of the house of tīmūr would be much better preserved by allowing the offending parties to marry the king of oudh was delighted to find that the old man had been so punished and the queen no less so to find herself so suddenly and unexpectedly relieved from all dread of her sisters return all parties wrote to my friend kām baksh who was then at jubbulpore and he came off

one regiment of european and four regiments of native infantry near the artillery practiceground we passed the tomb of jodh bāī the wife of the emperor akbar and the mother of jahāngīr she was of rājpūt caste daughter of the hindoo chief of jodhpur a very beautiful and it is said a very amiable woman the mogul emperors though muhammadans were then in the habit of taking their wives from among the rājpūt princes of the country with a view to secure their allegiance the tomb itself is in ruins having only part of the dome standing and the walls and magnificent gateway that at one time surrounded it have been all taken away and sold by a thrifty government or appropriated to purposes of more practical utility i have heard many muhammadans say that they could trace the decline of their empire in hindustan to the loss of the rājpūt blood in the veins of their princes better blood than that of the rājpūts of india certainly never flowed in the veins of any human beings or what is the same thing no blood was ever believed to be finer by the people themselves and those they had to deal with the difference is all in the imagination and the imagination is allpowerful with nations as with individuals the britons thought their blood the finest in the world till they were conquered by the romans the picts the scots and the saxons the saxons thought theirs the finest in the world till they were conquered by the danes and the normans this is the history of the human race the quality of the blood of a whole people has depended often upon the fate of a battle which in the ancient world doomed the vanquished to the hammer and the hammer changed the blood of those sold by it from generation to generation how many norman robbers got their blood ennobled and how many saxon nobles got theirs plebeianized by the battle of hastings and how difficult it would be for any of us to say from which we descendedthe britons or the saxons the danes or the normans or in what particular action our ancestors were the victors or the vanquished and became ennobled or plebeianized by the thousand accidents which influence the fate of battles a series of successful aggressions upon their neighbours will commonly give a nation a notion that they are superior in courage and pride will make them attribute this superiority to bloodthat is to an old date this was perhaps never more exemplified than in the case of the gūrkhas of nepal a small diminutive race of men not unlike the huns but certainly as brave as any men can possibly be a gūrkha thought himself equal to any four other men of the hills though they were all much stronger just as a dane thought himself equal to four saxons at one time in britain the other men of the hills began to think that he really was so and could not stand before him we passed many wells from which the people were watering their fields and found those which yielded a brackish water were considered to be much more valuable for irrigation than those which yielded sweet water it is the same in the valley of the nerbudda but brackish water does not suit some soils and some crops on the th we reached fathpur sīkrī which lies about twentyfour miles from agra and stands upon the back of a narrow range of sandstone hills rising abruptly from the alluvial plains to the highest about one hundred feet and extends three miles northnorth east and southsouthwest this place owes its celebrity to a muhammadan saint the shaikh salīm of chisht a town in persia who owed his to the following circumstance the emperor akbars sons had all died in infancy and he made a pilgrimage to the shrine of the celebrated muīnuddīn of chisht at ajmēr he and his family went all the way on foot at the rate of three kōs or four miles a day a distance of about three hundred and fifty miles kanāts or cloth walls were raised on each side of the road carpets spread over it and high towers of burnt bricks erected at every stage to mark the places where he rested on reaching the shrine he made a supplication to the saint who at night appeared to him in his sleep and recommended him to go and entreat the intercession of a very holy old man who lived a secluded life upon the top of the little range of hills at sīkrī he went accordingly and was assured by the old man then ninetysix years of age that the empress jodh bāī the daughter of a hindoo prince would be delivered of a son who would live to a good old age she was then pregnant and remained in the vicinity of the old mans hermitage till her confinement which took place st of august the infant was called after the hermit mirzā salīm and became in time emperor of hindostan under the name of jahāngīr it was to this emperor jahāngīr that sir thomas roe the ambassador was sent from the english court akbar in order to secure to himself his family and his people the advantage of the continued intercessions of so holy a man took up his residence at sīkrī and covered the hill with magnificent buildings for himself his courtiers and his public establishments the quadrangle which contains the mosque on the west side and tomb of the old hermit in the centre was completed inthe year six years before his death and is perhaps one of the finest in the world it is five hundred and seventyfive feet square and surrounded by a high wall with a magnificent cloister all around within on the outside is a magnificent gateway at the top of a noble flight of steps twentyfour feet high the whole gateway is one hundred and twenty feet in height and the same in breadth and presents beyond the wall five sides of an octagon of which the front face is eighty feet wide the arch in the centre of this space is sixty feet high by forty wide this gateway is no doubt extremely grand and beautiful but what strikes one most is the disproportion between the thing wanted and the thing providedthere seems to be something quite preposterous in forming so enormous an entrance for a poor diminutive man to walk throughand walk he must unless carried through on mens shoulders for neither elephant horse nor bullock could ascend over the flight of steps in all these places the staircases on the contrary are as disproportionately small they look as if they were made for rats to crawl through while the gateways seem as if they were made for ships to sail under one of the most interesting sights was the immense swarms of swallows flying round the thick bed of nests that occupy the apex of this arch and to the spectators below they look precisely like swarm of bees round a large honeycomb i quoted a passage in the korān in praise of the swallows and asked the guardians of the place whether they did not think themselves happy in having such swarms of sacred birds over their heads all day long not at all said they they oblige us to sweep the gateway ten times a day but there is no getting at their nests or we should soon get rid of them they then told me that the sacred bird of the korān was the abābīl or large black swallow and not the partādīl a little piebald thing of no religious merit whatever on the right side of the entrance is engraven on stone in large letters standing out in basrelief the following passage in arabic jesus on whom be peace has said the word is merely a bridge you are to pass over it and not to build your dwellings upon it where this saying of christ is to be found i know not nor has any muhammadan yet been able to tell me but the quoting of such a passage in such a place is a proof of the absence of all bigotry on the part of akbar the tomb of shaikh salīm the hermit is a very beautiful little building in the centre of the quadrangle the man who guards it told me that the jāts while they reigned robbed this tomb as well as those at agra of some of the most beautiful and valuable portion of the mosaic work but said he they were well plundered in their turn by your troops at bharatpur retribution always follows the wicked sooner or later he showed us the little roof of stone tiles close to the original little dingy mosque of the old hermit where the empress gave birth to jahāngīr and told us that she was a very sensible woman whose counsels had great weight with the emperor his majestys only fault was he said an inclination to learn the art of magic which was taught him by an old hindoo religious mendicant whose apartment near the palace he pointed out to us fortunately said our cicerone the fellow died before the emperor had learnt enough to practise the art without his aid shaikh salīm had he declared gone more than twenty times on pilgrimage to the tomb of the holy prophet and was not much pleased to have his repose so much disturbed by the noise and bustle of the imperial court at last akbar wanted to surround the hill with regular fortifications and the shaikh could stand it no longer either you or i must leave this hill said he to the emperor if the efficacy of my prayers is no longer to be relied upon let me depart in peace if it be your majestys will replied the emperor that one should go let it be your slave i pray the old story there is nothing like relying upon the efficacy of our prayers say the priests nothing like relying upon that of our sharp swords say the soldiers and as nations advance from barbarism they generally contrive to divide between them the

unpeopled waste soon became a city and fathpursīkrī was deserted cities which like this are maintained by the public establishments that attend and surround the courts of sovereign princes must always like this become deserted when these sovereigns change their restingplaces to the history of the rise and progress decline and fall of how many cities is this the key close to the tomb of the saint is another containing the remains of a great number of his descendants who continue to enjoy under the successors of akbar large grants of rentfree lands for their own support and for that of the mosque

family who still reside among the ruins are extremely poor what strikes a european most in going over these palaces of the moghal emperors is the want of what a gentleman of fortune in his own country would consider elegantly comfortable accommodations five hundred pounds a year would at the present day secure him more of this in any civilized country of europe or america than the greatest of those emperors could command he would perhaps have the same impression in going over the domestic architecture of the most civilized nations of the ancient world persia and egypt greece and rome notes the act of william iv c which reconstituted the government of india provided that the upper provinces should be formed into a separate presidency under the name of agra and sir charles metcalfe was

the local government was moved to allahabad in from the lieutenantgovernor of the northwestern provinces was also chief commissioner of oudh the name northwestern provinces which had become unsuitable and misleading since the annexation of the panjāb in could not be retained after the formation of the northwest frontier province in accordingly from that year the combined jurisdiction of the northwestern provinces and oudh received the new official name of the united provinces of agra and oudh the title of chief commissioner of oudh was dropped at the same time but the legal system and administration of the old kingdom of oudh continued to be distinct in certain respects the civil establishment and garrison are still nearly the same as in the authors time the inland customs

akbar had one christian queen her tomb at sikandara is locally known simply as rauza maryam the mausoleum of mary a designation which has had much to do with the persistence of the erroneous belief in the existence of a christian consort of akbar mr beveridge holds and i think rightly that jodh bāī is not a proper name it seems to mean merely princess of jodhpur the only lady really known as jodh

particular doctrines animosity and dissension prevail and each man deeming the tenets of his sect to be the dictates of truth itself aims at the destruction of all others vilifies reputation stains the earth with blood and has the vanity to imagine that he is performing meritorious actions were the voice of reason attended to mankind would be sensible of their error and lament the weaknesses which led them to interfere in the religious concerns of each other persecution after all defeats its own end it obliges men to conceal their opinions but produces no change in them summarily the hindoos are religious affable courteous to strangers prone to inflict austerities on themselves lovers of justice given to retirement able in business grateful admirers of truth and of unbounded fidelity in all their dealings this character shines brightest in adversity their soldiers know not what it is to fly from the field of battle when the success of the combat becomes doubtful they dismount from their horses and throw away their lives in payment of the debt of valour they have great respect for their tutors and make no account of their lives when they can devote them to the service of their god they consider the supreme being to be above all labour and believe brahmā to be the creator of the world vishnu its preserver and siva its destroyer but one sect believes that god who hath no equal appeared on earth under the three abovementioned forms without having been thereby polluted in the smallest degree in the same manner as the christians speak of the messiah others

bharatpurdīgwant of employment for the military and the educated classes under the companys rule our old friends mr charles fraser the commissioner of the agra division then on his circuit and major godby had come on with us from agra and made our party very agreeable on the th we went fourteen miles to bharatpur over a plain of alluvial but seemingly poor soil intersected by one low range of sandstone hills running northeast and southwest the thick belt of jungle three miles wide with which the chiefs of bharatpur used to surround their fortress while they were freebooters and always liable to be brought into collision with their neighbours has been fast diminishing since the capture of the place by our troops in and will very soon disappear altogether and give place to rich sheets of cultivation and happy little village communities our tents had been pitched close outside the mathurā gate near a small grove of fruittrees which formed the left flank of the last attack on this fortress by lord combermere major godby had been present during the whole siege and as we went round the place in the evening on our elephants he pointed out all the points of attack and told all the anecdotes of the day that were interesting enough to be remembered for ten years we went through the town out at the opposite gate and passed along the line of lord lakes attack in all the points of his attack were also pointed out to us by our cicerone an old officer in the service of the rājā it happened to be the anniversary of the first attempt to storm which was made on the th of january thirtyone years before one old officer told us that he remembered lord lake sitting with three other gentlemen on chairs not more than half a mile from the ramparts of the fort the old man thought that the men of those days were quite a different sort of thing to the men of the present day as well those who defended as those who attacked the fort and if the truth must be told he thought that the european lords and gentlemen had fallen off in the same scale as the rest but said the old man all these things are matter of destiny and providence upon that very bastion pointing to the right point of lord lakes attack stood a large twentyfour pounder which was loaded and discharged three times by supernatural agency during one of your attacksnot a living soul was near it we all smiled incredulous and the old man offered to bring a score of witnesses to the fact men of unquestionable veracity the left point of lord lakes attack was the baldēo bastion so called alter baldēo singh the second son of the then reigning chief ranjīt singh the feats which hector performed in the defence of troy sink into utter insignificance before those which baldēo performed in the defence of bharatpur according to the best testimony of the survivors of that great day but said the old man he was of course acting under supernatural influence he condescended to measure swords only with europeans and their bodies filled the whole bastion in which he stood according to the belief of the people though no european entered it i believe during the whole siege they pointed out to us where the different corps were posted there was one corps which had signalized itself a good deal but of which i had never before heard though all around me seemed extremely well acquainted with itthis was the antā gurgurs at last godby came to my side and told me this was the name by which the bombay troops were always known in bengal though no one seemed to know whence it came i am disposed to think that they derive it from the peculiar form of the caps of their sepoys which are in form like the common hookah called a gurgurī with a small ball at the top like an antā or tennis or billiard ball hence antā gurgurs the bombay sepoys were i am told always very angry when they heard that they were known by this termthey have always behaved like good soldiers and need not be ashamed of this or any other name the water in the lake about a mile to the west of bharatpur stands higher than the ground about the fortress and a drain had been opened through which the water rushed in and filled the ditch all round the fort and great part of the plain to the south and east before lord lake undertook the siege in this water might i believe have been taken off to the eastward into the jumna had the outlet been discovered by the engineers an attempt was made to cut the same drain on the approach of lord combermere in but a party went on and stopped the work before much water had passed and the ditch was almost dry when the siege began the walls being all of mud and now dismantled had a wretched appearance and the town which is contained within them is though very populous a mere collection of wretched hovels the only respectable habitation within is the palace which consists of three detached buildingsone for the chief another for the females of his family and the third for his court of justice i could not find a single trace of the european officers who had been killed there either at the first or second siege though i had been told that a small tomb had been built in a neighbouring grove over the remains of brigadiergeneral edwards who fell in the last storm it is i believe the only one that has ever been raised the scenes of battles fought by the muhammadan conquerors of india were commonly crowded with magnificent tombs built over the slain and provided for a time with the means of maintaining holy men who read the korān over their graves not that this duty was necessary for the repose of their souls for every muhammadan killed in fighting against men who believed not in his prophet went as a matter of course to paradise and every unbeliever killed in the same action went as surely tohell there are only a few hundred men exclusive of the prophets who according to muhammad have the first place in paradisethose who shared in one or other of his first three battles and believed in his holy mission before they had the evidence of a single victory over the unbelievers to support it at the head of these are the men who accompanied him in his flight from mecca to medina when he had no evidence either from victories or miracles in all such matters the less the evidence adduced in proof of a mission the greater the merit of those who believe in it according to the person who pretends to it and unhappily the less the evidence a man has for his faith the greater is his anger against other men for not joining in it with him no man gets very angry with another for not joining with him in his faith in the demonstration of a problem in mathematics man likes to think that he is on the way to heaven upon such easy terms but gets angry at the notion that others wont join him because they may consider him an imbecile for thinking that he is so the muhammadan generals and historians are sometimes almost as concise as caesar himself in describing very conscientiously a battle of this kind instead of i came i saw i conquered it is ten thousand musālmāns on that day tasted of the blessed fruit of paradise after sending fifty thousand unbelievers to the flames of hell on the th we came on twelve miles to kumbhīr over a plain of poor soil much impregnated with salt and with some works in which salt is made with solar evaporation the earth is dug up water is filtered through it and drawn off into small square beds where it is evaporated by exposure to the solar heat the gate of this fort leading out to the road we came is called modestly

distant placesthe kashmīr the kābul the constantinople gates outside the kumbhīr gate i saw for the first time in my life the well peculiar to upper india it is built up in the form of a round tower or cylindrical shell of burnt bricks well cemented with good mortar and covered inside and out with good stucco work and let down by degrees as the earth is removed by men at work in digging under the light earthy or sandy foundation inside and out this well is about twenty feet below and twenty feet above the surface and had to be built higher as it was let into the ground on the th we came on twelve miles to dīg deeg over a plain of poor and badly cultivated soil which must be almost all under water in the rains this was and still is the country seat of the jāts of bharatpur who rose as i have already stated to wealth and power by aggressions upon their immediate neighbours and the plunder of tribute on its way to the imperial capital and of the baggage of passing armies during the contests for dominion that followed the death of the emperors and during the decline and fall of the empire the jāts found the morasses with which they were surrounded here a source of strength they emigrated from the banks of the indus about multān and took up their abode by degrees on the banks of the jumna and those of the chambal from their confluence upwards where they became cultivators and robbers upon a small scale till they had the means to build garrisons when they entered the lists with princes who were only robbers upon a large scale the jāts like the marāthās rose by a feeling of nationality among a people who had none single landholders were every day rising to principalities by means of their gangs of robbers but they could seldom be cemented under one common head by a bond of national feeling they have a noble quadrangular garden at dīg surrounded by a high wall in the centre of each of the four faces is one of the most beautiful hindoo buildings for accommodation that i have ever seen formed of a very fine sandstone brought from the quarries of rūpbās which he between thirty and forty miles to the south and eight or ten miles west of fathpursīkrī these stones are brought in in flags some sixteen feet long from two to three feet wide and one thick with sides as flat as glass the flags being of the natural thickness of the strata the garden is four hundred and seventyfive feet long by three hundred and fifty feet wide and in the centre is an octagonal pond with openings on the four sides leading up to the four buildings each opening having from the centre of the pond to the foot of the flight of steps leading into them an avenue of jets deau dīg as much surpassed as bharatpur fell short of my expectations i had seen nothing in india of architectural beauty to be compared with the buildings in this garden except at agra the useful and the elegant are here everywhere happily blended nothing seems disproportionate or unsuitable to the purpose for which it was designed and all that one regrets is that so beautiful a garden should be situated in so vile a swamp there was a general complaint among the people of the town of a want of rozgār employment and its fruit subsistence the taking of bharatpur had they said produced a sad change among them for the worse godby observed to some of the respectable men about us who complained of this that happily their chief had now no enemy to employ them against but what said they is a prince without an army and why do you keep up yours now that all your enemies have been subdued we want them replied godby to prevent our friends from cutting each others throats and to defend them all against a foreign enemy true said they but what are we to do who have nothing but our swords to depend upon now that our chief no longer wants us and you wont take us and what said some shopkeepers are we to do who provided these troops with clothes food and furniture which they can no longer afford to pay for company ke amal men kuchh rozgār nahīn under the companys dominion there is no employment this is too true we do the soldiers work with onetenth of the soldiers that had before been employed in it over the territories we acquire and turn the other ninetenths adrift they all sink into the lowest class of religions mendicants or retainers or live among their friends as drones upon the land while the manufacturing trading and commercial industry that provided them with the comforts conveniences and elegancies of life while they were in a higher grade of service is in its turn thrown out of employment and the whole frame of society becomes for a time deranged by the local diminution in the demand for the services of men and the produce of theirindustry i say we do the soldiers work with onetenth of the numbers that were formerly required for it i will mention an anecdote to illustrate this in the year i was marching with my regiment from the nepāl frontier after the war to allahabad we encamped about four miles from a mud fort in the kingdom of oudh and heard the guns of the amil or chief of the district playing all day upon this fort from which his batteries were removed at least two miles he had three regiments of infantry a corps or two of cavalry and a good park of artillery while the garrison consisted of only about two hundred stout rājpūt landholders and cultivators or yeomen in the evening just as we had sat down to dinner a messenger came to the commanding officer colonel gregory who was a member of the mess from the said amil and begged permission to deliver his message in private i as the senior staff officer was requested to hear what he had to say what do you require from the commanding officer i require the loan of the regiment i know the commanding officer will not let you have the regiment if the amil cannot get more he will be glad to get two companies and i have brought with me this bag of gold containing some two or three hundred gold mohurs i delivered the message to colonel gregory before all the officers who desired me to say that he could not spare a single man as he had no authority to assist the amil and was merely marching through the country to his destination i did so the man urged me to beg the commanding officer if he could do no more merely to halt the next day where he was and lend the amil the use of one of his drummers and what will you do with him why just before daylight we will take him down near one of the gates of the fort and make him beat his drum as hard as he can and the people within thinking the whole regiment is upon them will make out as fast as possible at the opposite gate and the bag of goldwhat is to become of that you and the old gentleman can divide it between you and i will double it for you if you like i delivered the message before all the officers to their great amusement and the poor man was obliged to carry back his bag of gold to the amil the amil is the collector of revenues in oudh and he is armed with all the powers of government and has generally several regiments and a train of artillery with him the large landholders build these mud forts which they defend by their rājpūt cultivators who are among the bravest men in the world one hundred of them would never hesitate to attack a thousand of the kings regular troops because they know the amil would be ashamed to have any noise made about it at court but they know also that if they were to beat one hundred of the companys troops they would soon have a thousand upon them and if they were to beat one thousand they would soon have ten they provide for the maintenance of those who are wounded in their fight and for the widows and orphans of those who are killed their prince provides for neither and his soldiers are consequently somewhat chary of fighting it is from this peasantry the military cultivators of oudh that our bengal native infantry draws three out of four of its recruits and finer young men for soldiers can hardly anywhere be found the advantage which arises to society from doing the soldiers duty with a smaller number has never been sufficiently appreciated in india but it will become every day more manifest as our dominion becomes more and more stablefor men who have lived by the sword do not in india like to live by anything else or to see their children anything but soldiers under the former government men brought their own arms and horses to the service and took them away with them again when discharged the supply always greatly exceeded the demand for soldiers both in the cavalry and the infantry and a very great portion of the men armed and accoutred as soldiers were always without service roaming over the country in search of it to such men the profession next in rank after that of the soldier robbing in the service of the sovereign was that of the robber plundering on his own account materia munificentiae per bella et raptus nec arare terram aut expectare annum tam facile persuaseris quam vocare hostes et vulnera mereri pigrum quinimmo et iners videtur sudore acquirere quod possis sanguine parare war and rapine supply the prince with the means of his munificence you cannot persuade the german to cultivate the fields and wait patiently for the harvest so easily as you can to challenge the enemy and expose himself to honourable wounds they hold it to be base and dishonourable to earn by the sweat of their brow what they might acquire by their blood the equestrian robber had his horse and was called ghurāsī horserobber a term which he never thought disgraceful the footrobber under the native government stood in the same relation to the horserobber as the footsoldier to thehorsesoldier because the trooper furnished his own horses arms and accoutrements and considered himself a man of rank and wealth compared with the footsoldier both however had the wherewithal to rob the traveller on the highway and in the intervals between wars the high roads were covered with them there was a time in england it is said when the supply of clergymen was so great compared with the demand for them from the undue stimulus given to clerical education that it was not thought disgraceful for them to take to robbing on the highway and all the high roads were in consequence infested by them how much more likely is a soldier to consider himself justified in this pursuit and to be held so by the feelings of society in general when he seeks in vain for regular service under his sovereign and his viceroys the individual soldiers not only armed accoutred and mounted themselves but they generally ranged themselves under leaders and formed wellorganized bands for any purpose of war or plunder they followed the fortunes of such leaders whether in service or out of it and when dismissed from that of their sovereign they assisted them in robbing on the highway or in pillaging the country till the sovereign was compelled to take them back or give them estates in rentfree tenure for their maintenance and that of their followers all this is reversed under our government we do the soldiers work much better than it was ever before done with onetenthnay i may say onefiftiethpart of the numbers that were employed to do it by our predecessors and the whole number of the soldiers employed by us is not equal to that of those who were under them actually in the transition state or on their way from the place where they had lost service to the place where they hoped to find it extorting the means of subsistence either by intimidation or by open violence those who are in this transition state under us are neither armed accoutred nor mounted we do not disband en masse we only dismiss individuals for offences and they have no leaders to range themselves under those who come to seek our service are the sons of yeomen bred up from their infancy with all those feelings of deference for superiors which we require in soldiers they have neither arms horses nor accoutrements and when they leave us permanently or temporarily they take none with themthey never rob or stealthey will often dispute with the shopkeepers on the road about the price of provisions or get a man to carry their bundles gratis for a few miles but this is the utmost of their transgressions and for these things they are often severely handled by our police it is extremely gratifying to an englishman to hear the general testimony borne by all classes of people to the merits of our rule in this respect they all say that no former government ever devoted so much attention to the formation of good roads and to the protection of those who travel on them and much of the security arises from the change i have here remarked in the character and number of our military establishments it is equally gratifying to reflect that the advantages must go on increasing as those who have been thrown out of employment in the army find other occupations for themselves and their children for find them they must or turn mendicants if india should be blessed with a long interval of peace all soldiers under us who have served the government faithfully for a certain number of years are when no longer fit for the active duties of their profession sent back with the means of subsistence in honourable retirement for the rest of their lives among their families and friends where they form as it were fountains of good feeling towards the government they have served under former governments a trooper was discharged as soon as his horse got disabled and a footsoldier as soon as he got disabled himselfno matter howwhether in the service of the prince or otherwise no matter how long they had served whether they were still fit for any other service or not like the old soldier in gil blas they tumed robbers on the highway where they could still present a spear or a matchlock at a traveller though no longer deemed worthy to serve in the ranks of the army nothing tended so much to the civilization of europe as the substitution of standing armies for militia and nothing has tended so much to the improvement of india under our rule the troops to which our standing armies in india succeeded were much the same in character as those licentious bodies to which the standing armies of the different nations of europe succeeded and the result has been and will i hope continue to be the same highly beneficial to the great mass of the people by a statute of elizabeth it was made a capital offence felony without benefit of clergy for soldiers or sailors to beg on the high roads without a pass and i suppose this statute arose from their frequently robbing on the highways in the character of beggars there must at that time have been an immense number of soldiers in the transition state in england men who disdained the labours of peaceful life or had by long habit become unfitted for them religions mendicity has hitherto been the great safety valve through which the unquiet transition spirit has found vent under our strong and settled government a hindoo of any caste may become a religious mendicant of the two great monastic ordersof gosāins who are disciples of siva and bairāgīs who are disciples of vishnu and any muhammadan may become a fakīr and gosāins bairāgīs and fakīrs can always secure or extort food from the communities they visit still however there is enough of this unquiet transition spirit left to give anxiety to a settled government for the moment insurrection breaks out at any point from whatever cause to that point thousands are found flocking from north east west and south with their arms and their horses if they happen to have any in the hope of finding service either under the local authorities or the insurgents themselves as the troubled winds of heaven rush to the point where the pressure of the atmosphere has been diminishednotes on the sieges of bharatpur see

plain to govardhan a place celebrated in ancient history as the birthplace of krishna the seventh incarnation of the hindoo god of preservation vishnu and the scene of his dalliance with the milkmaids gōpīs and in modern days as the burialor burningplace of the jāt chiefs of bharatpur and dīg by whose tombs with their endowments this once favourite abode of the god is prevented from being entirely deserted the town stands upon a narrow ridge of sandstone hills about ten miles long rising suddenly out of an alluvial plain and running northeast and southwest the population is now very small and composed chiefly of brahmans who are supported by the endowments of these tombs and the contributions of a few pilgrims all our hindoo followers were much gratified as we happened to arrive on a day of peculiar sanctity and they were enabled to bathe and perform their devotions to the different shrines with the prospect of great advantage this range of hills is believed by hindoos to be part of a fragment of the himālaya mountains which hanumān the monkey general of rāma the sixth incarnation of vishnu was taking down to aid his master in the formation of his bridge from the continent to the island of ceylon when engaged in the war with the demon king of that island for the recovery of his wife sītā he made a false step by some accident in passing govardhan and this small bit of his load fell off the rocks begged either to be taken on to the god rāma or back to their old place but hanumān was hard pressed for time and told them not to be uneasy as they would have a comfortable restingplace and be worshipped by millions in future agesthus according to popular belief foretelling that it would become the residence of a future incarnation and the scene of krishnas miracles the range was then about twenty miles long ten having since disappeared under the ground it was of full length during krishnas days and on one occasion he took up the whole upon his little finger to defend his favourite town and its milkmaids from the wrath of indra who got angry with the people and poured down upon them a shower of burning ashes as i rode along this range which rises gently from the plains at both ends and abruptly from the sides with my groom by my side i asked him what made hanumān drop all his burthen here all his burthen exclaimed he with a smile had it been all would it not have been an immense mountain with all its towns and villages while this is but an insignificant belt of rock a mountain upon the back of men of former days sir was no more than a bundle of grass upon the back of one of your grasscutters in the present day nathū whose mind had been full of the wonders of this place from his infancy happened to be with us and he now chimed in it was night when hanumān passed this place and the lamps were seen burning in a hundred towns upon the mountain he had upon his backthe people were all at their usual occupations quite undisturbed this is a mere fragment of his great burthen and how was it that the men of those towns should have been so much smaller than the men who carried them god only knew but the fact of the men of the plains having been so large was undisputedtheir beards were as many miles long as those of the present day are inches did not bhīm throw the fortycubit stone pillar that now stands at eran a distance of thirty miles after the man who was running away with his cattle i thought of poor father gregory at agra and the heavy sigh he gave when asked by godby what progress he was making among the people in the way of conversion the faith of these people is certainly larger than all the mustardseeds in the world i told a very opulent and respectable hindoo banker one day that it seemed to us very strange that vishnu should come upon the earth merely to sport with milkmaids and to hold up an umbrella however large to defend them from a shower the earth sir said he was at that time infested with innumerable demons and giants who swallowed up men and women as bears swallow white ants and his highness krishna came down to destroy them his own mothers brother kans who then reigned at mathurā over govardhan was one of these horrible demons hearing that his sister would give birth to a son that was to destroy him he put to death several of her progeny as soon as they were born when krishna was seven days old he sent a nurse with poison on her nipple to destroy him likewise but his highness gave such a pull at it that the nurse dropped down dead in falling she resumed her real shape of a shedemon and her body covered no less than six square miles and it took several thousand men to cut her up and burn her to prevent the pestilence that must have followed his uncle then sent a crane which caught up his highness who always looked very small for his age and swallowed him as he would swallow a frog but his highness kicked up such a rumpus in the birds stomach that he was immediately thrown up again when he was seven years old his uncle invited him to a feast andgot the largest and most ferocious elephant in india to tread him to death as he alighted at the door his highness though then not higher than my waist took the enormous beast by one tusk and after whirling him round in the air with one hand half a dozen times he dashed him on the ground and killed him unable any longer to stand the wickedness of his uncle he seized him by the beard dragged him from his throne and dashed him to the ground in the same manner i thought of poor old father gregory and the mustardseeds again and told my rich old friend that it all appeared to us indeed passing strange the orthodox belief among the muhammadans is that moses was sixty yards high that he carried a mace sixty yards long and that he sprang sixty yards from the ground when he aimed the fatal blow at the giant ūj the son of anak who came from the land of canaan with a mountain on his back to crush the army of israelites still the head of his mace could reach only to the anklebone of the giant this was broken with the blow the giant fell and was crushed under the weight of his own mountain now a person whose anklebone was one hundred and eighty yards high must have been almost as prodigious as he who carried the fragment of the himālaya upon his back and he who believes in the one cannot fairly find fault with his neighbour for believing in the other i was one day talking with a very sensible and respectable hindoo gentleman of bundēlkhand about the accident which made hanumān drop this fragment of his load at govardhan all doubts upon that point said the old gentleman have been put at rest by holy writ it is related in our scriptures bharat the brother of rāma was left regent of the kingdom of ajodhya during his absence at the conquest of ceylon he happened at night to see hanumān passing with the mountain upon his back and thinking he might be one of the king of ceylons demons about mischief he let fly one of his blunt arrows at him it hit him on the leg and he fell mountain and all to the ground as he fell he called out in his agony rām rām from which bharat discovered his mistake he went up raised him in his arms and with his kind attentions restored him to his senses learning from him the object of his journey and fearing that his wounded brother lachhman would die before he could get to ceylon with the requisite remedy he offered to send hanumān on upon the barb of one of his arrows mountain and all to try him hanumān took up his mountain and seated himself with it upon the barb of the arrow as desired bharat placed the arrow to the string of his bow and drawing it till the barb touched the bow asked hanumān whether he was ready quite ready said hanumān but i am now satisfied that you really are the brother of our prince and regent of his kingdom which was all i desired pray let me descend and be sure that i shall be at ceylon in time to save your wounded brother he got off knelt down placed his forehead on bharats feet in submission resumed his load and was at ceylon by the time the day broke next morning leaving behind him the small and insignificant fragment on which the town and temples of govardhan now stand while little krishna was frisking about among the milkmaids of govardhan continued my old friend stealing their milk cream and butter brahmā the creator of the universe who had heard of his being an incarnation of vishnu the great preserver of the universe visited the place and had some misgivings from his size and employment as to his real character to try him he took off through the sky a herd of cattle on which some of his favourite playmates were attending old and young boys and all krishna knowing how much the parents of the boys and owners of the cattle would be distressed created in a moment another herd and other attendants so exactly like those that brahmā had taken that the owners of the one and the parents of the other remained ignorant of the change even the new creations themselves remained equally ignorant and the cattle walked into their stalls and the boys into their houses where they recognized and were recognized by their parents as if nothing had happened brahmā was now satisfied that krishna was a true incarnation of vishnu and restored to him the real herd and attendants the others were removed out of the way by krishna as soon as he saw the real ones coming back but said i to the good old man who told me this with a grave face must they not have suffered in passing from the life given to death and why create them merely to destroy them again was he not god the creator himself said the old man does he not send one generation into the world after another to fulfil their destiny and then to return to the earth from which they came just as he spreads over the land the grass and corn all is gathered in its season or withers as that passes away and dies the old gentleman might have quoted wordsworth we die my friend nor we alone but that which each man loved and prized in his peculiar nook of earth dies with him or is changed and very soon even of the good is no memorial left i was one day out shooting with my friend the rājā of maihar under the vindhya range which rises five or six hundred feet almost perpendicularly he was an excellent shot with an english doublebarrel and had with him six menjust as good i asked him whether we were likely to fall in with any hares using the term khargosh or asseared certainly not said the rājā if you begin by abusing them with such a name call them lambkanās sir longeared and we shall get plenty he shot one and attributed my bad luck to the opprobrious name i had used while he was reloading i took occasion to ask him how this range of hills had grown up where it was no one can say replied the rājā but we believe that when rāma went to recover his wife sītā from the demon king of ceylon rāvan he wanted to throw a bridge across from the continent to the island and sent some of his followers up to the himālaya mountains for stones he had completed his bridge before they all returned and a messenger was sent to tell those who had not yet come to throw down their burdens and rejoin him in all haste two long lines of these people had got thus far on their return when the messenger met them they threw down their loads here and here they have remained ever since one forming the vindhya range to the north of this valley and the other the kaimūr range to the south the vindhya range extends from mirzapore on the ganges nearly to the gulf of cambay some six or seven hundred miles so that my sporting friends faith was as capacious as any priest could well wish it and those who have it are likely never to die or suffer much from an over stretch of the reasoning faculties in a hot climate the town stands upon the belt of rocks about two miles from its northeastern extremity and in the midst is the handsome tomb of ranjit singh who defended bharatpur so bravely against lord lakes army the tomb has on one side a tank filled with water and on the other another much deeper than the first but without any water at all we were surprised at this and asked what the cause could be the people told us with the air of men who had never known what it was to feel the uneasy sensation of doubt that krishna one hot day after skying with the milkmaids had drunk it all dry and that no water would ever stay in it lest it might be quaffed by less noble lips no orthodox hindoo would ever for a moment doubt that this was the real cause of the phenomenon happy people how much do they escape of that pain which in hot climates wears us all down in our efforts to trace moral and physical phenomena to their real causes and sources mind mind mind without any of it those europeans who eat and drink moderately might get on very well in this climate much of it weighs them down oh sir the good die first and those whose hearts brains are dry as summer dust burn to the socket one is apt sometimes to think that muhammad manu and confucius would have been great benefactors in saving so many millions of their species from the pain of thinking too much in hot climates if they had only written their books in languages less difficult of acquirement their works are at once the bane and antidote of despotismthe source whence it comes and the shield which defends the people from its consuming fire the tomb of sūraj mall the great founder of the jāt power at bharatpur stands on the northeast extremity of this belt of rocks about two miles from the town and is an extremely handsome building conceived in the very best taste and executed in the very best style with its appendages of temples and smaller tombs it occupies the whole of one side of a magnificent tank full of clear water and on the other side it looks into a large and beautiful garden all the buildings and pavements are formed of the fine white sandstone of rūpbās scarcely inferior either in quality or appearance to white marble the stone is carved in relief with flowers in good taste in the centre of the tomb is the small marble slab covering the grave with the two feet of krishna carved in the centre and around them the emblems of the god the discus the skull the sword the rosary these emblems of the god are put on that people may have something godly to fix their thoughts upon it is by degrees and with fear and trembling that the hindoos imitate the muhammadans in the magnificence of their tombs the object is ostensibly to keep the ground on which the bodies have been burned from being defiled and generally hindoos have been content to raise small open terraces of brick and stucco work over the spot with some image or emblem of the god upon it the jāts here like the princes and gosāins in bundēlkhand have gone a stage beyond this and raised tombs equal in costliness and beauty to those over muhammadans of the highest rank still they do not venture to leave it without a divine image or emblem lest the gods might become jealous and revenge themselves upon the souls of the deceased and the bodies of the living on one side of sūraj malls tomb is that of his wife or some other female member of his family and upon the slab over her grave that is over the precise spot where she was burned are the same emblems except the sword for which a necklace is substituted at each end of this range of tombs stands a temple dedicated to baldēo the brother of krishna and in one of them i found his image with large eyes a jet black complexion and an african countenance why is this that baldēo should be always represented of this countenance and colour and his brother krishna either white or of an azure colour and the caucasian countenance the inside of the tomb is covered with beautiful snowwhite stucco work that resembles the finest marble but this is disfigured by wretched paintings representing on one side of the dome sūraj mall in darbār smoking his hookah and giving orders to his ministers in another he is at his devotions on the third at his sports shooting hogs and deer and on the fourth at war with some french officers of distinction figuring before him he is distinguished by his portly person in all and by his favourite lightbrown dress in three places at his devotions he isstanding all in white before the tutelary god of his house hardēo in various parts krishna is represented at his sports with the milkmaids the colours are gaudy and apparently as fresh as when first put on eighty years ago but the paintings are all in the worst possible taste and style inside the dome of ranjīt singhs tomb the siege of bharatpur is represented in the same rude taste and style lord lake is dismounted and standing before his white horse giving orders to his soldiers on the opposite side of the dome ranjīt singh in a plain white dress is standing erect before his idol at his devotions with his ministers behind him on the other two sides he is at his favourite field sports what strikes one most in all this is the entire absence of priestcraft he wanted all his revenue for his soldiers and his tutelary god seems in consequence to have been well pleased to dispense with the mediatory services of priests there are few temples anywhere to be seen in the territories of these jāt chiefs and as few of their subjects have yet ventured to follow them in this innovation upon the old hindoo usages of building tombs the countries under their dominion are less richly ornamented than those of their neighbours those who build tombs or temples generally surround them with groves of mango and other fine fruittrees with good wells to supply water for them and if they have the means they add tanks so that every religions edifice or work of ornament leads to one or more of utility so it was in europe often the northern hordes swept away all that had grown up under the institution of the romans and the saracens for almost all the great works of ornament and utility by which these countries became first adorned and enriched had their origin in church establishments that portion of india where the greater part of the revenue goes to the priesthood will generally be much more studded with works of ornament and utility than that in which the greater part goes to the soldiery i once asked a hindoo gentleman who had travelled all over india what part of it he thought most happy and beautiful he mentioned some part of southern india about tanjore i think where you could hardly go a mile without meeting some happy procession or coming to a temple full of priests or find an acre of land uncultivated the countries under the marāthā government improved much in appearance and in happiness i believe after the mayors of the palace who were brahmans assumed the government and put aside the sātārā rajas the descendants of the great sivājī wherever they could they conferred the government of their distant territories upon brahmans who filled all the high offices under them with men of the same caste who spent the greater part of their incomes in tombs temples groves and tanks that embellished and enriched the face of the country and thereby diffused a taste for such works generally among the people they governed the appearance of those parts of the marāthā dominion so governed is infinitely superior to that of the countries governed by the leaders of the military class such as sindhia holkār and the bhonslā whose capitals are still mere standing campsa collection of hovels and whose countries are almost entirely devoid of all those works of ornament and utility that enrich and adorn those of their neighbours they destroyed all they found in those countries when they conquered them and they have had neither the wisdom nor the taste to raise others to supply their places the sikh government is of exactly the same character and the countries they governed have i believe the same wretched appearancethey are swarms of human locusts who prey upon all that is calculated to enrich and embellish the face of the land they infest and all that can tend to improve men in their social relations and to link their affection to their soil and their government a hindoo prince is always running to the extreme he can never take and keep a middle course he is either ambitious and therefore appropriates all his revenues to the maintenance of soldiers to pour out in inroads upon his neighbours or he is superstitions and devotes all his revenue to his priesthood who embellish his country at the same time that they weaken it and invite invasion as their prince becomes less and less able to repel it the more popular belief regarding this range of sandstone hills at govardhan is that lachhman the brother of rāma having been wounded by rāvan the demon king of ceylon his surgeon declared that his wound could be cured only by a decoction of the leaves of a certain tree to be found in a certain hill in the himālaya mountains hanumān volunteered to go for it but on reaching the place he found that he had entirely forgotten the description of the tree required and to prevent mistake he took up the whole mountain upon his back and walked off with it to the plains as he passed govardhan where bharat and charat the third and fourth brothers of rāma then reigned he was seen by them it was night and thinking him a strange sort of fish bharat let fly one of his arrows at him it hit him in the leg and the sudden jerk caused this small fragment of his huge burden to fall off he called out in his agony rām rām from which they learned that he belonged to the army of their brother and let him pass on but he remained lame for life from the wound this accounts very satisfactorily according to popular belief for the halting gait of all the monkeys of that species those who are descended lineally from the general inherit it of course and those who are not adopt it out of respect for his memory as all the soldiers of alexander contrived to make one shoulder higher than the other because one of his happened to be so when he passed thousands and tens of thousands of lamps were burning upon his mountain as the people remained entirely unconscious of the change and at their usual occupations hanumān reached ceylon with his mountain the tree was found upon it and lachhmans wound cured govardhan is now within the boundary of our territory and a native collector resides here from

adjoining fyzabad which is still a very sacred place of pilgrimage it is i think absolutely impossible for the most sympathetic european to understand or enter into the mental position of the learned and devout hindoo who implicitly believes the wild myth related in the text and sees no incongruity in the congeries of inconsistent ideas which are involved in the story we may dimly apprehend that brahmā is conceived as a δημιουργός or architect of the universe working in subordination to an impersonal higher power and not as the infinite omniscient omnipotent creator whom the hebrews reverenced but we shall still be a long way from attaining the hindoo point of view the relations of krishna vishnu brahma rāma siva and all the other deities with one another and with mankind seem to be conceived by the hindoo in a manner so confused and contradictory that every attempt at elucidation or explanation must necessarily fail a hindoo is born not made and the inwardness of hinduism is

of a separate district in the official at govardhan in must therefore have been subordinate to mathurā not to agra chapter veracity the people of britain are described by diodorus siculus book v chap as in a very simple and rude state subsisting almost entirely on the produce of the land but as being a people of much integrity and sincerity far from the craft and knavery of men among us contented with plain and homely fare and strangers to the luxuries and excesses of the rich in india we find strict veracity most prevalent among the wildest and halfsavage tribes of the hills and jungles in central india or the chain of the himālaya mountains and among those where we find it prevail most we find cattlestealing most common the men of one tribe not deeming it to be any disgrace to lift or steal the cattle of another i have known the man among the gonds of the woods of central india whom nothing could induce to tell a lie join a party of robbers to lift a herd of cattle from the neighbouring plains for nothing more than as much spirits as he could enjoy at one bout i asked a native gentleman of the plains in the valley of the nerbudda one day what made the people of the woods to the north and south more disposed to speak the truth than those more civilized of the valley itself they have not yet learned the value of a lie said he with the greatest simplicity and sincerity for he was a very honest and plainspoken man veracity is found to prevail most where there is least to tempt to falsehood and most to be feared from it in a very rude state of society like that of which i have been speaking the only shape in which property is accumulated is in cattle things are bartered for each other without the use of a circulating medium and one member of a community has no means of concealing from the other the articles of property he has if they were to steal from each other they would not be able to conceal what they stoleto steal therefore would be no advantage in such societies every little community is left to govern itself to secure the rights and enforce the duties of all its several members in their relations with each other they are too poor to pay taxes to keep up expensive establishments and their governments seldom maintain among them any for the administration of justice or the protection of life property or character all the members of all such little communities will often unite in robbing the members of another community of their flocks and herds the only kind of property they have or in applauding those who most distinguish themselves in such enterprises but the wellbeing of the community demands that each member should respect the property of the others and be punished by the odium of all if he does not it is equally necessary to the wellbeing of the community that every member should be able to rely upon the veracity of the other upon the very few points where their rights duties and interests clash in the very rudest state of society among the woods and hills of india the people have some deity whose power they dread and whose name they invoke when much is supposed to depend upon the truth of what one man is about to declare the pīpal tree ficus religiosa is everywhere sacred to the gods who are supposed to sit among its leaves and listen to the music of their rustling the deponent takes one of these leaves in his hand and invokes the god who sits above him to crush him or those dear to him as he crushes the leaf in his hand if he speak anything but the truth he then plucks and crushes the leaf and states what he has to say the large cottontree is among the wild tribes of india the favourite seat of gods still more terrible because their superintendence is confined exclusively to the neighbourhood and having their attention less occupied they can venture to make a more minute scrutiny into the conduct of the people immediately around them the pīpal is occupied by one or other of the hindoo triad the god of creation preservation or destruction who have the affairs of the universe to look after but the cotton and other trees are occupied by some minor deities who are vested with a local superintendence over the affairs of a district or perhaps of a single village these are always in the view of the people and every man knows that he is every moment liable to be taken to their court and to be made to invoke their vengeance upon himself or those dear to him if he has told a falsehood in what he has stated or tells one in what he is about to state men so situated adhere habitually and i may say religiously to the truth and i have had before me hundreds of cases in which a mans property liberty or life has depended upon his telling a lie and he has refused to tell it to save either as my friend told me they had not learned the value of a lie or rather they had not learned with how much impunity a lie could be told in the tribunals of civilized society in their own tribunals under the pīpaltree or cottontree imagination commonly did what the deities who were supposed to preside had the credit of doing if the deponent told a lie he believed that the deity who sat on the sylvan throne above him and searched the heart of man must know it and from that moment he knew no resthe was always in dread of his vengeance if any accident happened to him or to those dear to him it was attributed to this offended deity and if no accident happened some evil was brought about by his own disordered imagination in the tribunals we introduce among them such people soon find that the judges who preside can seldom search deeply into the hearts of men or clearly distinguish truth from falsehood in the declarations of deponents and when they candistinguish it it is seldom that they can secure their conviction for perjury they generally learn very soon that these judges instead of being like the judges of their own woods and wilds the only beings who can search the hearts of men and punish them for falsehood are frequently the persons of all others most blind to the real state of the deponents mind and the degree of truth and falsehood in his narrative that however wellintentioned they are often labouring in the darkness visible created by the native officers around them they not only learn this but they learn what is still worse that they may tell what lies they please in these tribunals and that not one of them shall become known to the circle in which they move and whose good opinion they value if by his lies told in such tribunals a man has robbed another or caused him to be robbed of his property his character his liberty or his life he can easily persuade the circle in which he resides that it has arisen not from any false statements of his but from the blindness of the judge or the wickedness of the native officers of his court because all circles consider the blindness of the one and the wickedness of the other to be everywhere very great arrian in speaking of the class of supervisors in india says they may not be guilty of falsehood and indeed none of the indians were ever accused of that crime i believe that as little falsehood is spoken by the people of india in their village communities as in any part of the world with an equal area and population it is in our courts of justice where falsehoods prevail most and the longer they have been anywhere established the greater the degree of falsehood that prevails in them those entrusted with the administration of a newlyacquired territory are surprised to find the disposition among both principals and witnesses in cases to tell the plain and simple truth as magistrates they find it very often difficult to make thieves and robbers tell lies according to the english fashion to avoid running a risk of criminating themselves in england this habit of making criminals tell lies arose from the severity of the penal code which made the punishment so monstrously disproportionate to the crime that the accused however clear and notorious his crimes became an object of general sympathy in india punishments have nowhere been under our rule disproportionate to the crimes on the contrary they have generally been more mild than the people would wish them to be or think they ought to be in order to deter from similar crimes and in newlyacquired territories they have generally been more mild than in our old possessions the accused are therefore nowhere considered as objects of public sympathy and in newlyacquired territories they are willing to tell the truth and are allowed to do so in order to save the people whom they have injured and their neighbours generally the great loss and annoyance unavoidably attending upon a summons to our courts in the native courts to which ours succeed the truth was seen through immediately the judges who presided could commonly distinguish truth from falsehood in the evidence before them almost as well as the sylvan gods who sat in the pīpalor cottontrees though they were seldom supposed by the people to be quite so just in their decisions when we take possession of such countries they for a time at least give us credit for the same sagacity with a little more integrity the prisoner knows that his neighbours expect him to tell the truth to save them trouble and will detest him if he does not he supposes that we shall have the sense to find out the truth whether he tells it or not and then humanity to visit his crime with the punishment it merits and no more the magistrate asks the prisoner what made him steal and the prisoner enters at once into an explanation of the circumstances which reduced him to the necessity of doing so and offers to bring witnesses to prove them but never dreams of offering to bring witnesses to prove that he did not steal if he really had done so because the general feeling would be in favour of his doing the one and against his doing the other tavernier gives an amusing sketch of amīr jumla presiding in a court of justice during a visit he paid him in the kingdom of golconda in the year see book i part ii chap i asked a native law officer who called on me one day what he thought would be the effect of an act to dispense with oaths on the korān and ganges water and substitute a solemn declaration made in the name of god and under the same penal liabilities as if the korān or ganges water had been in the deponents hand i have practised in the courts thirty years sir said he and during that time i have found only three kinds of witnessestwo of whom would by such an act be left precisely where they were while the third would be released by it from a very salutary check and pray what are the three classes into which you divide the witnesses in our courts first sir are those who will always tell the truth whether they are required to state what they know in the form of an oath or not do you think this a large class yes i think it is and i have found among them many whom nothing on earth could make to swerve from the truth do what you please you could never frighten or bribe them into a deliberate falsehood the second are those who will not hesitate to tell a lie when they have a motive for it and are not restrained by an oath in taking an oath they are afraid of two things the anger of god and the odium of men only three days ago continued my friend i required a power of attorney from a lady of rank to enable me to act for her in a case pending before the court in this town it was given to me by her brother and two witnesses came to declare that she had given it now said i this lady is known to live under the curtain and you will be asked by the judge whether you saw her give this paper what will you say they both replied if the judge asks us the question without an oath we will say yesit will save much trouble and we know that she did give this paper though we did not really see her give it but if he puts the korān into our hands we must say no for we should otherwise be pointed at by all the town as perjured wretchesour enemies would soon tell everybody that we had taken a false oath now my friend went on the form of an oath is a great check upon this sort of persons thethird class consists of men who will tell lies whenever they have sufficient motive whether they have the korān or ganges water in their hands or not nothing will ever prevent their doing so and the declaration which you propose would be just as well as any other for them which class do you consider the most numerous of the three i consider the second the most numerous and wish the oath to be retained for them that is of all the men you see examined in our courts you think the most come under the class of those who will under the influence of strong motives tell lies if they have not the korān or ganges water in their hands yes but do not a great many of those whom you consider to be included among the second class come from the village communitiesthe peasantry of the country yes and do you not think that the greatest part of those men who tell lies in the court under the influence of strong motives unless they bear the korān or ganges water in their hands would refuse to tell lies if questioned before the people of their villages among the circle in which they live of course i do threefourths of those who do not scruple to lie in our courts would be ashamed to be before their neighbours or the elders of their village you think that the people of the village communities are more ashamed to tell lies before their neighbours than the people of towns much more here is no comparison and the people of towns and cities bear in india but a small proportion to the people of the village communities i should think a very small proportion indeed then you think that in the mass of the population of india out of our courts and in their own circles the first class or those who speak truth whether they have the korān or ganges water in their hands or not would be found more numerous than the other two certainly i do if they were always to be questioned before their neighbours or elders or so that they could feel that their neighbours and elders would know what they say this man is a very worthy and learned muhammadan who has read all the works on medicine to be found in persian and arabia gives up his time from sunrise in the morning till nine to the indigent sick of the town whom he supplies gratuitously with his advice and medicines that cost him thirty rupees a month out of about one hundred and twenty that he can make by his labours all the rest of the day there can be no doubt that even in england the fear of the odium of society which is sure to follow the man who has perjured himself acts more powerfully in making men tell the truth when they have the bible in their hands before a competent and public tribunal and with a strong worldly motive to tell a lie than the fear of punishment by the deity in the next world for having taken his name in vain in this christians as well as other people are too apt to think that there is yet abundance of time to appease the deity by repentance and reformation but they know that they cannot escape the odium of society with a free press and high tone of moral and religions feeling like those of england if they deliberately perjure themselves in open court whose proceedings are watched with so much jealousy they learn to dread the name of perjured villain or perjured wretch which would embitter the rest of their lives and perhaps the lives of their children in a society much advanced in arts and the refinements of life temptations to falsehood become very great and require strong checks from law religion or moral feeling religion is seldom of itself found sufficient for though men cannot hope to conceal their transgressions from the deity they can as i have stated always hope in time to appease him penal laws are not alone sufficient for men can always hope to conceal their trespasses from those who are appointed to administer them or at least to prevent their getting that measure of judicial proof required for their conviction the dread of the indignation of their circle of society is everywhere the more efficient of the three checks and this check will generally be found most to prevail where the community is left most to selfgovernmenthence the proverb there is honour among thieves a gang of robbers who are outlaws are of course left to govern themselves and unless these could rely on each others veracity and honour in their relations with each other they could do nothing if governmentswere to leave no degree of selfgovernment to the communities of which the society is composed this moral check would really ceasethe law would undertake to secure every right and enforce every duty and men would cease to depend upon each others good opinion and good feelings there is perhaps no part of the world where the communities of which the society is composed have been left so much to selfgovernment as in india there has seldom been any idea of a reciprocity of duties and rights between the governing and the governed the sovereign who has possession feels that he has a right to levy certain taxes from the land for the maintenance of the public establishments which he requires to keep down rebellion against his rule and to defend his dominions against all who may wish to intrude and seize upon them and to assist him in acquiring the dominions of other princes when favourable opportunities offer but he has no idea of a reciprocal duty towards those from whom he draws his revenues the peasantry from whom the prince draws his revenues feel that they are bound to pay that revenue that if they do not pay it he will with his strong arm turn them out and give to others their possessionsbut they have no idea of any right on their part to any return from him the village communities were everywhere left almost entirely to selfgovernment and the virtues of truth and honesty in all their relations with each other were indispensably necessary to enable them to govern themselves a common interest often united a good many village communities in a bond of union and established a kind of brotherhood over extensive tracts of richly cultivated land selfinterest required that they should unite to defend themselves against attacks with which they were threatened at every returning harvest in a country where every prince was a robber upon a scale more or less large according to his means and took the field to rob while the lands were covered with the ripe crops upon which his troops might subsist and where every man who practised robbery with open violence followed what he called an imperial trade pādshāhī kāmthe only trade worthy the character of a gentleman the same interest required that they should unite in deceiving their own prince and all his officers great and small as to the real resources of their estates because they all knew that the prince would admit of no other limits to his exactions than their abilities to pay at the harvest though in their relations with each other all these village communities spoke as much truth as those of any other communities in the world still in their relation with the government they told as many liesfor falsehood in the one set of relations would have incurred the odium of the whole of their circles of societytruth in the other would often have involved the same penalty if a man had told a lie to cheat his neighbour he would have become an object of hatred and contemptif he told a lie to save his neighbours fields from an increase of rent or tax he would have become an object of esteem and respect if the government officers were asked whether there was any truth to be found among such communities they would say no that the truth was not in them because they would not cut each others throats by telling them the real value of each others fields if the peasantry were asked they would say there was plenty of truth to be found everywhere except among a few scoundrels who to curry favour with the government officers betrayed their trust and told the value of their neighbours fields in their ideas he might as well have gone off and brought down the common enemy upon them in the shape of some princely robber of the neighbourhood locke says outlaws themselves keep faith and rules of justice one with anotherthey practise them as rules of convenience within their own communities but it is impossible to conceive that they embrace justice as a practical principle who act fairly with their fellow highwaymen and at the same time plunder or kill the next honest man they meet vol i p in india the difference between the army of a prince and the gang of a robber was in the general estimation of the people only in degreethey were both driving an imperial trade a pādshāhī kām both took the auspices and set out on their expedition after the dasahrā when the autumn crops were ripening and both thought the deity propitiated as soon as they found the omens favourable one attacked palaces and capitals the other villages and merchants storerooms the members of the army of the prince thought as little of the justice or injustice of his cause as those of the gang of the robber the people of his capital hailed the return of the victorious prince who had contributed so much to their wealth to his booty and to their selflove by his victory the village community received back the robber and his gang with the same feelings by their skill and daring they had come back loaded with wealth which they were always disposed to spend liberally with their neighbours there was no more of truth in the prince and his army in their relations with the princes and people of neighbouring principalities than in the robber and his gang in their relations with the people robbed the prince flatters the selflove of his army and his people the robber flatters that of his gang and his villagethe question is only in degree the persons whose selflove is flattered are blind to the injustice and cruelty of the attackthe prince is the idol of a people the robber the idol of a gang was ever robber more atrocious in his attacks upon a merchant or a village than louis xiv of france in his attacks upon the palatine and palatinate of the rhine how many thousand similar instances might be quoted of princes idolized by their people for deeds equally atrocious in their relations with other people what nation or sovereign ever found fault with their ambassadors for telling lies to the kings courts and people of other countries rome during the whole period of her history was a mere den of execrable thieves whose feelings were systematically brutalized by the most revolting spectacles that they might have none of those sympathies with suffering humanity none of those compunctious visitings of conscience which might be found prejudicial to the interests of the gang and beneficial to the rest of mankind take for example the conduct of this atrocious gang under aemilius paulus against epirus and greece generally after the defeat of perseus all under the deliberate decrees of the senate take that of this gang under his son scipio the younger against carthage and numantia under cato at cyprusall in the same mannerunder the deliberate decrees of the senate take indeed the whole of her history as a republic and we find it that of the most atrocious band of robbers that was ever associated against the rest of their species in her relations with the rest of mankind rome was collectively devoid of truth and her citizens who were sent to govern conquered countries were no less devoid of truth individuallythey cared nothing whatever for the feelings or the opinions of the people governed in their dealings with them truth and honour were entirely disregarded the only people whose favourable opinion they had any desire to cultivate were the members of the great gang and the most effectual mode of conciliating them was to plunder the people of conquered countries and distribute the fruits among them in presents of one kind or another can any man read without shuddering that it was the practice among this atrocious gang to have all the multitude of unhappy prisoners of both sexes and of all ranks and ageswho annually graced the triumphs of their generals taken off and murdered just at the moment when these generals reached the capitol amid the shouts of the multitude that their joys might be augmented by the sight or consciousness of the sufferings of others see hookes roman history vol iii p vol iv p it was the custom that when the triumphant conqueror tumed his chariot towards the capitol he commanded the captives to be led to prison and there put to death that so the glory of the victor and the miseries of the vanquished might be in the same moment at the utmost how many millions of the most innocent and amiable of their species must have been offered up as human sacrifices to the triumphs of the leaders of this great gang the women were almost as brutalized as the men lovers met to talk soft nonsense at exhibitions of gladiators valeria the daughter and sister of two of the first men in rome was beautiful gay and lively and of unblemished reputation having been divorced from her husband she and the monster sylla made love to each other at one of these exhibitions of gladiators and were soon after married gibbon in speaking of the lies which severus told his two competitors in the contest for empire says falsehood and insincerity unsuitable as they seem to the dignity of public transactions offend us with a less degrading idea of meanness than when they are found in the intercourse of private life in the latter they discover a want of courage in the other only a defect of power and as it is impossible for the most able statesmen to subdue millions of followers and enemies by their own personal strength the world under the name of policy seems to have granted them a very liberal indulgence of craft and dissimulation but the weak in society are often obliged to defend themselves against the strong by the same weapons and the world grants them the same liberal indulgence men advocate the use of the ballot in elections that the weak may defend themselves and the free institutions of the country by dissimulation against the strong who would oppress them the circumstances under which falsehood and insincerity are tolerated by the community in the best societies of modern days are very numerous and the worst society of modern days in the civilized world when slavery does not prevail is immeasurably superior to the best in ancient days or in the middle ages do we not every day hear men and women in what are called the best societies declaring to one individual or one set of acquaintances that the pity the sympathy the love or the admiration they have been expressing for others is in reality all feigned to soothe or please as long as the motive is not base men do not spurn the falsehood as such how much of untruth is tolerated in the best circles of the most civilized nations in the relations between electors to corporate and legislative bodies and the candidates for election between nominators to offices under government and the candidates for nomination between lawyers and clients vendors and purchasers particularly of horses between the recruiting sergeant and the young recruit whom he has found a little angry with his widowed mother whom he makes him kill by false pictures of what a soldier may hope for in the bellaque matribus detestata to which he invites him there is i believe no class of men in india from whom it is more difficult to get the true statement of a case pending before a court than the sepoys of our native regiments and yet there are i believe no people in the world from whom it is more easy to get it in their own village communities where they state it before their relations elders and neighbours whose esteem is necessary to their happiness and can be obtained only by adherence to truth every case that comes before a regimental court involves or is supposed to involve the interest or feelings of some one or other of their companions and the question which the deponent asks himself isnot what religion public justice the interests of discipline and order or the wishes of his officers require or what would appear manly and honourable before the elders of his own little village but what will secure the esteem and what will excite the hatred of his comrades this will often be downright deliberate falsehood sworn upon the korān or the ganges water before his officers many a brave sepoy have i seen faint away from the agitated state of his feelings under the dread of the deity if he told lies with the ganges water in his hands and of his companions if he told the truth and caused them to be punished every question becomes a party question and the point of honour requires that every witness shall tell as many lies about it as possible when i go into a village and talk with the people in any part of india i know that i shall get the truth out of them on all subjects as long as i can satisfy them that i am not come on the part of the government to inquire into the value of their fields with a view to new impositions and this i can always do but when i go among the sepoys to ask about anything i feel pretty sure that i have little chance of getting at the truth they will take the alarm and try to deceive me lest what i learn should be brought up at some future day against them or their comrades the duke of wellington says speaking of the english soldiers it is most difficult to convict a prisoner before a regimental courtmartial for i am sorry to say that soldiers have little regard to the oath administered to them and the officers who are sworn well and truly to try and determine according to the evidence the matter before them have too much regard to the strict letter of that administered to them again the witnesses being in almost every instance common soldiers whose conduct this tribunal was instituted to control the consequence is that perjury is almost as common an offence asdrunkenness and plunder c in the ordinary civil tribunals of europe and america a man commonly feels that though he is removed far from the immediate presence of those whose esteem is necessary for him their eyes are still upon him because the statements he may give will find their way to them through the medium of the press this he does not feel in the civil courts of india nor in the military courts of europe or of any other part of the world and the man who judges of the veracity of a whole people from the specimens he may witness in such courts cannot judge soundly shaikh sādī in his gulistān has the following tale i have heard that a prince commanded the execution of a captive who was brought before him when the captive having no hope of life told the prince that he disgraced his throne the prince not understanding him tumed to one of his ministers and asked him what he had said he says replied the minister quoting a passage from the korān god loves those who subdue their passions forgive injuries and do good to his creatures the prince pitied the poor captive and countermanded the orders for the execution another minister who owed a spite to the one who first spoke said nothing but truth should be spoken by such persons as we in the presence of the prince the captive spoke abusively and insolently and you have not interpreted his words truly the prince frowned and said his false interpretation pleases me more than thy true one because his was given for a good and thine for a malignant purpose and wise men have said that a peacemaking lie is better than a factious or anger exciting truth he who would too fastidiously condemn this doctrine should think of the massacre of thessalonica and how much better it would have been for the great theodosius to have had by his side the peacemaking ambrose archbishop of milan than the angerexciting rufinus when he heard of the offence which that city had committed in despotic governments where lives characters and liberties are every moment at the mercy not only of the prince but of all his public officers from the highest to the lowest the occasions in which men feel authorized and actually called upon by the common feelings of humanity to tell peacemaking lies occur every daynay every hour every petty officer of government armed with his little brief authority is a little tyrant surrounded by men whose all depends upon his will and who dare not tell him the truththe point of honour in this little circle demands that every one should be prepared to tell him peacemaking lies and the man who does not do so when the occasion seems to call for it incurs the odium of the whole circle as one maliciously disposed to speak angerexciting or factions truths poor cromwell and anne boleyn were obliged to talk of love and duty toward their brutal murderer henry viii and tell peacemaking lies on the scaffold to save their poor children from his resentment european gentlemen in india often by their violence surround themselves with circles of the same kind in which the point of honour demands that every member shall be prepared to tell peacemaking lies to save the others from the effects of their masters ungovernable passionsfalsehood is their only safeguard and consequently falsehood ceases to be odious countenanced in the circles of the violent falsehood soon becomes countenanced in those of the mild and forbearing their domestics pretend a dread of their anger which they really do not feel and they gain credit for having the same good excuse among those who have no opportunity of becoming acquainted with the real character of the gentlemen in their domestic relationsall are thought to be more or less tigerish in these relations particularly before breakfast because some are known to be so i have known the native officers of a judge who was really a very mild and worthy man but who lived a very secluded life plead as their excuse for all manner of bribery and corruption that their persons and character were never safe from his violence and urge that men whose tenure of office was very insecure and who were every hour in the day exposed to so much indignity could not possibly be blamed for making the most of their position the society around believed all this and blamed not the native officers but the judge or the government who placed them in such a situation other judges and magistrates have been known to do what this person was merely reported to do otherwise society would neither have given credit to his officers nor have held them excused for their malpractices those european gentlemen who allow their passions to get the better of their reason among their domestics do much to lower the character of their countrymen in the estimation of the people but the high officials who forget what they owe to themselves and the native officers of their courts when presiding on the bench of justice do ten thousand times more and i grieve to say that i have known a few officials of this class we have in england known many occasions particularly in the cases of prosecutions by the officers of government for offences against the state where little circles of society have made it a point of honour for some individuals to speak untruths and for others to give verdicts against their consciences some occasions indeed where those who ventured to speak the truth or give a verdict according to their conscience were in danger from the violence of popular resentment have we not unhappily in england and among our countrymen in all parts of the world experience of a wide difference between what is exacted from members of particular circles of society by the point of honour and what is held to be strict religions truth by the rest of society do we not see gentlemen cheating their tradesmen while they dare not leave a gambling debt unpaid the point of honour in the circle to which they belong demands that the one should be paid because the nonpayment would involve a breach of faith in their relations with each other as in the case of the members of a gang of robbers but the nonpayment of a tradesmans bill involves only a breach of faith in a gentlemans relations with a lower order at least some gentlemen do not feel any apprehension of incurring the odium of the circle inwhich they move by cheating of this kind in the same manner the roué or libertine of rank may often be guilty of all manner of falsehoods and crimes to the females of the class below him without any fear of incurring the odium of either males or females of his own circle on the contrary the more crimes he commits of this sort the more sometimes he may expect to be caressed by males and females of his own order the man who would not hesitate a moment to destroy the happiness of a family by the seduction of the wife or the daughter would not dare to leave one shilling of a gambling debt unpaidthe one would bring down upon him the odium of his circle but the other would not and the odium of that circle is the only kind of odium he dreads appius claudius apprehended no odium from his own orderthe patrician from the violation of the daughter of virginius of the plebeian order nor did sextus tarquinius of the royal order apprehend any from the violation of lucretia of the patrician orderneither would have been punished by their own order but they were both punished by the injured orders below them our own penal code punished with death the poor man who stole a little food to save his children from starvation while it left to exult in the caresses of his own order the wealthy libertine who robbed a father and mother of their only daughter and consigned her to a life of infamy and misery the poor victim of mans brutal passions and base falsehood suffered inevitable and exquisite punishment while the laws and usages of society left the man himself untouched he had nothing to apprehend if the father of his victim happened to be of the lower order or a minister of the church of christ because his own order would justify his refusing to meet the one in single combat and the other dared not invite him to it and the law left no remedy take the two parties in england into which society is politically divided there is hardly any species of falsehood uttered by the members of the party out of power against the members of the party in power that is not tolerated and even applauded by one party men state deliberately what they know to be utterly devoid of truth regarding the conduct of their opponent they basely ascribe to them motives by which they know they were never actuated merely to deceive the public and to promote the interests of their party without the slightest fear of incurring odium by so doing in the minds of any but their political opponents if a foreigner were to judge of the people of england from the tone of their newspapers he would say that there was assuredly neither honour honesty nor truth to be found among the classes which furnished the nation with its ministers and legislators for a set of miscreants more atrocious than the whig and tory ministers and legislators of england were represented to be in these papers never disgraced the society of any nation upon earth happily all foreigners who read these journals know that in what the members of one party say of those of the other or are reported to say there is often but little truth and that there is still less of truth in what the editors and correspondents of the ultra journals of one party write about the characters conduct and sentiments of the members of the other there is one species of untruth to which we english people are particularly prone in india and i am assured everywhere else it is this young miss in her teens as soon as she finds her female attendants in the wrong no matter in what way exclaims it is so like the natives and the idea of the same error vice or crime becomes so habitually associated in her mind with every native she afterwards sees that she can no more separate them than she can the idea of ghosts and hobgoblins from darkness and solitude the young cadet or civilian as soon as he finds his valet butler or groom in the wrong exclaims it is so like blackyso like the niggers they are all alike and what could you expect from him he has been constantly accustomed to the same vicious association of ideas in his native landif he has been brought up in a family of tories he has constantly heard those he most reverenced exclaim when they have found or fancied they found a whig in the wrong it is so like the whigsthey are all alikethere is no trusting any of them if a protestant it is so like the catholics there is no trusting them in any condition of life the members of whig and catholic families may say the same perhaps of tories and protestants an untravelled englishman will sometimes say the same of a frenchman and the idea of everything that is bad in man will be associated in his mind with the image of a frenchman if he hears of an act of dishonour by a person of that nation it is so like a frenchmanthey are all alike there is no honour in them a tory goes to america predisposed to find in all who live under republican governments every species of vice and crime and no sooner sees a man or woman misbehave than he exclaims it is so like the americansthey are all alike but what could you expect from republicans at home when he considers himself in relation to the members of the parties opposed to him in religion or politics they are associated in his mind with everything that is vicious abroad when he considers the people of other countries in relation to his own if they happen to be christians he will find them associated in his mind with everything that is good or everything that is bad in proportion as their institutions happen to conform to those which his party advocates a tory will abuse america and americans and praise the austrians a whig will perhaps abuse the austrians and others who live under paternal or despotic governments and praise the americans who live under institutions still more free than his own this has properly been considered by locke as a species of madness to which all mankind are more or less subject and from which hardly any individual can entirely free himself there is he says scarce a man so free from it but that if he should always on all occasions argue or do as in some cases he constantly does would not be thought fitter for bedlam than civil conversation i do not here mean when he is under the power of an unruly passion but in the steady calm course of his life that which thus captivates their reason and leads men of sincerity blindfold from common sense will when examined be found to be what we are speaking of some independent ideas of no alliance to one another are by education custom and the constant din of their party so coupled in their minds that they always appear there together and they can no more separate them in their thoughts than if they were but one idea and they operate as if they reallywere so book ii chap perjury had long since ceased to be considered disgraceful or even discreditable among the patrician order in rome before the soldiers ventured to break their oaths of allegiance military service had from the ignorance and selfishness of this order been rendered extremely odious to freeborn romans and they frequently mutinied and murdered their generals though they would not desert because they had sworn not to do so to break his oath by deserting the standards of rome was to incur the hatred and contempt of the great mass of the peoplethe soldier dared not hazard this but patricians of senatorial and consular rank did not hesitate to violate their oaths whenever it promised any advantage to the patrician order collectively or individually because it excited neither contempt nor indignation in that order they have been false to their generals said fabius but they have never deceived the gods i know they can conquer and they shall swear to do so they swore and conquered instead of adopting measures to make the duties of a soldier less odious the patricians tumed their hatred of these duties to account and at a high price sold an absolution from their oath while the members of the patrician order bought and sold oaths among themselves merely to deceive the lower orders they were still respected among the plebeians but when they began to sell dispensations to the members of this lower order the latter also by degrees ceased to feel any veneration for the oath and it was no longer deemed disgraceful to desert duties which the higher order made no effort to render less odious that they who draw the breath of life in a court and pass all their days in an atmosphere of lies should have any very sacred regard for truth is hardly to be expected they experience such falsehood in all who surround them that deception at least suppression of the truth almost seems necessary for selfdefence and accordingly if their speech be not framed upon the theory of the french cardinal that language was given to man for the better concealment of his thoughts they at least seem to regard in what they say not its resemblance to the tact in question but rather its subserviency to the purpose in view broughams george iv yet let it never be forgotten that princes are nurtured in falsehood by the atmosphere of lies which envelops their palace steeled against natural sympathies by the selfish natures of all that surround them hardened in cruelty partly indeed by the fears incident to their position but partly too by the unfeeling creatures the factions the unnatural productions of a court whom alone they deal with trained for tyrants by the prostration which they find in all the minds which they come in contact with encouraged to domineer by the unresisting medium through which all their steps to power and its abuse are made broughams carnot but lord brougham is too harsh johnson has observed truly enough honesty is not necessarily greater where elegance is less nor does a sense of supreme or despotic power necessarily imply the exercise or abuse of it princes have happily the same yearning as the peasant after the respect and affection of the circle around them and the people under them and they must generally seek it by the same means i have mentioned the village communities of india as that class of the population among whom truth prevails most but i believe there is no class of men in the world more strictly honourable in their dealings than the mercantile classes of india under native governments a merchants books were appealed to as holy writ and the confidence in them has certainly not diminished under our rule there have been instances of their being seized by the magistrate and subjected to the inspection of the officers of his court no officer of a native government ventured to seize them the merchant was required to produce them as proof of particular entries and while the officers of government did no more there was no danger of false accounts an instance of deliberate fraud or falsehood among native merchants of respectable station in society is extremely rare among the many hundreds of bills i have had to take from them for private remittances i have never had one dishonoured or the payment upon one delayed beyond the day specified nor do i recollect ever hearing of one who had they are so careful not to speculate beyond their means that an instance of failure is extremely rare among them no one ever in india hears of families reduced to ruin or distress by the failure of merchants or bankers though here as in all other countries advanced in the arts a vast number of families subsist upon the interest of money employed by them there is no class of men more interested in the stability of our rule in india than this of the respectable merchants nor is there any upon whom the welfare of our government and that of the people more depend frugal first upon principle that they may not in their expenditure encroach upon their capitals they become so by habit and when they advance in life they lay out their accumulated wealth in the formation of those works which shall secure for them from generation to generation the blessings of the people of the towns in which they have resided and those of the country around it would not be too much to say that onehalf of the great works which embellish and enrich the face of india in tanks groves wells temples c have been formed by this class of the people solely with the view of securing the blessings of mankind by contributing to their happiness in solid and permanent works the man who has left behind him great works in temples bridges reservoirs and caravanserais for the public good does not die says shaikh sādī the greatest of eastern poets whose works are more read and loved than those of any other uninspired man that has ever written not excepting our own beloved shakspeare he is as much loved and admired by hindoos as bymuhammadans and from boyhood to old age he continues the idol of the imaginations of both the boy of ten and the old man of seventy alike delight to read and quote him for the music of his verses and the beauty of his sentiments precepts and imagery it was to the class last mentioned whose incomes are derived from the profits of stock invested in manufactures and commerce that europe chiefly owed its rise and progress after the downfall of the roman empire and the long night of darkness and desolation which followed it it was through the means of mercantile industry and the municipal institutions to which it gave rise that the enlightened sovereigns of europe were enabled to curb the licence of the feudal aristocracy and to give to life property and character that security without which society could not possibly advance and it was through the same means that the people were afterwards enabled to put those limits to the authority of the sovereign and to secure to themselves that share in the government without which society could not possibly be free or well constituted upon the same foundation may we hope to raise a superstructure of municipal corporations and institutions in india such as will give security and dignity to the society and the sooner we begin upon the work the better notes johnson says mountaineers are thievish because they are poor and having neither manufactures nor commerce can grow rich only by robbery they regularly plunder their neighbours for their neighbours are commonly their enemies and having lost that reverence for property by which the order of civil life is preserved soon consider all as enemies whom they do not reckon as friends and think themselves licensed to invade whatever they are not obliged to protect w h s the quotation is from a journey

weakness and is practically untouched by christian and muhammadan proselytism the gods of the vedas are as dead as jupiter and the krishna worship only succeeds from its marvellous adaptability to the sensuous and romantic side of the native mind but it would be too much to say that the creed exercises any real effect on life or morals with the majority of its devotees it is probably more sympathetic than practical and ranks with the periodical ablutions in the ganges and jumna and the traditional worship of the local gods and ghosts which really impress the rustic he is enclosed on

goods which we had shown him but we were told that he was engaged examining a number of criminals who had been brought to him for immediate punishment it is the custom in this country not to keep a man in prison but immediately the accused is taken he is examined and sentence is pronounced on him which is then executed without any delay if the person whom they have seized is found innocent he is released at once and whatever the nature of the case may be it is promptly concluded on the th at seven oclock in the morning we went to the nawāb and immediately we were announced he asked us to enter his tent where he was seated with two of his secretaries by him the nawāb had the intervals between his toes full of letters and he also had many between the fingers of his left hand he drew them sometimes from his feet sometimes from his hand and sent his replies through his two secretaries writing some also himself while we were with the nawāb he was informed that four prisoners who were then at the door of the tent had arrived he remained more than half an hour without replying writing continually and making his secretaries write but at length he suddenly ordered the criminals to be brought in and after having questioned them and made them confess with their own mouths the crime of which they were accused he remained nearly an hour without saying anything continuing to write and to make his secretaries write among these four prisoners who were brought into his presence there was one who had entered a house and slain a mother and her three infants he was condemned forthwith to have his feet and hands cut off and to be thrown into a field near the high road to end his days another had stolen on the high road and the nawāb ordered him to have his stomach slit

never hinders any witness from lying to his hearts content the use of the korān and ganges water in the courts has been given up the tendency of modern india is to rely too much on formal law and the exercise of the powers of the central government the contemplation of the vast administrative machinery working with its irresistible force and unfailing regularity in obedience to the will of rulers whose motives are not understood undoubtedly has a paralysing influence on the life of the nations of india which if not counteracted would work deep mischief something in the way of counteraction has been done though not always with knowledge the difficulties inherent in the problem of reconciling foreign rule with selfgovernment in an asiatic country are enormous but panegyrics on the selfgovernment of indian villages must always be read with the qualification that the standard of such government was low and that hundreds of acts and omissions were tolerated which are intolerable to a modern european government hence comes the difficulty of enforcing numerous reforms loudly called for by european opinion the vast indian population hates reform and innovation for many reasons and above all because they involve expense which to the indian mind appears wholly unwarrantable the same phenomenon is observable in rural ireland where as in india an unhappy history has generated

certain occasions since the author wrote the above remarks the conditions of indian trade have been revolutionized by the development of roads railways motors telegraph postal facilities and exports

credit but he will often stoop to the most discreditable devices in the purchase of a coveted estate the foreclosure of a mortgage and the like his books nowadays are certainly not appealed to as holy

a man of great observation and practical good sense has an infinite fund of good humour and a cheerfulness of temperament that never seems to flaga more agreeable companion i have never met the villages in these parts are literally crowded with peafowl i counted no less than fortysix feeding close by among the houses of one hamlet on the road all wild or rather unappropriated for they seemed on the best possible terms with the inhabitants at sāhar our water was drawn from wells eighty feet deep and this is said to be the ordinary depth from which water is drawn consequently irrigation is too expensive to be common it is confined almost exclusively to small patches of garden cultivation in the vicinity of villages on the th we came on sixteen miles to kosī for the most part over a poor soil badly cultivated and almost exclusively devoted to autumn crops of which cotton is the principal i lost the road in the morning before daylight and the trooper who usually rode with me had not come up i got an old landholder from one of the villages to walk on with me a mile and put me in the right road i asked him what had been the state of the country under the former government of the jāts and marāthās and was told that the greater part was a wild jungle i remember said the old man when you could not have got out of the road hereabouts without a good deal of risk i could not have ventured a hundred yards from the village without the chance of having my clothes stripped off my back now the whole face of the country is under cultivation and the roads are safe formerly the governments kept no faith with their landholders and cultivators exacting ten rupees where they had bargained for five whenever they found the crops good but in spite of all this zulm oppression said the old man there was then more barkat blessings from above than now the lands yielded more returns to the cultivator and he could maintain his little family better upon five acres than he can now upon ten to what my old friend do you attribute this very unfavourable change in the productive powers of your soil a man cannot sir venture to tell the truth at all times and in all places said he you may tell it now with safety my good old friend i am a mere traveller musafir going to the hills in search of health from the valley of the nerbudda where the people have been suffering much from blight and are much perplexed in their endeavour to find a cause here sir we all attribute these evils to the dreadful system of perjury which the practices of your judicial courts have brought among the people you are perpetually putting the ganges water into the hands of the hindoos and the korān into those of muhammadans and all kinds of lies are every day told upon them god almighty can stand this no longer and the lands have ceased to be blessed with that fertility which they had before this sad practice began this sir is almost the only fault we have any of us to find with your government men by this system of perjury are able to cheat each other out of their rights and bring down sterility upon the land by which the innocent are made to suffer for the guilty on reaching our tents i asked a respectable farmer who came to pay his respects to the commissioner of the division mr fraser what he thought of the matter telling him what i had heard from my old friend on the road the diminished fertility is said he owing no doubt to the want of those salutary fallows which the fields got under former governments when invasions and civil wars were things of common occurrence and kept at least twothirds of the land waste but there is on the other hand no doubt that you have encouraged perjury a good deal in your courts of justice and this perjury must have some effect in depriving the land of the blessing of god every man now who has a cause in your civil courts seems to think it necessary either to swear falsely himself or to get others to do it for him the european gentlemen no doubt do all they can to secure every man his right but surrounded as they are by perjured witnesses and corrupt native officers they commonly labour in the dark much of truth is to be found among the village communities of india where they have been carefully maintained if people will go among them to seek it here as almost everywhere else truth is the result of selfgovernment whether arising from choice under municipal institutions or necessity under despotism and anarchy selfgovernment produces selfesteem and pride of character close to our tents we found the people at work irrigating their fields from several wells whose waters were all brackish the crops watered from these wells were admirablelikely to yield at least fifteen returns of the seed wherever we gowe find the signs of a great government passed awaysigns that must tend to keep alive the recollections and exalt the ideas of it in the minds of the people beyond the boundary of our military and civil stations we find as yet few indications of our reign or character to link us with the affections of the people there is hardly anything to indicate our existence as a people or a government in this country and it is melancholy to think that in the wide extent of country over which i have travelled there should be so few signs of that superiority in science and arts which we boast of and really do possess and ought to make conducive to the welfare and happiness of the people in every part of our dominions the people and the face of the country are just what they might have been had they been governed by police officers and taxgatherers from the sandwich islands capable of securing life property and character and levying honestly the means of maintaining the establishments requisite for the purpose some time after the journey here described in the early part of november after a heavy fall of rain i was driving alone in my buggy from garhmuktesar on the ganges to meerut the roads were very bad the stage a double one and my horse became tired and unable to go on i got out at a small village to give him a little rest and food and sat down under the shade of one old tree upon the trunk of another that the storm had blown down while my groom the only servant i had with me rubbed down and baited my horse i called for some parched gram from the same shop which supplied my horse and got a draught of good water drawn from the well by an old woman in a brass jug lent to me for the purpose by the shopkeeper while i sat contentedly and happily stripping my parched gram of its shell and eating it grain by grain the farmer or head landholder of the village a sturdy old rājpūt came up and sat himself without any ceremony down by my side to have a little conversation to one of the dignitaries of the land in whose presence the aristocracy are alone entitled to chairs this easy familiarity on the part of a poor farmer seems at first somewhat strange and unaccountable he is afraid that the man intends to offer him some indignity or what is still worse mistakes him for something less than the dignitary the following dialogue took place you are a rājpūt and a zamīndār landholder yes i am the head landholder of this village can you tell me how that village in the distance is elevated above the ground is it from the debris of old villages or from a rock underneath it is from the debris of old villages that is the original seat of all the rājpūts around we all trace our descent from the founders of that village who built and peopled it many centuries ago and you have gone on subdividing your inheritances here as elsewhere no doubt till you have hardly any of you anything to eat true we have hardy any of us enough to eat but that is the fault of the government that does not leave us enough that takes from us as much when the season is bad as when it is good but your assessment has not been increased has it no we have concluded a settlement for twenty years upon the same footing as formerly and if the sky were to shower down upon you pearls and diamonds instead of water the government would never demand more from you than the rate fixed upon no then why should you expect remissions in the bad seasons it cannot be disputed that the barkat blessing from above is less under you than it used to be formerly and that the lands yield less to our labour true my old friend but do you know the reason why no then i will tell you forty or fifty years ago in what you call the times of the barkat blessing from above the cavalry of sikh freebooters from the panjāb used to sweep over this fine plain in which stands the said village from which you are all descended and to massacre the whole population of some villages and a certain portion of that of every other village and the lands of those killed used to be waste for want of cultivators is not this all true yes quite true and the fine groves which had been planted over the plain by your ancestors as they separated from the great parent stock and formed independent villages and hamlets for themselves were all swept away and destroyed by the samehordes of freebooters from whom your poor imbecile emperors cooped up in yonder large city of delhi were utterly unable to defend you quite true said the old man with a sigh i remember when all this fine plain was as thickly studded with fine groves of mangotrees as rohilkhand or any other part of india you know that the land requires rest from labour as well as men and bullocks and that if you go on sowing wheat and other exhausting crops it will go on yielding less and less returns and at last not be worth the tilling quite well then why do you not give the land rest by leaving it longer fallow or by a more frequent alternation of crops relieve it because we have now increased so much that we should not get enough to eat were we to leave it to fallow and unless we tilled it with exhausting crops we should not get the means of paying our rents to the government the sikh hordes in former days prevented this they killed off a certain portion of your families and gave the land the rest which you now refuse it when you had exhausted one part you found another recovered by a long fallow so that you had better returns but now that we neither kill you nor suffer you to be killed by others you have brought all the cultivable lands into tillage and under the old system of cropping to exhaustion it is not surprising that they yield you less returns by this time we had a crowd of people seated around us upon the ground as i went on munching my parched gram and talking to the old patriarch they all laughed at the old man at the conclusion of my last speech and he confessed i was right this is all true sir but still your government is not considerate it goes on taking kingdom after kingdom and adding to its dominions without diminishing the burden upon us its old subjects here you have had armies away taking afghanistan but we shall not have one rupee the less to pay true my friend nor would you demand a rupee less from those honest cultivators around us if we were to leave you all your lands untaxed you complain of the governmentthey complain of you here the circle around us laughed at the old man again nor would you subdivide the lands the less for having it rentfree on the contrary it would be every generation subdivided the more inasmuch as there would be more of local ties and a greater disinclination of families to separate and seek service abroad true sir very truethat is no doubt a very great evil and you know it is not an evil produced by us but one arising out of your own laws of inheritance you have heard no doubt that with us the eldest son gets the whole of the land and the younger sons all go out in search of service with such share as they can get of the other property of their father yes sir but when shall we get serviceyou have none to give us i would serve tomorrow if you would take me as a soldier said he stroking his white whiskers the crowd laughed heartily and some wag observed that i should perhaps think him too old well said the old man smiling the gentleman himself is not very young and yet i dare say he is a good servant of his government this was paying me off for making the people laugh at his expense true my old friend said i but i began to serve when i was young and have been long learning very well said the old man but i should be glad to serve the rest of my life upon a less salary than you got when you began to learn well my friend you complain of our government but you must acknowledge that we do all we can to protect you though it is true that we are often acting in the dark often sir you are always acting in the dark you hardly any of you know anything of what your revenue and police officers are doing there is no justice or redress to be got without paying for it and it is not often that those who pay can get ittrue my old friend that is bad all over the world you cannot presume to ask anything even from the deity himself without paying the priest who officiates in his temples and if you should you would none of you hope to get from your deity what you asked for here the crowd laughed again and one of them said that there was this certainly to be said for our government that the european gentlemen themselves never took bribes whatever those under them might do you must not be too sure of that neither did not the lāl bībī the red lady get a bribe for soliciting the judge her husband to let go amīr singh who had been confined in jail how did this take place about three years ago amīr singh was sentenced to imprisonment and his friends spent a great deal of money in bribes to the native officers of the court but all in vain at last they were recommended to give a handsome present to the red lady they did so and amīr singh was released but did they give the present into the ladys own hand no they gave it to one of her women and how do you know that she ever gave it to her mistress or that her mistress ever heard of the transaction she might certainly have been acting without her mistress knowledge but the popular belief is that the lāl bībī got the present i then told the story of the affair at jubbulpore when mrs smiths name had been used for a similar purpose and the people around us were all highly amused and the old mans opinion of the transaction with the red lady evidently underwent a change we became good friends and the old man begged me to have my tents which he supposed were coming up pitched among them that he might have an opportunity of showing that he was not a bad subject though he grumbled against the government the next day at meerut i got a visit from the chief native judge whose son a talented youth is in my office among other things i asked him whether it might not be possible to improve the character of the police by increasing the salaries of the officers and mentioned my conversation with the landholder never sir said the old gentleman the man that now gets twentyfive rupees a month is contented with making perhaps fifty or seventyfive more and the people subject to his authority pay him accordingly give him a hundred sir and he will put a shawl over his shoulders and the poor people will be obliged to pay him at a rate that will make up his income to four hundred you will only alter his style of living and make him a greater burthen to the people he will always take as long as he thinks he can with impunity but do you not think that when people see a man adequately paid by the government they will the more readily complain of any attempt at unauthorized exactions not a bit sir as long as they see the same difficulties in the way of prosecuting him to conviction in the administration of civil justice the old gentleman is a civil judge you may occasionally see your way and understand what is doing but in revenue and police you never have seen it in india and never will i think the officers you employ will all add to their incomes by unauthorized means and the lower these incomes the less their pretensions and the less the populace have to pay notes january the old angloindian rose much earlier than his successor of the present day commonly does for other popular explanations of the alleged decrease in fertility of the soil see ante chapter where three explanations are offered namely the eating of beef the prevalence of adultery and the impiety of surveys the inapplicability of these observations of the author to the present time is a good measure of the material progress of india since his day the ganges canal the bridges over the indus ganges and other great rivers and numberless engineering works throughout the empire are permanent witnesses to the scientific superiority of the ruling race buildings which can claim any high degree of architectural excellence are unfortunately still rare but the public edificesof bombay will not suffer by comparison with those of most capital cities and for some years past considerable attention has been paid to architecture as an art a great architectural experiment is in progress at the new official capital of delhi the road is now an excellent one parched gram or chickpea is commonly used by indian travellers as a convenient and readily portable form of food the brass jug lent to the author could be purified by fire after his use of it growls of this kind must not be interpreted too literally any village landholder if encouraged would grumble in the same strain this is the permanent difficulty of indian revenue administration which no government measures can seriously diminish the mission to kabul under captain alexander burnes was not dispatched till september and troops did not assemble before the conclusion of the treaty with the sikhs in june the army crossed the indus in january the conversation in the text is stated to have taken place some time after the journey herein described and must apparently be dated in november the author was in the northwestern provinces in that year some of mrs smiths suitors entered into a combination to defraud a suitor in his court of a large sum of money which he was to pay to mrs smith as she walked in the garden a dancing girl from the town of jubbulpore was made to represent mrs smith and a suit of mrs smiths clothes was borrowed for her from the washerman the butler took the suitor to the garden and introduced him to the supposed mrs smith who received him very graciously and condescended to accept his offer of five thousand rupees in gold mohurs the plot was afterwards discovered and the old butler washerman and all were sentenced to work in a rope on the roads w h s penal labour on the roads has been discontinued long since similar plots probably have often escaped detection the whole conversation is a valuable illustration of indian habits and modes of thought the subject of the police administration is more fully discussed post in chapter chapter concentration of capital and its effects kosī stands on the borders of fīrōzpur the estate of the late shamsuddīn who was hanged at delhi on the rd of october for the murder of william fraser the representative of the governorgeneral in the delhi city and territories the mewātīs of fīrōzpur are notorious thieves and robbers during the nawābs time they dared not plunder within his territory but had a free licence to plunder wherever they pleased beyond it they will now be able to plunder at home since our tribunals have been introduced to worry prosecutors and their witnesses to death by the distance they have to go and the tediousness of our process and thereby to secure impunity to offenders by making it the interest of those who have been robbed not only to bear with the first loss without complaint but largely to bribe police officers to conceal the crimes from their master the magistrate when they happen to come to their knowledge here it was that jeswant rāo holkār gave a grand ball on the th of october while he was with his cavalry covering the siege of delhi by his regular brigade in the midst of the festivity he had a european soldier of the kings th regiment who had been taken prisoner strangled behind the curtain and his head stuck upon a spear and placed in the midst of the assembly where the nāch nautch girls were made to dance round it lord lake reached the place the next morning in pursuit of this monster and the gallant regiment who here heard the story had soon an opportunity of revenging the foul murder of their comrade in the battle of dīg one of the most gallant passages of arms we have ever had in india near kosī there is a factory in ruins belonging to the late firm of mercer company here the cotton of the district used to be collected and screwed under the superintendence of european agents preparatory to its embarkation for calcutta on the river jumna on the failure of the firm the establishment was broken up and the work which was then done by one great european merchant is now done by a score or two of native merchants there is perhaps nothing which india wants more than the concentration of capital and the failure of a i the great commercial houses in calcutta in the year was unquestionably a great calamity they none of them brought a particle of capital into the country nor does india want a particle from any country but they concentrated it and had they employed the whole as they certainly did a good deal of it in judiciously improving and extending the industry of the natives they might have been the source of incalculable good to india its people and government to this concentration of capital in great commercial and manufacturing establishments which forms the grand characteristic of european in contradistinction to asiatic societies in the present day must we look for those changes which we consider desirable in the social and religions institutions of the people where land is liable to eternal subdivision by the law and the religion of both the muhammadan and hindoo population where every great work that improves its productive powers and facilitates the distribution of its produce among the people in canals roads bridges c is made by government where capital is nowhere concentrated in great commercial or manufacturing establishments there can be no upper classes in society but those of office and of all societies perhaps that is the worst in which the higher classes are so exclusively composed in india public office has been and must continue to be the only road to distinction until we have a law of primogeniture and a concentration of capital in india no man has ever thought himself respectable or been thought so by others unless he is armed with his little hukūmat his little brief authority under government that gives him the command of some public establishment paid out of the revenues of the state in europe and america where capital has been concentrated in great commercial and manufacturing establishments and free institutions prevail almost as the natural consequence industry is everything and those who direct and command it are happily looked up to as the source of the wealth the strength the virtue and the happiness of the nation the concentration of capital in such establishments may indeed be considered not only as the natural consequence but as the prevailing cause of the free institutions by which the mass of the people in european countries are blessed the mass of the people were as much brutalized and oppressed by the landed aristocracy as they could have been by any official aristocracy before towns and higher classes were created by the concentration of capital the same observations are applicable to china there the land all belongs to the sovereign as in india and as in india it is liable to the same eternal subdivision among the sons of those who hold it under him capital is nowhere more concentrated in china than in india and all the great works that add to the fertility of the soil and facilitate the distribution of the land labour of the country are formed by the sovereign out of the public revenue the revenue is in consequence one of office and no man considers himself respectable unless invested with some office under government that is under the emperor subdivision of labour concentration of capital and machinery render an englishman everywhere dependent upon the cooperation of multitudes while the chinaman who as yet knows little of either is everywhere independent and able to work his way among strangers but this very dependence of the englishman upon the concentration of capital is the greatest source of his strength and pledge of his security since it supports those members of the higher orders who can best understand and assert the rights and interests of the wholeif we had any great establishment of this sort in which christians could find employment and the means of religious and secular instruction thousands of converts would soon flock to them and they would become vast sources of future improvement in industry social comfort municipal institutions and religion what chiefly prevents the spread of christianity in india is the dread of exclusion from caste and all its privileges and the utter hopelessness of their ever finding any respectable circle of society of the adopted religion which converts or wouldbe converts to christianity now everywhere feel form such circles for them make the members of these circles happy in the exertion of honest and independent industry let those who rise to eminence in them feel that they are considered as respectable and as important in the social system as the servants of government and converts will flock around you from all parts and from all classes of the hindoo community i have since i have been in india had i may say at least a score of hindoo grasscutters turn musalmāns merely because the grooms and the other grasscutters of my establishment happened to be of that religion and they could neither eat drink nor smoke with them thousands of hindoos all over india become every year musalmāns from the same motive and we do not get the same number of converts to christianity merely because we cannot offer them the same advantages i am persuaded that a dozen such establishments as that of mr thomas ashton of hyde as described by a physician at manchester and noticed in mr bainess admirable work on the cotton manufactures of great britain page would do more in the way of conversion among the people of india than has ever yet been done by all the religious establishments or ever will be done by them without such aid i have said that the great commercial houses of calcutta which in their ruin involved that of so many useful establishments scattered over india like that of kosī brought no capital into the country they borrowed from one part of the civil and military servants of government at a high interest that portion of their salary which they saved and lent it at a higher interest to others of the same establishment who for a time required or wished to spend more than they received or they employed it at a higher rate of profit for great commercial and manufacturing establishments scattered over india or spread over the ocean their great error was in mistaking nominal for real profits calculating their dividend on the nominal profits and never supposing that there could be any such things as losses in commercial speculation or bad debts from misfortunes and bad faith they squandered them in lavish hospitality and ostentatious display or allowed their retiring members to take them to england and to every other part of the world where their creditors might not find them till they discovered that all the real capital left at their command was hardly sufficient to pay back with the stipulated interest onetenth of what they had borrowed the members of those houses who remained in india up to the time of the general wreck were of course reduced to ruin and obliged to bear the burthen of the odium and indignation which the ruin of so many thousands of confiding constituents brought down upon them since that time the savings of civil and military servants have been invested either in government securities at a small interest or in banks which make their profit in the ordinary way by discounting bills of exchange and circulating their own notes for the purpose or by lending out their money at a high interest of or per cent to other members of the same services on the th of january we went on to horal ten miles over a plain with villages numerous and large and in every one some fine large building of olden timessarāi palace temple or tomb but all going to decay the population much more dense than in any of the native states i have seen villages larger and more numerous trade in the transit of cotton salt sugar and grain much brisker a great number of hares were here brought to us for sale at threepence apiece a rate at which they sell at this season in almost all parts of upper india where they are very numerous and very easily caught in nets notes kosī is twentyfive miles northwest of mathurā the story of the murder of mr fraser is fully detailed post in chapter after the execution of shamsud dīn the estate of the criminal was taken possession of by government and the town of fīrōzpur is now

mewātīs now supply men to a few robber gangs but are incapable of mischief on a large scale delhi was most nobly defended against holkār by a very small force under lieutenantcolonel burn who repelled an assault and defended a city ten miles in circumference and which had ever before been given up at the first appearance of an enemy at its gates the battle of dīg was fought on november by the division under the command of general fraser on the one side and holkārs infantry and artillery on the other the th led the way with its wonted alacrity and determination and forced its way into the

upwards of six hundred and forty killed and wounded including the brave commander who was mortally wounded andsurvived the victory only a few days on the night of november general lake in person routed holkār and his cavalry killing about three thousand men the english loss on this occasion amounted to only two men killed and about twenty wounded the fort of dīg with a hundred guns and a considerable quantity of ammunition and military stores was captured on december of the same year thornton history of british india pp nd ed transcription note this clause is not intelligible to the transcriber the character or i appears in the text some words appear to be missing the author was grievously mistaken in supposing that india did not require a particle of foreign capital the railways and the great tea coffee indigo and other industries built up and developed during the nineteenth century and still growing owe their existence to the hundreds of millions sterling of english capital poured into the country and could not possibly have been financed from indian resources the author seems not to have expected the construction of railways in india although when he wrote a beginning of the railway system in england had been made this sentiment is still potent and explains the eagerness often shown by wealthy landholders of high social rank to obtain official appointments which to the european mind seem unworthy of their acceptance few readers are likely to accept this proposition this clause is not intelligible to the editor the word revenue probably is a misprint for aristocracy the original edition prints no man considers himself less respectable which is nonsense this sentiment reads oddly in these days of social democracy and continual conflict between capital and labour the steady progress of islam in lower and eastern bengal first made apparent by the census of has been confirmed by the enumerations of and the feeling that the religion of the prophet gives its adherent a better position in both this world and the next than hinduism can offer to a lowcaste man is the most powerful motive for conversion see dr james wises valuable treatise the muhammadans of eastern bengal jasb part iii pp and the census reports from to the authors whimsical notion that a development of commercial and manufacturing organization in india would cause converts to flock from all parts and from all classes of the hindoo community has not been verified by experience much capital is now concentrated in the great cities and the number of cotton jute and other factories is considerable but christian converts are not among the goods produced the modern commercial houses bring a large proportion of their capital from europe the three presidency banks the bank

sv bank and paper currency much indian capital is now invested in jointstock companies of every kind more correctly hodal chapter transit duties in indiamode of collecting them at horal resides a collector of customs with two or three uncovenanted european assistants as patrol officers the rule now is to tax only the staple articles of produce from the west on their transit down into the valley of the jumna and ganges and to have only one line on which these articles shall be liable to duties they are free to pass everywhere else without search or molestation this has no doubt relieved the people of these provinces from an infinite deal of loss and annoyance inflicted upon them by the former system of levying the customs duties and that without much diminishing the net receipts of government from this branch of its revenues but the time may come when government will be constrained to raise a greater proportion of its collective revenues than it has hitherto done from indirect taxation and when this time comes the rule which confines the impost to a single line must of course be abandoned under the former system one great man with a very high salary was put in to preside over a host of native agents with very small salaries and without any responsible intermediate agent whatever to aid him and to watch over them the great man was selected without any reference to his knowledge of or fitness for the duties entrusted to him merely because he happened to be of a certain standing in a certain exclusive service which entitled him to a certain scale of salary or because he had been found unfit for judicial or other duties requiring more intellect and energy of character the consequence was that for every one rupee that went into the public treasury ten were taken by these harpies from the merchants or other people over whom they had or could pretend to have a right of search some irresponsible native officer who happened to have the confidence of the great man no matter in what capacity he served him sold for his own profit and for that of those whose goodwill he might think it worth while to conciliate the offices of all the subordinate agents immediately employed in the collection of the duties a man who was to receive an avowed salary of seven rupees a month would give him three or four thousand for his post because it would give him charge of a detached post in which he could soon repay himself with a handsome profit a poor peon who was to serve under others and could never hope for an independent charge would give five hundred rupees for an office which yielded him avowedly only four rupees a month all arrogated the right of search and the state of indian society and the climate were admirably suited to their purpose a person of any respectability would feel himself dishonoured were the females of his family to be seen much less touched while passing along the road in their palanquin or covered carnage and to save himself from such dishonour he was everywhere obliged to pay these customhouse officers many articles that pass in transit through india would suffer much damage from being opened along the road at any season and be liable to be spoiled altogether during that of the rains and these harpies could always make the merchants open them unless they paid liberally for their forbearance articles were rated to the duty according to their value and articles of the same weight were often of course of very different values these officers could always pretend that packages liable to injury from exposure contained within them among the articles set forth in the invoice others of greater value in proportion to their weight men who carried pearls jewels and other articles very valuable compared with their bulk always depended for their security from robbers and thieves on their concealment and there was nothing which they dreaded so much as the insolence and rapacity of these customhouse officers who made them pay large bribes or exposed their goods gangs of thieves had members in disguise at such stations who were soon able to discover through the insolence of the officers and the fears and entreaties of the merchants whether they had anything worth taking or not a party of thieves from datiyā in followed lord william bentincks camp to the bank of the river jumna near mathurā where they found a poor merchant humbly entreating an insolent customhouse officer not to insist upon his showing the contents of the little box he carried in his carriage lest it might attract the attention of thieves who were always to be found among the followers of such a camp and offering to give him anything reasonable for his forbearance nothing he could be got to offer would satisfy the rapacity of the man the box was taken out and opened it contained jewels which the poor man hoped to sell to advantage among the european ladies and gentlemen of the governorgenerals suite he replaced his box in his carriage but in half an hour it was travelling posthaste to datiyā by relays of thieves who had been posted along the road for such occasions they quarrelled about the division swords were drawn and wounds inflicted one of the gang ran off to the magistrate at sāgar with whom he had before been acquainted and he sent him back with a small party and a letter to the datiyā rājā requesting that he would get the box of jewels for the poor merchant the party took the precaution of searching the house of the thieves before they delivered the letter to their friend the minister and by this means recovered about half the jewels which amounted in all to about seven thousand rupees the merchant was agreeably surprised when he got back so much of his property through the magistrate of mathurā and confirmed the statement of the thief regarding the dispute with the customhouse officer which enabled them to discover the value of the box should government by and by extend the system that obtains in this single line to the customs all over india they maygreatly augment their revenue without any injury and with but little necessary loss and inconvenience to merchants the object of all just taxation is to make the subjects contribute to the public burthen in proportion to their means and with as little loss and inconvenience to themselves as possible the people who reside west of this line enjoy all their salt cotton and other articles which are taxed on crossing the line without the payment of any duties while those to the east of it are obliged to pay it is therefore not a just line the advantages are first that it interposes a body of most efficient officers between the mass of harpies and the heads of the department who now virtually superintend the whole system whereas they used formerly to do so merely ostensibly they are at once the tapis of prince husain and the telescope of prince alī they enable the heads of departments to be everywhere and see everything whereas before they were nowhere and saw nothing secondly it makes the great staple articles of general consumption alone liable to the payment of duties and thereby does away in a great measure with the odious right of search at kosī our friend charles fraser left us to proceed through mathurā to agra he is a very worthy man and excellent public officer one of those whom one always meets again with pleasure and of whose society one never tires mr wilmot the collector of customs and mr wright one of the patrol officers came to dine with us the wind blew so hard all day that the cook and khānsāmān butler were long in despair of being able to give us any dinner at all at last we managed to get a tent closed at every crevice to keep out the dust for a cookroom and they were thus able to preserve their masters credit which no doubt according to their notions depended altogether on the quality of his dinner notes the place is a small town in the gurgāon district panjāb the term uncovenanted may require explanation for readers not familiar with the details of indian administration the civil service of india commonly called indian civil service which supplies most of the higher administrative and judicial officers used to be known as the covenanted service because its members sign a covenant with the secretary of state all the other departmental servicespublic works postal and the restwere grouped together as uncovenanted in accordance with the report of the public service commission the terms covenanted and uncovenanted have been disused the text refers to what was known as the customs hedge before the establishment of the british supremacy each of the innumerable native jurisdictions levied transit duties on many kinds of goods at each of its frontiers to the infinite vexation of traders such duties were gradually abolished in british territory and few if any are now enforced by native states salt cannot be manufactured in british india without a licence and the salt formerly called inland customs department is charged with the duty of preventing the manufacture or sale of illicit salt in its later developments the customs hedge was used for the collection of the salt duty only sir john strachey took a leading part in its abolition to secure the levy of the duty on salt he writes there grew up gradually a monstrous system to which it would be almost impossible to find a parallel in any tolerably civilized country a customs line was established which stretched across the whole of india which in extended from the indus to the mahānadī in madras a distance of miles and it was guarded by nearly men and petty officers at an annual cost of it would have stretched from london to constantinople it consisted principally of an immense impenetrable hedge of thorny trees and bushes a similar line miles in length was maintained in the northeastern part of the bombay presidency from dohud to the runn of cutch in the salt duties were revised and the necessary arrangements with the native states were made with effect from the st april the whole customs line was abolished with the exception of a small portion on the indus sir j strachey the finances and public works of india london pp great mines of rock salt are worked near the indus most people who know india intimately are of opinion that indirect taxation is more suitable to the circumstances of the country than direct taxation for municipal purposes indirect taxation under the name of octroi is levied by most considerable towns and notwithstanding its inconveniences is far less unpopular and far more productive than any form of direct taxation the people have been accustomed to indirect taxation of divers kinds from the most remote times and hate income tax or any other direct impost however reasonable it may be in theory since the general customs duty is per cent ad valorem on commodities imported into british india by sea see ig vol iv chapter the above remarks on the suitability of indirect taxation for india are not intended as a defence of the barbarous device of the customs hedge which was indefensible that unsound system prevailed in all departments during the early years of the nineteenth century in bengal the monopoly of salt in one form or other dates at least from the establishment of the board of trade there in the strict monopoly of salt commenced in under a system of agencies the system introduced in continued in force with occasional modifications till when the several salt agencies were gradually abolished leaving the supply of salt whether by importations or excise manufacture to private enterprise since then for bengal proper the supply of the condiment has been obtained chiefly by importation but in part by private manufacture under a system of excise balfour cyclopaedia rd ed sv salt at present the salt department is controlled by a single commissioner with thegovernment of india the fee payable for a licence to manufacture salt is fifty rupees it is inaccurate to describe the limitation imposed on the manufacture of salt as a monopoly any one can sell salt but it can be made only under licence the author the same observations mutatis mutandis are applicable to the magistracy of the country and the remedy for all the great existing evils must be sought in the same means the interposition of a body of efficient officers between the magistrate and the thānadārs or present head police officers of small divisions w h s much has been done to carry out this advice the most efficient officers of the inland customs department alluded to in the text were the european or eurasian uncovenanted collectors of customs and their assistants the allusion to prince husain and prince alī refers to the wellknown tale in the arabian nights the story of prince ahmad and the fairy peribanu it is omitted i believe from lanes version chapter peasantry of india attached to no existing governmentwant of trees in upper india cause and consequencewells and groves what strikes one most after crossing the chambal is i think the improved size and bearing of the men they are much stouter and more bold and manly without being at all less respectful they are certainly a noble peasantry full of courage spirit and intelligence and heartily do i wish that we could adopt any system that would give our government a deep root in their affections or link their interests inseparably with its prosperity for with all its defects life property and character are certainly more secure and all their advantages more freely enjoyed under our government than under any other they have ever heard of or that exists at present in any other part of the country the eternal subdivision of the landed property reduces them too much to one common level and prevents the formation of that middle class which is the basis of all that is great and good in european societiesthe great vivifying spirit which animates all that is good above it in the community it is a singular fact that the peasantry and i may say the landed interest of the country generally have never been the friends of any existing government have never considered their interests and that of their government the same and consequently have never felt any desire for its success or its duration the towns and villages all stand upon high mounds formed of the debris of former towns and villages that have been accumulating most of them for thousands of years they are for the most part mere collections of wretched hovels built of frail materials and destined only for a brief period man wants but little here below nor wants that little long and certainly there is no climate in the world where man wants less than in this of india generally and upper india particularly the peasant lives in the open air and a house to him is merely a thing to eat and sleep in and to give him shelter in the storm which comes upon him but seldom and never in a pitiless shape the society of his friends he enjoys in the open air and he never furnishes his house for their reception or for display the peasantry of india in consequence of living and talking so much in the open air have all stentorian voices which they find it exceedingly difficult to modulate to our taste when they come into our rooms another thing in this part of india strikes a traveller from other partsthe want of groves of fruittrees around the villages and along the roads in every other part of india he can at every stage have his tents pitched in a grove of mangotrees that defend his followers from the direct rays of the sun in the daytime and from the cold dews at night but in the district above agra he may go for ten marches without getting the shelter of a grove in one the sikhs the marāthās the jāts and the pathāns destroyed them all during the disorders attending the decline of the muhammadan empire and they have never been renewed because no man could feel secure that they would be suffered to stand ten years a hindoo believes that his soul in the next world is benefited by the blessings and grateful feelings of those of his fellow creatures who unmolested eat the fruit and enjoy the shade of the trees he has planted during his sojourn in this world and unless he can feel assured that the traveller and the public in general will be permitted to do so he can have no hope of any permanent benefit from his good work it might as well be cut down as pass into the hands of another person who had no feeling of interest in the eternal repose of the soul of the planter that person would himself have no advantage in the next world from giving the fruit and the shade of the trees to the public since the prayers of those who enjoyed them would be offered for the soul of the planter and not for hishe therefore takes all their advantage to himself in this world and the planter and the public are defrauded our government thought they had done enough to encourage the renewal of these groves when by a regulation they gave to the present lessees of villages the privilege of planting them themselves or permitting others to plant them but where they held their leases for a term of only five years of course they would be unwilling to plant them they might lose their lease when the term expired or forfeit it before and the successor would have the land on which the trees stood and would be able to exclude the public if not the proprietor from the enjoyment of any of their advantages our government has in effect during the thirtyfive years that it has held the dominion of the northwestern provinces prohibited the planting of mango groves while the old ones are every year disappearing on the resumption of rentfree lands even the ground on which the finest of these groves stand has been recklessly resumed and the proprietors told me that they may keep the trees they have but cannot be allowed to renew them as the lands are become the property of government the lands of groves that have been the pride of families for a century and a half have been thus resumed government is not aware of the irreparable mischief they do the country they govern by such measures on my way back from meerut after the conversation already related with the farmer of a small village ante chapter text at my tents were one day pitched in the month of december amidst some very fine garden cultivation in the district of alīgarh and in the evening i walked out as usual to have some talk with the peasantry i came to aneighbouring well at which four pair of bullocks were employed watering the surrounding fields of wheat for the market and vegetables for the families of the cultivators four men were employed at the well and two more in guiding the water into the little embanked squares into which they divide their fields i soon discovered that the most intelligent of the four was a jāt and i had a good deal of conversation with him as he stood landing the leather buckets as the two pair of bullocks on his side of the well drew them to the top a distance of forty cubits from the surface of the water beneath who built this well i began it was built by one of my ancestors six generations ago how much longer will it last ten generations more i hope for it is now just as good as when first made it is of pakkā bricks without mortar cement how many waterings do you give if there should be no rain we shall require to give the land six waterings as the water is sweet had it been brackish four would do brackish water is better for wheat than sweet water but it is not so good for vegetables or sugarcane how many bīghās are watered from this well we water twenty bīghās or one hundred and five jarībs from this well and you pay the government how much one hundred rupees at the rate of five rupees the bīghā but only the five immediately around the well are mine the rest belong to others but the well belongs to you and i suppose you get from the proprietors of the other fifteen something for your water nothing there is more water for my five bīghās and i give them what they require gratis they acknowledge that it is a gift from me and that is all i want and what does the land beyond the range of your water of the same quality pay it pays at the rate of two rupees the bīghā and it is with difficulty that they can be made to pay that water sir is a great thing and with that and manure we get good crops from the land how many returns of the seed from these twenty bīghās with six waterings and cross ploughing and good manure we contrive to get twenty returns that is if god is pleased with us and blesses our efforts and you maintain your family comfortably out of the return from your five if they were mine i could but we had two or three bad seasons seven years ago and i was obliged to borrow eighty rupees from our banker at per cent for the subsistence of my family i have hardly been able to pay him the interest with all i can earn by my labour and i now serve him upon two rupees a month but that is not enough to maintain you and your family no but he only requires my services for half the day and during the other half i work with others to get enough for them and when do you expect to pay off your debt god only knows if i exert myself and keep a good nīyat pure mind or intentions he will enable me or my children to do so some day or other in the meantime he has my five bīghās of land in mortgage and i serve him in the cultivation but under those misfortunes you could surely venture to demand something from the proprietors of the other fifteen bīghās for the water of your well never sir it would be said all over the country that such an one sold gods water for his neighbours fields and i should be ashamed to show my face though poor and obliged to work hard and serve others i have still too much pride forthat how many bullocks are required for the tillage of these twenty bīghās watered from your well these eight bullocks do all the work they are dear now this was purchased the other day on the death of the old one for twentysix rupees they cost about fifty rupees a pairthe late famine has made them dear what did the well cost in making i have heard that it cost about one hundred and twenty rupees it would cost about that sum to make one of this kind in the present day not more how long have the families of your caste been settled in these parts about six or seven generations the country had before been occupied by a peasantry of the kalār caste our ancestors came built up mud fortifications dug wells and brought the country under cultivation it had been reduced to a waste for a long time we were obliged to follow the plough with our swords by our sides and our friends around us with their matchlocks in their hand and their matches lighted did the water in your well fail during the late seasons of drought no sir the water of this well never fails then how did bad seasons affect you my bullocks all died one after the other from want of fodder and i had not the means to till my lands subsistence became dear and to maintain my family i was obliged to contract the debt for which my lands are now mortgaged i work hard to get them back and if i do not succeed my children will i hope with the blessing of god the next morning i went on to kākā fifteen miles and finding tents people and cattle without a tree to shelter them i was much pleased to see in my neighbourhood a plantation of mango and other fruittrees it had i was told been planted only three years ago by hīrāman and mōtīrām and i sent for them knowing that they would be pleased to have their good work noticed by any european gentleman the trees are now covered with cones of thatch to shelter them from the frost the merchants came evidently much pleased and i had a good deal of talk with them who planted this new grove we planted it three years ago what did your well cost you and how many trees have you we have about four hundred trees and the well has cost us two hundred rupees and will cost us two hundred more how long will you require to water them we shall require to water the mango and other large trees ten or twelve years but the orange pomegranate and other small trees will always require watering what quantity of ground do the trees occupy they occupy twentytwo bīghās of one hundred and five jarībs we place them all twelve yards from each other that is the large trees and the small ones we plant between them how did you get the land we were many years trying in vain to get a grant from the government through the collector at last we got him to certify on paper that if the landholder would give us land to plant our grove upon the government would have no objection we induced the landholder who is a constituent of ours to grant us the land and we made our well and planted our trees you have done a good thing what reward do you expect we hope that those who enjoy the shade the water and the fruit will think kindly of us when they are gone the names of the great men who built the castles palaces and tombs at delhi and agra have been almost all forgotten because no one enjoys any advantage from them but the names of those who planted the few mango groves we see are still remembered and blessed by all who eat of their fruit sit in their shade and drink of their water from whatever part of the world they come even the european gentlemen remember their names with kindness indeed it was at the suggestion ofa european gentleman who was passing this place many years ago and talking with us as you are now that we commenced this grove look over this plain said he it has been all denuded of the fine groves with which it was no doubt once studded though it is tolerably well cultivated the traveller finds no shelter in it from the noonday suneven the birds seem to have deserted you because you refuse them the habitations they find in other parts of india we told him that we would have the grove planted and we have done so and we hope god will bless our undertaking the difficulty of getting land is i suppose the reason why more groves are not planted now that property is secure how could men plant without feeling secure of the land they planted upon and when government would not guarantee it the landholder could guarantee it only during the five years of lease and if at the end of that time government should transfer the lease of the estate to another the land of the grove would be transferred with it we plant not for worldly or immediate profits but for the benefit of our souls in the next worldfor the prayers of those who may derive benefit from our works when we are gone our landholders are good men and will never resume the lands they have given us and if the lands be sold at auction by government or transferred to others we hope the certificate of the collector will protect us from his grasp you like your present government do you not we like it much there has never been a government that gave so much security to life and property all we want is a little more of public service and a little more of trade but we have no cause to complain it is our own fault if we are not happy but i have been told that the people find the returns from the soil diminishing and attribute it to the perjury that takes place in our courts occasionally that sir is no doubt true there has been a manifest falling off in the returns and people everywhere think that you make too much use of the korān and the ganges water in your courts god does not like to hear lies told upon one or other and we are apt to think that we are all punished for the sins of those who tell them may we ask sir what office you hold it is my office to do the work which god assigns to me in this world the work of god sir is the greatest of all works and those are fortunate who are chosen to do it their respect for me evidently increased when they took me for a clergyman i was dressed in black in the first place it is my duty to tell you that god does not punish the innocent for the guilty and that the perjury in courts has nothing to do with the diminution of returns from the soil where you apply water and manure and alternate your crops you always get good returns do you not very good returns but we have had several bad seasons that have carried away the greater part of our population but a small portion of our lands can be irrigated for want of wells and we had no rain for two or three years or hardly any in due season and it was this deficiency of rain which the people thought a chastisement from heaven but the wells were not dried up were they no and the people whose fields they watered had good returns and high prices for produce yes they had but their cattle died for want of food for there was no grass any where to be found still they were better off than those who had no wells to draw water from for their fields and the only way to provide against such evils in future is to have a well for every field god has given you the fields and he has given you the water and when it does not come from the clouds you must draw it from your wells true sir very true but the people are very poor and have not the means to form the wells they require and if they borrow the money from you you charge them with interest from one to two per cent a month according to their character and circumstances but interest is very often merely nominal and we are in most cases glad to get back the principal alone and what security have you for the land of your grove in case the landholder should change his mind or die and leave sons not so well disposedin the first place we hold his bonds for a debt of nine thousand rupees which he owes us and which we have no hopes of his ever paying in the next we have on stamped paper his deed of gift in which he declares that he has given us the land and that he and his heirs for ever shall be bound to make good the rents should government sell the estate for arrears of revenue we wanted him to write this document in the regular form of a deed of sale but he said that none of his ancestors had ever yet sold their lands and that he would not be the first to disgrace his family or record their disgrace on stamped paperit should he was resolved be a deed of gift but of course you prevailed upon him to take the price yes we prevailed upon him to take two hundred rupees for the land and got his receipt for the same indeed it is so mentioned in the deed of gift but still the landlord who is a near relation of the late chief of hatrās would persist in having the paper made out as a deed not of sale but of gift god knows whether after all our grove will be securewe must run the risk now we have begun upon it notes this phrase is misleading there is no want of trees in upper india generally only certain limited areas are ill wooded most of the districts in the plains of the ganges and jumna are well wooded this is a favourite doctrine of the author often reiterated the absence of a powerful middle class is a characteristic not of india only but of all oriental despotisms and the subdivision of landed property is only one of the causes of the nonexistence of such a class this is quite true the rural population want two things first a light assessment secondly the minimum of official interference they do not care a straw who the ruler is and they like best that ruler be his name or nationality what it may who worries them least and takes least money from them goldsmith the hermit in chapter of the vicar of wakefield groves are still scarce in the agra country but much planting has been done on the roads gorakhpur azamgarh and some other districts forming half of the old province of oudh ceded by the ruler of oudh in were long known as the ceded provinces the western districts of the northwestern provinces known as the conquered provinces were taken from the marāthās in the province of benares became british territory in the hill districts of the kumaun division were annexed in at the close of the war with nepal all the regions named are now included in the agra province of the united provinces of agra and oudh in which the editor served for twentynine years the authors remarks are not readily intelligible to readers unversed in the technicalities of indian revenue administration the author writes on the assumption that government was the proprietor of the soil while he was writing the settlements under regulation ix of were in progress those settlements or revenue contracts were ordinarily sanctioned for periods of thirty years and the landholders whom the author calls lessees have gradually changed into proprietors with full power over their land subject only to the state lien for the land revenue crown rent or state share of the produce and to the laws of inheritance and succession the resumption of rentfree lands simply means the subjection of those lands to the payment of land revenue it is inaccurate to say that the lands are become the property of government by reason of their being assessed even when land generally was regarded as the property of the state and the landholders were considered to be only lessees no objection would have been made to the planting of groves if payment of the land revenue had been continued for the planted area as for cultivated land now that landholders have been recognized as proprietors there is nothing to prevent them from planting as much land as they like with trees although the state has not always been willing to exempt the whole planted area from assessment no one ever objected to the renewal of trees except on the ground that the area under trees might be excluded from assessment for many years past the government of india has been most anxious to encourage treeplanting and has sanctioned liberal rules respecting the exemption of grove land from assessment to land revenue or rent as the author calls it the government of the united provinces certainly is not now liable to reproach for indifference to the value of groves enormous progress in the planting of road avenues has also been made the deficiency of trees in the country about agra is partly due to nature much of the ground being cut up by ravines and unfavourable for planting the alīgarh district lies to the north and east of the mathurā district the fort of alīgarh is fiftyfive miles north of agra and eightyfour miles southeast of delhi pakkā here means burned in a kiln as distinguished from sundried the bīghā is the unit of superficial land measure varying but often taken as fiveeighths of an acre the jarīb is a smaller measure the rules now in force require assessing officers to make allowance for permanent improvements such as the well described in the text so as to give the fair benefit of the improvement to the maker in the early settlements this important matter was commonly neglected tolerable bullocks fit for use at the well and in the plough would now cost much more this conversation appears to have taken place in the year the famine alluded to is that of this conversation gives a very vivid and truthful picture of rural life in northern india most revenue officers have held similar conversations with rustics but the author is almost the only writer on indian affairs who has perceived that exact notes of casual chats in the fields would be found interesting and valuable the early settlements were made for short terms the certificate would not be of much avail in a civil court the alīgarh district is now irrigated by canals this is the lenders view of his business the borrowers might have a different story chapter public spirit of the hindoostree cultivation and suggestions for extending it i may here be permitted to introduce as something germane to the matter of the foregoing chapter a recollection of jubbulpore although we are now far past that locality my tents are pitched where they have often been before on the verge of a very large and beautiful tank in a fine grove of mangotrees and close to a handsome temple there are more handsome temples and buildings for accommodation on the other side of the tank but they are gone sadly out of repair the bank all round this noble tank is beautifully ornamented by fine banyan and pīpal trees between which and the waters edge intervene numerous clusters of the graceful bamboo these works were formed about eighty years ago by a respectable agricultural capitalist who resided at this place and died about twenty years after they were completed no relation of his can now be found in the district and not one in a thousand of those who drink of the water or eat of the fruit knows to whom he is indebted there are round the place some beautiful bāolīs or large wells with flights of stone steps from the top to the waters edge imbedded in clusters of beautiful trees they were formed about the same time for the use of the public by men whose grandchildren have descended to the grade of cultivators of the soil or belted attendants upon the present native collectors without the means of repairing any of the injury which time is inflicting upon these magnificent works three or four young pīpaltrees have begun to spread their delicate branches and pale green leaves rustling in the breeze from the dome of this fine temple which these infant herculeses hold in their deadly grasp and doom to inevitable destruction pigeons deposit the seeds of the pīpaltree on which they chiefly feed in the crevices of buildings no hindoo dares and no christian or muhammadan will condescend to lop off the heads of these young trees and if they did it would only put off the evil and inevitable day for such are the vital powers of their roots when they have once penetrated deeply into a building that they will send out their branches again cut them off as often as you may and carry on their internal attack with undiminished vigour no wonder that superstition should have consecrated this tree delicate and beautiful as it is to the gods the palace the castle the temple and the tomb all those works which man is most proud to raise to spread and to perpetuate his name crumble to dust beneath her withering grasp she rises triumphant over them all in her lofty beauty bearing high in air amidst her light green foliage fragments of the wreck she has made to show the nothingness of mans greatest efforts while sitting at my tentdoor looking out upon this beautiful sheet of water and upon all the noble works around me i thought of the charge so often made against the people of this fine land of the total want of public spirit among them by those who have spent their indian days in the busy courts of law and still more busy commercial establishments of our great metropolis if by the term public spirit be meant a disposition on the part of individuals to sacrifice their own enjoyments or their own means of enjoyment for the common good there is perhaps no people in the world among whom it abounds so much as among the people of india to live in the grateful recollections of their countrymen for benefits conferred upon them in great works of ornament and utility is the study of every hindoo of rank and property such works tend in his opinion not only to spread and perpetuate his name in this world but through the good wishes and prayers of those who are benefited by them to secure the favour of the deity in the next according to their notions every drop of rainwater or dew that falls to the ground from the green leaf of a fruittree planted by them for the common good proves a refreshing draught for their souls in the next world when no descendant remains to pour the funeral libations in their name the water from the trees they have planted for the public good is destined to supply its place everything judiciously laid out to promote the happiness of their fellow creatures will in the next world be repaid to them tenfold by the deity in marching over the country in the hot season we every morning find our tents pitched on the green sward amid beautiful groves of fruittrees with wells of pakkā brick or stone masonry built at great expense and containing the most delicious water but how few of us ever dream of asking at whose cost the trees that afford us and our followers such agreeable shade were planted or the wells that afford us such copious streams of fine water in the midst of dry arid plains were formed we go on enjoying all the advantages which arise from the noble public spirit that animates the people of india to benevolent exertions without once calling in question the truth of the assertion of our metropolitan friends that the people of india have no public spirit mānmōr a respectable merchant of mirzapore who traded chiefly in bringing cotton from the valley of the nerbudda and southern india through jubbulpore to mirzapore and in carrying back sugar and spices in return learning how muchtravellers on this great road suffered from the want of water near the hiliyā pass under the vindhya range of hills commenced a work to remedy the evil in not a drop of wholesome water was to be found within ten miles of the bottom of the pass where the laden bullocks were obliged to rest during the hot months when the greatest thoroughfare always took place mānmōr commenced a large tank and garden and had laid out about twenty thousand rupees in the work when he died his son lalū mānmōr completed the work soon after his fathers death at a cost of eighty thousand rupees more that travellers might enjoy all the advantages that his good old father had benevolently intended for them the tank is very large always full of fine water even in the driest part of the dry season with flights of steps of cut freestone from the waters edge to the top all round a fine garden and shrubbery with temples and buildings for accommodations are attached with an establishment of people to attend and keep them in order all the country around this magnificent work was a dreary solitudethere was not a human habitation within many miles on any side tens of thousands who passed this road every year were blessing the name of the man who had created it where it was so much wanted when the new road from the nerbudda to mirzapore was made by the british government to descend some ten miles to the north of it as many miles were saved in the distance by the new cut and the passage down made comparatively easy at great cost travellers forsook the hiliyā road and poor mānmōrs work became comparatively useless i brought the work to the notice of lord william bentinck who in passing mirzapore some time after sent for the son and conferred upon him a rich dress of honour of which he has ever since been extremely proud hundreds of works like this are undertaken every year for the benefit of the public by benevolent and unostentatious individuals who look for their reward not in the applause of newspapers and public meetings but in the grateful prayers and good wishes of those who are benefited by them and in the favour of the deity in the next world for benefits conferred upon his creatures in this what the people of india want is not public spirit for no men in the world have more of it than the hindoos but a disposition on the part of private individuals to combine their efforts and means in effecting great objects for the public good with this disposition they will be in time inspired under our rule when the enemies of all settled governments may permit us to divert a little of our intellect and our revenue from the duties of war to those of peace in the year while i held the civil charge of the district of jubbulpore in this valley of the nerbudda i caused an estimate to be made of the public works of utility and ornament it contained the population of the district at that time amounted to souls distributed among occupied towns villages and hamlets there were villages more which had formerly been occupied but were then deserted there were tanks bāolīs or large wells with flights of steps extending from the top down to the water when in its lowest stage wells lined with brick and stone cemented with lime but without stairs hindoo temples and muhammadan mosques the estimated cost of these works in grain at the present price had the labour been paid in kind at the ordinary rate was r sterling the labourer was estimated to be paid at the rate of about twothirds the quantity of corn he would get in england if paid in kind and corn sells here at about onethird the price it fetches in average seasons in england in europe therefore these works supposing the labour equally efficient would have cost at least four times the sum here estimated and such works formed by private individuals for the public good without any view whatever to return in profits indicate a very high degree of public spirit the whole annual rent of the lands of this district amounts to r sterling that is demandable by the government and by those who hold the lands at lease immediately under government over and above what may be considered as the profits of their stock as farmers these works must therefore have cost about thirteen times the amount of the annual rent of the whole of the lands of the district or the whole annual rent for above thirteen years but i have not included the groves of mango and tamarind and other fine trees with which the district abounds twothirds of the towns and villages are imbedded in fine groves of these trees mixed with the banyan ficus indica and the pīpal ficus religiosa i am sorry they were not numbered but i should estimate them at three thousand and the outlay upon a mango grove is on an average about four hundred rupees the groves of fruittrees planted by individuals for the use of the public without any view to a return in profit would in this district according to this estimate have cost twelve lākhs more or about twice the amount of the annual rent of the whole of the lands it should be remarked that the whole of these works had been formed under former governments ours was established in the year the upper doāb and the delhi territories were denuded of their trees in the wars that attended the decline and fall of the muhammadan empire and the rise and progress of the sikhs jāts and marāthās in that quarter these lawless freebooters soon swept all the groves from the face of every country they occupied with their troops and they never attempted to renew them or encourage the renewal we have not been much more sparing and the finest groves of fruittrees have everywhere been recklessly swept down by our barrackmasters to furnish fuel for their brickkilns and i am afraid little or no encouragement is given for planting others to supply their place in those parts of india where they are most wanted we have a regulation authorizing the lessee of a village to plant a grove in his grounds but where the settlements of the landrevenue have been for short periods as in all upper and central india this authority is by no means sufficient to induce them to invest their property in such works it gives no sufficient guarantee that the lessee for the next settlement shall respect a grant made by his predecessors and every grove of mangotrees requires outlay and care for at least ten years though a man destines the fruit the shade and the water for the use of the public he requires to feel that it will be held for the public in his name and by his children and descendants and never be exclusively appropriated by any man in power for his own use if the lands were still to belong to the lessee of the estate under government and the trees only to the planter and his heirs he to whom the land belonged might very soon render the property in the trees of no value to the planter or his heirs if government wishes the upper doāb the delhi mathurā and agra districts again enriched and embellished with mango groves they will not delay to convey this feeling to the hundreds nay thousands who would be willing to plant them upon a single guarantee that the lands upon which the trees stand shall be considered to belong to them and their heirs as long as these trees stand upon them that the land the shade the fruit and the water will be left to the free enjoyment of the public we may take for granted since the good which the planters soul is to derive from such a work in the next world must depend upon their being so and all that is required to be stipulated in such grants is that mango tamarind pīpal or bar ie banyan trees at the rate of twentyfive the english acre shall be planted and kept up in every piece of land granted for the purpose and that a well of pakkā masonry shall be made for the purpose of watering them in the smallest as well as in the largest piece of ground granted and kept always in repair if the grantee fulfil the conditions he ought in order to cover part of the expense to be permitted to till the land under the trees till they grow to maturity and yield their fruit if he fails the lands having been declared liable to resumption should be resumed the person soliciting such grants should be required to certify in his application that he had already obtained the sanction of the present lessee of the village in which he wishes to have his grove and for this sanction he would of course have to pay the full value of the land for the period of his lease when his lease expires the land in which the grove is planted would be excluded from the assessment and when it is considered that every good grove must cost the planter more than fifty times the annual rent of the land government may be satisfied that they secure the advantage to their people at a very cheap rate over and above the advantage of fruit water and shade for the public these groves tend much to secure the districts that are well studded with them from the dreadful calamities that in india always attend upon deficient falls of rain in due season they attract the clouds and make them deposit their stores in districts that would not otherwise be blessed with them and hot and dry countries denuded of their trees and by that means deprived of a great portion of that moisture to which they had been accustomed and which they require to support vegetation soon become dreary and arid wastes the lighter particles which formed the richest portion of their soil blow off and leave only the heavy arenaceous portion and hence perhaps those sandy deserts in which are often to be found the signs of a population once very dense in the mauritius the rivers were found to be diminishing under the rapid disappearance of the woods in the interior when government had recourse to the measure of preventing further depredations and they soon recovered their size the clouds brought up from the southern ocean by the southeast trade wind are attracted as they pass over the island by the forests in the interior and made to drop their stores in daily refreshing showers in many other parts of the world governments have now become aware of this mysterious provision of nature and have adopted measures to take advantage of it for the benefit of the people and the dreadful sufferings to which the people of those of our districts which have been the most denuded of their trees have been of late years exposed from the want of rain in due season may perhaps induce our indian government to turn its thoughts to the subject the province of mālwā which is bordered by the nerbudda on the south gujarāt on the west rājputāna on the north and allahabad on the east is said never to have been visited by a famine and this exemption from so great a calamity must arise chiefly from its being so well studded with hills and groves the natives have a couplet which like all good couplets on rural subjects is attributed to sahadēo one of the five demigod brothers of the mahābhārata to this effect if it does not thunder on such a night you father must go to mālwā and i to gujarāt meaning the rains will fail us here and we must go to those quarters where they never fail notes the archaeological survey is engaged in unceasing battle with the pīpal seedlings this proposition is too general the hiliyā or haliyā pass

upon the old high road leading to mirzapore is a still more magnificent tank with one of the most beautiful temples in india all executed two or three generations ago at the expense of two or three lakhs of rupees for the benefit of the public by a very worthy man who became rich in the service of the former government his descendants all save one now follow the plough and that one has a small rentfree village held on condition of appropriating the rents to the repair of the tank w h s the name talwā is only the rustic way of pronouncing tāl meaning the tank gosalpur is nineteen miles northeast of jabalpur two or three lakhs of rupees were then in eighteenth century worth about to sterling india except on the frontiers has been at peace since and much revenue has been spent on the duties of peace but the power of combination for public objects has developed among the people to a less degree than the author seems to have expected though some development undoubtedly has taken place in the original edition these statistics are given in words figures have been used in this edition as being more readily grasped the central provinces gazetteer gives the following figures area of district square miles population villages wells in use the gazetteer figures apparently include wells of all kinds and do not reckon hamlets separately wells are of course an absolute necessity and their construction could not be avoided in a country occupied by a fixed population the number of temples and mosques was very small for so large a population many of the tanks too are indispensably necessary for watering the cattle employed in agriculture the bāolīs may fairly be reckoned as the fruit of the public spirit of individuals this chapter is a reprint of a paper entitled on the public spirit of the hindoos see bibliography ante no the cp gazetteer states that in the landrevenue was r as compared with r in the authors time it has since been largely enhanced the lessees zamīndārs have now become proprietors and the landrevenue according to the rule in force for many years past should not exceed half the estimated profit rental the early settlements were made in accordance with the theory of native governments that the land is the property of the state and that the lessees are entitled only to subsistence with a small percentage as payment for the trouble of collection from the actual cultivators the authors estimate gives the zamīndārs only ths or ths of the profit rental the people of the jubbulpore district must have been very different from those of the rest of india if they planted their groves solely for the public benefit the editor has never known the fruit not to mention the timber and firewood of a grove to be available for the use of the general public universal custom allows all comers to use the shade of any established grove but the fruit is always jealousy guarded and gathered by the owners even one tree is often the property of many sharing and disputes about the division of mangoes and other fruits are extremely frequent the framing of a correct record of rights in trees is one of the most embarrassing tasks of a revenue officer under the modern system it often happens that the land belongs to one party and the trees to another disputes of course occur but as a rule the rights of the owner of the trees are not interfered with by the owner of the land in thousands of such cases both parties exercise their rights without friction this sentence shows clearly how remote from the authors mind was the idea of private property in land in india government has long since parted with the power of giving grants such as the author recommends the upper doāb districts of meerut muzaffarnagar and sahāranpur now have plenty of groves the cost of establishing a grove varies much according to circumstances of which the distance of water from the surface is the most important where water is distant the cost of constructing and working a well is very high where water is near these items of expense are small because the roots of the trees soon reach a moist stratum and candispense with irrigation the author in his appreciation of the value of arboriculture and forest conservancy was far in advance of his angloindian contemporaries a modern meteorologist might object to some of his phraseology but the substance of his remarks is quite sound his statement of the ways in which trees benefit climate is incomplete one important function performed by the roots of trees is the raising of water from the depths below the surface to be dispersed by the leaves in the form of vapour trees act beneficially in many other ways also which it would be tedious to specify the indian government long remained blind to the importance of the duty of saving the country from denudation the first forest conservancy establishments were organized in for madras and burma and by act vii of the forest department was established on a legal basis its operations have since been largely extended and trained foresters are now sent out each year to india the department at the present time controls many thousand square miles of forest the reader may consult the article forests in balfour cyclopaedia rd ed and sundry official reports for further details a yearly grant for arboriculture is now made to every district thousands of miles of roads have been lined with trees and multitudes of groves have been established by both government and private individuals the author was himself a great treeplanter in a letter dated th december he describes the avenue which he had planted along the road from maihar to jubbulpore in and and another eightysix miles long from jhānsī ghāt on the nerbudda to chāka the trees planted were banyan pīpal mango tamarind and jāman eugenia jambolana he remarks that these trees will last for centuries in mālwā suffered from a severe famine such as had not visited this favoured spot for more than thirty years the people were unused to and quite unprepared for this calamity the distress being aggravated by the great influx of immigrants from rājputāna who had hitherto always been sure of relief in this region of which the fertility is proverbial in a new calamity appeared in the shape of plague which has seriously reduced the agricultural population in some districts ig xvii chapter cities and

establishments at a place no sooner passes away than the place is deserted and goes to ruin as a matter of course such is the history of nineveh babylon and all cities which have owed their origin and support entirely to the public establishments of the sovereignany revolution that changed the seat of government depopulated a city sir thomas roe the ambassador of james the first of england to the court of delhi during the reign of jahāngīr passing through some of the old capital cities of western india then deserted and in ruins writes to the archbishop of canterbury i know not by what policy the emperors seek the ruin of all the ancient cities which were nobly built but now be desolate and in rubbish it must arise from a wish to destroy all the ancient cities in order that there might appear nothing great to have existed before their time but these cities like all which are supported in the same manner by the residence of a court and its establishments become deserted as the seat of dominion is changed nineveh built by ninus out of the spoils he brought back from the wide range of his conquests continued to be the residence of the court and the principal seat of its military establishments for thirteen centuries to the reign of sardanapalus during the whole of this time it was the practice of the sovereigns to collect from all the provinces of the empire their respective quotas of troops and to canton them within the city for one year at the expiration of which they were relieved by fresh troops in the last years of sardanapalus four provinces of the empire media persia babylonia and arabia are said to have furnished a quota of four hundred thousand and in the rebellion which closed his reign these troops were often beaten by those from the other provinces of the empire which could not have been much less in number the successful rebel arbaces transferred the court and his own appendages to its capital and nineveh became deserted and for more than eighteen centuries lost to the civilized world babylon in the same manner and susa ecbatana persepolis and seleucia all one after the other became deserted as sovereigns changed their residence and with it the seats of their public establishments which alone supported them thus thebes became deserted for memphis memphis for alexandria and alexandria for cairo as the sovereigns of egypt changed theirs and thus it has always been in india where cities have been almost all founded on the same basesthe residence of princes and their public establishments civil military or ecclesiastical the city of kanauj on the ganges when conquered by mahmūd of ghaznī is stated by the historians of the conqueror to have contained a standing army of five hundred thousand infantry with a due proportion of cavalry and elephants thirty thousand shops for the sale of pān alone and sixty thousand families of opera girls the pān dealers and opera girls were part and parcel of the court and its public establishments and as much dependent on the residence of the sovereign as the civil military and ecclesiastical officers who ate their pān and enjoyed their dancing and music and this great city no sooner ceased to be the residence of the sovereign the great proprietor of all the lands in the country than it became deserted after the establishment of the muhammadan dominion in india almost all the hindoo cities within the wide range of their conquest became deserted as the necessary consequence as the military establishments were all destroyed or disbanded and the religions establishments scattered their lands confiscated their idols broken and their temples either reduced to ruins in the first ebullition of fanatical zeal or left deserted and neglected to decay from want of those revenues by which alone they had been or could be supported the towns and cities of the roman empire which owed their origin to the same cause the residence of governors and their legions or other public establishments resisted similar shocks with more endurance because they had most of them ceased to depend upon the causes in which they originated and began to rest upon other bases when destroyed by wave after wave of barbarian conquest they were restored for the most part by the residence of church dignitaries and their establishments and the military establishments of the new order of things instead of remaining as standing armies about the courts of princes dispersed after every campaign like militia to enjoy the fruits of the lands assigned for their maintenance when alone they could be enjoyed in the rude state to which society had been reducedupon the lands themselves for some time after the muhammadan conquest of india that part of it which was brought effectually under the new dominion can hardly be considered to have had more than one city with its dependent towns and villages because the emperor chose to concentrate the greater part of his military establishments around the seat of his residence and thisgreat city became deserted whenever he thought it necessary or convenient to change that seat but when the emperor began to govern his distant provinces by viceroys he was obliged to confide to them a share of his military establishments the only public establishments which a conqueror thought it worth while to maintain and while they moved about in their respective provinces the imperial camp became fixed the great officers of state enriched by the plunder of conquered provinces began to spend their wealth in the construction of magnificent works for private pleasure or public convenience in time the viceroys began to govern their provinces by means of deputies who moved about their respective districts and enabled their masters the viceroys of provinces to convert their camps into cities which in magnificence often rivalled that of the emperor their master the deputies themselves in time found that they could govern their respective districts from a central point and as their camps became fixed in the chosen spots towns of considerable magnitude rose and sometimes rivalled the capitals of the viceroys the muhammadans had always a greater taste for architectural magnificence as well in their private as in their public edifices than the hindoos who sought the respect and good wishes of mankind through the medium of groves and reservoirs diffused over the country for their benefit whenever a muhammadan camp was converted into a town or city almost all the means of individuals were spent in the gratification of this taste their wealth in money and movables would be on their death at the mercy of their princetheir offices would be conferred on strangers tombs and temples canals bridges and caravanserais gratuitously for the public good would tend to propitiate the deity and conciliate the goodwill of mankind and might also tend to the advancement of their children in the service of their sovereign the towns and cities which rose upon the sites of the standing camps of the governors of provinces and districts in india were many of them as much adorned by private and public edifices as those which rose upon the standing camps of the muhammadan conquerors of spain standing camps converted into towns and cities it became in time necessary to fortify with walls against any surprise under any sudden ebullition among the conquered people and fortifications and strong garrisons often suggested to the bold and ambitions governors of distant provinces attempts to shake off the imperial yoke that portion of the annual revenue which had hitherto flowed in copious streams of tribute to the imperial capital was now arrested and made to augment the local establishments adorn the cities and enrich the towns of the viceroys now become the sovereigns of independent kingdoms the lieutenantgovernors of these new sovereigns possessed of fortified towns in their turn often shook off the yoke of their masters in the same manner and became in their turn the independent sovereigns of their respective districts the whole resources of the countries subject to their rule being employed to strengthen and improve their condition they soon became rich and powerful kingdoms adorned with splendid cities and populous towns since the public establishments of the sovereigns among whom all the revenues were expended spent all they received in the purchase of the produce of the land and labour of the surrounding country which required no other market thus the successful rebellion of one viceroy converted southern india into an independent kingdom and the successful rebellion of his lieutenantgovernors in time divided it into four independent kingdoms each with a standing army of a hundred thousand men and adorned with towns and cities of great strength and magnificence but they continued to depend upon the causes in which they originatedthe public establishments of the sovereign and when the emperor akbar and his successors aided by their own sic intestine wars had conquered these sovereigns and again reduced their kingdoms to tributary provinces almost all these cities and towns became depopulated as the necessary consequence the public establishments were again moving about with the courts and camps of the emperor and his viceroys and drawing in their train all those who found employment and subsistence in contributing to their efficiency and enjoyment it was not as our ambassador in the simplicity of his heart supposed the disinclination of the emperors to see any other towns magnificent save those in which they resided which destroyed them but their ambition to reduce all independent kingdoms to tributary provinces notes january a small town thirtysix miles south of delhi situated in

prayāg and many other important hindoo cities were never deserted and continued to be populous through all vicissitudes it is true that in most places the principal temples were desecrated or

this proposition which is not true of southern india at all applies only to secular buildings in northern india the temples of khajurāho mount abū and numberless other places equal in magnificence the architecture of the muhammadans or indeed that of any people in the world the anthors remarks seem likely to convey wrong notions very few of the capitals of the muhammadan viceroys and governors were new foundations nearly all of them were ancient hindoo towns adopted as convenient official residences and enlarged and beautified by the new rulers much of the old beauties being at the same time destroyed fyzabad certainly was a new foundation of the nawāb wazīrs of oudh but it lies so close to the extremely ancient city of ajodhya that it should rather be regarded as a muhammadan extension

and dined with us they complained sadly of the solitude to which they were condemned but admitted that they should not be able to get through half so much business were they placed at a large station and exposed to all the temptations and distractions of a gay and extensive circle nor feel the same interest in their duties or sympathy with the people as they do when thrown among them in this manner to give young men good feelings towards the natives the only good way is to throw them among them at those outstations in the early part of their career when all their feelings are fresh about them this holds good as well with the military as the civil officer but more especially with the latter a young officer at an outpost with his corps or part of it for the first season or two commonly lays in a store of good feeling towards his men that lasts him for life and a young gentleman of the civil service lays in in the same manner a good store of sympathy and fellow feeling with the natives in general mr gubbins is the magistrate and collector of one of the three districts into which the delhi territories are divided and he has charge of fīrōzpur the resumed estate of the late nawāb shamsuddīn which yields a net revenue of about two hundred thousand rupees a year i have already stated that this nawāb took good care that his mewātī plunderers should not rob within his own estate but he not only gave them free permission to rob over the surrounding districts of our territory but encouraged them to do so that he might share in their booty he was a handsome young man and an extremely agreeable companion but a most unprincipled and licentious character no man who was reputed to have a handsome wife or daughter was for a moment safe within his territories the following account of mr william frasers assassination by this nawāb may i think be relied upon the fīrōzpur jāgīr was one of the principalities created under the principle of lord cornwalliss second administration which was to make the security of the british dominions dependent upon the divisions among the independent native chiefs upon their frontiers the person receiving the grant or confirmation of such principality from the british government pledged himself to relinquish all claims to aid and to maintain the peace in his own possessions fīrōzpur was conferred by lord lake in upon ahmad baksh for his diplomatic services out of the territories acquired by us west of the jumna during the marāthā wars he had been the agent on the part of the hindoo chiefs of alwar in attendance upon lord lake during the whole of that war he was a great favourite and his lordships personal regard for him was thought by those chiefs to have been so favourable to their cause that they conferred upon him the pargana of lohārū in hereditary rentfree tenure in ahmad baksh declared shamsuddīn his eldest son his heir with the sanction of the british government and the rājās of alwar in february shamsuddīn at the request of his father by a formal deed assigned over the pargana of lohārū as a provision for his younger brothers by another mother amīnuddīn and ziā uddīn and in october he was finally invested by his father with the management and the circumstance was notified to the british government through the resident at delhi sir charles metcalfe ahmad baksh died in october disputes soon after arose between the brothers and they expressed a desire to submit their claims to the arbitration of sir edward colebrooke who had succeeded sir charles metcalfe in the residency of delhi he referred the matter to the supreme government and by their instructions under date th of april he was authorized to adjust the matter he decided that shamsuddīn should make a complete and unencumbered cession to his younger brothers of the pargana of lohārū without the reservation of any right of interference in the management or of any condition of obedience to himself whatever and that amīnuddīn should till his younger brother came of age pay into the delhi treasury for him the annual sum of five thousand two hundred and ten rupees as his half share of the net proceeds to be there held in deposit for him and that the estate should from the time he came of age be divided between them in equal shares this award was confirmed by government but sir edward was recommended to alter it for an annual money payment to the two younger brothers if he could do so with the consent of the parties the pargana was transferred as the money payment could not be agreed upon and in september mr martin who had succeeded sir e colebrooke proposed to government that the pargana of lohārū should be restored to shamsuddīn in lieu of a fixed sum of twentysix thousand rupees a year to be paid by him annually to his two younger brothers this proposal was made on the ground that amīnuddīn could not collect the revenues from the refractory landholders instigated no doubt by the emissaries of shamsuddīn and consequently could not pay his younger brothers revenue into the treasury in calculating the annual net revenue of rupees of the gross revenue had been estimated as the annual expenses of the mutual sic establishments of the two brothers to the arrangement proposed by mr martin the younger brothers strongly objected and proposed in preference to make over the pargana to the british government on condition of receiving the net revenue whatever might be the amount mr martin was desired bythe governorgeneral to effect this arrangement should amīnuddīn appear still to wish it but he preferred retaining the management of it in his own hands in the hope that circumstances would improve shamsuddīn however pressed his claim to the restoration of the pargana so often that it was at last in september insisted upon by government on the ground that amīnuddīn had failed to fulfil that article of the agreement which bound him to pay annually into the delhi treasury rupees for his younger brother though that brother had never complained on the contrary lived with him on the best possible terms and was as averse as himself to the retransfer of the pargana on condition that they gave up their claims to a large share of the movable property of their late father which had been already decided in their favour in the court of first instance mr w fraser who had succeeded to the office of governorgenerals representative in the delhi territories remonstrated strongly against this measure and wished to bring it again under the consideration of government on the grounds that ziāuddīn had never made any complaint against his brother amīnuddīn for want of punctuality in the payment of his share of the net revenue after the payment of their mutual establishments that the two brothers would be deprived by this measure of an hereditary estate to the value of sixty thousand rupees a year in perpetuity burthened with the condition that they relinquished a suit already gained in the court of first instance and likely to be gained in appeal involving a sum that would of itself yield them that annual sum at the moderate interest of per cent the grounds alleged by him were not considered valid and the pargana was made over to shamsud dīn the pargana now yields rupees a year and under good management may yield at mr frasers recommendation amīnuddīn went himself to calcutta and is said to have prevailed upon the government to take his case again into their consideration shamsud dīn had become a debauched and licentious character and having criminal jurisdiction within his own estate no ones wife or daughter was considered safe for when other means failed him he did not scruple to employ assassins to effect his hated purposes by removing the husband or father mr fraser became so disgusted with his conduct that he would not admit him into his house when he came to delhi though he had it may be said brought him up as a child of his own indeed he had been as fond of him as he could be of a child of his own and the boy used to spend the greater part of his time with him one day after mr fraser had refused to admit the nawāb to his house colonel skinner having some apprehensions that by such slights he might be driven to seek revenge by assassination is said to have remonstrated with mr fraser as his oldest and most valued friend mr fraser told him that he considered the nawāb to be still but a boy and the only way to improve him was to treat him as such it was however more by these slights than by any supposed injuries that shamsuddīn was exasperated and from that day he determined to have mr fraser assassinated having prevailed upon a man karīm khān who was at once his servant and boon companion he sent him to delhi with one of his carriages which he was to have sold through mr mcpherson a european merchant of the city he was ordered to stay there ostensibly for the purpose of learning the process of extracting copper from the fossil containing the ore and purchasing dogs for the nawāb he was to watch his opportunity and shoot mr fraser whenever he might find him out at night attended by only one or two orderlies to be in no haste but to wait till he found a favourable opportunity though it should be for several months he had with him a groom named rūplā and a mewātī attendant named aniā and they lodged in apartments of the nawābs at daryāoganj he rode out morning and evening attended by aniā on foot for three months during which he often met mr fraser but never under circumstances favourable to his purpose and at last in despair returned to fīrōzpur aniā had importuned him for leave to go home to see his children who had been ill and karīm khān did not like to remain without him the nawāb was displeased with him for returning without leave and ordered him to return to his post and effect the object of his mission aniā declined to return and the nawāb recommended karīm to take somebody else but he had he said explained all his designs to this man and it would be dangerous to entrust the secret to another and he could moreover rely entirely upon the courage of aniā on any trying occasion twenty rupees were due to the treasury by aniā on account of the rent of the little tenement he held under the nawāb and the treasurer consented at the request of karīm khān to receive this by small instalments to be deducted out of the monthly wages he was to receive from him he was moreover assured that he should have nothing to do but to cook and eat and should share liberally with karīm in the one hundred rupees he was taking with him in money and the letter of credit upon the nawābs bankers at delhi for one thousand rupees more the nawāb himself came with them as far as the village of nagīna where he used to hunt and there karīm requested permission to change his groom as he thought rūplā too shrewd a man for such a purpose he wanted he said a stupid sleepy man who would neither ask nor understand anything but the nawāb told him that rūplā was an old and quiet servant upon whose fidelity he could entirely rely and karīm consented to take him aniās little tenement upon which his wife and children resided was only two miles distant and he went to give instructions about gathering in the harvest and to take leave of them he told his wife that he was going to the capital on a difficult and dangerous duty but that his companion karīm would do it all no doubt aniā asked karīm before they left nagīna what was to be his reward and he told him that the nawāb had promised them five villages in rentfree tenure aniā wished to learn from the nawāb himself what he might expect and being taken to him by karīm was assured that he and his family should be provided for handsomely for the rest of their lives if he did his duty well on this occasionon reaching delhi they took up their quarters near colonel skinners house in the bulvemars ward where they resided for two months the nawāb had told karīm to get a gun made for his purpose at delhi or purchase one stating that his guns had all been purchased through colonel skinner and would lead to suspicion if seen in his possession on reaching delhi karīm purchased an old gun and desired aniā to go to a certain man in the chāndnī chauk and get it made in the form of a short blunderbuss with a peculiar stock that would admit of its being concealed under a cloak and to say that he was going to gwālior to seek service if any one questioned him the barrel was cut and the instrument made exactly as karīm wished it to be by the man whom he pointed out they met mr fraser every day but never at night and karīm expressed regret that the nawāb should have so strictly enjoined him not to shoot him in the daytime which he thought he might do without much risk aniā got an attack of fever and urged karīm to give up the attempt and return home or at least permit him to do so karīm himself became weary and said he would do so very soon if he could not succeed but that he should certainly shoot some european gentleman before he set out and tell his master that he had taken him for mr fraserto save appearances aniā told him that this was a question between him and his master and no concern of his at the expiration of two months a peon came to learn what they were doing karīm wrote a letter by him to the nawāb saying that the dog he wished was never to be seen without ten or twelve people about him and that he saw no chance whatever of finding him except in the midst of them but that if he wished he would purchase this dog in the midst of the crowd the nawāb wrote a reply which was sent by a trooper with orders that it should be opened in presence of no one but aniā the contents were i command you not to purchase the dog in presence of many persons as its price will be greatly raised you may purchase him before one person or even two but not before more i am in no hurry the longer the time you take the better but do not return without purchasing the dog that is without killing mr fraser they went on every day to watch mr frasers movements leaving the horse with the groom sometimes in one old ruin of the city and sometimes in another ready saddled for flight with orders that he should not be exposed to the view of passersby karīm and aniā used to pace the streets and on several occasions fell in with him but always found him attended by too many followers of one kind or another for their purpose at last on sunday the th of march karīm heard that mr fraser was to attend a nāch dance given by hindoo rāo the brother of the baiza bāi who then resided at delhi and determining to try whether he could not shoot him from horseback he sent away his groom as soon as he had ascertained that mr fraser was actually at the dance aniā went in and mixed among the assembly and as soon as he saw mr fraser rise to depart he gave intimation to karīm who ordered him to keep behind and make off as fast as he could as soon as he should hear the report of his gun a little way from hindoo raos house the road branches off that to the left is straight while that to the right is circuitous mr fraser was known always to take the straight road and upon that karīm posted himself as the road up to the place where it branched off was too public for his purpose as it happened mr fraser for the first time took the circuitous road to the right and reached his home without meeting karīm aniā placed himself at the cross way and waited there till karīm came up to him on hearing that he had taken the right road karīm said that a man in mr frasers situation must be a strange kāfir unbeliever not to have such a thing as a torch with him in a dark night had he had what he ought he said i should not have lost him this time they passed him on the road somewhere or other almost every afternoon after this for seven days but could never fall in with him after dark on the eighth day sunday the nd of march karīm went as usual in the forenoon to the great mosque to say his prayers and on his way back in the afternoon he purchased some plums which he was eating when he came up to aniā whom he found cooking his dinner he ordered his horse to be saddled immediately and told aniā to make haste and eat his dinner as he had seen mr fraser at a party given by the rājā of kishangarh when his time is come said karīm we shall no doubt find an opportunity to kill him if we watch him carefully they left the groom at home that evening and proceeded to the dargāh church near the canal seeing aniā with merely a stick in his hand karīm bid him go back and change it for a sword while he went in and said his evening prayers on being rejoined by aniā they took the road to cantonments which passed by mr frasers house and aniā observed that the risk was hardly equal in this undertaking he being on foot while karīm was on horseback that he should be sure to be taken while the other might have a fair chance of escape it was now quite dark and karīm bid him stand by sword in hand and if anybody attempted to seize his horse when he fired cut him down and be assured that while he had life he would never suffer him aniā to be taken karīm continued to patrol up and down on the highroad that nobody might notice him while aniā stood by the roadside at last about eleven oclock they heard mr fraser approach attended by one trooper and two peons on foot and karīm walked his horse slowly as if he had been going from the city to the cantonments till mr fraser came up within a few paces of him near the gate leading into his house karīm khān on leaving his house had put one large ball into his short blunderbuss and when confident that he should now have an opportunity of shooting mr fraser he put in two more small ones as mr frasers horse was coming up on the left side karīm khān tumed round his and as he passed presented his blunderbuss fired and all three balls passed into mr frasers breast all three horses reared at the report and flash and mr fraser fell dead on the ground karīm galloped off followed at a short distance by the trooper and the two peons went off and gave information to major pew and cornet robinson who resided near the place they came in all haste to the spot and had the body taken tothe deceaseds own house but no signs of life remained they reported the murder to the magistrate and the city gates were closed as the assassin had been seen to enter the city by the trooper aniā ran home through the kabul gate of the city unperceived while karīm entered by the ajmēr gate and passed first through the encampment of hindoo rao to efface the traces of his horses feet when he reached their lodgings he found aniā there before him and rūplā the groom seeing his horse in a sweat told him that he had had a narrow escapethat mr fraser had been killed and orders given for the arrest of any horseman that might be found in or near the city he told him to hold his tongue and take care of the horse and calling for a light he and aniā tore up every letter he had received from fīrōzpur and dipped the fragments in water to efface the ink from them aniā asked him what he had done with the blunderbuss and was told that it had been thrown into a well aniā now concealed three flints that he kept about him in some sand in the upper story they occupied and threw an iron ramrod and two spare bullets into a well near the mosque the next morning when he heard that the city gates had been all shut to prevent any one from going out till strict search should be made karīm became a good deal alarmed and went to seek counsel from moghal beg the friend of his master but when in the evening he heard that they had been again opened he recovered his spirits and the next day he wrote a letter to the nawāb saying that he had purchased the dogs that he wanted and would soon return with them he then went to mr mcpherson and actually purchased from him for the nawāb some dogs and pictures and the following day sent rūplā the groom with them to fīrōzpur accompanied by two bearers a pilgrim lodged in the same place with these men and was present when karīm came home from the murder and gave his horse to rūplā in the evening after the departure of rūplā with the dogs four men of the gūjar caste came to the place and karīm sat down and smoked a pipe with one of them who said that he had lost his bread by mr frasers death and should be glad to see the murderer punishedthat he was known to have worn a green vest and he hoped he would soon be discovered the pilgrim came up to karīm shortly after these four men went away and said that he had heard from some one that he karīm was himself suspected of the murder he went again to moghal beg who told him not to be alarmed that happily the regulations were now in force in the delhi territory and that he had only to stick steadily to one story to be safe he now desired aniā to return to fīrōzpur with a letter to the nawāb and to assure him that he would be stanch and stick to one story though they should seize him and confine him in prison for twelve years he had he said already sent off part of his clothes and aniā should now take away the rest so that nothing suspicious should be left near him the next morning aniā set out on foot accompanied by islāmullah a servant of moghal begs who was also the bearer of a letter to the nawāb they hired two ponies when they became tired but both flagged before they reached nagīna whence aniā proceeded to fīrōzpur on a mare belonging to the native collector leaving islāmullah behind he gave his letter to the nawāb who desired him to describe the affair of the murder he did so the nawāb seemed very much pleased and asked him whether karīm appeared to be in any alarm aniā told him that he did not and had resolved to stick to one story though he should be imprisoned for twelve years karīm khān said the nawāb turning to the brotherinlaw of the former wāsil khān and hasan alī who stood near himkarīm khān is a very brave man whose courage may be always relied on he gave aniā eighteen rupees and told him to change his name and keep close to wāsil khān they retired together but while wāsil khān went to his house aniā stood on the road unperceived but near enough to hear hasan alī urge the nawāb to have him put to death immediately as the only chance of keeping the fatal secret he went off immediately to wāsil khān and prevailed upon him to give him leave to go home for that night to see his family promising to be back the next morning early he set out forthwith but had not been long at home when he learned that hasan alī and another confidential servant of the nawāb were come in search of him with some troopers he concealed himself in the roof of his house and heard them ask his wife and children where he was saying they wanted his aid in getting out some hyaenas they had traced into their dens in the neighbourhood they were told that he had gone back to fīrōzpur and returned but were sent back by the nawāb to make a more careful search for him before they came however he had gone off to his friends kamruddīn and joharī two brothers who resided in the rāo rājās territory to this place he was followed by some mewātīs whom the nawāb had induced under the promise of a large reward to undertake to kill him one night he went to two acquaintances makrām and shahāmat in a neighbouring village and begged them to send to some english gentleman in delhi and solicit for him a pardon on condition of his disclosing all the circumstances of mr frasers murder they promised to get everything done for him through a friend in the police at delhi and set out for that purpose while aniā returned and concealed himself in the hills in six days they came with a paper purporting to be a promise of pardon from the court of delhi and desired kamruddīn to introduce them to aniā he told them to return to him in three days and he would do so but he went off to aniā in the hills and told him that he did not think these men had really got the papers from the english gentlementhat they appeared to him to be in the service of the nawāb himself aniā was however introduced to them when they came back and requested that the paper might be read to him seeing through their designs he again made off to the hills while they went out in search they pretended of a man to read it but in reality to get some people who were waiting in the neighbourhood to assist in securing him and taking him off to the nawābfinding on their return that aniā had escaped they offered high rewards to the two brothers if they would assist in tracing him out and joharī was taken to the nawāb who offered him a very high reward if he would bring aniā to him or at least take measures to prevent his going to the english gentlemen this was communicated to aniā who went through bharatpur to bareilly and from bareilly to secunderabad where he heard in the beginning of july that both karīm and the nawāb were to be tried for the murder and that the judge mr colvin had already arrived at delhi to conduct the trial he now determined to go to delhi and give himself up on his way he was met by mr simon frasers man who took him to delhi when he confessed his share in the crime became kings evidence at the trial and gave an interesting narrative of the whole affair two watercarriers in attempting to draw up the brass jug of a carpenter which had fallen into the well the morning after the murder pulled up the blunderbuss which karīm khān had thrown into the same well this was afterwards recognized by aniā and the man whom he pointed out as having made it for him two of the four gūjars who were mentioned as having visited karīm immediately after the murder went to brigadier fast who commanded the troops at delhi fearing that the native officers of the european civil functionaries might be in the interest of the nawāb and get them made away with they told him that karīm khān seemed to answer the description of the man named in the proclamation as the murderer of mr fraser and he sent them with a note to the commissioner mr metcalfe who sent them to the magistrate mr fraser who accompanied them to the place and secured karīm with some fragments of important papers the two mewātīs who had been sent to assassinate aniā were found and they confessed the fact the brother of aniā rahmat was found and he described the difficulty aniā had to escape from the nawābs people sent to murder him rūplā the groom deposed to all that he had seen during the time he was employed as karīms groom at delhi several men deposed to having met karīm and heard him asking after mr fraser a few days before the murder the two peons who were with mr fraser when he was shot deposed to the horse which he rode at the time and which was found with him karīm khān and the nawāb were both convicted of the crime sentenced to death and executed at delhi i should mention that suspicion had immediately attached to karīm khān he was known for some time to have been lurking about delhi on the pretence of purchasing dogs and it was said that had the nawāb really wanted dogs he would not have sent to purchase them by a man whom he admitted to his table and treated on terms of equality he was suspected of having been employed on such occasions beforeknown to be a good shot and a good rider who could fire and reload very quickly while his horse was in full gallop and called in consequence the bharmārū his horse which was found in the stable by the gūjar spies who had before been in mr frasers service answered the description given of the murderers horse by mr frasers attendants and the nawāb was known to cherish feelings of bitter hatred against mr fraser the nawāb was executed some time after karīm on thursday morning the rd of october close outside the north or kashmir gate leading to the cantonments he prepared himself for the execution in an extremely rich and beautiful dress of light green the colour which martyrs wear but he was made to exchange this and he then chose one of simple white and was too conscious of his guilt to urge strongly his claim to wear what dress he liked on such an occasion the following corps were drawn up around the gallows forming three sides of a square the st regiment of cavalry the th th and th regiments of native infantry major pews light field battery and a strong party of police on ascending the scaffold the nawāb manifested symptoms of disgust at the approach to his person of the sweeper who was to put the rope round his neck but he soon mastered his feelings and submitted with a good grace to his fate just as he expired his body made a last turn and left his face towards the west or the tomb of his prophet which the muhammadans of delhi considered a miracle indicating that he was a martyrnot as being innocent of the murder but as being executed for the murder of an unbeliever pilgrimages were for some time made to the nawābs tomb but i believe they have long since ceased with the short gleam of sympathy that his fate excited the only people that still recollect him with feelings of kindness are the prostitutes and dancing women of the city of delhi among whom most of his revenues were squandered in the same manner was wazīr ali recollected for many years by the prostitutes and dancing women of benares after the massacre of mr cherry and all the european gentlemen of that station save one mr davis who bravely defended himself wife and children against a host with a hog spear on the top of his house no european could pass benares for twenty years after wazīr alīs arrest and confinement in the garrison of fort william without hearing from the windows songs in his praise and in praise of the massacre it is supposed that the nawāb faiz muhammad khan of jhajjar was deeply implicated in this murder though no proof of it could be found he died soon after the execution of shamsud dīn and was succeeded in his fief by his eldest son faiz alī khān this fief was bestowed on the father of the deceased whose name was najābat alī khān by lord lake on the termination of the war in for the aid he had given to the retreating army under colonel monson one circumstance attending the execution of the nawāb shamsuddīn seems worthy of remark the magistrate mr frascott desired his crier to go through the city the evening before the execution and proclaim to the people that those who might wish to be present at the execution were not to encroach upon the line of sentries that would be formed tokeep clear an allotted space round the gallows nor to carry with them any kind of arms but the crier seemingly retaining in his recollection only the words arms and sentries gave out after his oyes oyes that the sentries had orders to use their arms and shoot any man woman or child that should presume to go outside the wall to look at the execution of the nawāb no person in consequence ventured out till the execution was over when they went to see the nawāb himself converted into smoke as the general impression was that as life should leave it the body was to be blown off into the air by a general discharge of musketry and artillery moghal bēg was acquitted for want of judicial proof of his guilty participation in the crime notes the authors remarks concerning military officers refer to officers serving with native regiments now known as the indian army before the

several attempts to dislodge him were compelled to retire without effecting their object the benefit derived from the resistance of this intrepid man extended beyond his own family the delay thereby

chief of balamgarh mustered a cortège of sixty elephants and about ten thousand men to attend him out in the istikbāl to meet and welcome his guests the bridegrooms party had to expend about six hundred thousand rupees in this visit alone they scattered copper money all along the road from their homes to within seven miles of balamgarh from this point to the gate of the fort they had to scatter silver and from this gate to the door of the palace they scattered gold and jewels of all kinds the son of the patiālā chief a lad of about ten years of age sat upon his elephant with a bag containing six hundred gold mohurs of two guineas each mixed up with an infinite variety of gold earrings pearls and precious stones which he scattered in handfuls among the crowd the scattering of the copper and silver had been left to inferior hands the costs of the family of the bride are always much greater than that of the bridegroom they are obliged to entertain at their own expense all the bridegrooms guests as well as their own as long as they remain and over and above this on the present occasion the rājā gave a rupee to every person that came invited or uninvited an immense concourse of people had assembled to share in this donation and to scramble for the money scattered along the road and ready money enough was not found in the treasury before a further supply could be

place among the castes of the hindoos the jāt is in every respect the most important of the panjāb peoples the distinction between jāt and rājpūt is social rather than ethnic socially the jāt occupies

and in organizing the imperial service troops the sikh states are now sufficiently well governed chapter collegiate endowment of muhammadan tombs and mosques on the th we came to badarpur twelve miles over a plain with the range of hills on our left approaching nearer and nearer the road and separating us from the old city of delhi we passed through farīdpur once a large town and called after its founder shaikh farīd whose mosque is still in good order though there is no person to read or hear prayers in it we passed also two fine bridges one of three and one of four arches both over what were once streams but are now dry beds of sand the whole road shows signs of having been once thickly peopled and highly adorned with useful and ornamental works when delhi was in its glory every handsome mausoleum among muhammadans was provided with its mosque and endowed by the founder with the means of maintaining men of learning to read their korān over the grave of the deceased and in his chapel and as long as the endowment lasted the tomb continued to be at the same time a college they read the korān morning and evening over the grave and prayers in the chapel at the stated periods and the rest of their time is commonly devoted to the instruction of the youths of their neighbourhood either gratis or for a small consideration apartments in the tomb were usually set aside for the purpose and these tombs did ten times more for education in hindustan than all the colleges formed especially for the purpose we might suppose that rulers who formed and endowed such works all over the land must have had more of the respect and the affections of the great mass of the people than we who as my friend upon the jumna has it build nothing but private dwellinghouses factories courts of justice and jails can ever have but this conclusion would not be altogether just though every mosque and mausoleum was a seat of learning that learning instead of being a source of attraction and conciliation between the muhammadans and hindoos was on the contrary a source of perpetual repulsion and enmity between themit tended to keep alive in the breasts of the musalmāns a strong feeling of religions indignation against the worshippers of idols and of dread and hatred in those of the hindoos the korān was the book of books spoken by god to the angel gabriel in parts as occasion required and repeated by him to muhammad who unable to write himself dictated them to any one who happened to be present when he received the divine communications it contained all that it was worth mans while to study or knowit was from the deity but at the same time coeternal with himit was his divine eternal spirit inseparable from him from the beginning and therefore like him uncreated this book to read which was of itself declared to be the highest of all species of worship taught war against the worshippers of idols to be of all merits the greatest in the eye of god and no man could well rise from the perusal without the wish to serve god by some act of outrage against them these buildings were therefore looked upon by the hindoos who composed the great mass of the people as a kind of religions volcanoes always ready to explode and pour out their lava of intolerance and outrage upon the innocent people of the surrounding country if a hindoo fancied himself injured or insulted by a muhammadan he was apt to revenge himself upon the muhammadans generally and insult their religion by throwing swines flesh or swines blood into one of their tombs or churches and the latter either flew to arms at once to revenge their god or retaliated by throwing the flesh or the blood of the cow into the first hindoo temple at hand which made the hindoos fly to arms the guilty and the wicked commonly escaped while numbers of the weak the innocent and the unoffending were slaughtered the magnificent buildings therefore instead of being at the time bonds of union were commonly sources of the greatest discord among the whole community and of the most painful humiliation to the hindoo population during the bigoted reign of aurangzēb and his successors a hindoos presence was hardly tolerated within sight of these tombs or churches and had he been discovered entering one of them he would probably have been hunted down like a mad dog the recollection of such outrages and the humiliation to which they gave rise associated as they always are in the minds of the hindoos with the sight of these buildings are perhaps the greatest source of our strength in india because they at the same time feel that it is to us alone they owe the protection which they now enjoy from similar injuries many of my countrymen full of virtuous indignation at the outrages which often occur during the processions of the muharram particularly when these happen to take place at the same time with some religious procession of the hindoos are very anxious that our government should interpose its authority to put down both but these processions and occasional outrages are really sources of great strength to us they show at once the necessity for the interposition of an impartial tribunal and a disposition on the part of the rulers to interpose impartially the muhammadan festivals are regulated by the lunar and those of the hindoos by the solar year and they cross each other every thirty or forty years and furnish fair occasions for the local authorities to interpose effectually people who receive or imagine insults or injuries commonly postpone their revenge till these religious festivals come round when they hope to be able to settle their accounts with impunity among the excited crowd the mournful procession of the muharram when the muhammadans are inflamed to madness by the recollection of the really affecting incidents of the massacre of the grandchildren of their prophet and by the images of their tombs andtheir sombre music crosses that of the holī in which the hindoos are excited to tumultuous and licentious joy by their bacchanalian songs and dances every thirtysix years and they reign together for some four or five days during which the scene in every large town is really terrific the processions are liable to meet in the street and the lees of the wine of the hindoos or the red powder which is substituted for them is liable to fall upon the tombs of the others hindoos pass on forgetting in their saturnalian joy all distinctions of age sex or religion their clothes and persons besmeared with the red powder which is moistened and thrown from all kinds of machines over friend and foe while meeting these come the muhammadans clothed in their green mourning with gloomy downcast looks beating their breasts ready to kill themselves and too anxious for an excuse to kill anybody else let but one drop of the lees of joy fall upon the image of the tomb as it passes and a hundred swords fly from their scabbards many an innocent person falls and woe be to the town in which the magistrate is not at hand with his police and military force proudly conscious of their power the magistrates refuse to prohibit one class from laughing because the other happens to be weeping and the hindoos on such occasions laugh the more heartily to let the world see that they are free to do so a very learned hindoo once told me in central india that the oracle of mahādēo had been at the same time consulted at three of his greatest templesone in the deccan one in rājputāna and one i think in bengalas to the result of the government of india by europeans who seemed determined to fill all the high offices of administration with their own countrymen to the exclusion of the people of the country a day was appointed for the answer and when the priest came to receive it they found mahādēo siva himself with a european complexion and dressed in european clothes he told them that their european government was in reality nothing more than a multiplied incarnation of himself and that he had come among them in this shape to prevent their cutting each others throats as they had been doing for some centuries past that these his incarnations appeared to have no religion themselves in order that they might be the more impartial arbitrators between the people of so many different creeds and sects who now inhabited the country that they must be aware that they never had before been so impartially governed and that they must continue to obey these their governors without attempting to pry further into futurity or the will of the gods mahādēo performs a part in the great drama of the rāmāyana or the rape of sīta and he is the only figure there that is represented with a white face i was one day praising the law of primogeniture among ourselves to a muhammadan gentleman of high rank and defending it on the ground that it prevented that rivalry and bitterness of feeling among brothers which were always found among the muhammadans whose law prescribes an equal division of property real and personal among the sons and the choice of the wisest among them as successor to the government this said he is no doubt the source of our weakness but why should you condemn a law which is to you a source of so much strength i one day said he asked mr seaton the governorgenerals representative at the court of delhi which of all things he had seen in india he liked best you have replied he smiling a small species of melon called phūt disunion this is the thing we like best in your land there was continued my muhammadan friend an infinite deal of sound political wisdom in this one sentence mr seaton was a very good and a very wise man our european governors of the present day are not at all the same kind of thing i asked mr b a judge the same question many years afterwards and he told me that he thought the rupees were the best things he had found in india i asked mr t the commissioner and he told me that he thought the tobacco which he smoked in his hookah was the best thing and pray sir what do you think the best thing why nawāb sāhib i am always very well pleased when i am free from pain and can get my nostrils full of cool air and my mouth full of cold water in this hot land of yours and i think most of my countrymen are the same next to these the thing we all admire most in india nawāb sāhib is the entire exemption which you and i and every other gentleman native or european enjoy from the taxes which press so heavily upon them in other countries in kāshmīr no midwife is allowed to attend a woman in her confinement till a heavy tax has been paid to ranjīt singh for the infant and in england a man cannot let the light of heaven into his house till he has paid a tax for the window nor keep a dog

employment for the educated classes under government true nawāb sāhib we might no doubt greatly multiply this employment to the advantage of those who got the places but we should have to multiply at the same time the taxes to the great disadvantage of those who did not get them true very true sir said my old friend notes january farīdpur is a mistake for farīdābād a small town sixteen miles from delhi founded in by shaikh farīd treasurerof jahāngīr to protect the high road between agra and delhi the beds are dry in the cold season but the streams which flow from the hills to the south of delhi are torrents in the rainy season but the education in such schools is of very little value being commonly confined to the committing of the korān to memory by boys ignorant of arabic in modern india the british buildings are far more varied and many aspire to some architectural merit muhammad is said to have received these communications in all situations sometimes when riding along the road on his camel he became suddenly red in the face and greatly agitated he made his camel sit down immediately and called for some one to write his rhapsodies were all written at the time on leaves and thrown into a box gabriel is believed to have made him repeat over the whole once every year during the month of ramazān in the year he died muhammad told his followers that the angel had made him repeat them over twice that year and that he was sure he would not live to receive another visit w h s the muhammadan year consists of twelve lunar months of and days alternately the common year therefore consists of only days but when intercalary days in certain years are allowed for the mean year consists of days inasmuch as a solar year consists of about days the difference amounts to nearly days and any given month in the muhammadan year consequently goes the round of the seasons in course of time the muharram celebration takes its name from the first month of the muhammadan year during which it takes place alī the cousin of muhammad was married to the prophets daughter fatima and according to the shīa sect must be regarded as the lawful successor of muhammad who died in june

day of the month muharram th october ad in a great battle fought at karbalā near the euphrates these events are commemorated yearly by noisy funeral processions properly the proceedings ought to be altogether mournful and confined to the shīa sect but in practice sunnī muhammadans and even hindoos take part in the ceremonies which are regarded by many of the populace as no more solemn than a lord mayors show the disgusting festival of the holī celebrated with drunkenness and obscenity takes place in march and is supposed to be the festival of the vernal equinox see ante chapter note the

on eight miles to the kutb mīnār across the range of sandstone hills which rise to the height of about two hundred feet and run north and south the rocks are for the most part naked but here and there the soil between them is covered with famished grass and a few stunted shrubs anything more unprepossessing can hardly be conceived than the aspect of these hills which seem to serve no other purpose than to store up heat for the people of the great city of delhi we passed through a cut in this range of hills made apparently by the stream of the river jumna at some remote period and about one hundred yards wide at the entrance this cut is crossed by an enormous stone wall running north and south and intended to shut in the waters and form a lake in the opening beyond it along the brow of the precipice overlooking the northern end of the wall is the stupendous fort of tughlakābād built by the emperor tughlak the first of the sandstones of the range of hills on which it stands cut into enormous square blocks on the brow of the opposite side of the precipice overlooking the southern end of the wall stands the fort of muhammadābād built by this emperors son and successor muhammad and resembling in all things that built by his father these fortresses overlooked the lake with the old city of delhi spread out on the opposite side of it to the west there is a third fortress upon an isolated hill east of the great barrier wall said to have been built in honour of his master by the emperor tughlaks barber the emperors tomb stands upon an isolated rock in the middle of the once lake now plain about a mile to the west of the barrier wall the rock is connected with the western extremity of the northern fortress by a causeway of twentyfive arches and about one hundred and fifty yards long this is a fine tomb and contains in a square centre room the remains of the emperor tughlak his wife and his son the tomb is built of red sandstone and surmounted by a dome of white marble the three graves inside are built of brick covered with stucco work the outer sides of the tomb slope slightly inwards from the base in the form of a pyramid but the inner walls are of course perpendicular the impression left on the mind after going over these stupendous fortifications is that the arts which contribute to the comforts and elegancies of life must have been in a very rude state when they were raised domestic architecture must have been wretched in the extreme the buildings are all of stone and almost all without cement and seem to have been raised by giants and for giants whose arms were against everybody and everybodys arm against them this was indeed the state of the pathān sovereigns in indiathey were the creatures of their armies and their armies were also employed against the people who feared and detested them all the emperor tughlak on his return at the head of the army which he had led into bengal to chastise some rebellious subjects was met at afghānpur by his eldest son jūnā whom he had left in the government of the capital the prince had in three days raised here a palace of wood for a grand entertainment to do honour to his fathers return and when the emperor signified his wish to retire all the courtiers rushed out before him to be in attendance and among the rest jūnā himself five attendants only remained when the emperor rose from his seat and at that moment the building fell in and crushed them and their master jūnā had been sent at the head of an army into the deccan where he collected immense wealth from the plunder of the palaces of princes and the temples of their priests the only places in which much wealth was to be found in those days this wealth he tried to conceal from his father whose death he probably thus contrived that he might the sooner have the free enjoyment of it with unlimited power only thirty years before alāuddīn returning in the same manner at the head of an army from the deccan loaded with wealth murdered the emperor fīrōz the second the father of his wife and ascended the throne jūnā ascended the throne under the name of muhammad the third and after the remains of his father had been deposited in the tomb i have described he passed in great pomp and splendour from the fortress of tughlakābād which his father had just then completed to the city in which the mīnār stands with elephants before and behind loaded with gold and silver coins which were scattered among the crowd who everywhere hailed him with shouts of joy the roads were covered with flowers the houses adorned with the richest stuffs and the streets resounded with music he was a man of great learning and a great patron of learned men he was a great founder of churches had prayers read in them at the prescribed times and always went to prayers five times a day himself he was rigidly temperate himself in his habits and discouraged all intemperance in others these things secured him panegyrists throughout the empire during the twentyseven years that he reigned over it though perhaps he was the most detestable tyrant that ever filled a throne he would take his armies out over the most populous and peaceful districts and hunt down the innocent and unoffending people like wild beasts and bring home their heads by thousands to hang them on the city gates for his mere amusement he twice made the whole people of the city of delhi emigrate with him to daulatābād insouthern india which he wished to make the capital from some foolish fancy and during the whole of his reign gave evident signs of being in an unsound state of mind there was at the time of his fathers death a saint at delhi named nizāmuddīn aulia or the saint who was supposed by supernatural means to have driven from delhi one night in a panic a large army of moghals under tarmasharīn who invaded india from transoxiana in and laid close siege to the city of delhi in which the emperor alāuddīn was shut up without troops to defend himself his armies being engaged in southern india it is very likely that he did strike this army with a panic by getting some of their leaders assassinated in one night he was supposed to have the dast ul ghaib or supernatural purse literally invisible hand as his private expenditure is said to have been more lavish even than that of the emperor himself while he had no ostensible source of income whatever the emperor was either jealous of his influence and display or suspected him of dark crimes and threatened to humble him when he returned to delhi as he approached the city the friends of the saint knowing the resolute spirit of the emperor urged him to quit the capital as he had been often heard to say let me but reach delhi and this proud priest shall be humbled the only reply that the saint would ever deign to give from the time the imperial army left bengal till it was within one stage of the capital was dihlī dūr ast delhi is still far off this is now become a proverb over the east equivalent to our there is many a slip between the cup and the lip it is probable that the saint had some understanding with the son in his plans for the murder of his father it is possible that his numerous wandering disciples may in reality have been murderers and robbers and that he could at any time have procured through them the assassination of the emperor the muhammadan thugs or assassins of india certainly looked upon him as one of the great founders of their system and used to make pilgrimages to his tomb as such and as he came originally from persia and is considered by his greatest admirers to have been in his youth a robber it is not impossible that he may have been originally one of the assassins or disciples of the old man of the mountains and that he may have set up the system of thuggee in india and derived a great portion of his income from it emperors now prostrate themselves and aspire to have their bones placed near it scil the tomb while wandering about the ruins i remarked to one of the learned men of the place who attended us that it was singular tughlaks buildings should be so rude compared with those of iltutmish who had reigned more than eighty years before him not at all singular said he was he not under the curse of the holy saint nizāmuddīn and what had the emperor done to merit the holy mans curse he had taken by force to employ upon his palaces several of the masons whom the holy man was employing upon a church said he the kutb mīnār was i think more beyond my expectations than the tāj first because i had heard less of it and secondly because it stands as it were alone in indiathere is absolutely no other tower in this indian empire of ours large pillars have been cut out of single stones and raised in different parts of india to commemorate the conquests of hindoo princes whose names no one was able to discover for several centuries till an unpretending english gentleman of surprising talents and industry mr james prinsep lately brought them to light by mastering the obsolete characters in which they and their deeds had been inscribed upon them these pillars would however be utterly insignificant were they composed of many stones the knowledge that they are cut out of single stones brought from a distant mountain and raised by the united efforts of multitudes when the mechanical arts were in a rude state makes us still view them with admiration but the single majesty of this mīnār of kutbuddīn so grandly conceived so beautifully proportioned so chastely embellished and so exquisitely finished fills the mind of the spectator with emotions of wonder and delight without any such aid he feels that it is among the towers of the earth what the tāj is among the tombs something unique of its kind that must ever stand alone in his recollections it is said to have taken fortyfour years in building and formed the left of two mīnārs of a mosque the other mīnār was never raised but this has been preserved and repaired by the liberality of the british government it is only feet high and feet in circumference at the base it is circular and fluted vertically into twentyseven semicircular and angular divisions there are four balconies supported upon large stone brackets and surrounded with battlements of richly cut stone to enable people to walk round the tower with safety the first is ninety feet from the base the second fifty feet further up the third forty further and the fourth twentyfour feet above the third up to the third balcony the tower is built of fine but somewhat ferruginous sandstone whose surface has become red from exposure to the oxygen of the atmosphere up to the first balcony the flutings are alternately semicircular and angular in the second story they are all semicircular and in the third all angular from the third balcony to the top the building is composed chiefly of white marble and the surface is without the deep flutings around the first story there are five horizontal belts of passages from the korān engraved in bold relief and in the kufic character in the second story there are four and in the third three the ascent is by a spiral staircase within of three hundred and eighty steps and there are passages from this staircase to the balconies with others here and there for the admission of light and air a foolish notion has prevailed among some people overfond of paradox that this tower is in reality a hindoo building and not as commonly supposed a muhammadan one never was paradox supported upon more frail i might say absurd foundations they are these st that there is only one mīnār whereas there ought to have been twohad the unfinished one been intended as the second it would not have been as it really is larger than the first nd that other mīnārs seen in the present day either do not slope inward from the base up at all or do not slope so much as this i tried to trace the origin of this paradox and i think i found it in a silly old munshī clerk in the service of the emperor he toldme that he believed it was built by a former hindoo prince for his daughter who wished to worship the rising sun and view the waters of the jumna from the top of it every morning there is no other hindoo building like or of the same kind as this the ribbons or belts of passages from the korān are all in relief and had they not been originally inserted as they are the whole surface of the building must have been cut down to throw them out in bold relief the slope is the peculiar characteristic of all the architecture of the pathāns by whom the church to which this tower belongs was built nearly all the arches of the church are still standing in a more or less perfect state and all correspond in design proportion and execution to the tower the ruins of the old hindoo temples about the place and about every other place in india are totally different in all three here they are all exceedingly paltry and insignificant compared with the church and its tower and it is evident that it was the intention of the founder to make them appear so to future generations of the faithful for he has taken care to make his own great work support rather than destroy them that they might for ever tend to enhance its grandeur it is sufficiently clear that the unfinished mīnār was commenced upon too large a scale and with too small a diminution of the circumference from the base upwards it is twofifths larger than the finished tower in circumference and much more perpendicular finding these errors when they had got some thirty feet from the foundation the founder shamsuddīn īltutmish began to work anew and had he lived a little longer there is no doubt that he would have raised the second tower in its proper place upon the same scale as the one completed his death was followed by several successive revolutions five sovereigns succeeded each other on the throne of delhi in ten years as usual on such occasions works of peace were suspended and succeeding sovereigns sought renown in military enterprise rather than in building churches this church was entire with the exception of the second mīnār when tamerlane invaded india he took back a model of it with him to samarkand together with all the masons he could find at delhi and is said to have built a church upon the same plan at that place before he set out for the invasion of syria the west face of the quadrangle in which the tower stands formed the church which consisted of eleven large arched alcoves the centre and largest of which contained the pulpit in size and beauty they seem to have corresponded with the mīnār but they are now all in ruins in the front of the centre of these alcoves stands the metal pillar of the old hindoo sovereign of delhi prithī rāj across whose temple all the great mosque of which this tower forms a part was thrown in triumph the ruins of these temples he scattered all round the place and consist of colonnades of stone pillars and pedestals richly enough carved with human figures in attitudes rudely and obscenely conceived the small pillar is of bronze or a metal which resembles bronze and is softer than brass and of the same form precisely as that of the stone pillar at eran on the bīnā river in mālwā upon which stands the figure of krishna with the glory around his head it is said that this metal pillar was put down through the earth so as to rest upon the very head of the snake that supports the world and that the sovereign who made it and fixed it upon so firm a basis was told by his spiritual advisers that his dynasty should last as long as the pillar remained where it was anxious to see that the pillar was really where the priests supposed it to be that his posterity might be quite sure of their position prithī rāj had it taken up and he found the blood and some of the flesh of the snakes head adhering to the bottom by this means the charm was broken and the priests told him that he had destroyed all the hopes of his house by his want of faith in their assurances i have never met a hindoo that doubted either that the pillar was really upon this snakes head or that the king lost his crown by his want of faith in the assurance of his priests they all believe that the pillar is still stuck into the head of the great snake and that no human efforts of the present day could remove it on my way back to my tents i asked the old hindoo officer of my guard who had gone with me to see the metal pillar what he thought of the story of the pillar what the people relate about the kīlī pillar having been stuck into the head of the snake that supports the world sir is nothing more than a simple historical fact known to everybody is it not so my brothers turning to the hindoo sipāhīs and followers around us who all declared that no fact could ever be better established when the rājā continued the old soldier had got the pillar fast into the head of the snake he was told by his chief priest that his dynasty must now reign over hindustan for ever but said the rājā as all seems to depend upon the pillar being on the head of the snake we had better see that it is so with our own eyes he ordered it to be taken up the clergy tried to dissuade him but all in vain up it was takenthe flesh and blood of the snake were found upon itthe pillar was replaced but a voice was heard saying thy want of faith hath destroyed theethy reign must soon end and with it that of thy race i asked the old soldier from whence the voice came he said this was a point that had not he believed been quite settled some thought it was from the serpent himself below the earth others that it came from the high priest or some of his clergy wherever it came from said the old man there is no doubt that god decreed the rājās fall for his want of faith and fall he did soon after all our followers concurred in this opinion and the old man seemed quite delighted to think that he had had an opportunity of delivering his sentiments upon so great a question before so respectable an audience the emperor shamsuddīn īltutmish is said to have designed this great muhammadan church at the suggestion ofkhwāja kutbuddīn a muhammadan saint from ūsh in persia who was his religious guide and apostle and died some sixteen years before him his tomb is among the ruins of this old city pilgrims visit it from all parts of india and go away persuaded that they shall have all they have asked provided they have given or promised liberally in a pure spirit of faith in his influence with the deity the tomb of the saint is covered with gold brocade and protected by an awning those of the emperors around it he naked and exposed emperors and princes lie all around him and their tombs are entirely disregarded by the hundreds that daily prostrate themselves before his and have been doing so for the last six hundred years among the rest i saw here the tomb of muazzam alias bahādur shāh the son and successor of aurangzēb and that of the blind old emperor shāh alam from whom the honourable company got their dīwanī grant the grass grows upon the slab that covers the remains of muazzam the most learned most pious and most amiable l believe of the crowned descendants of the great akbar these kings and princes all try to get a place as near as they can to the remains of such old saints believing that the ground is more holy than any other and that they may give them a lift on the day of resurrection the heir apparent to the throne of delhi visited the tomb the same day that i did he was between sixty and seventy years of age i asked some of the attendants of the tomb on my way back what he had come to pray for and was told that no one knew but every one supposed it was for the death of the emperor his father who was only fifteen years older and was busily engaged in promoting an intrigue at the instigation of one of his wives to oust him and get one of her sons mirza salīm acknowledged as his successor by the british government it was the hindoo festival of the basant and all the avenues to the tomb of this old saint were crowded when i visited it why the muhammadans crowded to the tomb on a hindoo holiday i could not ascertain the emperor īltutmish who died ad is buried close behind one end of the arched alcove in a beautiful tomb without its cupola he built the tomb himself and left orders that there should be no parda screen between him and heaven and no dome was thrown over the building in consequence other great men have done the same and their tombs look as if their domes had fallen in they think the way should be left clear for a start on the day of resurrection the church is stated to have been added to it by the emperor balban and the mīnār finished about the end of the seventeenth century it was so shaken by an earthquake that the two upper stories fell down our government when the country came into our possession undertook to repair these two stories and entrusted the work to captain smith who built up one of stone and the other of wood and completed the repairs in three years the one was struck by lightning eight or nine years after and came down if it was anything like the one that is left the lightning did well to remove it about five years ago while the emperor was on a visit to the tomb of kutbuddīn a madman got into his private apartments the servants were ordered to turn him out on passing the mīnār he ran in ascended to the top stood a few minutes on the verge laughing at those who were running after him and made a spring that enabled him to reach the bottom without touching the sides an eyewitness told me that he kept his erect position till about halfway down when he turned over and continued to turn till he got to the bottom when his fall made a report like a gun he was of course dashed to pieces about five months ago another fell over by accident and was dashed to pieces against the sides a new road has been here cut through the tomb of the emperor alā uddīn who murdered his fatherinlawthe first muhammadan conqueror of southern india and his remains have been scattered to the winds a very pretty marble tomb to the west of the alcoves covers the remains of imām mashhadī the religious guide of the emperor akbar and a magnificent tomb of freestone covers those of his four fosterbrothers this was long occupied as a dwellinghouse by the late mr blake of the bengal civil service who was lately barbarously murdered at jaipur to make room for his diningtables he removed the marble slab which covered the remains of the dead from the centre of the building against the urgent remonstrance of the people and threw it carelessly on one side against the wall where it now lies the people appealed in vain it is said to mr fraser the governorgenerals representative who was soon after assassinated and a good many attribute the death of both to this outrage upon the remains of the dead fosterbrother of akbar those of alāuddīn were no doubt older and less sensitive tombs equally magnificent cover the remains of the other three fosterbrothers of akbar but i did not enter them notes the sultan called by the author the emperor tughlak the first as being the first of the tughlak dynasty was by birth a karaunīah turk named ghāzī bēg tughlak he

of his life and his tomb near delhi is to this day visited as a place of pilgrimage by thugs who make votive offerings to it he is said to have been of the barsot class born in the month ofsafar hijrī march ad died rabīulawwal october ad the months as stated do not corresponded his tomb is visited by muhammadan pilgrims from all parts as a place of great sanctity from containing the remains of so holy a man but the thugs both hindoo and muhammadan visit it as containing the remains of the most celebrated thug of his day he was of the sunnī sect and those of the shīa sect find no difficulty in believing that he was a thug but those of his own sect will never credit it there are perhaps no sufficient grounds to pronounce him one of the fraternity but there are some to suspect that he was so at some period of his life the thugs say he gave it up early in life but kept others employed in it till late and derived an income from it and the dastulghaib or supernatural purse with which he was supposed to be endowed gives a colour to this his lavish expenditure so much beyond his ostensible means gave rise to the belief that he was supplied from above with money the old man of the mountains with whom the author compares nizāmuddīn or at least the original old man of the mountains shaikhul jabal was hasanibnsabbāh or ussabbāh who founded the sect of socalled assassins in the mountains on

and finish to sum up he held the delhi monument to surpass any building of its class in the whole world hist of indian and eastern architecture ed vol ii p fergusson ibid was mistaken in supposing that the kutb mīnār was intended for anything else than a māzina or tower from which the call to prayers should be proclaimed it is that and nothing else several examples of early mosques with only one mīnār each are known at koil and bayāna in india as well as at ghaznī and cairo the unfinished mīnār of alāuddīn near the kutb mīnār was intended for a distinct building namely his addition to the

kutbud dīn is erroneous the notion of the hindoo origin of the kutb mīnār which the author justly stigmatizes as foolish was taken up by sir sayyid ahmad khān the author of an urdū work on the antiquities of delhi and by sir a cunninghams assistant mr beglar who wasted a great part of volume iv of the archaeological survey reports in trying to prove the paradox his speculations on the subject were conclusively refuted by his chief in the preface pp vx of the same volume the mīnār was built by hindoo masons and in consequence some of the details notably its overlapping or corbelled arches are hindoo this is correct the hindoo towers of victory are in a totally different style on the misnomer pathāns see ante previous note the kutb mosque was constructed from the materials of twentyseven hindoo temples the colonnades retain much of their hindoo character fanshawe p and plate the authors description of the unfinished tower is far from accurate the tower was begun not by shamsuddīn īltutmish but by alāuddīn muhammad shāh in the year ah ad it is about feet in diameter and when cased with marble as was intended would have been at least feet in diameter or nearly double

means small when its material is considered on the contrary it is very large that material is not bronze or a metal which resembles bronze but is pure malleable iron as proved by analysis it has been suggested that this pillar must have been formed by gradually welding pieces together if so it has been done very skilfully since no marks of such welding are to be seen the famous iron pillar at the kutb near delhi indicates an amount of skill in the manipulation of a large mass of wrought iron which has been the marvel of all who have endeavoured to account for it it is not many years since the production of such a pillar would have been an impossibility in the largest foundries of the world and even now there are comparatively few where a similar mass of metal could be tumed out the total

shāhjahānābād on the nd of january we went on twelve miles to the new city of delhi built by the emperor shāhjahān and called after him shāhjahānābād and took up our quarters in the palace of the bēgam samrū a fine building agreeably situated in a garden opening into the great street with a branch of the great canal running through it and as quiet as if it had been in a wilderness we had obtained from the bēgam permission to occupy this palace during our stay it was elegantly furnished the servants were all exceedingly attentive and we were very happy the kutb mīnār stands upon the back of the sandstone range of low hills and the road descends over the northeastern face of this range for half a mile and then passes over a level plain all the way to the new city which lies on the right bank of the river jumna the whole plain is literally covered with the remains of splendid muhammadan mosques and mausoleums these muhammadans seem as if they had always in their thoughts the saying of christ which akbar has inscribed on the gateway at fathpur sīkrī life is a bridge which you are to pass over and not to build your dwellings upon the buildings which they have left behind them have almost all a reference to a future statethey laid out their means in a church in which the deity might be propitiated in a tomb where leaned and pious men might chant their korān over their remains and youth be instructed in their duties in a serai a bridge a canal built gratuitously for the public good that those who enjoyed these advantages from generation to generation might pray for the repose of their souls how could it be otherwise where the land was the property of government where capital was never concentrated or safe when the only aristocracy was that of office while the emperor was the sole recognized heir of all his public officers the only thing that he could not inherit were his tombs his temples his bridges his canals his caravanserais i was acquainted with the history of most of the great men whose tombs and temples i visited along the road but i asked in vain for a sight of the palaces they occupied in their day of pride and power they all had no doubt good houses agreeably situated like that of the bēgam samrū in the midst of wellwatered gardens and shrubberies delightful in their season but they cared less about themthey knew that the emperor was heir to every member of the great body to which they belonged the aristocracy of office and might transfer all their wealth to his treasury and all their palaces to their successors the moment the breath should be out of their bodies if their sons got office it would neither be in the same grades nor in the same places as those of their fathers how different it is in europe where our aristocracy is formed upon a different basis no one knows where to find the tombs in which the remains of great men who have passed away repose or the churches and colleges they have founded or the serāis the bridges the canals they formed gratuitously for the public good but everybody knows where to find their proud palaces life is not to them a bridge over which they are to pass and not build their dwellings upon the eldest sons enjoy all the patrimonial estates and employ them as best they may to get their younger brothers into situations in the church the army the navy and other public establishments in which they may be honourably and liberally provided for out of the public purse about halfway between the great tower and the new city on the lefthand side of the road stands the tomb of mansūr alī khān the greatgrandfather of the present king of oudh of all the tombs to be seen in this immense extent of splendid ruins this is perhaps the only one raised over a subject the family of whose inmates are now in a condition even to keep it in repair it is a very beautiful mausoleum built after the model of the tāj at agra with this difference that the external wall around the quadrangle of the tāj is here as it were thrown back and closed in upon the tomb the beautiful gateway at the entrance of the gardens of the tāj forms each of the four sides of the tomb of mansūr alī khān with all its chaste beauty of design proportion and ornament the quadrangle in which this mausoleum stands is about three hundred and fifty yards square surrounded by a stone wall with handsome gateways and filled in the same manner as that of the tāj at agra with cisterns and fruittrees three kinds of stones are usedwhite marble red sandstone and the fine white and fleshcoloured sandstone of rupbās the dome is of white marble and exactly of the same form as that of the tāj but it stands on a neck or base of sandstone with twelve sides and the marble is of a quality very inferior to that of the tāj it is of coarse dolomite and has become a good deal discoloured by time so as to give it the appearance which bishop heber noticed of potted meat the neck is not quite so long as that of the tāj and is better covered by the marble cupolas that stand above each face of the building the four noble minarets are however wanting the apartments are all in number and form exactly like those of the tāj but they are somewhat less in size in the centre of the first floor lies the beautiful marble slab that bears the date of this small pillar of a tottering state ah and in a vault underneath repose his remains by the side of those of one of his granddaughters the graves that cover these remains are of plain earth strewed with fresh flowers and covered with plain cloth about two miles from this tomb to the east stands that of the father of akbar humāyūn a large and magnificent building as i rodetowards this building to see the slab that covers the head of poor dārā shikoh i frequently cast a lingering look behind to view as often as i could this very pretty imitation of the most beautiful of all the tombs of the earth on my way i turned in to see the tomb of the celebrated saint nizāmuddīn auliā the defeater of the transoxianian army under tarmah shīrīn in to which pilgrimages are still made from all parts of india it is a small building surmounted by a white marble dome and kept very clean and neat by its side is that of the poet khusrū his contemporary and friend who moved about where he pleased through the palace of the emperor tughlak shāh the first five hundred years ago and sang extempore to his lyre while the greatest and the fairest watched his lips to catch the expressions as they came warm from his soul his popular songs are still the most popular and he is one of the favoured few who live through ages in the everyday thoughts and feelings of many millions while the crowned heads that patronized them in their brief day of pomp and power are forgotten or remembered merely as they happened to be connected with them his tomb has also a dome and the grave is covered with rich brocade and attended with as much reverence and devotion as that of the great saint himself while those of the emperors kings and princes that have been crowded around them are entirely disregarded a number of people are employed to read the korān over the grave of the old saint scil nizāmuddīn who died ah ad and are paid by contributions from the present emperor and the members of his family who occasionally come in their hour of need to entreat his intercession with the deity in their favour and by the humble pilgrims who flock from all parts for the same purpose a great many boys are here educated by those readers of their sacred volume all my attendants bowed their heads to the dust before the shrine of the saint but they seemed especially indifferent to those of the royal family which are all open to the sky respect shown or neglect towards them could bring neither good nor evil while any slight to the tomb of the crusty old saint might be of serious consequence in an enclosure formed by marble screens beautifully carved is the tomb of the favourite son of the present emperor mirzā jahāngīr whom i knew intimately at allahabad in when he was killing himself as fast as he could with hoffmans cherry brandy this he would say to me is really the only liquor that you englishmen have worth drinking and its only fault is that it makes one drunk too soon to prolong his pleasure he used to limit himself to one large glass every hour till he got dead drunk two or three sets of dancing women and musicians used to relieve each other in amusing him during this interval he died of course soon and the poor old emperor was persuaded by his mother the favourite sultana that he had fallen a victim to sighing and grief at the treatment of the english who would not permit him to remain at delhi where he was continually employed in attempts to assassinate his eldest brother the heir apparent and to stir up insurrections among the people he was not in confinement at allahabad but merely prohibited from returning to delhi he had a splendid dwelling a good income and all the honours due to his rank in another enclosure of the same kind are the emperor muhammad shāhwho reigned when nādir shāh invaded delhihis mother wife and daughter and in another close by is the tomb which interested me most that of jahānārā bēgam the favourite sister of poor dārā shikoh and daughter of shāh jahān it stands in the same enclosure with the brother of the present emperor on one side and his daughter on the other her remains are covered with a marble slab hollow at the top and exposed to the skythe hollow is filled with earth covered with green grass upon her tomb is the following inscription the three first lines of which are said to have been written by herselflet no rich canopy cover my grave this grass is the best covering for the tombs of the poor in spirit the humble the transitory jahānārā the disciple of the holy men of chisht the daughter of the emperor shāh jahān i went over the magnificent tomb of humāyūn which was raised over his remains by the emperor akbar it stands in the centre of a quadrangle of about four hundred yards square with a cloistered wall all round but i must not describe any more tombs here under a marble slab lies the head of poor dārā shikoh who but for a little infirmity of temper had perhaps changed the destinies of india by changing the character of education among the aristocracy of the countries under his rule and preventing the birth of the marāthā powers by leaving untouched the independent kingdoms of the deccan upon whose ruins under his bigoted brother the former rose secular and religions education were always inseparably combined among the muhammadans and invited to india from persia by the public offices civil and military which men of education and courtly manners could alone obtain these offices had long been exclusively filled by such men who flocked in crowds to india from khorāsān and persia every man qualified by secular instruction to make his way at court and fill such offices was disposed by his religions instruction to assert the supremacy of his creed and to exclude the followers of every other from the employments over which he had any control the aristocracy of office was the ocean to which this stream of muhammadan education flowed from the west and spread all over india and had dārā subdued his brothers and ascended the throne he would probably have arrested the flood by closing the public offices against these persian adventurers and filling them with christians and hindoos this would have changed the character of the aristocracy and the education of the peoplewhile looking upon the slab under which his head reposes i thought of the slight accidents by flood and field the still slighter thought of the brain and feeling of the heart on which the destinies of nations and of empires often dependon the discovery of the great diamond in the mines of golcondaon the accident which gave it into the hands of an ambitions persian adventureron the thought which suggested the advantage of presenting it to shāh jahānon the feeling which made dārā get off and aurangzēb sit on his elephant at the battle of samūgarh on which depended the fate of india and perhaps the advancement of the christian religion and european literature and science over india but for the accident which gave charles martel the victory over the saracens at tours arabic and persian had perhaps been the classical languages and islamism the religion of europe and where we have cathedrals and colleges we might have had mosques and mausoleums and america and the cape the compass and the press the steamengine the telescope and the copernican system might have remained still undiscovered and but for the accident which turned hannibals face from rome after the battle of cannae or that which intercepted his brother asdrubals letter we might now all be speaking the languages of tyre and sidon and roasting our own children in offerings to siva or saturn instead of saving those of the hindoos poor dārā but for thy little jealousy of thy father and thy son thy desire to do all thy work without their aid and those occasional ebullitions of passion which alienated from thee the most powerful of all the hindoo princes whom it was so much thy wish and thy interest to cherish thy generous heart and enlightened mind had reigned over this vast empire and made it perchance the garden it deserves to be made i visited the celebrated mosque known by the name of jāmi jumma masjid a fine building raised by shāh jahān and finished in six years ah at a cost of ten lākhs of rupees or one hundred thousand pounds money compared to mans labour and subsistence is still four times more valuable in india than in england and a similar building in england would cost at least four hundred thousand pounds it is like all the buildings raised by this emperor in the best taste and style i was attended by three welldressed and modest hindoos and a muhammadan servant of the emperor my attention was so much taken up with the edifice that i did not perceive till i was about to return that the doorkeepers had stopped my three hindoos i found that they had offered to leave their shoes behind and submit to anything to be permitted to follow me but the porters had they said strict orders to admit no worshippers of idols for their master was a man of the book and had therefore got a little of the truth in him though unhappily not much since his heart had not been opened to that of the korān nathū could have told him that he also had a book which he and some fourscore millions more thought as good as his or better but he was afraid to descant upon the merits of his shāstras and the miracles of kishan jī krishna among such fierce cutthroatlooking people he looked however as if he could have eaten the porter korān and all when i came to their rescue the only volumes which muhammadans designate by the name of the book are the old and new testaments and the korān i visited also the palace which was built by the same emperor it stands on the right bank of the jumna and occupies a quadrangle surrounded by a high wall built of red sandstone about one mile in circumference one side looks down into the clear stream of the jumna while the others are surrounded by the streets of the city the entrance is by a noble gateway to the west and facing this gateway on the inside a hundred and twenty yards distant is the dīwānīamm or the common hall of audience this is a large hall the roof of which is supported upon four colonnades of pillars of red sandstone now whitewashed but once covered with stucco work and gilded on one of these pillars is shown the mark of the dagger of a hindoo prince of chitōr who in the presence of the emperor stabbed to the heart one of the muhammadan ministers who made use of some disrespectful language towards him on being asked how he presumed to do this in the presence of his sovereign he answered in the very words almost of roderic dhu i right my wrongs where they are given though it were in the court of heaven the throne projects into the hall from the back in front of the large central arch it is raised ten feet above the floor and is about ten feet wide and covered by a marble canopy all beautifully inlaid with mosaic work exquisitely finished but now much dilapidated the room or recess in which the throne stands is open to the front and about fifteen feet wide and six deep there is a door at the back by which the emperor entered from his private apartments and one on his left from which his prime minister or chief officer of state approached the throne by a flight of steps leading into the hall in front of the throne and raised some three feet above the floor is a fine large slab of white marble on which one of the secretaries stood during the hours of audience to hand up to the throne any petitions that were presented and to receive and convey commands as the people approached over the intervening one hundred and twenty yards between the gateway and the hall of audience they were made to bow down lower and lower to the figure of the emperor as he sat upon his throne without deigning to show by any motion of limb or muscle that he was really made of flesh and blood and not cut out of the marble he sat upon the marble walls on three sides of this recess are inlaid with precious stones representing some of the most beautiful birds and flowers of india according to the boundaries of the country when shāh jahān built this palace which included kābul and kāshmīr afterwards severed from it on the invasion of nadir shāh on the upper part of the back wall is represented in the same precious stones and in a graceful attitude a european in a kind of spanish costume playing upon his guitar and in the character of orpheus charming the birds and beasts whichhe first taught the people of india so well to represent in this manner this i have no doubt was intended by austin de bordeaux for himself the man from shīrāz amānat khān who designed all the noble tughra characters in which the passages from the korān are inscribed upon different parts of the tāj at agra was permitted to place his own name in the same bold characters on the righthand side as we enter the tomb of the emperor and his queen it is inscribed after the date thus ah ad the humble fakīr amānat khān of shirāz austin was a still greater favourite than amānat khān and the emperor shāh jahān no doubt readily acceded to his wishes to have himself represented in what appeared to him and his courtiers so beautiful a picture the dīwānikhās or hall of private audience is a much more splendid building than the other from its richer materials being all built of white marble beautifully ornamented the roof is supported upon colonnades of marble pillars the throne stands in the centre of this hall and is ascended by steps and covered by a canopy with four artificial peacocks on the four corners here thought i as i entered this apartment sat aurangzēb when he ordered the assassination of his brothers dārā and murād and the imprisonment and destruction by slow poison of his son muhammad who had so often fought bravely by his side in battle here also but a few months before sat the great shāh jahān to receive the insolent commands of this same grandson muhammad when flushed with victory and to offer him the throne merely to disappoint the hopes of the youths father aurangzēb here stood in chains the graceful sulaimān to receive his sentence of death by slow poison with his poor young brother sipihr shikoh who had shared all his fathers toils and dangers and witnessed his brutal murder here sat muhammad shāh bandying compliments with his ferocious conqueror nādir shāh who had destroyed his armies plundered his treasury stripped his throne and ordered the murder of a hundred thousand of the helpless inhabitants of his capital men women and children in a general massacre the bodies of these people lay in the streets tainting the air while the two sovereigns sat here sipping their coffee and swearing to the most deliberate lies in the name of their god prophet and korānall are now dust that of the oppressor undistinguishable from that of the oppressed within this apartment and over the side arches at one end is inscribed in black letters the celebrated couplet if there be a paradise on the face of the earth it is thisit is thisit is this anything more unlike paradise than this place now is can hardly be conceived here are crowded together twelve hundred kings and queens for all the descendants of the emperors assume the title of salātīn the plural of sultan literally eating each other up government from motives of benevolence has here attempted to apportion out the pension they assign to the emperor to the different members of his great family circle who are to be subsisted upon it instead of leaving it to his own discretion this has perhaps tended to prevent the family from throwing off its useless members to mix with the common herd and to make the population press against the means of subsistence within these walls kings and queens of the house of tīmūr are to be found lying about in scores like broods of vermin without food to eat or clothes to cover their nakedness it has been proposed by some to establish colleges for them in the palace to fit them by education for high offices under our government were this done this pensioned family which never can possibly feel well affected towards our government or any government but their own would alone send out men enough to fill all the civil offices open to the natives of the country to the exclusion of the members of the humbler but better affected families of muhammadans and hindoos if they obtained the offices they would be educated for the evil to government and to society would be very great and if they did not get them the evil would be great to themselves since they would be encouraged to entertain hopes that could not be realized better let them shift for themselves and quietly sink among the crowd they would only become rallying points for the dissatisfaction and multiplied sources of disaffection everywhere doing mischief and nowhere doing good let loose upon society they everywhere disgust people by their insolence and knavery against which we are every day required to protect the people by our interference the prestige of their name will by degrees diminish and they will sink by and by into utter insignificance during his stay at jubbulpore kāmbaksh the nephew of the emperor whom i have already mentioned as the most sensible member of the family did an infinite deal of good by cheating almost all the tradesmen of the town till he came down among them with all his ragamuffins from delhi men thought the padshāhs and their progeny must be something superhuman something not to be spoken of much less approached without reverence during the latter part of his stay my court was crowded with complaints and no one has ever since heard a scion of the house of tīmūr spoken of but as a thing to be avoideda person more prone than others to take in his neighbours one of these kings who has not more than ten shillings a month to subsist himself and family upon will in writing to the representative of the british government address him as fidwī khās your particular slave and be addressed in reply with your majestys commands have been received by your slave i visited the college which is in the mausoleum of ghāzīuddīn a fine building with its usual accompaniment of a mosque and a college the slab that covers the grave and the marble screens that surround the ground that contains it are amongst the most richly cut things that i have seen the learned and pious muhammadans in the institution told me in my morning visit that there should always be a small hollow in the top of marble slabs like that on jahānārās whenever any of them were placed over graves in order to admit water earth and grass but that strictly speaking no slab should be allowed to cover the grave as it could not fail to be in the way of the dead when summoned to get up by the trumpet of azraīl on the day of the resurrection earthly pride said they has violated this rule and now everybody that can afford it gets a marble slab put over his grave but it is not only in this that men have been falling offfrom the letter and spirit of the law for we now hear drums beating and trumpets sounding even among the tombs of the saints a thing that our forefathers would not have considered possible in former days it was only a prophet like moses jesus or muhammad that was suffered to have a stone placed over his head i asked them how it was that the people crowded to the tombs of their saints as i saw them at that of kutb shāh in old delhi on the basant a hindoo festival it only shows said they that the end of the world is approaching are we not divided into seventytwo sects among ourselves all falling off into hinduism and every day committing greater and greater follies these are the manifest signs long ago pointed out by wise and holy men as indicating the approach of the last day a man might make a curious book out of the indications of the end of the world according to the notions of different people or different individuals the hindoos have had many different worlds or ages and the change from the good to the bad or the golden to the iron age is considered to have been indicated by a thousand curious incidents i one day asked an old hindoo priest a very worthy man what made the five heroes of the mahābhārata the demigod brothers of indian story leave the plains and bury themselves no one knew where in the eternal snows of the himālaya mountains why sir said he there is no question about that yudhisthira the eldest who reigned quietly at delhi after the long war one day sat down to dinner with his four brothers and their single wife draupadī for you know sir they had only one among them all the king said grace and the covers were removed when to their utter consternation a fullgrown fly was seen seated upon the dish of rice that stood before his majesty yudhisthira rose in consternation when flies begin to blow upon mens dinners said his majesty you may be sure my brothers that the end of the world is nearthe golden age is gonethe iron one has commenced and we must all be off the plains of india are no longer a fit abode for gentlemen without taking one morsel of food added the priest they set out and were never after seen or heard of they were however traced by manifest supernatural signs up through the valley of the ganges to the snow tops of the himālaya in which they no doubt left their mortal coils they seem to feel a singular attachment for the birthplace of their great progenitrix for no place in the world is i suppose more infested by them than delhi at present and there a dish of rice without a fly would in the iron be as rare a thing as a dish with one in the golden age muhammadans in india sigh for the restoration of the old muhammadan regime not from any particular attachment to the descendants of tīmūr but with precisely the same feelings that whigs and tories sigh for the return to power of their respective parties in england it would give them all the offices in a country where office is everything among them as among ourselves every man is disposed to rate his own abilities highly and to have a good deal of confidence in his own good luck and all think that if the field were once opened to them by such a change they should very soon be able to find good places for themselves and their children in it perhaps there are few communities in the world among whom education is more generally diffused than among muhammadans in india he who holds an office worth twenty rupees a month commonly gives his sons an education equal to that of a prime minister they learn through the medium of the arabic and persian languages what young men in our colleges learn through those of the greek and latinthat is grammar rhetoric and logic after his seven years of study the young muhammadan binds his turban upon a head almost as well filled with the things which appertain to these branches of knowledge as the young man raw from oxford he will talk as fluently about socrates and aristotle plato and hippocrates galen and avicenna alias sokrāt aristotalis aflātūn bokrāt jālīnus and bū alī sena and what is much to his advantage in india the languages in which he has learnt what he knows are those which he most requires through life he therefore thinks himself as well fitted to fill the high offices which are now filled exclusively by europeans and naturally enough wishes the establishments of that power would open them to him on the faculties and operations of the human mind on mans passions and affections and his duties in all relations of life the works of imām muhammad ghazālī and nāsiruddīn tūsī hardly yield to those of plato and aristotle or to those of any other authors who have written on the same subjects in any country these works the ihyaul ulūm epitomized into the kīmiāisaādat and the akhlāki nāsirī with the didactic poems of sādī are the great pierian spring of moral instruction from which the muhammadan delights to drink deep from infancy to old age and a better spring it would be difficult to find in the works of any other three men it is not only the desire for office that makes the educated muhammadans cherish the recollection of the old regime in hīndustan they say we pray every night for the emperor and his family because our forefathers ate the salt of his forefathers that is our ancestors were in the service of his ancestors and consequently were the aristocracy of the country whether they really were so matters not they persuade themselves or their children that they were this is a very common and a very innocent sort of vanity we often find englishmen in india and i suppose in all the rest of our foreign settlements sporting high tory opinions and feelings merely with a view to have it supposed that their families are or at some time were among the aristocracy of the land to express a wish for conservative predominance is the same thing with them as to express a wish for the promotion in the army navy or church of some of their near relations and thus to indicate that they are among the privileged class whose wishes the tories would be obliged to consult were they in power man is indeed fearfully and wonderfully made to be fitted himself for action in the world or for directing ably the actions of others it is indispensably necessary that he should mix freely from his youth up with his fellow men i have elsewhere mentioned that the state of imbecility to which a man of naturally average powers of intellect may be reduced when brought up with his mother in the seraglio is inconceivable to those who have not had opportunities of observing itthe poor old emperor of delhi to whom so many millions look up is an instance a more venerablelooking man it is difficult to conceive and had he been educated and brought up with his fellow men he would no doubt have had a mind worthy of his person as it is he has never been anything but a baby rājā jīvan rām an excellent portrait painter and a very honest and agreeable person was lately employed to take the emperors portrait after the first few sittings the portrait was taken into the seraglio to the ladies the next time he came the emperor requested him to remove the great blotch from under the nose may it please your majesty it is impossible to draw any person without a shadow and i hope many millions will long continue to repose under that of your majesty true rājā said his majesty men must have shadows but there is surely no necessity for placing them immediately under their noses the ladies will not allow mine to be put there they say it looks as if i had been taking snuff all my life and it certainly has a most filthy appearance besides it is all awry as i told you when you began upon it the rājā was obliged to remove from under the imperial and certainly very noble nose the shadow which he had thought worth all the rest of the picture queen elizabeth is said by an edict to have commanded all artists who should paint her likeness to place her in a garden with a full light upon her and the painter to put any shadow in her face at his peril the next time the rājā came the emperor took the opportunity of consulting him upon a subject that had given him a good deal of anxiety for many months the dismissal of one of his personal servants who had become negligent and disrespectful he first took care that no one should be within hearing and then whispered in the artists ear that he wished to dismiss this man the rājā said carelessly as he looked from the imperial head to the canvas why does your majesty not discharge the man if he displeases you why do i not discharge him i wish to do so of course and have wished to do so for many months but kuchh tadbīr chāhiye some plan of operations must be devised if your majesty dislikes the man you have only to order him outside the gates of the palace and you are relieved from his presence at once true man i am relieved from his presence but his enchantments may still reach me it is them that i most dreadhe keeps me in a continual state of alarm and i would give anything to get him away in a good humour when the rājā return to meerut he received a visit from one of the emperors sons or nephews who wanted to see the place his tents were pitched upon the plain not far from the theatre he arrived in the evening and there happened to be a play that night several times during the night he got a message from the prince to say that the ground near his tents was haunted by all manner of devils the rājā sent to assure him that this could not possibly be the case at last a man came about midnight to say that the prince could stand it no longer and had given orders to prepare for his immediate return to delhi for the devils were increasing so rapidly that they must all be inevitably devoured before daybreak if they remained the rājā now went to the princes camp here he found him and his followers in a state of utter consternation looking towards the theatre the last carriages were leaving the theatre and going across the plain and these silly people had taken them all for devils the present pensioned imperial family f delhi are commonly considered to be of the house of tīmūr lang the lame because bābur the real founder of the dynasty was descended from him in the seventh stage tīmūr merely made a predatory inroad into india to kill a few million of unbelievers plunder the country of all the movable valuables he and his soldiers could collect and take back into slavery all the best artificers of all kinds that they could lay their hands upon he left no one to represent him in india he claimed no sovereignty and founded no dynasty there there is no doubt much in the prestige of a name and though six generations had passed away the people of northern india still trembled at that of the lame monster bābur wished to impress upon the minds of the people the notion that he had at his back the same army of demons that tīmūr had commanded and be boasted his descent from him for the same motive that alexander boasted his from the horned and clovenfooted god of the egyptian desert as something to sanctify all enterprises justify the use of all means and carry before him the belief in his invincibility bābur was an admirable chiefa fit founder of a great dynastya very proper object for the imagination of future generations to dwell upon though not quite so good as his grandson the great akbar tīmūr was a ferocious monster who knew how to organize and command the set of demons who composed his army and how best to direct them for the destruction of the civilized portion of mankind and their works but who knew nothing else in his invasion of india he caused the people of the towns and villages through which he passed to be all massacred without regard to religion age or sex if the soldiers in the town resisted the people were all murdered because they did so if they did not the people were considered to have forfeited their lives to the conquerors for being conquered and told to purchase them by the surrender of all their property the value of which was estimated by commissaries appointed for the purpose the price was always more than they could pay and after torturing a certain number to death in the attempt to screw the sum out of them the troops were let in to murder the rest so that no city town or village escaped and the very grain collected for the army over and above what they could consume at any stage was burned lest it might relieve some hungry infidel of the country who had escaped from the general carnage all the soldiers high and low were murdered when taken prisoners as a matter of course but the officers and soldiers of tīmūrs army after taking all the valuable movables thought they might be able to find a market for the artificers by whom they were made and for their families and they collected together an immense number of men women and children all who asked for mercy pretended to be able to make something that these tartars had taken a liking to oncoming before delhi tīmūrs army encamped on the opposite or left bank of the river jumna and here he learned that his soldiers had collected together above one hundred thousand of these artificers besides their women and children there were no soldiers among them but tīmūr thought it might be troublesome either to keep them or to turn them away without their women and children and still more so to make his soldiers send away these women and children immediately he asked whether the prisoners were not for the most part unbelievers in his prophet muhammad and being told that the majority were hindoos he gave orders that every man should be put to death and that any officer or soldier who refused to kill or have killed all such men should suffer death as soon as this order was made known says tīmūrs historian and great eulogist the officers and soldiers began to put it in execution and in less than one hour one hundred thousand prisoners according to the smallest computation were put to death and their bodies thrown into the river jumna among the rest mulānā nasīrud dīn amr one of the most venerable doctors of the court who would never consent so much as to kill a single sheep was constrained to order fifteen slaves whom he had in his tents to be slain tīmūr then gave orders that onetenth of his soldiers should keep watch over the indian women children and camels taken in the pillage the city was soon after taken and the people commanded as usual to purchase their lives by the surrender of their propertytroops were sent in to take itnumbers were tortured to deathand then the usual pillage and massacre of the whole people followed without regard to religion age or sex and about a hundred thousand more of innocent and unoffending people were murdered the troops next massacred the inhabitants of the old city which had become crowded with fugitives from the new the last remnant took refuge in a mosque where two of tīmūrs most distinguished generals rushed in upon them at the head of five hundred soldiers and as the amiable historian tells us sent to the abyss of hell the souls of these infidels of whose heads they erected towers and gave their bodies for food to birds and beasts of prey being at last tired of slaughter the soldiers made slaves of the survivors and drove them out in chains and as they passed the officers were allowed to select any they liked except the masons whom tīmūr required to build for him at samarkand a church similar to that of īltutmish in old delhi he now set out to take meerut which was at that time a fortified town of much note the people determined to defend themselves and happened to say that tarmah shirīn who invaded india at the head of a similar body of tartars a century before had been unable to take the place this so incensed tīmūr that he brought all his forces to bear on meerut took the place and having had all the hindoo men found in it skinned alive he distributed their wives and children among his soldiers as slaves he now sent out a division of his army to murder unbelievers and collect plunder over the cultivated plains between the ganges and jumna while he led the main body on the same pious duty along the hills from hardwār on the ganges to the west having massacred a few thousands of the hill people tīmūr read the noon prayer and returned thanks to god for the victories he had gained and the numbers he had murdered through his goodness and told his admiring army that a religions war like this produced two great advantages it secured eternal happiness in heaven and a good store of valuable spoils on earththat his design in all the fatigues and labours which he had undertaken was solely to render himself pleasing to god treasure up good works for his eternal happiness and get riches to bestow upon his soldiers and the poor the historian makes a grave remark upon this invasion the korān declares that the highest glory man can attain in this world is unquestionably waging a successful war in person against the enemies of his religion no matter whether those against whom it is waged happen ever to have heard of this religion or not muhammad inculcated the same doctrine in his discourses with his friends and in consequence the great tīmūr always strove to exterminate all the unbelievers with a view to acquire that glory and to spread the renown of his conquests my name said he has spread terror through the universe and the least motion i make is capable of shaking the whole earth tīmūr returned to his capital of samarkand in transoxiana in may his army besides other things which they brought from india had an immense number of men women and children whom they had reduced to slavery and driven along like flocks of sheep to forage for their subsistence in the countries through which they passed or perish after the murder on the banks of the jumna of part of the multitude they had collected before taking the capital amounting to one hundred thousand men tīmūr was obliged to assign onetenth of his army to guard what were left the women and children after the murder in the capital of delhi says the historian an eyewitness there were some soldiers who had a hundred and fifty slaves men women and children whom they drove out of the city before them and some soldiers boys had twenty slaves to their own share on reaching samarkand they employed these slaves as best they could and tīmūr employed his the masons in raising his great church from the quarries of the neighbouring hills in october following tīmūr led this army of demons over the rich and polished countries of syria anatolia and georgia levelling all the cities towns and villages and massacring the inhabitants without any regard to age or sex with the same amiable view of correcting the notions of people regarding his creed propitiating the deity and rewarding his soldiers he sent to the christian inhabitants of smyrna then one of the first commercial cities in the world to request that they would at once embrace muhammadanism in the beauties of which the general and his soldiers had orders generously and diligently to instruct them they refused and tīmūr repaired immediately to the spot that he might share in the merit of sending their souls to the abyss of hell bajazet the turkish emperor of anatolia had recently terminated an unavailing siege of seven years tīmūr took the city in fourteen days december had every man womanand child that he found in it murdered and caused some of the heads of the christians to be thrown by his balistas or catapultas into the ships that had come from different european nations to their succour all other christian communities found within the wide range of this dreadful tempest were swept off in the same manner nor did muhammadan communities fare better after the taking of baghdad every tartar soldier was ordered to cut off and bring away the head of one or more prisoners because some of the tartar soldiers had been killed in the attack and they spared says the historian neither old men of fourscore nor young children of eight years of age no quarter was given either to rich or poor and the number of dead was so great that they could not be counted towers were made of their heads to serve as an example to posterity ninety thousand were murdered in cold blood and one hundred and twenty pyramids were made of the heads for trophies damascus nice aleppo sebastē and all the other rich and populous cities of palestine syria asia minor and georgia then the most civilized region of the world shared in the same fate all were reduced to ruins and their people without regard to religion age or sex barbarously and brutally murdered in the beginning of this man recollected that among the many millions of unbelieving christians and hindoos whose souls he had sent to the abyss of hell there were many muhammadans who had no doubt whatever in the divine origin or coeternal existence of the korān and as their death might perhaps not have been altogether pleasing to his god and his prophet he determined to appease them both by undertaking the murder of some two hundred millions of industrious and unoffending chinese among whom there was little chance of finding one man who had ever even heard of the korānmuch less believed in its divinity and coeternityor of its interpreter muhammad at the head of between two and three hundred thousand wellmounted tartars and their followers he departed from his capital of samarkand on the th of january and crossed the jaxartes on the ice in the words of his judicious historian he thus generously undertook the conquest of china which was inhabited only by unbelievers that by so good a work he might atone for what had been done amiss in other wars in which the blood of so many of the faithful had been shed as all my vast conquests said tīmūr himself have caused the destruction of a good many of the faithful i am resolved to perform some good action to atone for the crimes of my past life and to make war upon the infidels and exterminate the idolaters of china which cannot be done without very great strength and power it is therefore fitting my dear companions in arms that those very soldiers who were the instruments whereby those my faults were committed should be the means by which i work out my repentance and that they should march into china to acquire for themselves and their emperor the merit of that holy war in demolishing the temples of those unbelievers and erecting good muhammadan mosques in their places by this means we shall obtain pardon for all our sins for the holy korān assures us that good works efface the sins of this world at the close of the emperors speech the princes of the blood and other officers of rank besought god to bless his generous undertaking unanimously applauding his sentiments and loading him with praises let the emperor but display his standard and we will follow him to the end of the world tīmūr died soon after crossing the jaxartes on the st of april and china was saved from this dreadful scourge but as the philosophical historian sharafuddīn profoundly observes the korān remarks that if any one in his pilgrimage to mecca should be surprised by death the merit of the good work is still written in heaven in his name as surely as if he had had the good fortune to accomplish it it is the same with regard to the ghaza holy war where an eternal merit is acquired by troubles fatigues and dangers and he who dies during the enterprise at whatever stage is deemed to have completed his design thus tīmūr the lame had the merit beyond all question of doubt of sending to the abyss of hell two hundred millions of men women and children for not believing in a certain book of which they had never heard or read for the tartars had not become muhammadans when they conquered china in the beginning of the thirteenth century indeed the amiable and profound historian is of opinion after the most mature deliberation that god himself must have arranged all this in favour of so great and good a prince and knowing that his end was nigh inspired him with the idea of undertaking this enterprise that he might have the merit of having completed it otherwise how should he have thought of leading out his army in the dead of winter to cross countries covered with ice and snow the heir to the throne the prince pīr muhammad was absent when tīmūr died but his wives who had accompanied him were all anxious to share in the merit of the holy undertaking and in a council of the chiefs held after his death the opinions of these amiable princesses prevailed that the two hundred millions of chinese ought still to be sent to the abyss of hell since it had been the earnest wish of their deceased husband and must undoubtedly have been the will of god to send them thither without delay fortunately quarrels soon arose among his sons and grandsons about the succession and the army recrossed the jaxartes still over the ice in the beginning of april and china was saved from this scourge such was timūr the lame the man whose greatness and goodness are to live in the hearts of the people of india ninetenths of whom are hindoos and to fill them with overflowing love and gratitude towards his descendants in this brief sketch will perhaps be found the true history of the origin of the gipsies the tide of whose immigration began to flow over all parts of europe immediately after the return of tīmūr from india the hundreds of thousands of slaves which his army brought from india in men women and children were cast away when they got as many as they liked from the more beautiful and polished inhabitants of the cities of palestine syria asia minor and georgia which were all one after the other treated in the same manner as delhi had been the tartar soldiers had no time to settle down and employ them as they intended for their convenience they were marched off to ravage western asia in october about three months after their return from india tīmūr reached samarkand in the middle of may but he had gone on in advance of his army which did not arrive for some time after being cast off the slaves from india spread over thosecountries which were most likely to afford them the means of subsistence as beggars for they knew nothing of the manners the arts or the language of those among whom they were thrown and as arabia palestine syria anatolia georgia circassia and russia had been or were being desolated by the army of this tartar chief they passed into egypt and bulgaria whence they spread over all other countries scattered over the face of these countries they found small parties of vagrants who were from the same regions as themselves who spoke the same language and who had in all probability been drawn away by the same means of armies returning from the invasion of india chingīz khān invaded india two centuries before his descendant tarmah shirīn invaded india in and must have taken back with him multitudes of captives the unhappy prisoners of tīmūr the lame gathered round these nuclei as the only people who could understand or sympathize with them from his sixth expedition into india mahmūd is said to have carried back with him to ghaznī two hundred thousand hindoo captives in a state of slavery ad from his seventh expedition in his army of one hundred and forty thousand fighting men returned laden with hindoo captives who became so cheap that a hindoo slave was valued at less than two rupees mahmūd made several expeditions to the west immediately after his return from india in the same manner as tīmūr did after him and he may in the same manner have scattered his indian captives they adopted the habits of their new friends which are indeed those of all the vagrant tribes of india and they have continued to preserve them to the present day i have compared their vocabularies with those of india and find so many of the words the same that i think a native of india would even in the present day be able without much difficulty to make himself understood by a gang of gipsies in any part of europe a good christian may not be able exactly to understand the nature of the merit which tamerlane expected to acquire from sending so many unoffending chinese to the abyss of hell according to the muhammadan creed god has vowed to fill hell chock full of men and genii hence his reasons for hardening their hearts against that faith in the korān which might send them to heaven and which would they think necessarily follow an impartial examination of the evidence of its divinity and certainty tīmūr thought no doubt that it would be very meritorious on his part to assist god in this his labour of filling the great abyss by throwing into it all the existing population of china while he spread over their land in pastoral tribes the goodly seed of muhammadanism which would give him a rich supply of recruits for paradise the following dialogue took place one day between me and the muftī or head muhammadan law officer of one of our regulation courts does it not seem to you strange muftī sāhib that your prophet who according to your notions must have been so well acquainted with the universe and the laws that govern it should not have revealed to his followers some great truths hitherto unknown regarding these laws which might have commanded their belief and that of all future generations in his divine mission not at all said the muftī they would probably not have understood him and if they had those who did not believe in what he did actually reveal to them would not have believed in him had he revealed all the laws that govern the universe and why should they not have believed in him because what he revealed was sufficient to convince all men whose hearts had not been hardened in unbelief god said as for the unbelievers it is the same with them whether you admonish them or do not admonish them they will not believe god hath sealed up their hearts their ears and their eyes and a grievous punishment awaits them and why were the hearts of any men thus hardened to unbelief when by unbelief they were to incur such dreadful penalties because they were otherwise wicked men but you think of course that there was really much of good in the revelations of your prophet of course we do and that those who believed in it were likely to become better men for their faith assuredly then why harden the hearts of even bad men against a faith that might make them good has not god said if we had pleased we had certainly given unto every soul its direction but the word which hath proceeded from me must necessarily be fulfilled when i said verily i will fill hell with men and genii altogether and again had it pleased the lord he would have made all men of one religion but they shall not cease to differ among them unless those on whom the lord shall have mercy and unto this hath he created them for the word of thy lordshall be fulfilled when he said verily i will fill hell altogether with genii and men you all believe that the devil like all the angels was made of fire yes and that he was doomed to hell because he would not fall down and worship adam who was made of clay yes god commanded him to bow down to adam and when he did not do as he was bid god said why iblīs what hindered thee from bowing down to adam as the other angels did he replied it is not fit that i should worship man whom thou hast formed of dried clay or black mud god said get thee therefore hence for thou shalt be pelted with stones and a curse shall be upon thee till the day of judgement the devil said o lord give me respite unto the day of resurrection god said verily thou shalt be respited until the appointed time and does it not appear to you mufti sāhib that in respiting the devil iblīs till the day of resurrection some injustice was done to the children of adam how because he replies o lord because thou hast seduced me i will surely tempt men to disobedience in the earth no sir because he could only tempt those who were predestined to go astray for he adds i will seduce all except such of them as shall be thy chosen servants god said this is the right way with me verily as to my servants thou shalt have no power over them but over those only who shall be seduced and who shall follow thee and hell is surely denounced to them all then you think mufti sāhib that the devil could seduce only such as were predestined to go astray and who would have gone astray whether he the devil had been respited or not certainly i do does it not then appear to you that it is as unjust to predestine men to do that for which they are to be sent to hell as it would be to leave them all unguided to the temptations of the devil these are difficult questions replied the muftī which we cannot venture to ask even ourselves all that we can do is to endeavour to understand what is written in the holy book and act according to it god made us all and he has the right to do what he pleases with what he has made the potter makes two vessels he dashes the one on the ground but the other he sells to stand in the palaces of princes but a pot has no soul muftī sāhib to be roasted to all eternity in hell true sir these are questions beyond the reach of human understanding how often do you read over the korān i read the whole over about three times a month replied the muftī i mentioned this conversation one day to the nawāb alīuddīn a most estimable old gentleman of seventy years of age who resides at murādābād and asked him whether he did not think it a singular omission on the part of muhammad after his journey to heaven not to tell mankind some of the truths that have since been discovered regarding the nature of the bodies that fill these heavens and the laws that govern their motions mankind could not either from the korān or from the traditions perceive that he was at all aware of the errors of the system of astronomy that prevailed in his day and among his people not at all replied the nawāb the prophets had no doubt abundant opportunities of becoming acquainted with the heavenly bodies and the laws which govern them particularly those who like muhammad had been up through the seven heavens but their thoughts were so entirely taken up with the deity that they probably never noticed the objects by which he was surrounded and if they had noticed them they would not perhaps have thought it necessary to say anything about them their object was to direct mens thoughts towards god and his commandments and to instruct them in their duties towards him and towards each other suppose continued the nawāb you were to be invited to see and converse with even your earthly sovereign would not your thoughts be too much taken up with him to admit of your giving on your return an account of the things you saw about him i have been several times to see you and i declare that i have been so much taken up with the conversations which have passed that i have never noticed the many articles i now see around me nor could i have told any one onmy return home what i had seen in your roomthe wallshades the pictures the sofas the tables the bookcases continued he casting his eyes round the room all escaped my notice and might have escaped it had my eyes been younger and stronger than they are what then must have been the state of mind of those great prophets who were admitted to see and converse with the great creator of the universe and were sent by him to instruct mankind i told my old friend that i thought his answer the best that could be given but still that we could not help thinking that if muhammad had really been acquainted with the nature of the heavenly bodies and the laws which govern them he would have taken advantage of his knowledge to secure more firmly their faith in his mission and have explained to them the real state of the case instead of talking about the stars as merely made to be thrown at devils to give light to men upon this little globe of ours and to guide them in their wanderings upon it by sea and land but what said the nawāb are the great truths that you would have had our holy prophet to teach mankind why nawāb sahib i would have had him tell us amongst other things of that law which makes this our globe and the other planets revolve round the sun and their moons around them i would have had him teach us something of the nature of the things we call comets or stars with large tails and of that of the fixed stars which we suppose to be suns like our sun with planets revolving round them like ours since it is clear that they do not borrow their light from our sun nor from anything that we can discover in the heavens i would also have had him tell us the nature of that white belt which crosses the sky which you call the ovarious belt khattiabyāz and we the milkyway and which we consider to be a collection of selflighted stars while many orthodox but unlettered musalmāns think it the marks made in the sky by borak the roughshod donkey on which your prophet rode from jerusalem to heaven and you think nawāb sāhib that there was quite evidence enough to satisfy any person whose heart had not been hardened to unbelief and that no description of the heavenly bodies or of the laws which govern their motion could have had any influence on the minds of such people assuredly i do sir has not god said if we should open a gate in the heavens above them and they should ascend thereto all the day long they would surely say our eyes are only dazzled or rather we are a people deluded by enchantments do you think sir that anything which his majesty moses could have said about the planets and the comets and the milky way would have tended so much to persuade the children of israel of his divine mission as did the single stroke of his rod which brought a river of delicious water gushing from a dry rock when they were all dying from thirst when our holy prophet continued the nawāb placing the points of the four fingers of his right hand on the table placed his blessed hand thus on the ground and caused four streams to gush out from the dug plain and supply with fresh water the whole army which was perishing from thirst and when out of only five small dates he afterwards feasted this immense army till they could eat no more he surely did more to convince his followers of his divine mission than he could have done by any discourse about the planets and the milky way khattiabyāz no doubt nawāb sāhib these were very powerful arguments for those who saw them or believed them to have been seen and those who doubt the divinity of your prophets mission are those who doubt their ever having been seen the whole army saw and attested them sir and that is evidence enough for us and those who saw them and were not satisfied must have had their hearts hardened to unbelief and you think nawāb sāhib that a man is not master of his own belief or disbelief in religions matters though he is rewarded by an eternity of bliss in paradise for the one and punished by an eternity of scorching in hell for the other i do sir faith is a matter of feeling and over our feelings we have no control all that we can do is to prevent their influencing our actions when these actions would be mischievous i have a desire to stretch out this arm and crush that fly on the table i can control the act and do so but the desire is not under my control true nawāb sāhib and in this life we punish men not for their feelings which are beyond their control but for their acts over which they have no control and we are apt to think that the deity will do the same there are sir continued the nawāb three kinds of certaintythe moral certainty the mathematical and the religious certainty which we hold to be the greatest of allthe one in which the mind feels entire repose this repose i feel in everything that is written in the korān in the bible and with the few known exceptions in the new testament we do not believe that christ was the son of god though we believe him to have been a great prophet sent down to enlighten mankind nor do we believe that he was crucified we believe that the wicked jews got hold of a thief and crucified him in the belief that he was the christ but the real christ was we think taken up into heaven and not suffered to be crucified but nawāb sāhib the sikhs have their book in which they have the same faith true sir but the sikhs are unlettered ignorant brutes and you do not i hope call their granth a booka thing written only the other day and full of nonsense no book has appeared since the korān came down from heaven nor will anyother come till the day of judgement and how said the nawāb have people in modern days made all the discoveries you speak of in astronomy

in the world where a great city could be approached by such a road from the largest military station in the empire not more than three stages distant after breakfast the head native police officer of the division came to pay his respects he talked of the dreadful murders which used to be perpetrated in this neighbourhood by miscreants who found shelter in the territories of the bēgam samrū whither his followers dared not hunt for them and mentioned a case of nine persons who had been murdered just within the boundary of our territories about seven years before and thrown into a dry well he was present at the inquest held on their bodies and described their appearance and i found that they were the bodies of a news writer from lahore who with his eight companions had been murdered by thugs on his way back to rohilkhand i had long before been made acquainted with the circumstances of this murder and the perpetrators had all been secured but we wanted this link in the chain of evidence it had been described to me as having taken place within the boundary of the bēgams territory and i applied to her for a report on the inquest she declared that no bodies had been discovered about the time mentioned and i concluded that the ignorance of the people of the neighbourhood was pretended as usual in such cases with a view to avoid a summons to give evidence in our courts i referred forthwith to the magistrate of the district and found the report that i wanted and thereby completed the chain of evidence upon a very important case the thānadār seemed much surprised to find that i was so well acquainted with the circumstances of this murder but still more that the perpetrators were not the poor old bēgams subjects but our own the police officers employed on our borders find it very convenient to trace the perpetrators of all murders and gang robberies into the territories of native chiefs whose subjects they accuse often when they know that the crimes have been committed by our own they are on the one hand afraid to seize or accuse the real offenders lest they should avenge themselves by some personal violence or by thefts or robberies which they often commit with a view to get them tumed out of office as inefficient and on the other they are tempted to conceal the real offenders by a liberal share of the spoil and a promise of not offending again within their beat their tenure of office is far too insecure and their salaries are far too small they are often dismissed summarily by the magistrate if they send him in no prisoners and also if they send in to him prisoners who are not ultimately convicted because a magistrates merits are too often estimated by the proportion that his convictions bear to his acquittals among the prisoners committed for trial to the sessions men are often ultimately acquitted for want of judicial proof when there is abundance of that moral proof on which a police officer or magistrate has to act in the discharge of his duties and in a country where gangs of professional and hereditary robbers and murderers extend their depredations into very remote parts and seldom commit them in the districts in which they reside the most vigilant police officer must often fail to discover the perpetrators of heavy crimes that take place within his range when they cannot find them the native officers either seize innocent persons and frighten them into confession or else they try to conceal the crime and in this they are seconded by the sufferers in the robbery who will always avoid if they can a prosecution in our courts and by their neighbours who dread being summoned to give evidence as a serious calamity the man who has been robbed instead of being an object of compassion among his neighbours often incurs their resentment for subjecting them to this calamity and they not only pay largely themselves but make him pay largely to have his losses concealed from the magistrate formerly when a district was visited by a judge of circuit to hold his sessions only once or twice a year and men were constantly bound over to prosecute and appear as evidence from sessions to sessions till they were wearied and worried to death this evil was much greater than at present when every district is provided with its judge of sessions who is or ought to be always ready to take up the cases committed for trial by the magistrate this was one of the best measures of lord w bentincks admirable though much abused administration of the government of india still however the inconvenience and delay of prosecution in our courts are so great and the chance of the ultimate conviction of great offenders is so small that strong temptations are held out to the police to conceal or misrepresent the character of crimes and they must have a great feeling of security in their tenure of office and more adequate salaries better chances of rising and better supervision over them before they will resist such temptation these thānadārs and all the public officers under them are all so very inadequately paid that corruption among them excites no feeling of odium or indignation in the minds of those among whom they live and serve such feelings are rather directed against the government that places them in such situations of so much labour and responsibility with salaries so inadequate and thereby confers upon them virtually a licence to pay themselves bypreying upon those whom they are employed ostensibly to protect they know that with such salaries they can never have the reputation of being honest however faithfully they may discharge their duties and it is too hard to expect that men will long submit to the necessity of being thought corrupt without reaping some of the advantages of corruption let the thānadārs have everywhere such salaries as will enable them to maintain their families in comfort and keep up that appearance of respectability which their station in society demands and over every three or four thānadārs jurisdiction let there be an officer appointed upon a higher scale of salary to supervise and control their proceedings and armed with powers to decide minor offences to these higher stations the thānadārs will be able to look forward as their reward for a faithful and zealous discharge of their duties he who can suppose that men so inadequately paid who have no promotion to look forward to and feel no security in their tenure of office and consequently no hope of a provision for old age will be zealous and honest in the discharge of their duties must be very imperfectly acquainted with human nature and with the motives by which men are influenced in all quarters of the world but we are none of us so ignorant for we all know that the same motives actuate public servants in india as elsewhere we have acted successfully upon this knowledge in the scale of salaries and gradation of rank assigned to european civil functionaries and to all native functionaries employed in the judicial and revenue branches of the public service and why not act upon it in that of the salaries assigned to the native officers employed in the police the magistrate of a district gets a salary of from two thousand to two thousand five hundred rupees a month the native officer next under him is the thānadār or head native police officer of a subdivision of his district containing many towns and villages with a population of a hundred thousand souls this officer gets a salary of twentyfive rupees a month he cannot possibly do his duty unless he keeps one or two horses indeed he is told by the magistrate that he cannot and that he must have one or two horses or resign his post the people seeing how much we expect from the thānadār and how little we give him submit to his demands for contributions without murmuring and consider almost any demand trivial from a man so employed and so paid they are confounded at our inconsistency and say we see you giving high salaries and high prospects of advancement to men who have nothing to do but collect your rents and decide our disputes about pounds shillings and pence which we used to decide much better ourselves when we had no other court but that of our elderswhile those who are to protect life and property to keep peace over the land and enable the industrious to work in security maintain their families and pay the government revenue are left with hardly any pay at all there is really nothing in our rule in india which strikes the people so much as this inconsistency the evil effects of which are so great and manifest the only way to remedy the evil is to give a greater feeling of security in the tenure of office a higher rate of salary the hope of a provision for old age and above all the gradation of rank by interposing the officers i speak of between the thānadārs and the magistrate this has all been done in the establishments for the collection of the revenue and administration of civil justice hobbes in his leviathan says and seeing that the end of punishment is not revenge and discharge of choler but correction either of the offender or of others by his example the severest punishments are to be inflicted for those crimes that are of most danger to the public such as are those which proceed from malice to the government established those that spring from contempt of justice those that provoke indignation in the multitude and those which unpunished seem authorized as when they are committed by sons servants or favourites of men in authority for indignation carrieth men not only against the actors and authors of injustice but against all power that is likely to protect them as in the case of tarquin when for the insolent act of one of his sons he was driven out of rome and the monarchy itself dissolved para chapter almost every one of our thānadārs is in his way a little tarquin exciting the indignation of the people against his rulers and no time should be lost in converting him into something better by the obstacles which are still everywhere opposed to the conviction of offenders in the distance of our courts the forms of procedure and other causes of the laws delay we render the duties of our police establishment everywhere more honoured in the breach than the observance by the mass of the people among whom they are placed we must as i have before said remove some of these obstacles to the successful prosecution of offenders in our criminal courts which tend so much to deprive the government of all popular aid and support in the administration of justice and to convert all our police establishments into instruments of oppression instead of what they should be the efficient means of protection to the persons property and character of the innocent crimes multiply from the assurance the guilty are everywhere apt to feel of impunity to crime and the more crimes multiply the greater is the aversion the people everywhere feel to aid the government in the arrest and conviction of criminals because they see more and more the innocent punished by attendance upon distant courts at great cost and inconvenience to give evidence upon points which seem to them unimportant while the guilty escape owing to technical difficulties which they can never understand the best way to remove these obstacles is to interpose officers between the thānadār and the magistrate and arm them with judicial powers to try minor cases leaving an appeal open to the magistrate and to extend the final jurisdiction of the magistrate to a greater range of crimes though it should involve the necessity of reducing the measure of punishment annexed to them beccaria has justly observed that crimes are more effectually prevented by thecertainty than by the severity of punishment the certainty of a small punishment will make a stronger impression than the fear of one more severe if attended with the hope of escaping for it is the nature of mankind to be terrified at the approach of the smallest inevitable evil whilst hope the best gift of heaven has the power of dispelling the apprehensions of a greater especially if supported by examples of impunity which weakness or avarice too frequently affords i ought to have mentioned that the police of a district in our bengal territories consists of a magistrate and his assistant who are european gentlemen of the civil service and a certain number of thānadārs from twelve to sixteen who preside over the different subdivisions of the district in which they reside with their establishments these thānadārs get twentyfive rupees a month have under them four or five jemadārs upon eight rupees and thirty or forty barkandāzes upon four rupees a month the jemadārs are most of them placed in charge of nākas or subdivisions of the thānadārs jurisdiction the rest are kept at their headquarters ready to move to any point where their services may be required these are all paid by government but there is in each village one watchman and in larger villages more than one who are appointed by the heads of villages and paid by the communities and required daily or periodically to report all the police matters of their villages to the thānadārs the distance between the magistrates and thānadārs is at present immeasurable and an infinite deal of mischief is done by the latter and those under them of which the magistrates know nothing whatever in the first place they levy a fee of one rupee from every village at the festival of the holī in february and another at that of the dasehra in october and in each thānadārs jurisdiction there are from one to two hundred villages these and numerous other unauthorized exactions they share with those under them and with the native officers about the person of the magistrate who if not conciliated can always manage to make them appear unfit for their places a robbery affords a rich harvest some article of stolen property is found in one mans house and by a little legerdemain it is conveyed to that of another both of whom are made to pay liberally the man robbed also pays and all the members of the village community are made to do the same they are all called to the court of the thānadār to give evidence as to what they have seen or heard regarding either the fact or the persons in the remotest degree connected with itas to the arrests of the supposed offendersthe search of their housethe character of their grandmothers and grandfathers and they are told that they are to be sent to the magistrate a hundred miles distant and then made to stand at the door among a hundred and fifty pairs of shoes till his excellency the nāzir the undersheriff of the court may be pleased to announce them to his highness the magistrate which of course he will not do without a consideration to escape all these threatened evils they pay handsomely and depart in peace the thānadār reports that an attempt to rob a house by persons unknown had been defeated by his exertions and the good fortune of the magistrate and sends a liberal share of spoil to those who are to read his report to that functionary this goes on more or less in every district but more especially in those where the magistrate happens to be a man of violent temper who is always surrounded by knaves because men who have any regard for their character will not approach himor a weak goodnatured man easily made to believe anything and managed by favouritesor one too fond of fieldsports or of music painting european languages literature and sciences or lastly of his own ease some magistrates think they can put down crime by dismissing the thānadār but this tends only to prevent crimes being reported to him for in such cases the feelings of the people are in exact accordance with the interests of the thānadārs and crimes augment by the assurance of impunity thereby given to criminals the only remedy for all this evil is to fill up the great gulf between the magistrate and thānadār by officers who shall be to him what i have described the patrol officers to be to the collectors of customs at once the tapis of prince husain and the telescope of prince alia medium that will enable him to be everywhere and see everything and why is this remedy not applied simply and solely because such appointments would be given to the uncovenanted and might tend indirectly to diminish the appointments open to the covenanted servants of the company young gentlemen of the civil service are supposed to be doing the duties which would be assigned to such officers while they are at school as assistants to magistrates and collectors and were this great gulf filled up by efficient covenanted officers they would have no school to go to there is no doubt some truth in this but the welfare of a whole people should not be sacrificed to keep this school or playground open exclusively for them let them act for a time as they would unwillingly do with the uncovenanted and they will learn much more than if they occupied the ground exclusively and acted alonethey will be always with people ready and willing to tell them the real state of things whereas at present they are always with those who studiously conceal it from them it is a common practice with thānadārs all over the country to connive at the residence within their jurisdiction of gangs of robbers on the condition that they shall not rob within those limits and shall give them a share of what they bring back from their distant expeditions they scil the gangs go out ostensibly in search of service on the termination of the rains of one season in october and return before the commencement of the next in june but their vocation is always well known to the police and to all the people of their neighbourhood and very often to the magistrates themselves who could if they would secure them on their return with their booty but this would not secure their conviction unless the proprietors could be discovered which they scarcely ever could were the police officers to seize them they would be all finally acquitted and released by the judgesthe magistrate would get into disrepute with his superiors by the number of acquittals compared withconvictions exhibited in his monthly tables and he would vent his spleen upon the poor thānadār who would at the same time have incurred the resentment of the robbers and between both he would have no possible chance of escape he therefore consults his own interest and his own case by leaving them to carry on their trade of robbery or murder unmolested and his master the magistrate is well pleased not to be pestered with charges against men whom he has no chance of getting ultimately convicted it was in this way that so many hundred families of assassins by profession were able for so many generations to reside in the most cultivated and populous parts of our territories and extend their depredations into the remotest parts of india before our system of operations was brought to bear upon them in their profession was perfectly well known to the people of the districts in which they resided and to the greater part of the police they murdered not within their own district and the police of that district cared nothing about what they might do beyond it the most respectable native gentleman in the city and district told me one day an amusing instance of the proceedings of a native officer of that district which occurred about five years ago in a village which he had purchased and let in farms a shopkeeper was one day superintending the cutting of some sugarcane which he had purchased from a cultivator as it stood his name was girdhārī i think and the boy who was cutting it for him was the son of a poor man called madārī girdhārī wanted to have the cane cut down as near as he could to the ground while the boy to save himself the trouble of stooping would persist in cutting it a good deal too high up after admonishing him several times the shopkeeper gave him a smart clout on the head the boy to prevent a repetition called out murder girdhārī has killed megirdhārī has killed me his old father who was at work carrying away the cane at a little distance out of sight ran off to the village watchman and in his anger told him that girdhārī had murdered his son the watchman went as fast as he could to the thānadār or head police officer of the division who resided some miles distant the thānadār ordered off his subordinate officer the jemadār with half a dozen policemen to arrange everything for an inquest on the body by the time he should reach the place with all due pomp the jemadār went to the house of the murderer and dismounting ordered all the shopkeepers of the village who were many and respectable to be forthwith seized and bound hand and feet so said the jemadār you have all been aiding and abetting your friend in the murder of poor madārīs only son may it please your excellency we have never heard of any murder impudent scoundrels roared the jemadār does not the poor boy lie dead in the sugarcane field and is not his highness the thānadār coming to hold an inquest upon it and do you take us for fools enough to believe that any scoundrel among you would venture to commit a deliberate murder without being aided and abetted by all the rest the village watchman began to feel some apprehension that he had been too precipitate and entreated the jemadār to go first and see the body of the boy what do you take us for said the jemadār a thing without a stomach do you suppose that government servants can live and labour on air are we to go and examine bodies upon empty stomachs let his father take care of the body and let these murdering shopkeepers provide us something to eat nine rupees worth of sweetmeats and materials for a feast were forthwith collected at the expense of the shopkeepers who stood bound and waiting the arrival of his highness the thānadār who was soon after seen approaching majestically upon a richly caparisoned horse what said the jemadār is there nobody to go and receive his highness in due form one of the shopkeepers was untied and presented with fifteen rupees by his family and those of the other shopkeepers these he took up and presented to his highness who deigned to receive them through one of his train and then dismounted and partook of the feast that had been provided now said his highness we will go and hold an inquest on the body of the poor boy and off moved all the great functionaries of government to the sugarcane field with the village watchman leading the way the father of the boy met them as they entered and was pointed out by the village watchman where said the thānadār is your poor boy there said madārī cutting the canes how cutting the canes was he not murdered by the shopkeepers no said madārī he was beaten by girdhārī and richly deserved it i find girdhārī and the boy were called up and the little urchin said that he called out murder merely to prevent girdhārī from giving him another clout on the side of the head his father was then fined nine rupees for giving a false alarm and girdhārī fifteen for so unmercifully beating the boy and they were made to pay on the instant under the penalty of all being sent off forty miles to the magistrate having thus settled this very important affair his highness the thānadār walked back to the shop ordered all the shopkeepers to be set at liberty smoked his pipe mounted his horse and rode home followed by all his police officers and well pleased with his days work the farmer of the village soon after made his way to the city and communicated the circumstances to my old friend who happened to be on intimate terms with the magistrate he wrote a polite note to the thānadār to say that he should never get any rents from his estate if the occupants were liable to such fines as these and that he should take the earliest opportunity of mentioning them to his friend the magistrate the thānadār ascertained that he was really in the habit of visiting the magistrate and communicating with him freely and hushed up the matter by causing all save the expenses of the feast to be paid back these are things of daily occurrence in all parts of our dominions and the thānadārs are not afraid to play such fantastic tricks because all those under and all those above them share more or less in the spoil and are bound in honour to conceal them from the european magistrate whom it is the interest of all to keep in the dark they know that the people will hardly ever complain from the great dislike they all have to appear in our courts particularly when it is against any of the officers of those courts or their friends and creatures in the district police when our operations commenced in these assassins scil the thugs revelled over every road in india in gangsof hundreds without the fear of punishment from divine or human laws but there is not now i believe a road in india infested by them that our government has still defects and great ones must be obvious to every one who has travelled much over india with the requisite qualifications and disposition to observe but i believe that in spite of all the defects i have noticed above in our police system the life property and character of the innocent are now more secure and all their advantages more freely enjoyed than they ever were under any former government with whose history we are acquainted or than they now are under any native government in india those who think they are not so almost always refer to the reign of shāh jahān when men like tavernier travelled so securely all over india with their bags of diamonds but i would ask them whether they think that the life property and character of the innocent could be anywhere very secure or their advantages very freely enjoyed in a country where a man could do openly with impunity what the traveller describes to have been done by the persian physician of the governor of allahabad this governor being sickly had in attendance upon him eleven physicians one of whom was a european gentleman of education claudius maille of bourges the chief favourite of the eleven was however a persian who one day threw his wife from the top of a battlement to the ground in a fit of jealousy he thought the fall would kill her but she had only a few ribs broken whereupon the kindred of the woman came and demanded justice at the feet of the governor the governor sending for the physician commanded him to be gone resolving to retain him no longer in his service the physician obeyed and putting his poor maimed wife in a palankeen he set forward upon the road with all his family but he had not gone above three or four days journey from the city when the governor finding himself worse than he was wont to be sent to recall him which the physician perceiving stabbed his wife his four children and thirteen female slaves and returned again to the governor who said not a word to him but entertained him again in his service this occurred within taverniers own knowledge and about the time he visited allahabad and is related as by no means a very extraordinary circumstance notes january the tomb of safdar jang or mansūr alī khān described ante chapter the bridges over the jumna are now of course maintained by government and the railway companies the main highways approaching delhi are now excellent metalled roads by the term the largest military station in the empire the author means meerut at present the largest military station in northern india is i believe rāwal pindi and the combined cantonments of secunderābād and bolarum in the nizams dominions constitute the largest military station in the empire comprising parts of the meerut and muzaffarnagar districts of the northwestern provinces now the agra province in the united provinces of agra and oudh the bēgams history will be discussed in chapter post the members of the reformed police force constituted under act v of generally on the model of the royal irish constabulary have no reason to complain of insecurity of tenure it is now very difficult to obtain sanction to the dismissal of a corrupt or inefficient officer unless he has been judicially convicted of a statutory offence ordinarily there is for each district or administrative unit a separate sessions and district judge who tries both civil and criminal cases of the more serious kind occasionally two or three districts have only one judge between them who is then usually in arrear with his work sessions for the trial of grave criminal cases are held monthly bimonthly or quarterly according to circumstances in some districts and for some classes of cases the jury system has been introduced but as a rule in northern india the responsibility rests with the judge alone who receives some slight aid from assessors capital sentences passed by a sessions judge must be confirmed by two judges of a high court or equivalent tribunal the historian thornton chapter went so far as to declare that lord william bentinck has done less for the interest of india and for his own reputation than any who had occupied his place since the commencement of the nineteenth century with the single exception of sir george barlow the abolition of widowburning is the only act of the bentinck administration which this writer could praise such a criticism is manifestly unjust the outcome of contemporary anger and prejudice the inscription written by macaulay the friend and coadjutor of lord william and placed on the statue of the reforming governorgeneral in calcutta does not give undeserved praise to the much abused statesman sir william sleeman so much admired lord william bentinck and formed such a favourable estimate of the merits of his government that it may be well to support his opinion by that of macaulay the text of the inscription is to william cavendish bentinck who during seven years ruled india with eminent prudenceintegrity and benevolence who placed at the head of a great empire never laid aside the simplicity and moderation of a private citizen who infused into oriental despotism the spirit of british freedom who never forgot that the end of government is the happiness of the governed who abolished cruel rites who effaced humiliating distinctions who gave liberty to the expression of public opinion whose constant study it was to elevate the intellectual and moral character of the nation committed to his charge this monument was erected by men who differing in race in manners in language and in religion cherish with equal veneration and gratitude the memory of his wise reforming and paternal administration lord william bentinck by d boulger p rulers of india series a european district superintendent of police under the general supervision of the magistrate of the district now commands the police of each district and sometimes has one or two european assistants he is also aided by wellpaid inspectors who are for the most part natives of india measures have recently been taken especially in the united provinces to improve the pay training and position of the police force european and indian police officers and men now obtain pensions like public servants in other departments in some provinces the highest salaries of magistrates are much lower than the rates stated by the author which are the highest paid to the most senior officers in certain provinces and in all provinces officiating incumbents who form a large proportion of the officers employed draw only a part of the full salary the fall in exchange has enormously reduced the real value of all indian salaries another popular view of this subject and i think the one more commonly taken is expressed in the anecdote told ante chapter following wellpaid inspectors of police drawing salaries of to rupees a month are often extremely corrupt and retire with large fortunes i knew many cases but could never obtain judicial proof of one when sons servants or favourites of men in authority in india no longer oppress their fellows the millennium will have arrived it is some slight satisfaction to a zealous magistrate of the present day when he sees a great and influential criminal escape his just doom to think that even the best magistrates many years ago had to submit to similar painful experiences india cannot truly be described as an uncivilized or barbarous country but side by side with elements of the highest civilization it contains many elements of primitive and savage barbarism the savagery of india cannot be dealt with by barristers or moral textbooks the number of subordinate magistrates paid and unpaid has of late years been enormously increased and courts are consequently much more numerous than they used to be the vast increase in facility of communication has also diminished the inconveniences which the author deplores in oudh and certain other provinces which used to be called nonregulation the chief magistrate of the district has power to try and adequately punish all offences except capital ones the power is useful when the district officer has time to exercise it which is not always the case there is a superintendent of police for the province of bengal but in the northwestern provinces his duties are divided among the commissioners of revenue w h s by superintendent of police the author means the high officer now called the inspectorgeneral of police under the present system each local government or administration has one of these officers who is aided by one or more staff officers as assistantinspectorsgeneral the commissioners in the united provinces have been relieved of police duties the organization of police stations has been much modified since the authors time our bengal territories as understood by the author included in addition to bengal the northwestern provinces now the province of agra the saugor and nerbudda territories now in the central provinces and the delhi territories oudh of course was then independent and the panjāb was under the rule of ranjit singh all these practices are still carried on and experienced magistrates are well aware of their existence though powerless to stop them people will often give private information of malpractices but will hardly ever come into court and speak out openly a magistrate cannot take action on statements which the makers will not submit to crossexamination this is still a favourite trick every year inspectorsgeneral of police and secretaries to government make the same sarcastic remarks about the wonderful number of attempts at burglary and the apparent contentment of the criminalclasses with the small results of their labours but the thānadār is too much for even inspectorsgeneral and secretaries to government no amount of reorganization changes him mr r when appointed magistrate of the district of fathpur on the ganges had a wish to translate the henriade and in order to secure leisure he issued a proclamation to all the thānadārs of his district to put down crime declaring that he would hold them responsible for what might be committed and dismiss from his situation every one who should suffer any to be committed within his charge this district lying on the borders of oudh had been noted for the number and atrocious character of its crimes from that day all the periodical returns went up to the superior court blanknot a crime was reported astonished at this sudden result of the change of magistrates the superior court of calcutta the sadr nizāmat adālat requested one of the judges who was about to pass through the district on his way down to inquire into the nature of the system which seemed to work so well with a view to its adoption in other districts he found crimes were more abundant than ever and the thānadārs showed him the proclamation which had been understood as all such proclamations are not as enjoining vigilance in the prosecution of crime but as prohibiting all report of them so as to save the magistrate trouble and get him a good name with his superiors w h s great caution should always be used by local officers in making comments on statistics the subordinate cares nothing for the facts when a superior objects that the birthrate is too low and the deathrate too high in any police circle the practical conclusion drawn by the police is that the figures of the next return must be made more palatable and they are cooked accordingly so if burglaries are too numerous they cease to be reported and so forth the old superior court was known as the sadr nizāmat adālat on the criminal and as the sadr dīwānī adālat on the civil side these courts have now been replaced by the high courts and equivalent tribunals in the authors time the high court for the agra province had not yet been established its seat is now at allahabad but was formerly at agra the gap has been filled up by numbers of deputy magistrates tahsīldār c invested with magisterial powers honorary magistrates district superintendents and inspectors and yet all the old games still go on merrily the reason is that the character of the people has not changed the police must have the power to arrest and that power when wielded by unscrupulous hands must always be formidable a magistrate who can find in his district even one man official or unofficial who will tell him the real state of things and not merely repeat scandal and malignant gossip is unusually fortunate the thugs were suppressed because a special organization was devised and directed for the purpose the english rules as to the admissibility of evidence being judiciously relaxed the ordinary law and methods of procedure are of little effect against the secret societies known as criminal tribes these criminal tribes number hundreds of thousands of persona and present a problem almost unknown to european experience the gipsies who are largely of indian origin are perhaps the only european example of an hereditary criminal tribe but they are not sheltered and abetted by the landowners as their brethren in india are the magistrate of course was the author these motives all retain their full force and are unaffected by police commissions and reorganization schemes some people think that the character of the police will be raised by the employment as officers of young indians of good family i am sorry to say that i found these young men to be the worst offenders they are more daring in their misdeeds than the ordinary policeman and no better in their morals this is quite true and it is also true that our police administration is the weakest part of our system but the fault is not entirely that of the police in some provinces especially in bengal the action of the high courts has almost paralysed the arm of the executive m claude maille of bourges as we shall see in book i chapter a man of this name who had escaped from the dutch service was in the year a not very successful amateur gunfounder for mīr jumla he had after his escape set up as a surgeon to the nawāb with an equipment consisting of a case of instruments and a box of ointments which he had stolen from m cheteur the dutch ambassador to golconda tavernier throws no light upon his identity with this physician tavernier travels ed ball vol i p note m maille befriended manucci who mentions him several times irvine storia do mogor i c balls version of this horrible story vol i p does not differ materially from that quoted in the text tavernier does not mention the name of the governor though he observes that he was one of the greatest nobles in india tavernier visited allahabad in december and then heard the story the governor concerned being at the time in the fort i have no doubt that in the reign of shāh jahān ordinary offences committed by ordinary criminals were ruthlessly punished and to some extent suppressed but under the best asiatic governments great men and their dependants have usually been able to do pretty much what they pleased the english government has the merit of refusing to give formal recognition to difference of rank in criminals and of often trying to punish influential offenders though seldomsucceeding in the attempt from time to time a conspicuous example like that of the nawāb shamsuddīn is made and a few such examples combined with the greater vigilance and more complete organization of the english executive prevent the occurrence of atrocities so great as that described without a word of comment by the french traveller i have not the slightest doubt nor has any magistrate of long experience any doubt that women are frequently made away with quietly in the recesses of the zanāna i have known several such cases which were notorious though incapable of judicial proof the amount of serious secret crime which occurs in india and never comes to light is very considerable chapter rentfree tenuresright of government to resume such grants on the th we went on fifteen miles to bēgamābād over a sandy and level country all the peasantry along the roads were busy watering their fields and the singing of the man who stood at the well to tell the other who guides the bullocks when to pull after the leather bucket had been filled at the bottom and when to stop as it reached the top was extremely pleasing it is said that tānsēn of delhi the most celebrated singer they have ever had in india used to spend a great part of his time in these fields listening to the simple melodies of these waterdrawers which he learned to imitate and apply to his more finished vocal music popular belief ascribes to tānsēn the power of stopping the river jumna in its course his contemporary and rival birjū baulā who according to popular belief could split a rock with a single note is said to have learned his bass from the noise of the stone mills which the women use in grinding the corn for their families tānsēn was a brahman from patna who entered the service of the emperor akbar became a musalmān and after the service of twentyseven years during which he was much beloved by the emperor and all his court he died at gwālior in the thirtyfourth year of the emperors reign his tomb is still to be seen at gwālior all his descendants are said to have a talent for music and they have all sēn added to their names while mādhojī sindhia the gwālior chief was prime minister he made the emperor assign to his daughter the bālā bāī in jāgīr or rentfree tenure ninetyfive villages rated in the imperial sanads deeds of grant at three lākhs of rupees a year when the emperor had been released from the durance vile in which he was kept by daulat rāo sindhia the adopted son of this chief by lord lake in and the countries in which these villages were situated taken possession of she was permitted to retain them on condition that they were to escheat to us on her death she died in and we took possession of the villages which now yield it is said four lākhs of rupees a year bēgamābād was one of them it paid to the bālā bāi only six hundred rupees a year but it pays now to us six hundred and twenty rupees but the farmers and cultivators do not pay a farthing morethe difference was taken by the favourite to whom she assigned the duties of collection and who always took as much as he could get from them and paid as little as he could to her the tomb of the old collector stood near my tents and his son who came to visit it told me that he had heard from gwālior that a new governorgeneral was about to arrive who would probably order the villages to be given back when he should be made collector of the village as his father had been had our government acted by all the rentfree lands in our territories on the same principle they would have saved themselves a vast deal of expense trouble and odium the justice of declaring all lands liable to resumption on the death of the present incumbents when not given by competent authority for and actually applied to the maintenance of religious charitable educational or other establishments of manifest public utility would never have been for a moment questioned by the people of india because they would have all known that it was in accordance with the customs of the country if at the same time that we declared all land liable to resumption when not assigned by such authority for such purposes and actually applied to them we had declared that all grants by competent authority registered in due form before the death of the present incumbents should be liable on their death to the payment to government of only a quarter or half the rent arising from them it would have been universally hailed as an act of great liberality highly calculated to make our reign popular as it is we have admitted the right of former rulers of all descriptions to alienate in perpetuity the land the principal source of the revenue of the state in favour of their relatives friends and favourites leaving upon the holders the burthen of proving at a ruinous cost in fees and bribes through court after court that these alienations had been made by the authorities we declare competent before the time prescribed and we have thus given rise to an infinite deal of fraud perjury and forgery and to the opinion i fear very generally prevalent that we are anxious to take advantage of unavoidable flaws in the proof required to trick them out of their lands by tedious judicial proceedings while we profess to be desirous that they should retain them in this we have done ourselves great injustice though these lands were often held for many generations under former governments and for the exclusive benefit of the holders it was almost always when they were of any value in collusion with the local authorities who concealed the circumstances from their sovereign for a certain stipulated sum or share of the rents while they held office this of course the holders were always willing to pay knowing that no sovereign would hesitate much to resume their lands should the circumstance of their holding them for their private use alone be ever brought to his notice the local authorities were no doubt always willing to take a moderate share of the rent knowing that they would get nothing should the lands be resumed by the sovereign sometimes the lands granted were either at the time the grant was made or became soon after waste and depopulated in consequence of invasion or internal disorders and remaining in this state for many generations the intervening sovereigns either knew nothing or cared nothing about the grants under our rule they became by degrees again cultivated and peopled and in consequence valuable not by the exertions of the rentfree holders for they were seldom known to do anything but collect the rents but by those of the farmers and cultivators whopay them when saādat alī khan the sovereign of oudh ceded rohilkhand and other districts to the honourable company in lieu of tribute in he resumed every inch of land held in rentfree tenure within the territories that remained with him without condescending to assign any other reason than state necessity the measure created a good deal of distress particularly among the educated classes but not so much as a similar measure would have created within our territories because all his revenues are expended in the maintenance of establishments formed exclusively out of the members of oudh families and retained within the country while ours are sent to pay establishments formed and maintained at a distance and those whose lands are resumed always find it exceedingly difficult to get employment suitable to their condition the face of the country between delhi and meerut is sadly denuded of its groves not a grove or an avenue is to be seen anywhere and but few fine solitary trees i asked the people of the cause and was told by the old men of the village that they remembered well when the sikh chiefs who now bask under the sunshine of our protection used to come over at the head of dalas bodies of ten or twelve horse each and plunder and lay waste with fire and sword at every returning harvest the fine country which i now saw covered with rich sheets of cultivation and which they had rendered a desolate waste without a man to make or a man to grant a petition when lord lake came among them they were they say looking on at a distance when he fought the battle of delhi and drove the marāthās who were almost as bad as the

friend up to the day of his death both are said to have worked many wonderful miracles among the people of the surrounding country who used to see them according to popular belief quietly taking their morning ride together upon the backs of two enormous tigers who came every morning at the appointed hour from the distant jungle the hindoo is said to have been very fond of music and though he has been now dead some three centuries a crowd of amateurs atālīs assemble every sunday afternoon at his shrine on the bank of the tank and sing gratis and in a very pleasing style to an immense concourse of people who assemble to hear them and to solicit the spirit of the old saint softened by their melodies at the tomb of the muhammadan saint a number of professional dancers and singers assemble every thursday afternoon and dance sing and play gratis to a large concourse of people who make offerings of food to the poor and implore the intercession of the old man with the deity in return the muhammadans tomb is large and handsome and built of red sandstone inlaid with marble but without any cupola that there may be no curtain between him and heaven when he gets out of his last long sleep at the resurrection not far from his tomb is another over the bones of a pilgrim they call ganjifann or the granary of science professional singers and dancers attend it every friday afternoon and display their talents gratis to a large concourse who bestow what they can in charity to the poor who assemble on all these occasions to take what they can get another much frequented tomb lies over a muhammadan saint who has not been dead more than three years named gohar sāh he owes his canonization to a few circumstances of recent occurrence which are however universally believed mr smith an enterprising merchant of meerut who had raised a large windmill for grinding corn in the sadr bāzār is said to have abused the old man as he was one day passing by and looked with some contempt on his method of grinding which was to take the bread from the mouths of so many old widows my child said the old saint amuse thyself with this toy of thine for it has but a few days to run in four days from that time the machine stopped poor mr smith could not afford to set it going again and it went to ruin the whole native population of meerut considered this a miracle of gohar sāh just before his death the country round meerut was under water and a great many houses fell from incessant rain the old man took up his residence during this time in a large sarāi in the town but finding his end approach he desired those who had taken shelter with him to have him taken to the jungle where he now reposes they did so and the instant they left the building it fell to the ground many who saw it told me they had no doubt that the virtues of the old man had sustained it while he was there and prevented its crushing all who were in it the tomb was built over his remains by a hindoo officer of the court who had been long out of employment and in great affliction he had no sooner completed the tomb and implored the aid of the old man than he got into excellent service and has been ever since a happy man he makes regular offerings to his shrine as a grateful return for the saints kindness to him in his hour of need professional singers and dancers display their talents here gratis as at the other tombs every wednesday afternoon the ground all round these tombs is becoming crowded with the graves of people who in their last moments request to be buried zērsāya under the shadow of these saints who in their lifetime are all said to have despised the pomps and vanities of this life and to have taken nothing from their disciples and worshippers but what was indispensably necessary to support existencefood being the only thing offered and accepted and that taken only when they happened to be very hungry happy indeed was the man whose dish was put forward when the saints appetite happened to be sharp the death of the poor old bēgam has it is said just canonized another saint shākir shāh who lies buried at sardhana but is claimed by the people of meerut among whom he lived till about five years ago when he desired to be taken to sardhana where he found the old lady very dangerously ill and not expected to live he was himself very old and ill when he set out from meerut and the journey is said to have shaken him so much that he found his end approaching and sent a messenger to the princess in these words ayā torē chale ham that is death came for thee but i go in thy place and he told those around him that she had precisely five years more to live she is said to have caused a tomb to be built over him and is believed by the people to have died that day five years all these things i learned as i wandered among the tombs of the old saints the first few evenings after my arrival at meerut i was interested in their history from the circumstance that amateur singers and professional dancers and musicians should display their talents at their shrines gratis for the sake of getting alms for the poor of the place given intheir namea thing i had never before heard ofthough the custom prevails no doubt in other places and that musalmāns and hindoos should join promiscuously in their devotions and charities at all these shrines manohar nāths shrine though he was a hindoo is attended by as many musalmān as hindoo pilgrims he is said to have taken the samādh that is to have buried himself alive in this place as an offering to the deity men who are afflicted with leprosy or any other incurable disease in india often take the samādh that is bury or drown themselves with due ceremonies by which they are considered as acceptable sacrifices to the deity i once knew a hindoo gentleman of great wealth and respectability and of high rank under the government of nāgpur who came to the river nerbudda two hundred miles attended by a large retinue to take the samādh in due form from a painful disease which the doctors pronounced incurable after taking an affectionate leave of all his family and friends he embarked on board the boat which took him into the deepest part of the river he then loaded himself with sand as a sportsman who is required to carry weights in a race loads himself with shot and stepping into the water disappeared the funeral ceremonies were then performed and his family friends and followers returned to nāgpur conscious that they had all done what they had been taught to consider their duty many poor men do the same every year when afflicted by any painful disease that they consider incurable the only way to prevent this is to carry out the plan now in progress of giving to india in an accessible shape the

oshaughnessy contributed many scientific papers to the jasb vols viii ix x xii and xvi chapter subdivisions of landswant of gradations of ranktaxes the country between delhi and meerut is well cultivated and rich in the latent power of its soil but there is here as everywhere else in the upper provinces a lamentable want of gradations in society from the eternal subdivision of property in land and the want of that concentration of capital in commerce and manufactures which characterizes europeanor i may take a wider range and say christian societies where as in india the landlords share of the annual returns from the soil has been always taken by the government as the most legitimate fund for the payment of its public establishments and the estates of the farmers and the holdings of the immediate cultivators of the soil are liable to be subdivided in equal shares among the sons in every succeeding generation the land can never aid much in giving to society that without which no society can possibly be well organizeda gradation of rank were the government to alter the system to give up all the rent of the lands and thereby convert all the farmers into proprietors of their estates the case would not be much altered while the hindoo and muhammadan law of inheritance remained the same for the eternal subdivision would still go on and reduce all connected with the soil to one common level and the people would be harassed with a multiplicity of taxes from which they are now free that would have to be imposed to supply the place of the rent given up the agricultural capitalists who derived their incomes from the interest of money advanced to the farmers and cultivators for subsistence and the purchase of stock were commonly men of rank and influence in society but they were never a numerous class the mass of the people in india are really not at present sensible that they pay any taxes at all the only necessary of life whose price is at all increased by taxes is salt and the consumer is hardly aware of this increase the natives never eat salted meat and though they require a great deal of salt living as they do so much on vegetable food still they purchase it in such small quantities from day to day as they require it that they really never think of the tax that may have been paid upon it in its progress to understand the nature of taxation in india an englishman should suppose that all the nonfarming landholders of his native country had a century or two ago consented to resign their property into the hands of their sovereign for the maintenance of his civil functionaries army navy church and public creditors and then suddenly disappeared from the community leaving to till the lands merely the farmers and cultivators and that their forty millions of rent were just the sum that the government now required to pay all these four great establishments to understand the nature of the public debt of england a man has only to suppose one great national establishment twice as large as those of the civil functionaries the army navy and the church together and composed of members with fixed salaries who purchased their commissions from the wisdom of our ancestors with liberty to sell them to whom they pleasewho have no duty to perform for the public and have like adam and eve the privilege of going to seek their place of rest in what part of the world they pleasea privilege of which they will of course be found more and more anxious to avail themselves as taxation presses on the one side and prohibition to the import of the necessaries of life diminishes the means of paying them on the other the repeal of the corn laws may give a new lift to england it may greatly increase the foreign demand for the produce of its manufacturing industry it may invite back a large portion of those who now spend their incomes in foreign countries and prevent from going abroad to reside a vast number who would otherwise go these laws must soon be repealed or england must reduce one or other of its great establishmentsthe national debt the church the army or the navy the corn laws press upon england just in the same manner as the discovery of the passage to india by the cape of good hope pressed upon venice and the other states whose welfare depended upon the transit of the produce of india by land but the navigation of the cape benefited all other european nations at the same time that it pressed upon these particular states by giving them all the produce of india at cheaper rates than they would otherwise have got it and by opening the markets of india to the produce of all other european nations the corn laws benefit only one small section of the people of england while they weigh like an incubus upon the vital energies of all the rest and at the same time injure all other nations by preventing their getting the produce of manufacturing industry so cheap as they would otherwise get it they have not therefore the merit of benefiting other nations at the same time that they crush their own for some twenty or thirty years of our rule too many of the collectors of our land revenue in what we call the western provinces sought the bubble reputation in an increase of assessment upon the lands of their district every five years when the settlement was renewed the more the assessment was increased the greater was the praise bestowed upon the collector by the revenue boards or the revenue secretary to government in the name of the governorgeneral of india these collectors found an easy mode of acquiring this reputationthey left the settlements to their native officers and shut their ears to all complaints of grievances till they had reduced all the landholders of their districts to one common level of beggary without stock character or credit and transferred a great portion of their estates to thenative officers of their own courts through the medium of the auction sales that took place for the arrears or pretended arrears of revenue a better feeling has for some years past prevailed and collectors have sought their reputation in a real knowledge of their duties and real good feeling towards the farmers and cultivators of their districts for this better tone of feeling the western provinces are i believe chiefly indebted to mr r m bird of the revenue board one of the most able public officers now in india a settlement for twenty years is now in progress that will leave the farmers at least per cent upon the gross collections from the immediate cultivators of the soil that is the amount of the revenue demandable by government from the estate will be that less than what the farmer will and would under any circumstances levy from the cultivators in his detailed settlement the farmer lets all the land of his estate out to cultivators and takes in money this rate of profit for his expense trouble and risk or he lets out to the cultivators enough to pay the government demand and tills the rest with his own stock rentfree when a division takes place between his sons they either divide the estate and become each responsible for his particular share or they divide the profits and remain collectively responsible to government for the whole leaving one member of the family registered as the lessee and responsible head in the ryotwār system of southern india government officers removable at the pleasure of the government collector are substituted for these farmers or more properly proprietors of estates and a system more prejudicial to the best interests of society could not well be devised by the ingenuity of man it has been supposed by some theorists who are practically unacquainted with agriculture in this or any other country that all who have any interest in land above the rank of cultivator or ploughman are mere drones or useless consumers of that rent which under judicious management might be added to the revenues of governmentthat all which they get might and ought to be either left with the cultivators or taken by the government at the head of these is the justly celebrated historian mr mill but men who understand the subject practically know that the intermediate agency of a farmer who has a permanent interest in the estate or an interest for a long period is a thousand times better both for the government and the people than that of a government officer of any description much less that of one removable at the pleasure of the collector government can always get more revenue from a village under the management of the farmer the character of the cultivators and village community generally is much better the tillage is much better and the produce from more careful weeding and attention of all kinds sells much better in the market the better character of the cultivators enables them to get the loans they require to purchase stock and to pay the government demand on more moderate terms from the capitalists who rely upon the farmer to aid in the recovery of their outlays without reference to civil courts which are ruinous media as well in india as in other places the farmer or landlord finds in the same manner that he can get much more from lands let out on lease to the cultivators or yeomen who depend upon their own character credit and stock than he can from similar lands cultivated with his own stock and hired labourers can never be got to labour either so long or so well the labour of the indian cultivating lessee is always applied in the proper quantity and at the proper time and placethat of the hired fieldlabourer hardly ever is the skilful coachmaker always puts on the precise quantity of iron required to make his coach strong because he knows where it is required his coach is at the same time as light as it can be with safety the unskilful workman either puts on too much and makes his coach heavy or he puts it in the wrong place and leaves it weak if government extends the twenty years settlement now in progress to fifty years or more they will confer a great blessing upon the people and they might perhaps do it on the condition that the incumbent consented to allow the lease to descend undivided to his heirs by the laws of primogeniture to this condition all classes would readily agree for i have heard hindoo and muhammadan landholders all equally lament the evil effects of the laws by which families are so quickly and inevitably broken up and say that it is the duty of government to take advantage of their power as the great proprietor and leaser of all the lands to prevent the evil by declaring leases indivisible there would then they say be always one head to assist in maintaining the widows and orphans of deceased members in educating his brothers and nephews and by his influence and respectability procuring employment for them in such men with feelings of permanent interest in their estates and in the stability of the government that secured them possession on such favourable terms and with the means of educating their children we should by and by find our best support and society its best element the law of primogeniture at present prevails only where it is most mischievous under our rule among the feudal chiefs whose ancestors rose to distinction and acquired their possessions by rapine in times of invasion and civil wars this law among them tends to perpetuate the desire to maintain those military establishments by which the founders of their families arose in the hope that the times of invasion and civil wars may return and open for them a similar field for exertion it fosters a class of powerful men essentially and irredeemably opposed in feeling not only to our rule but to settled government under any rule and the sooner the hindoo law of inheritance is allowed by the paramount power to take its course among these feudal chiefs the better for society there is always a strong tendency to it in the desire of the younger brothers to share in the loaves and fishes and this tendency is checked only by the injudicious interposition of our authority to give india the advantage of free institutions or all the blessings of which she is capable under an enlightened paternal government nothing is more essential than the supersession of this feudal aristocracy by one founded upon other bases and above all upon that of the concentration of capital in commerce and manufactures nothing tends so much to prevent the accumulation and concentration of capital over india as this feudal aristocracy which tendseverywhere to destroy that feeling of security without which men will nowhere accumulate and concentrate it they do so not only by the intrigues and combinations against the paramount power which keep alive the dread of internal wars and foreign invasion but by those gangs of robbers and murderers which they foster and locate upon their estates to prey upon the more favoured or better governed territories around them from those gangs of freebooters who are to be found upon the estate of almost every native chief no accumulation of movable property of any value is ever for a moment considered safe and those who happen to have any such are always in dread of losing not only their property but their lives along with it for these gangs secure in the protection of such chief are reckless in their attack and kill all who happen to come in their way notes this phrase is meant to include america moneylenders naturally have flourished daring the long period of internal peace since the mutiny they vary in wealth and position from the humblest gombeen man to the millionaire banker many of these moneylenders are now among the largest owners of land in the country under native rule interests in land were generally too precarious to be saleable the author did not foresee that the growth of private property in land would carry with it the right and desire of one party to sell and of another to buy and would thus favour the growth of large estates and to a considerable extent counteract the evils of subdivision of course like everything else the large estates have their evils too much nonsense is written about sales of land in india as well as in ireland the two countries have more than the initial letter in common theorists declare that it is right that the taxpayers should know what is taken from them and that therefore direct taxes are best but practical men who have to govern ignorant and suspicious races resentful of direct taxation know that indirect taxation is for such people the best this illustration would give a very false idea of modern indian finance they have no duty to perform as creditors but as citizens of an enlightened nation they no doubt perform many of them very important ones w h s the authors whimsical comparison between stockholders and adam and eve and his notion that the creditors of the nation may be regarded as officials without duties only obscure a simple matter the emigration of owners of consols never assumed very alarming dimensions the corn laws were repealed in and the shilling duty which was then left was abolished in considering that the author belonged to a landowning family his clear perception of the evils caused by the corn laws is remarkable by the western provinces the author means the region called later the northwestern provinces and now known as the agra province in the united provinces of agra and oudh with the delhi territories which latter are now partly under the government of the panjāb and partly in the new small province or chief commissionership of delhi at the time referred to the provincial government had not been constituted fifty per cent may be considered as the average rate left to the lessees or proprietors of estates under this new settlement and if they take on an average onethird of the gross produce government takes twoninths but we may rate the government share of the produce actually taken at onefifth as the maximum and onetenth as the minimum w h s it is unfortunately true that in the shortterm settlements made previous to many abuses of the kinds referred to in the text occurred the traditions of the people and the old records attest numerous instances the first serious attempt to reform the system of revenue settlements was made by regulation vii of but owing to an excessive elaboration of procedure the attempt produced no appreciable results regulation ix of established a workable system and provided for the appointment of indian deputy collectors with adequate powers the settlements of the northwestern provinces made under this regulation were for the most part reasonably fair and were generally confirmed for a period of thirty years mr robert mertins bird who entered the service in and died in took a leading part in this great reform when the next settlements were made between and the share of the profit rental claimed by the state was reduced from twothirds to onehalf full details will be found in the editors settlement officers manual for the n w p allahabad or in baden powells big book land systems of british india clarendon press since the people whom the author calls farmers have gradually become fall proprietors subject to the government lien on the land and its produce for the land revenue for many years past the ancient custom of joint ownership and collective responsibility has been losing ground partitions are now continually demanded and every year collective responsibility is becoming more unpopular and more difficult to enforce this judgement i need hardly say would not be accepted in madras or bombay the issue raised is too large for discussion in footnotes the advantages of very long terms of settlements are obvious the disadvantages though equally real are less obvious fluctuations in prices and above all in the price of silver are among the many conditions which complicate the question except the bengal landowners most people now admit that the permanent settlement of bengal in was a grievous mistake it is also admitted that the mistake is irrevocable these two suggestions of the author that the law of primogeniture should be established to regulate the succession to ordinary estates and that it should be abolished in the case of chieftainships where it already prevails are obviously open to criticism it seems sufficient to say that both recommendations are for many reasons altogether impracticable in passing i may note that the term feudal does not express with any approach to correctness the relation of the native states to the government of india the evils described in this paragraph though diminished have not disappeared nevertheless no one would now seriously propose the deliberate supersession of the existing aristocracy by rich merchants and manufacturers the proposal is too fanciful for discussion during the long period of peace merchants and manufacturers have naturally risen to a position much more prominent than they occupied in the authors time chapter meerutangloindian society meerut is a large station for military and civil establishments it is the residence of a civil commissioner a judge a magistrate a collector of land revenue and all their assistants and establishments there are the majorgeneral commanding the division the brigadier commanding the station four troops of horse and a company of foot artillery one regiment of european cavalry one of european infantry one of native cavalry and three of native infantry it is justly considered the healthiest station in india for both europeans and natives and i visited it in the latter end of the cold which is the healthiest season of the year yet the european ladies were looking as if they had all come out of their graves and talking of the necessity of going off to the mountains to renovate as soon as the hot weather should set in they had literally been fagging themselves to death with gaiety at this the gayest and most delightful of all indian stations during the cold months when they ought to have been laying in a store of strength to carry them through the trying seasons of the hot winds and rains up every night and all night at balls and suppers they could never go out to breathe the fresh air of the morning and were looking wretchedly ill while the european soldiers from the barracks seemed as fresh as if they had never left their native land there is no doubt that sitting up late at night is extremely prejudicial to the health of europeans in india i have never seen the european male or female that could stand it long however temperate in habits and an old friend of mine once told me that if he went to bed a little exhilarated every night at ten oclock and took his ride in the morning he found himself much better than if he sat up till twelve or one oclock without drinking and lay abed in the mornings almost all the gay pleasures of india are enjoyed at night and as ladies here as everywhere else in christian societies are the life and soul of all good parties as of all good novels they often to oblige others sit up late much against their own inclinations and even their judgements aware as they are that they are gradually sinking under the undue exertions when i first came to india there were a few ladies of the old school still much looked up to in calcutta and among the rest the grandmother of the earl of liverpool the old bēgam johnstone then between seventy and eighty years of age all these old ladies prided themselves upon keeping up old usages they use to dine in the afternoon at four or five oclocktake their airing after dinner in their carriages and from the time they returned till ten at night their houses were lit up in their best style and thrown open for the reception of visitors all who were on visiting terms came at this time with any strangers whom they wished to introduce and enjoyed each others society there were music and dancing for the young and cards for the old when the party assembled happened to be large enough and a few who had been previously invited stayed supper i often visited the old bēgam johnstone at this hour and met at her house the first people in the country for all people including the governorgeneral himself delighted to honour this old lady the widow of a governorgeneral of india and the motherinlaw of a prime minister of england she was at murshīdābād when sirājuddaula marched from that place at the head of the army that took and plundered calcutta and caused so many europeans to perish in the black hole and she was herself saved from becoming a member of his seraglio or perishing with the lest by the circumstance of her being far gone in her pregnancy which caused her to be made over to a dutch factory she had been a very beautiful woman and had been several times married the pictures of all her husbands being hung round her noble drawingroom in calcutta covered during the day with crimson cloth to save them from the dust and uncovered at night only on particular occasions one evening mrs crommelin a friend of mine pointing to one of them asked the old lady his name really i cannot at this moment tell you my dear my memory is very bad striking her forehead with her right hand as she leaned with her left arm in mrs crommelins but i shall recollect in a few minutes the old ladys last husband was a clergyman mr johnstone whom she found too gay and persuaded to go home upon an annuity of eight hundred a year which she settled upon him for life the bulk of her fortune went to lord liverpool the rest to her grandchildren the ricketts watts and others since those days the modes of intercourse in india have much altered society at all the stations beyond the three capitals of calcutta madras and bombay is confined almost exclusively to the members of the civil and military services who seldom remain long at the same stationthe military officers hardly ever more than three years and the civil hardly ever so long at disagreeable stations the civil servants seldom remain so many months every newcomer calls in the forenoon upon all that are at the station when he arrives and they return his call at the same hour soon after if he is a married man the married men upon whom he has called take their wives to call upon his and he takes his to return the call of theirs these calls are all indispensable and being made in the forenoon become very disagreeable in the hot season all complain of them yet no one forgoes his claim upon them and till the claim is fulfilled people will not recognize each other as acquaintances unmarried officers generally dine in the evening because it is a more convenient hour for the mess and married civil functionaries do the same because it is more convenient for their office work if you invite those who dine at that hour to spend the evening with you you must invite them to dinner even in thehot weather and if they invite you it is to dinner this makes intercourse somewhat heavy at all times but more especially so in the hot season when a table covered with animal food is sickening to any person without a keen appetite and stupefying to those who have it no one thinks of inviting people to a dinner and ballit would be vandalism and when you invite them as is always the case to come after dinner the ball never begins till late at night and seldom ends till late in the morning with all its disadvantages however i think dining in the evening much better for those who are in health than dining in the afternoon provided people can avoid the intermediate meal of tiffin no person in india should eat animal food more than once a day and people who dine in the evening generally eat less than they would if they dined in the afternoon a light breakfast at nine biscuit or a slice of toast with a glass of water or sodawater at two oclock and dinner after the evening exercise is the plan which i should recommend every european to adopt as the most agreeable when their digestive powers get out of order people must do as the doctors tell them there is i believe no society in which there is more real urbanity of manners than in that of indiaa more general disposition on the part of its different members to sacrifice their own comforts and conveniences to those of others and to make those around them happy without letting them see that it costs them an effort to do so there is assuredly no society where the members are more generally free from those corroding cares and anxieties which weigh upon the hearts of men whose incomes are precarious and position in the world uncertain they receive their salaries on a certain day every month whatever may be the state of the seasons or of trade they pay no taxes they rise in the several services by rotation religious feelings and opinions are by common consent left as a question between man and his maker no one ever thinks of questioning another about them nor would he be tolerated if he did so most people take it for granted that those which they got from their parents were the right ones and as such they cherish them they remember with feelings of filial piety the prayers which they in their infancy offered to their maker while kneeling by the side of their mothers and they continue to offer them up through life with the same feelings and the same hopes differences of political opinion which agitate society so much in england and other countries where every man believes that his own personal interests must always be more or less affected by the predominance of one party over another are no doubt a source of much interest to people in india but they scarcely ever excite any angry passions among them the tempests by which the political atmosphere of the world is cleared and purged of all its morbid influences burst not upon uswe see them at a distancewe know that they are working for all mankind and we feel for those who boldly expose themselves to their pitiless peltings as men feel for the sailors whom they suppose to be exposed on the ocean to the storm while they listen to it from their beds or winter firesides we discuss all political opinions and all the great questions which they affect with the calmness of philosophers not without emotion certainly but without passion we have no share in returning members to parliamentwe feel no dread of those injuries indignities and calumnies to which those who have are too often exposed and we are free from the bitterness of feelings which always attend them how exalted how glorious has been the destiny of england to spread over so vast a portion of the globe her literature her language and her free institutions how ought the sense of this high destiny to animate her sons in their efforts to perfect their institutions which they have formed by slow degrees from feudal barbarism to make them in reality as perfect as they would have them appear to the world to be in theory that rising nations may love and honour the source whence they derive theirs and continue to look to it for improvement we return to the society of our wives and children after the labours of the day are over with tempers unruffled by collision with political and religious antagonists by unfavourable changes in the season and the markets and the other circumstances which affect so much the incomes and prospects of our friends at home we must look to them for the chief pleasures of our lives and know that they must look to us for theirs and if anything has crossed us we try to conceal it from them there is in india a strong feeling of mutual dependence which prevents little domestic misunderstandings between man and wife from growing into quarrels so often as in other countries where this is less prevalent men have not here their clubs nor their wives their little coteries to fly to when disposed to make serious matters out of trifles and both are in consequence much inclined to bear and forbear there are of course on the other hand evils in india that people have not to contend with at home but on the whole those who are disposed to look on the fair as well as on the dark side of all around them can enjoy life in india very much as long as they and those dear to them are free from physical pain we everywhere find too many disposed to look upon the dark side of all that is present and the bright side of all that is distant in time and placealways miserable themselves be they where they will and making all around them miserable this commonly arises from indigestion and the habit of eating and drinking in a hot as in a cold climate and giving their stomachs too much to do as if they were the only parts of the human frame whose energies were unrelaxed by the temperature of tropical climates there is however one great defect in angloindian society it is composed too exclusively of the servants of government civil military and ecclesiastic and wants much of the freshness variety and intelligence of cultivated societies otherwise constituted in societies where capital is concentrated for employment in large agricultural commercial and manufacturing establishments those who possess and employ it form a large portion of the middle and higher classes they require the application of the higher branches of science to the efficient employment of their capital in almost every purpose to which it can be applied and they require at the same time to show that they are not deficient in thatconventional learning of the schools and drawingrooms to which the circles they live and move in attach importance in such societies we are therefore always coming in contact with men whose scientific knowledge is necessarily very precise and at the same time very extensive while their manners and conversation are of the highest polish there is perhaps nothing which strikes a gentleman from india so much on his entering a society differently constituted as the superior precision of mens information upon scientific subjects and more especially upon that of the sciences more immediately applicable to the arts by which the physical enjoyments of men are produced prepared and distributed all over the world almost all men in india feel that too much of their time before they left england was devoted to the acquisition of the dead languages and too little to the study of the elements of science the time lost can never be regainedat least they think so which is much the same thing had they been well grounded in the elements of physics physiology and chemistry before they left their native land they would have gladly devoted their leisure to the improvement of their knowledge but to go back to elements where elements can be learnt only from books is unhappily what so few can bring themselves to that no man feels ashamed of acknowledging that he has never studied them at all till he returns to england or enters a society differently constituted and finds that he has lost the support of the great majority that always surrounded him in india it will perhaps be said that the members of the official aristocracy of all countries have more or less of the same defects for certain it is that they everywhere attach paramount or undue importance to the conventional learning of the grammarschool and the drawingroom and the ignorant and the indolent have everywhere the support of a great majority johnson has however observed but the truth is that the knowledge of external nature and the sciences which that knowledge requires or includes are not the great or the frequent business of the human mind whether we provide for action or conversation whether we wish to be useful or pleasing the first requisite is the religious and moral knowledge of right and wrong the next is an acquaintance with the history of mankind and with those examples which may be said to embody truth and prove by events the reasonableness of opinions prudence and justice are virtues and excellences of all times and of all placeswe are perpetually moralists but we are geometricians only by chance our intercourse with intellectual nature is necessary our speculations upon matter are voluntary and at leisure physiological learning is of such rare emergence that one may know another half his life without being able to estimate his skill in hydrostatics or astromony but his moral and prudential character immediately appears those authors therefore are to be read at schools that supply most axioms of prudence most principles of moral truth and most materials for conversation and these purposes are best served by poets orators and historians life of milton notes in india officers have much better opportunities in time of peace to learn how to handle troops than in england from having them more concentrated in large stations with fine open plains to exercise upon during the whole of the cold season from the beginning of november to the end of february the troops are at large stations exercised in brigades and the artillery cavalry and infantry together w h s the normal garrison of meerut in recent years has consisted of one british cavalry regiment one battalion of british infantry one native cavalry regiment and one battalion of native infantry with two batteries of horse and two of field artillery the cantonment was established in from which date the town grew rapidly in size and population the civil staff has been largely increased since sleemans time by the addition of numerous officers belonging to irrigation and other departmental services which did not exist in his day the offices of district magistrate and collector have been united as a single person for many years the cantonments suffered severely from typhoid fever for several years in the latter part of the nineteenth century few angloindians will dispute the truth of this dictum the late earl of liverpool then mr jenkinson married this old ladys daughter he was always very attentive to her and she used with feelings of great pride and pleasure to display the contents of the boxes of millinery which he used every year to send out to her w h the author came out to india in mr charles jenkinson was created baron hawkesbury in and earl of liverpool in his first wife who died in was amelia daughter of mr william watts governor of fort william and of the lady described by the author their only son succeeded to the earldom in and died in the peerage became extinct on the death of the third earl in burkes peerage it was revived in lord liverpool the second earl became prime minister in after the murder of perceval mrs johnson not johnstone was not the widow of a governorgeneral of india her history is told in detail on her tombstone in st johns churchyard calcutta and is summarized in buckland dictionary of indian biography she was born in and died in she had four husbands namely l parry purple temple whom she married when she was only thirteen years of age james altham who died of smallpox a few days after his marriage william watts senior member of council and for a short time governor or president of fort william in in rev william johnson who became principal chaplain of fort william in and left india in she was known as the old begum and her epitaph asserts that she was when she died the oldest british resident in bengal universally beloved respected andrevered mr a l paul kindly communicated the full text of the inscription on her tomb with some additional notes the author met her in when she was about eightyfive years of age the tragedy of the black hole occurred in june of late years the rigour of the custom exacting midday calls has been relaxed in some places moat people would require some training before they could find this very abstemious regimen the most agreeable it will i hope be admitted that this observation still holds good when the author wrote the rupee was worth more than two shillings the members of the indian services were few in number and mostly well paid while living was cheap now all is changed the rupee has an artificial value of s d the members of the services are numerous and often ill paid while living is dear the sharp fall in the value of silver and consequently in the gold equivalent of the rupee began in corroding cares and anxieties are now the lot of most people who serve in india they now have the privilege of paying taxes this perfect religious freedom still generally characteristic of angloindian society is one of its greatest charms and the charms of the country do not increase the author probably had in his mind the famous lines of lucretiussuave mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis e terra magnum alterius spectare laborem non quia vexari quemquam st jucunda voluptas sed quibus ipse malis careas quia cernere suave st book ii line this delightful philosophic calm is no longer an angloindian possession nor can the modern indian official congratulate himself on his immunity from injuries indignities and calumnies there are now clubs everywhere and coteries are said to be not unknown few angloindians of the present day are able to share the authors cheery optimism in this matter also time has wrought great changes the scientific branches of the indian services the medical engineering forestry geological survey and others have greatly developed and many officials in india whether of european or indian race now occupy high places in the world of science compare bolingbrokes observation already quoted that history is philosophy teaching by example chapter pilgrims of india there is nothing which strikes a european more in travelling over the great roads in india than the vast number of pilgrims of all kinds which he falls in with particularly between the end of november sic when all the autumn harvest has been gathered and the seed of the spring crops has been in the ground they consist for the most part of persons male and female carrying ganges water from the point at hardwār where the sacred stream emerges from the hills to the different temples in all parts of india dedicated to the gods vishnu and siva there the water is thrown upon the stones which represent the gods and when it falls upon these stones it is called chandamirt or holy water and is frequently collected and reserved to be drunk as a remedy for a mind diseased this water is carried in small bottles bearing the seals of the presiding priest at the holy place whence it was brought the bottles are contained in covered baskets fixed to the ends of a pole which is carried across the shoulder the people who carry it are of three kindsthose who carry it for themselves as a votive offering to some shrine those who are hired for the purpose by others as salaried servants and thirdly those who carry it for sale in the interval between the sowing and reaping of the spring crops that is between november and march a very large portion of the hindoo landholders and cultivators of india devote their leisure to this pious duty they take their baskets and poles with them from home or purchase them on the road and having poured their libations on the head of the god and made him acquainted with their wants and wishes return home from november to march threefourths of the number of these people one meets consist of this class at other seasons more than threefourths consist of the other two classesof persons hired for the purpose as servants and those who carry the water for sale one morning the old jemadār the marriage of whose mangogrove with the jasmine i have already described brought his two sons and a nephew to pay their respects to me on their return to jubbulpore from a pilgrimage to jagannāth the sickness of the youngest a nice boy of about six years of age had caused this pilgrimage the eldest son was about twenty years of age and the nephew about eighteen after the usual compliments i addressed the eldest son and so your brother was really very ill when you set out very ill sir hardly able to stand without assistance what was the matter with him it was what we call a dryingup or withering of the system what were the symptoms dysentery good and what cured him as he now seems quite well our mother and father vowed five pair of baskets of ganges water to gajādhar an incarnation of the god siva at the temple of baijnāth and a visit to the temple of jagannāth and having fulfilled these vows your brother recovered he had quite recovered sir before we had set out on our return from jagannāth and who carried the baskets my mother wife cousin myself and little brother all carried one pair each this little boy could not surely carry a pair of baskets all the way no sir we had a pair of small baskets made especially for him and when within about three miles of the temple he got down from his little pony took up his baskets and carried them to the god up to within three miles of the temple the baskets were carried by a brahman servant whom we had taken with us to cook our food we had with us another brahman to whom we had to pay only a trifle as his principal wages were made up of fees from families in the town of jubbulpore who had made similar vows and gave him so much a bottle for the water he carried in their several names to the goddid you give all your water to the baijnāth temple or carry some with you to jagannāth no water is ever offered to jagannāth sir he is an incarnation of vishnu and does vishnu never drink he drinks sir no doubt but he gets nothing but offerings of food and money from this to bindāchal on the ganges two hundred and thirty miles thence to baijnāth a hundred and fifty miles and thence to jagannāth some four or five hundred miles more and your mother and wife walked all the way with their baskets all the way sir except when either of them got sick when she mounted the pony with my little brother till she felt well again here were four members of a respectable family walking a pilgrimage of between twelve and fourteen hundred miles going and coming and carrying burthens on their shoulders for the recovery of the poor sick boy and millions of families are every year doing the same from all parts of india the change of air and exercise cured the boy and no doubt did them all a great deal of good but no physician in the world but a religions one could have persuaded them to undertake such a journey for the same purpose the rest of the pilgrims we meet are for the most part of the two monastic orders of gosāins or the followers of siva and bairāgīs or followers of vishnu and muhammadan fakīrs a hindoo of any caste may become a member of these monastic orders they are all disciples of the high priests of the temples of their respective gods and in their name they wander all over india visiting the celebrated temples which are dedicated to them a part of the revenues of these temples is devoted to subsisting these disciples as they pass and every one of them claims the right of a days food and lodging or more according to the rules of the temple they make collections along the roads and when they return commonly bring back some surplus as an offering to their apostle the high priest who has adopted them almost every high priest has a good many such disciples as they are not costly and from their returning occasionally and from the disciples of others passing these high priests learn everything of importance that is going on over india and are well acquainted with the state of feeling and opinion what these disciples get from secular people is given not only from feelings of charity and compassion but as a religions or propitiatory offering for they are all considered to be armed by their apostle with a vicarious power of blessing or cursing and as being in themselves men of god whom it might be dangerous to displease they never condescend to feign disease or misery in order to excite feelings of compassion but demand what they want with a bold front as holy men who have a right to share liberally in the superfluities which god has given to the rest of the hindoo community they are in general exceedingly intelligent men of the world and very communicative among them will be found members of all classes of hindoo society and of the most wealthy and respectable families while i had charge of the narsinghpur district in a bairāgī or follower of vishnu came and settled himself down on the border of a village near my residence his mild and paternal deportment pleased all the little community so much that they carried him every day more food than he required at last the proprietor of the village a very respectable old gentleman to whom i was much attached went out with all his family to ask a blessing of the holy man as they sat down before him the tears were seen stealing down his cheeks as he looked upon the old mans younger sons and daughters at last the old mans wife burst into tears ran up and fell upon the holy mans neck exclaiming my lost son my lost son he was indeed her eldest son he had disappeared suddenly twelve years before became a disciple of the high priest of a distant temple and visited almost every celebrated temple in india from kedārnāth in the eternal snows to sītā baldī rāmesar opposite the island of ceylon he remained with the family for nearly a year delighting them and all the country around with his narratives at last he seemed to lose his spirits his usual rest and appetite and one night he again disappeared he had been absent for some years when i last saw the family and i know not whether he ever returned the real members of these monastic orders are not generally bad men but there are a great many men of all kinds who put on their disguises and under their cloak commit all kinds of atrocities the security and convenience which the real pilgrims enjoy upon our roads and the entire freedom from all taxation both upon these roads and at the different temples they visit tend greatly to attach them to our rule and through that attachment a tone of good feeling towards it is generally disseminated over all india they come from the native states and become acquainted with the superior advantages the people under us enjoy in the greater security of property the greater freedom with which it is enjoyed and displayed the greater exemption from taxation and the odious right of search which it involves the greater facilities for travelling in good roads and bridges the greater respectability and integrity of public servants arising from the greater security in their tenure of office and more adequate rate of avowed salaries the entire freedom of the navigation of our great rivers on which thousands and tens of thousands of laden vessels now pass from one end to the other without any one to question whence they come or whither they go these are tangible proofs of good government whichall can appreciate and as the european gentleman in his rambles along the great roads passes the lines of pilgrims with which the roads are crowded during the cold season he is sure to hear himself hailed with grateful shouts as one of those who secured for them and the people generally all the blessings they now enjoy one day my sporting friend the rājā of maihar told me that he had been purchasing some water from the ganges at its source to wash the image of vishnu which stood in one of his temples i asked him whether he ever drank the water after the image had been washed in it yes said he we all occasionally drink the chandamirt and do you in the same manner drink the water in which the god siva has been washed never said the rājā and why not because his wife devī one day in a domestic quarrel cursed him and said the water which falls from thy head shall no man henceforward drink from that day said the rājā no man has ever drunk of the water that washes his image lest devī should punish him and how is it then rājā sahib that mankind continue to drink the water of the ganges which is supposed to flow from her husband sivas topknot because replied the rājā this sacred river first flows from the right foot of the god vishnu and thence passes over the head of siva the three gods continued the rājā govern the world turn and turn about twenty years at a time while vishnu reigns all goes on well rain descends in good season the harvests are abundant and the cattle thrive when brahma reigns there is little falling off in these matters but during the twenty years that siva reigns nothing goes on wellwe are all at cross purposes our crops fail our cattle get the murrain and mankind suffer from epidemic diseases the rājā was a follower of vishnu as

disguised as a fakīr is often sent on by dacoits gangrobbers as a spy and decoy threefourths of these religions mendicants whether hindoos or muhammadans rob and steal and a very great portion of them murder their victims before they rob them but they have not any of them as a class been found to follow the trade of murder so exclusively as to be brought properly within the scope of our operations there is hardly any species of crime that is not throughout india perpetrated by men in the disguise of these religious mendicants and almost all such mendicants are really men in disguise for hindoos

registration of every disciple belonging to every high priest whether hindoo or muhammadan and a stringent vagrant act his suggestions have not been acted on this incident still happens occasionally for the rājā see ante chapter chapter the bēgam sumroo on the th of february i went out to sardhana and visited the church built and endowed by the late bēgam sombre whose remains are now deposited in it it was designed by an italian gentleman m reglioni and is a fine but not a striking building i met the bishop julius caesar an italian from milan whom i had known a quarter of a century before a happy and handsome young manhe is still handsome though old but very miserable because the bēgam did not leave him so large a legacy as he expected in the revenues of her church he had she thought quite enough to live upon and she said that priests without wives or children to care about ought to be satisfied with this and left him only a few thousand rupees she made him the medium of conveying a donation to the see of rome of one hundred and fifty thousand rupees and thereby procured for him the bishopric of amartanta in the island of cyprus and got her grandson dyce sombre made a chevalier of the order of christ and presented with a splint from the real cross as a relic the bēgam sombre was by birth a saiyadanī or lineal descendant from muhammad the founder of the musalmān faith and she was united to walter reinhard when very young by all the forms considered necessary by persons of her persuasion when married to men of another reinhard had been married to another woman of the musalmān faith who still lives at sardhana but she had become insane and has ever since remained so by this first wife he had a son who got from the emperor the title of zafar yāb khān at the request of the bēgam his stepmother but he was a man of weak intellect and so little thought of that he was not recognized even as the nominal chief on the death of his father walter reinhard was a native of salzburg he enlisted as a private soldier in the french service and came to india where he entered the service of the east india company and rose to the rank of sergeant reinhard got the sobriquet of sombre from his comrades while in the french service from the sombre cast of his countenance and temper an armenian by name gregory of a calcutta family the virtual minister of kāsim alī khān under the title of gorgīn khān took him into his service when the war was about to commence between his master and the english kāsim alī was a native of kāshmīr and not naturally a bad man but he was goaded to madness by the injuries and insults heaped upon him by the servants of the east india company who were not then paid as at present in adequate salaries but in profits upon all kinds of monopolies and they would not suffer the recognized sovereign of the country in which they traded to grant to his subjects the same exemption that they claimed for themselves exclusively and a war was the consequence mr ellis one of these civil servants and chief of the factory at patna whose opinions had more weight with the council in calcutta than all the wisdom of such men as vansittart and warren hastings because they happened to be more consonant with the personal interests of the majority precipitately brought on the war and assumed the direction of all military operations of which he knew nothing and for which he seems to have been totally unfitted by the violence of his temper all his enterprises failedthe city and factory were captured by the enemy and the european inhabitants taken prisoners the nawāb smarting under the reiterated wrongs he had received and which he attributed mainly to the counsels of mr ellis no sooner found the chief within his grasp than he determined to have him and all who were taken with him save a doctor fullarton to whom he owed some personal obligations put to death his own native officers were shocked at the proposal and tried to dissuade him from the purpose but he was resolved and not finding among them any willing to carry it into execution he applied to sumroo who readily undertook and with some of his myrmidons performed the horrible duty in at the suggestion of gregory and sombre kāsim alī now attempted to take the small principality of nepāl as a kind of basis for his operations against the english he had four hundred excellent rifles with flint locks and screwed barrels made at monghyr mungēr on the ganges so as to fit into small boxes these boxes were sent up on the backs of four hundred brave volunteers for this forlorn hope gregory had got a passport for the boxes as rare merchandise for the palace of the prince at kathmandū in whose presence alone they were to be opened on reaching the palace at night these volunteers were to open their boxes screw up the barrels destroy all the inmates and possess themselves of the palace where it is supposed kāsim ali had already secured many friends twelve thousand soldiers had advanced to the foot of the hills near betiyā to support the attack and the volunteers were in the fort of makwānpur the only strong fort between the plain and the capital they had been treated with great consideration by the garrison and were to set out at daylight the next morning but one of the attendants who had been let into the secret got drunk and in a quarrel with one of the garrison told him that he should see in a few days who would be master of that garrison this led to suspicion the boxes were broken open the arms discovered and the whole of the party except three or four were instantly put to death the three or four who escaped gave intelligence to the army at betiyā and the whole retreated upon monghyr but for this drunken man nepāl had perhaps been kāsim alīskāsim alī khān was beaten in several actions by our gallant little band of troops under their able leader colonel adams and at last driven to seek shelter with the nawāb wazīr of oudh into whose service sumroo afterwards entered this chief being in his turn beaten sumroo went off and entered the service of the celebrated chief of rohilkhand hāfiz rahmat khān this he soon quitted from fear of the english he raised two battalions in which he soon afterwards increased to four and let out always to the highest bidderfirst to the jāt chiefs of dīg then to the chief of jaipur then to najaf khān the prime minister and then to the marāthās his battalions were officered by europeans but europeans of respectability were unwilling to take service under a man so precariously situated however great their necessities and he was obliged to content himself for the most part with the very dross of societymen who could neither read nor write nor keep themselves sober the consequence was that the battalions were often in a state of mutiny committing every kind of outrage upon the persons of their officers and at all times in a state of insubordination bordering on mutiny these battalions seldom obtained their pay till they put their commandant into confinement and made him dig up his hidden stores if he had any or borrow from bankers if he had none if the troops felt pressed for time and their commander was of the necessary character they put him astride upon a hot gun without his trousers when our battalion had got its pay out of him in this manner he was often handed over to another for the same purpose the poor old bēgam had been often subjected to the starving stage of this proceeding before she came under our protection but had never i believe been grilled upon a gun it was a rule it was said with sombre to enter the field of battle at the safest point form line facing the enemy fire a few rounds in the direction where they stood without regard to the distance or effect form square and await the course of events if victory declared for the enemy he sold his unbroken force to him to great advantage if for his friends he assisted them in collecting the plunder and securing all the advantages of the victory to this prudent plan of action his corps afterwards steadily adhered and they never took or lost a gun till they came in contact with our forces at ajantā and assaye sombre died at agra on the th of may and his remains were at first buried in his garden they were afterwards removed to the consecrated ground in the agra churchyard by his widow the bēgam who was baptized at the age of forty by a roman catholic priest under the name of joanna on the th of may on the death of her husband she was requested to take command of the force by all the europeans and natives that composed it as the only possible mode of keeping them together since the son was known to be altogether unfit she consented and was regularly installed in the charge by the emperor shāh alam her chief officer was a mr paoli a german who soon after took an active part in providing the poor imbecile old emperor with a prime minister and got himself assassinated on the restoration a few weeks after of his rival the troops continued in the same state of insubordination and the bēgam was anxious for an opportunity to show that she was determined to be obeyed while she was encamped with the army of the prime minister of the time at mathurā news was one day brought to her that two slave girls had set fire to her houses at agra in order that they might make off with their paramours two soldiers of the guard she had left in charge these houses had thatched roofs and contained all her valuables and the widows wives and children of her principal officers the fire had been put out with much difficulty and great loss of property and the two slave girls were soon after discovered in the bazaar at agra and brought out to the bēgams camp she had the affair investigated in the usual summary form and their guilt being proved to the satisfaction of all present she had them flogged till they were senseless and then thrown into a pit dug in front of her tent for the purpose and buried alive i had heard the story related in different ways and i now took pains to ascertain the truth and this short narrative may i believe be relied upon an old persian merchant called the agā still resided at sardhana to whom i knew that one of the slave girls belonged i visited him and he told me that his father had been on intimate terms with sombre and when he died his mother went to live with his widow the bēgamthat his slave girl was one of the twothat his mother at first protested against her being taken off to the camp but became on inquiry satisfied of her guiltand that the bēgams object was to make a strong impression upon the turbulent spirit of her troops by a severe example in this object said the old agā she entirely succeeded and for some years after her orders were implicitly obeyed had she faltered on that occasion she must have lost the commandshe would have lost that respect without which it would have been impossible for her to retain it a month i was then a boy but i remember well that there were besides my mother and sisters many respectable females that would have rather perished in the flames than come out to expose themselves to the crowd that assembled to see the fires and had the fires not been put out a great many lives must have been lost besides there were many old people and young children who could not have escaped the old agā was going off to take up his quarters at delhi when this conversation took place and i am sure that he told me what he thought to be true this narrative corresponded exactly with that of several other old men from whom i had heard the story it should be recollected that among natives there is no particular mode of execution prescribed for those who are condemned to die nor in a camp like this any court of justice save that of the commander in which they could be tried and supposing the guilt to have been established as it is said to have been to the satisfaction of the bēgam and the principal officers who were all europeans and christians perhaps the punishment was not much greater than the crime deserved and the occasion demanded but it is possible that the slave girls may not have set fire to the buildings but merely availed themselves of the occasion of the fire to run off indeed slave girls are under so little restraint in india that it would be hardly worth while for them to burn down a house to get out i am satisfied that the bēgam believed them guilty and that the punishment horrible as itwas was merited it certainly had the desired effect my object has been to ascertain the truth in this case and to state it and not to eulogize or defend the old bēgam after paolis death the command of the troops under the bēgam devolved successively upon baours evans dudrenec who after a short time all gave it up in disgust at the beastly habits of the european subalterns and the overbearing insolence to which they and the want of regular pay gave rise among the soldiers at last the command devolved upon monsieur le vaisseau a french gentleman of birth education gentlemanly deportment and honourable feelings the battalions had been increased to six with their due proportion of guns and cavalry part resided at sardhana her capital and part at delhi in attendance upon the emperor a very extraordinary man entered her service about the same time with le vaisseau george thomas who from a quartermaster on board a ship raised himself to a principality in northern india thomas on one occasion raised his mistress in the esteem of the emperor and the people by breaking through the old rule of central squares gallantly leading on his troops and rescuing his majesty from a perilous situation in one of his battles with a rebellious subject najaf kulī khān where the bēgam was present in her palankeen and reaped all the laurels being from that day called the most beloved daughter of the emperor as his best chance of securing his ascendancy against such a rival le vaisseau proposed marriage to the bēgam and was accepted she was married to le vaisseau by father gregoris a carmelite monk in before saleur and bernier two french officers of great merit george thomas left her service in consequence in and set up for himself and was afterwards crushed by the united armies of the sikhs and marāthās commanded by european officers after he had been recognized as a general officer by the governorgeneral of india george thomas had latterly twelve small disciplined battalions officered by europeans he had good artillery cast his own guns and was the first person that applied iron calibres to brass cannon he was unquestionably a man of very extraordinary military genius and his ferocity and recklessness as to the means he used were quite in keeping with the times his revenues were derived from the sikh states which he had rendered tributary and he would probably have been sovereign of them all in the room of ranjit singh had not the jealousy of perron and other french officers in the marāthā army interposed the bēgam tried in vain to persuade her husband to receive all the european officers of the corps at his table as gentlemen urging that not only their domestic peace but their safety among such a turbulent set required that the character of these officers should be raised if possible and their feelings conciliated nothing he declared should ever induce him to sit at table with men of such habits and they at last determined that no man should command them who would not condescend to do so their insolence and that of the soldiers generally became at last unbearable and the bēgam determined to go off with her husband and seek an asylum in the honourable companys territory with the little property she could command of one hundred thousand rupees in money and her jewels amounting perhaps in value to one hundred thousand more le vaisseau did not understand english but with the aid of a grammar and a dictionary he was able to communicate her wishes to colonel mcgowan who commanded at that time an advanced post of our army at anūpshahr on the ganges he proposed that the colonel should receive them in his cantonments and assist them in their journey thence to farrukhābād where they wished in future to reside free from the cares and anxieties of such a charge the colonel had some scruples under the impression that he might be censured for aiding in the flight of a public officer of the emperor he now addressed the governorgeneral of india sir john shore himself april who requested major palmer our accredited agent with sindhia who was then encamped near delhi and holding the seals of prime minister of the empire to interpose his good offices in favour of the bēgam and her husband sindhia demanded twelve lākhs of rupees as the price of the privilege she solicited to retire and the bēgam in her turn demanded over and above the privilege of resigning the command into his hands the sum of four lākhs of rupees as the price of the arms and accoutrements which had been provided at her own cost and that of her late husband it was at last settled that she should resign the command and set out secretly with her husband and that sindhia should confer the command of her troops upon one of his own officers who would pay the son of sombre two thousand rupees a month for life le vaisseau was to be received into our territories treated as a prisoner of war upon parole and permitted to reside with his wife at the french settlement of chandernagore his last letter to sir john shore is dated the th april his last letters describing this final arrangement are addressed to mr even a french merchant at mirzapore and a mr bernier both personal friends of his and are dated th of may the battalions on duty at delhi got intimation of this correspondence made the son of sombre declare himself their legitimate chief and march at their head to seize the bēgam and her husband le vaisseau heard of their approach and urged the bēgam to set out with him at midnight for anūpshahr declaring that he would rather destroy himself than submit to the personal indignities which he knew would be heaped upon him by the infuriated ruffians who were coming to seize them the bēgam consented declaring that she would put an end to her life with her own hand should she be taken she got into her palankeen with a dagger in her hand and as he had seen her determined resolution and proud spirit before exerted on many trying occasions he doubted not that she would do what she declared she would he mounted his horse and rode by the side of her palankeen with a pair of pistols in his holsters and a good sword by his side they had got as far as kabrī about three miles from sardhana on the road to meerut when they found the battalions from sardhana who had got intimation of the flight gaining fast upon the palankeen le vaisseau asked the bēgam whether she remained firm in her resolve to die rather than submit to the indignities that threatened them yes replied she showing him the dagger firmly grasped in her right hand he drew a pistol from his holster without saying anything but urged on the bearers he could have easily galloped off and saved himself but he would not quit his wifesside at last the soldiers came up close behind them the female attendants of the bēgam began to scream and looking in le vaisseau saw the white cloth that covered the bēgams breast stained with blood she had stabbed herself but the dagger had struck against one of the bones of her chest and she had not courage to repeat the blow her husband put his pistol to his temple and fired the bail passed through his head and he fell dead on the ground one of the soldiers who saw him told me that he sprang at least a foot off the saddle into the air as the shot struck him his body was treated with every kind of insult by the european officers and their men and the bēgam was taken back into sardhana kept under a gun for seven days deprived of all kinds of food save what she got by stealth from her female servants and subjected to all manner of insolent language at last the officers were advised by george thomas who had instigated them to this violence out of pique against the bēgam for her preference of the frenchman to set aside their puppet and reseat the bēgam in the command as the only chance of keeping the territory of sardhana if said he the bēgam should die under the torture of mind and body to which you are subjecting her the minister will very soon resume the lands assigned for your payment and disband a force so disorderly and so little likely to be of any use to him or the emperor a council of war was heldthe bēgam was taken out from under the gun and reseated on the masnad a paper was drawn up by about thirty european officers of whom only one monsieur saleur could sign his own name swearing in the name of god and jesus christ that they would henceforward obey her with all their hearts and souls and recognize no other person whomsoever as commander they all affixed their seals to this covenant but some of them to show their superior learning put their initials or what they used as such for some of these learned thebans knew only two or three letters of the alphabet which they put down though they happened not to be their real initials an officer on the part of sindhia who was to have commanded these troops was present at this reinstallation of the bēgam and glad to take as a compensation for his disappointment the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand rupees which the bēgam contrived to borrow for him the body of poor le vaisseau was brought back to camp and there lay several days unburied and exposed to all kinds of indignities the supposition that this was the result of a plan formed by the bēgam to get rid of le vaisseau is i believe unfounded the bēgam herself gave some colour of truth to the report by retaining the name of her first husband sombre to the last and never publicly or formally declaring her marriage with le vaisseau after his death the troops in this mutiny pretended nothing more than a desire to vindicate the honour of their old commander sombre which had they said been compromised by the illicit intercourse between le vaisseau and his widow she had not dared to declare the marriage to them lest they should mutiny on that ground and deprive her of the command and for the same reason she retained the name of sombre after her restoration and remained silent on the subject of her second marriage the marriage was known only to a few european officers sir john shore major palmer and the other gentlemen with whom le vaisseau corresponded some grave old native gentlemen who were long in her service have told me that they believed there really was too much of truth in the story which excited the troops to mutiny on that occasionher too great intimacy with the gallant young frenchman god forgive them for saying so of a lady whose salt they had eaten for so many years le vaisseau made no mention of the marriage to colonel mcgowan and from the manner in which he mentions it to sir john shore it is clear that he or she or both were anxious to conceal it from the troops and from sindhia before their departure she stipulated in her will that her heir mr dyce should take the name of sombre as if she wished to have the little episode of her second marriage forgotten after the death of le vaisseau the command devolved on monsieur saleur a frenchman the only respectable officer who signed the covenant he had taken no active part in the mutiny on the contrary he had done all he could to prevent it and he was at last with george thomas the chief means of bringing his brother officers back to a sense of their duty another battalion was added to the four in and another raised in and five of the six marched under colonel saleur to the deccan with sindhia they were in a state of mutiny the whole way and utterly useless as auxiliaries as saleur himself declared in many of his letters written in french to his mistress the bēgam at the battle of assaye four of these battalions were left in charge of the marāthā camps one was present in the action and lost its four guns soon after the return of these battalions the bēgam entered into an alliance with the british government the force then consisted of these six battalions a party of artillery served chiefly by europeans and two hundred horse she had a good arsenal well stored a foundry for cannon both within the walls of a small fortress built near her dwelling at sardhana the whole cost her about four lākhs of rupees a year her civil establishments eighty thousand and her household establishments and expenses about the same total six lākhs of rupees a year the revenues of sardhana and the other lands assigned at different times for the payment of the force had been at no time more than sufficient to cover these expenses but under the protection of our government they improved with the extension of tillage and the improvements of the surrounding markets for produce and she was enabled to give largely to the support of charitable institutions and to provide handsomely for the support of her family and pensioners after her death sombres son zafaryāb khān had a daughter who was married to colonel dyce who had for some time the management of the bēgams affairs but he lost her favour long before her death by his violent temper and overbearing manners and was obliged to resign the management to his son who on the bēgams death came in for the bulk of her fortune or about sixty lākhs of rupees he has two sisters who were brought up by the bēgam one married to captain troup an englishman and the other to mr salaroli an italian both very worthy men their wives have beenhandsomely provided for by the bēgam and by their brother who trebled the fortunes left to them by the bēgam she built an excellent church at sardhana and assigned the sum of rupees as a fund to provide for its service and repairs rupees as another fund for the poor of the place and as a third for a college in which roman catholic priests might be educated for the benefit of india generally she sent to rome rupees to be employed as a charity fund at the discretion of the pope and to the archbishop of canterbury she sent for the same purpose she gave to the bishop of calcutta rupees to provide teachers for the poor of the protestant church in calcutta she sent to calcutta for distribution to the poor and for the liberation of deserving debtors to the catholic missions at calcutta bombay and madras she gave and to that of agra she built a handsome chapel for the roman catholics at meerut and presented the fund for its support with a donation of and she built a chapel for the church missionary at meerut the reverend mr richards at a cost of to meet the wants of the native protestants among all who had opportunities of knowing her she bore the character of a kindhearted benevolent and good woman and i have conversed with men capable of judging who had known her for more than fifty years she had uncommon sagacity and a masculine resolution and the europeans and natives who were most intimate with her have told me that though a woman and of small stature her rub dignity or power of commanding personal respect was greater than that of almost any person they had ever seen from the time she put herself under the protection of the british government in she by degrees adopted the european modes of social intercourse appearing in public on an elephant in a carriage and occasionally on horseback with her hat and veil and dining at table with gentlemen she often entertained governorsgeneral and commandersin chief with all their retinues and sat with them and their staff at table and for some years past kept an open house for the society of meerut but in no situation did she lose sight of her dignity she retained to the last the grateful affections of the thousands who were supported by her bounty while she never ceased to inspire the most profound respect in the minds of those who every day approached her and were on the most unreserved terms of intimacy lord william bentinck was an excellent judge of character and the following letter will show how deeply his visit to that part of

inveterate enemy of mr thomas thomas was an irishman born in the county of tipperary from the best information we could procure it appears that mr george thomas first came to india in a british ship of war in his situation in the fleet was humble having served as a quartermaster or as is affirmed by some in the capacity of a common sailor his first service was among the polygars to the southward where he resided a few years but at length setting out overland he spiritedly traversed the central part of the peninsula and about the year arrived at delhi here he received a commission in the service of the bēgam sumroo soon after his arrival at delhi the bēgam with her usual judgement and discrimination of character advanced him to a command in her army from this period his military career in the northwest of india may be said to have commenced owing to the rivalry of le vaisseau thomas quitted the bēgam sumroo and about betook himself to the frontier station of the british army at the post of anopshire anūpshāhr here he waited several months in the beginning of the year mr thomas being at anopshire received letters from appakandarow apakanda rāo a mahratta chief conveying offers of service and promises of a comfortable provision francklin op cit p the author states that thomas left the bēgams service in after her marriage with le vaisseau in that year francklin see

salary in one of the government offices at agra beale this incident happened in see nwp gazetteer vol ii p ig vol xii p a more competent estimate may perhaps be formed of his abilities if we reflect on the nature and extent of one of his plans which he detailed to the compiler of these memoirs during his residence at benares when fixed in his residence at hānsī he first conceived and would if unforeseen and untoward circumstances had not occurred have executed the bold design of extending his conquests to the mouths of the indus this was to have been effected by a fleet of boats constructed from timber procured in the forests near the city of fīrōzpur on the banks of the satlaj river proceeding down that river with his army and settling the countries he might subdue on his route a daring enterprise and conceived in the true spirit of an ancient roman on the conclusion of this design it was his intention to turn his arms against thepanjāb which he expected to reduce in a couple of years and which considering the wealth he would then have acquired and the amazing resources he would have possessed these successes combined would doubtless have contributed to establish his authority on a firm and solid basis he offered to conquer the panjāb on behalf of the government of india for the welfare of his king and country francklin pp a small town in the bulandshahr

the liègeois strenuously dissuaded the bēgam from the proposed hostilities and was in consequence degraded by le vaisseau the troop then mutinied and swore allegiance to zafar yāb khān francklin p thomas says that the overtures came from the bēgam in a manner the most abject and desponding she addressed mr thomas implored him to come to her assistance and finally offered to pay any sum of money the marāthās should require on condition they would reinstate her in the jāgīr on receipt of these letters mr thomas by an offer of rupees prevailed on bāpū sindhia to make a movement towards sardhana after negotiation thomas marched to khataulī and publicly gave out that unless the bēgam was reinstated in her authority those who resisted must expect no mercy and to give additional weight to this declaration he apprised them that he was acting under the orders of the marāthā chiefs after some difficulty she was finally reinstated in the full authority of her jāgīr this version of the affair it will be noticed does not quite agree with that given more briefly by the author the paper was written by a muhammadan and he would not write christ the son of god it is written in the name of god and his majesty christ the muhammadans look upon christ as the greatest of prophets before muhammad but the most binding article of their faith is this from the korān which they repeat every day i believe in god who was never begot nor has ever begotten nor will ever have an equalalluding to the christians belief in the trinity w h s for mohammeds opinion of jesus christ see especially chapters and of the korān to my mind the circumstances all tend to throw suspicion on the bēgam the author evidently was disposed to form the beat possible opinion of her character and acts after the bēgams death the revenue settlement of the estate was made by mr plowden who writes in his report as quoted in nwp gazetteer st ed vol iii p the rule seems to have been fully recognized and acted up to by the bēgam which declared that according to muhammadan law there shall be left for every man who cultivates his lands as much as he requires for his own support till the next crop be reaped and that of his family and for seed this much shall be left to him what remains is landtax and shall go to the public treasury for considering her territory as a private estate and her subjects as serfs she appropriated the whole produce of their labour with the exception of what sufficed to keep body and soul together it was by these means that a factitious state of prosperity was induced and maintained which though it might and i believe did deceive the bēgams neighbours into an impression that her country was highly prosperous could not delude the population into content and happiness above the surface and to the eye all was smiling and prosperous but within was rottenness and misery under these circumstances the smallness of the above arrear is no proof of the fairness of the revenue it

mary chapter on the spirit of military discipline in the native army of india abolition of corporal punishmentincrease of pay with length of servicepromotion by seniority the following observations on a very important and interesting subject were not intended to form a portion of the present work they serve to illustrate however many passages in the foregoing chapters touching the character of the natives of india and the afghan war having occurred since they were written i cannot deny myself the gratification of presenting them to the public since the courage and fidelity which it was my object to show the british government had a right to expect from its native troops and might always rely upon in the hour of need have been so nobly displayed i had one morning november th a visit from the senior native officer of my regiment shaikh mahūb alī a very fine old gentleman who had recently attained the rank of sardār bahādur and been invested with the new order of british india he entered the service at the age of fifteen and had served fiftythree years with great credit to himself and fought in many an honourable field he had come over to jubbulpore as president of a native general courtmartial and paid me several visits in company with another old officer of my regiment who was a member of the same court the following is one of the many conversations i had with him taken down as soon as he left me what do you think sardār bahādur of the order prohibiting corporal punishment in the army has it had a bad or a good effect it has had a very good effect what good has it produced it has reduced the number of courts martial to onequarter of what they were before and thereby lightened the duties of the officers it has made the good men more careful and the bad men more orderly than they used to be how has it produced this effect a bad man formerly went on recklessly from small offences to great ones in the hope of impunity he knew that no regimental cantonment or brigade court martial could sentence him to be dismissed the service and that they would not sentence him to be flogged except for great crimes because it involved at the same time dismissal from the service if they sentenced him to be flogged he still hoped that the punishment would be remitted the general or officer confirming the sentence was generally unwilling to order it to be carried into effect because the man must after being flogged be tumed out of the service and the marks of the lash upon his back would prevent his getting service anywhere else now he knows that these courts can sentence him to be dismissed from the servicethat he is liable to lose his bread for ordinary transgressions and be sentenced to work on the roads for graver ones he is in consequence much more under restraint than he used to be and how has it tended to make the welldisposed more careful they were formerly liable to be led into errors by the example of the bad men under the same hope of impunity but they are now more on their guard they have all relations among the native officers who are continually impressing upon them the necessity of being on their guard lest they be sent back upon their familiestheir mothers and fathers wives and children as beggars to be dismissed from a service like that of the company is a very great punishment it subjects a man to the odium and indignation of all his family when in the companys service his friends know that a soldier gets his pay regularly and can afford to send home a very large portion of it they expect that he will do so he feels that they will listen to no excuse and he contracts habits of sobriety and prudence if a man gets into the service of a native chief his friends know that his pay is precarious and they continue to maintain his family for many years without receiving a remittance from him in the hope that his circumstances may one day improve he contracts bad habits and is not ashamed to make his appearance among them knowing that his excuses will be received as valid if one of the companys sepoys were not to send home remittances for six months some members of the family would be sent to know the reason why if he could not explain they would appeal to the native officers of the regiment who would expostulate with him and if all failed his wife and children would be tumed out of his fathers house unless they knew that he was gone to the wars and he would be ashamed ever to show his face among them again and the gradual increase of pay with length of service has tended to increase the value of the service has it notit has very much there are in our regiment out of eight hundred men more than one hundred and fifty sepoys who get the increase of two rupees a month and the same number that get the increase of one this they feel as an immense addition to the former seven rupees a month a prudent sepoy lives upon two or at the utmost three rupees a month in seasons of moderate plenty and sends all the rest to his family a great number of the sepoys of our regiment live upon the increase of two rupees and send all their former seven to their families the dismissal of a man from such a service as this distresses not only him but all his relations in the higher grades who know how much of the comfort and happiness of his family depend upon his remaining and advancing in it and they all try to make their young friends behave as they ought to do do you think that a great portion of the native officers of the army have the same feelings and opinions on the subject as you have they have all the same there is not i believe one in a hundred that does not think as i do upon the subject flogging was an odious thing a man was disgraced not only before his regiment but before the crowd that assembled to witness the punishment had he been suffered to remain in the regiment he could never have hoped to rise after having been flogged or sentenced to be flogged his hopes were all destroyed and his spirit broken and the order directing him to be dismissed was good but as i have said he lost all hope of getting into any other service and dared not show his face among his family at home you know who ordered the abolition of flogging lord bentinck and you know that it was at his recommendation the honourable company gave the increase of pay with length of service we have heard so and we feel towards him as we felt towards lord wellesley lord hastings and lord lake do you think the army would serve again now with the same spirit as they served under lord lake the army would go to any part of the world to serve such mastersno army had ever masters that cared for them like ours we never asked to have flogging abolished nor did we ever ask to have an increase of pay with length of service and yet both have been done for us by the company bahādur the old sardār bahādur came again to visit me on the st of december with all the native officers who had come over from sāgar to attend the court seven in number there were three very smart sensible men among them one of whom had been a volunteer at the capture of java and the others at that of the isle of france they all told me that they considered the abolition of corporal punishment a great blessing to the native army some bad men who had already lost their character and consequently all hope of promotion might be in less dread than before but they were very few and their regiments would soon get rid of them under the new law that gave the power of dismissal to regimental courts martial but i find the european officers are almost all of opinion that the abolition of flogging has been or will be attended with bad consequences they sir apprehend that there will not be sufficient restraint upon the loose characters of the regiment but now that the sepoys have got an increase of pay in proportion to length of service there will be no danger of that where can they ever hope to get such another service if they forfeit that of the company if the dread of losing such a service is not sufficient to keep the bad in order that of being put to work upon the roads in irons will the good can always be kept in order by lighter punishments when they have so much at stake as the loss of such a service by frequent offences some gentlemen think that a soldier does not feel disgraced by being flogged unless the offence for which he has been flogged is in itself disgraceful there is no soldier sir that does not feel disgraced by being tied up to the halberts and flogged in the face of all his comrades and the crowd that may choose to come and look at him the sepoys are all of the same respectable families as ourselves and they all enter the service in the hope of rising in time to the same stations as ourselves if they conduct themselves well their families look forward with the same hope a man who has been tied up and flogged knows the disgrace that it will bring upon his family and will sometimes rather die than return to it indeed as head of a family he could not be received at home but men do not feel disgraced in being flogged with a rattan at drill while at the drill they consider themselves and are considered by us all as in the relation of scholars to their schoolmasters doing away with the rattan at drill had a very bad effect young men were formerly with the judicious use of the rattan made fit to join the regiment at furthest in six months but since the abolition of the rattan it takes twelve months to make them fit to be seen in the ranks there was much virtue in the rattan and it should never have been given up we have all been flogged with the rattan at the drill and never felt ourselves disgraced by itwe were shāgirds scholars and the drillsergeant who had the rattan was our ustād schoolmaster but when we left the drill and took our station in the ranks as sepoys the case was altered and we should have felt disgraced by a flogging whatevermight have been the nature of the offence we committed the drill will never get on so well as it used to do unless the rattan be called into use again but we apprehend no evil from the abolition of corporal punishment afterwards people are apt to attribute to this abolition offences that have nothing to do with it and for which ample punishments are still provided if a man fires at his officer people are apt to say it is because flogging has been done away with but a man who deliberately fires at his officer is prepared to undergo worse punishment than flogging do you not think that the increase of pay with length of service to the sepoys will have a good effect in tending to give to regiments more active and intelligent native officers old sepoys who are not so will now have less cause to complain if passed over will they not if the sepoys thought that the increase of pay was given with this view they would rather not have it at all to pass over men merely because they happen to have grown old we consider very cruel and unjust they all enter the service young and go on doing their duty till they become old in the hope that they shall get promotion when it comes to their turn if they are disappointed and young men or greater favourites with their european officers are put over their heads they become heartbroken we all feel for them and are always sorry to see an old soldier passed over unless he has been guilty of any manifest crime or neglect of duty he has always some relations among the native officers who know his family for we all try to get our relations into the same regiment with ourselves when they are eligible they know what that family will suffer when they learn that he has no longer any hopes of rising in the service and has become miserable supersessions create distress and bad feelings throughout a regiment even when the best men are promoted which cannot always be the case for the greatest favourites are not always the best men many of our old european officers like yourself are absent on staff or civil employments and the command of companies often devolves upon very young subalterns who know little or nothing of the character of their men they recommend those whom they have found most active and intelligent and believe to be the best but their opportunities of learning the characters of the men have been few they have seen and observed the young active and forward but they often know nothing of the steady unobtrusive old soldier who has done his duty ably in all situations without placing himself prominently forward in any the commanding officers seldom remain long with the same regiment and consequently seldom know enough of the men to be able to judge of the justice of the selections for promotion where a man has been guilty of a crime or neglected his duty we feel no sympathy for him and are not ashamed to tell him so and put him down when he complains here the old sūbadār who had been at the taking of the isle of france mentioned that when he was senior jemadār of his regiment and a vacancy had occurred to bring him in as sūbadār he was sent for by his commanding officer and told that by orders from headquarters he was to be passed over on account of his advanced age and supposed infirmity i felt said the old man as if i had been struck by lightning and fell down dead the colonel was a good man and had seen much service he had me taken into the open air and when i recovered he told me that he would write to the commanderinchief and represent my case he did so and i was promoted and i have since done my duty as sūbadār for ten years the sardār bahādur told me that only two men in our regiment had been that year superseded one for insolence and the other for neglect of duty and that officers and sepoys were all happy in consequencethe young because they felt more secure of being promoted if they did their duty and the old because they felt an interest in their young relations in those regiments said he where supersessions have been more numerous old and young are dispirited and unhappy they all feel that the good old rule of right hakk as long as a man does his duty well can no longer be relied upon when two companies of my regiment passed through jubbulpore a few days after this conversation on their way from sāgar to seoni i rode out a mile or two to meet them they had not seen me for sixteen years but almost all the native commissioned and noncommissioned officers were personally known to me they were all very glad to see me and i rode along with them to their place of encampment where i had ready a feast of sweetmeats they liked me as a young man and are i believe proud of me as an old one old and young spoke with evident delight of the rigid adherence on the part of the present commanding officer colonel presgrave to the good old rule of hakk right in the recent promotions to the vacancies occasioned by the annual transfer to the invalid establishment we might no doubt have in every regiment a few smarter native officers by disregarding this rule than by adhering to it but we should in the diminution of the good feeling towards the european officers and the government lose a thousand times more than we gained they now go on from youth to old age from the drill to the retired pension happy and satisfied that there is no service on earth so good for them with admirable moral but little or no literary education the native officers of our regiments never dream of aspiring to anything more than is now held out to them and the mass of the soldiers are inspired with devotion to the service and every feeling with which we could wish to have them inspired by the hope of becoming officers in time if they discharge their duties faithfully and zealously deprive the mass of this hope give the commissions to an exclusive class of natives or to a favoured few chosen often if not commonly without reference to the feelings or qualifications we most want in our native officers and our native army will soon cease to have the same feelings of devotion towards the government and of attachment and respect towards their european officers that they now have the young ambitions and aspiring native officers will soon try to teach the great mass that their interest andthat of the european officers and european government are by no means one and the same as they have been hitherto led to suppose and it is upon the good feeling of this great mass that we have to depend for support to secure this good feeling we can well afford to sacrifice a little efficiency at the drill it was unwise in one of the commandersinchief to direct that no soldier in our bengal native regiments should be promoted unless he could read and writeit was to prohibit the promotion of the best and direct the promotion of the worst soldiers in the ranks in india a military officer is rated as a gentleman by his birth that is caste and by his deportment in all his relations of life not by his knowledge of books the rājpūt the brahman and the proud pathān who attains a commission and deports himself like an officer never thinks himself or is thought by others deficient in anything that constitutes the gentleman because he happens not to be at the same time a clerk he has from his childhood been taught to consider the quill and the sword as two distinct professions both useful and honourable when honourably pursued and having chosen the sword he thinks he does quite enough in learning how to use and support it through all grades and ought not to be expected to encroach on the profession of the penman this is a tone of feeling which it is clearly the interest of government rather to foster than discourage and the order which militated so much against it has happily been either rescinded or disregarded threefourths of the recruits of our bengal native infantry are drawn from the rājpūt peasantry of the kingdom of oudh on the left bank of the ganges where their affections have been linked to the soil for a long series of generations the good feelings of the families from which they are drawn continue through the whole period of their service to exercise a salutary influence over their conduct as men and as soldiers though they never take their families with them they visit them on furlough every two or three years and always return to them when the surgeon considers a change of air necessary to their recovery from sickness their family circles are always present to their imaginations and the recollections of their last visit the hopes of the next and the assurance that their conduct as men and as soldiers in the interval will be reported to those circles by their many comrades who are annually returning on furlough to the same parts of the country tend to produce a general and uniform propriety of conduct that is hardly to be found among the soldiers of any other army in the world and which seems incomprehensible to those unacquainted with its source veneration for parents cherished through life and a neverimpaired love of home and of all the dear objects by which it is constituted our indian native army is perhaps the only entirely voluntary standing army that has been ever known and it is to all intents and purposes entirely voluntary and as such must be treated we can have no other native army in india and without such an army we could not maintain our dominion a day our best officers have always understood this quite well and they have never tried to flog and harass men out of all that we find good in them for our purposes any regiment in our service might lay down their arms and disperse tomorrow without our having a chance of apprehending one deserter among them all when frederick the great of prussia reviewed his army of sixty thousand men in pomerania previous to his invasion of silesia he asked the prince danhalt who accompanied him what he most admired in the scene before him sire replied the prince i admire at once the fine appearance of the men and the regularity and perfection of their movements and evolutions for my part said frederick this is not what excites my astonishment since with the advantage of money time and care these are easily attained it is that you and i my dear cousin should be in the midst of such an army as this in perfect safety here are sixty thousand men who are all irreconcilable enemies to both you and myself not one among them that is not a man of more strength and better armed than either yet they all tremble at our presence while it would be folly on our part to tremble at theirssuch is the wonderful effect of order vigilance and subordination but a reasonable man might ask what were the circumstances which enabled frederick to keep in a state of order and subordination an army composed of soldiers who were irreconcilable enemies of their prince and of their officers he could have told the prince danhalt had he chose to do so for frederick was a man who thought deeply the chief circumstance favourable to his ambition was the imbecility of the old french government then in its dotage and unable to see that an army of involuntary soldiers was no longer compatible with the state of the nation this government had reduced its soldiers to a condition worse than that of the common labourers upon the roads while it deprived them of all hope of rising and all feeling of pride in the profession desertion became easy from the extension of the french dominion and from the circumstance of so many belligerent powers around requiring good soldiers and no odium attended desertion where everything was done to degrade and nothing to exalt the soldier in his own esteem and that of society instead of following the course of events and rendering the condition of the soldier less odious by increasing his pay and hope of promotion and diminishing the labour and disgrace to which he was liable and thereby filling her regiments with voluntary soldiers when involuntary ones could no longer be obtained the government of france reduced the soldiers pay to onehalf the rate of wages which a common labourer got on the roads and put them under restraints and restrictions that made them feel every day and every hour that they were slaves to prevent desertions by severeexamples under this highpressure system they had recourse first to slitting the noses and cutting off the ears of deserters and lastly to shooting them as fast as they could catch them but all was in vain and frederick of prussia alone got fifty thousand of the finest soldiers in the world from the french regiments who composed onethird of his army and enabled him to keep all the rest in that state of discipline that improved so much its efficiency in the same manner as the deserters from the roman legions which took place under similar circumstances became the flower of the army of mithridates frederick was in position and disposition a despot his territories were small while his ambition was boundless he was unable to pay a large army the rate of wages necessary to secure the services of voluntary soldiers and he availed himself of the happy imbecility of the french government to form an army of involuntary ones he got french soldiers at a cheap rate because they dared not return to their native country whence they were hunted down and shot like dogs and these soldiers enabled him to retain his own subjects in his ranks upon the same terms had the french government retraced its steps improved the condition of its soldiers and mitigated the punishment for desertion during the long war fredericks army would have fallen to pieces like the baseless fabric of a vision parmi nous says montesquieu les désertions sont fréquentes parce que les soldats sont la plus vile partie de chaque nation et quil ny en a aucun qui aie ou qui croie avoir un certain avantage sur les autres chez les romains elles étaient plus raresdes soldats tirés du sein dun peuple si fier si orgueilleux si sūr de commander aux autres ne pouvaient guère penser ā s aviler jusquà cesser dētre romains but was it the poor soldiers who were to blame if they were vile and had no advantage over others or the government that took them from the vilest classes or made their condition when they got them worse than that of the lowest class in society the romans deserted under the same circumstances and as i have stated formed the elite of the army of mithridates and the other enemies of rome but they respected their military oath of allegiance long after perjury among senators had ceased to excite any odium since as a fashionable or political vice it had become common did not our day of retribution come though in a milder shape to teach us a great political and moral lesson when so many of our brave sailors deserted our ships for those of america in which they fought against us they deserted from our ships of war because they were there treated like dogs or from our merchant ships because they were every hour liable to be seized like felons and put on board the former when england expected every man to do his duty at trafalgar had england done its duty to every man who was that day to fight for her is not the intellectual stock which the sailor acquires in scenes of peril upon the high and giddy mast as much his property as that which others acquire in scenes of peace at schools and colleges and have not our senators morally and religiously as much right to authorize their sovereign to seize clergymen lawyers and professors for employment in his service upon the wages of ordinary uninstructed labour as they have to authorize him to seize able sailors to be so employed in her navy a feeling more base than that which authorized the able seaman to be hunted down upon such conditions torn from his wife and children and put like uriah in front of those battles upon which our welfare and honour depended never disgraced any civilized nation with whose history we are acquainted sir matthew decker in a passage quoted by mr mcculloch says the custom of impressment put a freeborn british sailor on the same footing as a turkish slave the grand seignior cannot do a more absolute act than to order a man to be dragged away from his family and against his will run his head against the mouth of a cannon and if such acts should be frequent in turkey upon any one set of useful men would it not drive them away to other countries and thin their numbers yearly and would not the remaining few double or triple their wages which is the case with our sailors in time of war to the great detriment of our commerce the americans wisely relinquished the barbarous and unwise practice of their parent land and as mcculloch observes while the wages of all labourers and artisans are uniformly higher in the united states than in england those of sailors are generally lower as the natural consequence of manning their navy by means of voluntary enlistment alone at the close of the last war sixteen thousand british sailors were serving on board of american ships and the wages of our seamen rose from forty or fifty to a hundred or one hundred and twenty shillings a month as the natural consequence of our continuing to resort to impressment after the americans had given it up fredericks army consisted of about one hundred and fifty thousand men fifty thousand of these were french deserters and a considerable portion of the remaining hundred thousand were deserters from the austrian army in which desertion was punished in the same manner with death the dread of this punishment if they quitted his ranks enabled him to keep up that state of discipline that improved so much the efficacy of his regiments at the same time that it made every individual soldier his irreconcilable enemy not relying entirely upon this dread on the part of deserters to quit his ranks under his highpressure system of discipline and afraid that the soldiers of his own soil might make off in spite of all their vigilance he kept his regiments in garrison towns till called on actual service and that they might not desert on their way from one garrison to another during relief he never had them relieved at all a trooper was flogged for falling from his horse though he had broken a limb in his fall it was difficult he said to distinguish an involuntary fault from one that originated in negligence and to prevent a man hoping that his negligence would be forgiven all blunders were punished from whatever cause arising no soldier was suffered to quit his garrison till led out to fight and when a desertion took place cannons were fired to announce it to the surrounding country great rewards were given for apprehending andsevere punishments inflicted for harbouring the criminal and he was soon hunted down and brought back a soldier was therefore always a prisoner and a slave still all this rigour of prussian discipline like that of our navy was insufficient to extinguish that ambition which is inherent in our nature to obtain the esteem and applause of the circle in which we move and the soldier discharged his duty in the hour of danger in the hope of rendering his life more happy in the esteem of his officers and comrades every tolerably good soldier feels says adam smith that he would become the scorn of his companions if he should be supposed capable of shrinking from danger or of hesitating either to expose or to throw away his life when the good of the service required it so thought the philosopherking of prussia when he let his regiments out of garrison to go and face the enemy the officers were always treated with as much lenity in the prussian as any other service because the king knew that the hope of promotion would always be sufficient to bind them to their duties but the poor soldiers had no hope of this kind to animate them in their toils and their dangers we took our system of drill from frederick of prussia and there is still many a martinet who would carry his highpressure system of discipline into every other service over which he had any control unable to appreciate the difference of circumstances under which they may happen to be raised and maintained the sepoys of the bengal army the only part of our native army with which i am much acquainted are educated as soldiers from their infancythey are brought up in that feeling of entire deference for constituted authority which we require in soldiers and which they never lose through life they are taken from the agricultural classes of indian society almost all the sons of yeomencultivating proprietors of the soil whose families have increased beyond their means of subsistence one son is sent one after another to seek service in our regiments as necessity presses at home from whatever causethe increase of taxation or the too great increase of numbers in families no men can have a higher sense of the duty they owe to the state that employs them or whose salt they eat nor can any men set less value on life when the service of that state requires that it shall be risked or sacrificed no persons are brought up with more deference for parents in no family from which we drew our recruits is a son through infancy boyhood or youth heard to utter a disrespectful word to his parentssuch a word from a son to his parents would shock the feelings of the whole community in which the family resides and the offending member would be visited with their highest indignation when the father dies the eldest son takes his place and receives the same marks of respect the same entire confidence and deference as the father if he be a soldier in a distant land and can afford to do so he resigns the service and returns home to take his post as the head of the family if he cannot afford to resign if the family still want the aid of his regular monthly pay he remains with his regiment and denies himself many of the personal comforts he has hitherto enjoyed that he may increase his contribution to the general stock the wives and children of his brothers who are absent on service are confided to his care with the same confidence as to that of the father it is a rule to which i have through life found but few exceptions that those who are most disposed to resist constituted authority are those most disposed to abuse such authority when they get it the members of these families disposed as they always are to pay deference to such authority are scarcely ever found to abuse it when it devolves upon them and the elder son when he succeeds to the place of his father loses none of the affectionate attachment of his younger brothers they never take their wives or children with them to their regiments or to the places where their regiments are stationed they leave them with their fathers or elder brothers and enjoy their society only when they return on furlough threefourths of their incomes are sent home to provide for their comfort and subsistence and to embellish that home in which they hope to spend the winter of their days the knowledge that any neglect of the duty they owe their distant families will be immediately visited by the odium of their native officers and brother soldiers and ultimately communicated to the heads of their families acts as a salutary check on their conduct and i believe that there is hardly a native regiment in the bengal army in which the twenty drummers who are christians and have their families with the regiment do not cause more trouble to the officers than the whole eight hundred sepoys to secure the fidelity of such men all that is necessary is to make them feel secure of three thingstheir regular pay at the handsome rate at which it has now been fixed their retiring pensions upon the scale hitherto enjoyed and promotion by seniority like their european officers unless they shall forfeit all claims to it by misconduct or neglect of duty people talk about a demoralized army and discontented army no army in the world was certainly ever more moral or more contented than our native army or more satisfied that their masters merit all their devotion and attachment and i believe none was ever more devoted or attached to them i do not speak of the european officers of the native army they very generally believe that they have had just cause of complaint and sufficient care has not always been taken to remove that impression in all the junior grades the honourable companys officers have advantages over the queens in india in the higher grades the queens officers have advantages over those of the honourable company the reasons it does not behove me here to considerin all armies composed of involuntary soldiers that is of soldiers who are anxious to quit the ranks and return to peaceful occupations but cannot do so much of the drill to which they are subjected is adopted merely with a view to keep them from pondering too much upon the miseries of their present condition and from indulging in those licentious habits to which a strong sense of these miseries and the recollection of the enjoyments of peaceful life which they have sacrificed are too apt to drive them no portion of this is necessary for the soldiers of our native army who have no miseries to ponder over or superior enjoyments in peaceful life to look back upon and a very small quantity of drill is sufficient to make a regiment go through its evolutions well because they have all a pride and pleasure in their duties as long as they have a commanding officer who understands them clarke in his travels speaking of the three thousand native infantry from india whom he saw paraded in egypt under their gallant leader sir david baird says troops in such a state of military perfection or better suited for active service were never seennot even on the famous parade of the chosen ten thousand belonging to bonapartes legions which he was so vain of displaying before the present war in the front of the tuileries at paris not an unhealthy soldier was to be seen the english inured to the climate of india considered that of egypt as temperate in its effects and the sipāhees seemed as fond of the nile as the ganges it would be much better to devise more innocent amusements to lighten the miseries of european soldiers in india than to be worrying them every hour night and day with duties which are in themselves considered to be of no importance whatever and imposed merely with a view to prevent their having time to ponder on these miseries but all extra and useless duties to a soldier become odious because they are always associated in his mind with the ideas of the odious and degrading punishment inflicted for the neglect of them it is lamentable to think how much of misery is often wantonly inflicted upon the brave soldiers of our european regiments of india on the pretence of a desire to preserve order and discipline sportsmen know that if they train their horses beyond a certain point they train off that is they lose the spirit and with it the condition they require to support them in their hour of trial it is the same with soldiers if drilled beyond a certain point they drill off and lose the spirit which they require to sustain them in active service and before the enemy an overdrilled regiment will seldom go through its evolutions well even in ordinary review before its own general if it has all the mechanism it wants all the real spirit of military disciplineit becomes dogged and is in fact a body with but a soul the martinet who is seldom a man of much intellect is satisfied as long as the bodies of his men are drilled to his liking his narrow mind comprehends only one of the principles which influence mankindfear and upon this he acts with all the pertinacity of a slavedriver if he does not disgrace himself when he comes before the enemy as he commonly does by his own incapacity his men will perhaps try to disgrace him even at the sacrifice of what they hold dearer than their livestheir reputation the real soldier who is generally a man of more intellect cares more about the feelings than the bodies of his men he wants to command their affections as well as their limbs and he inspires them with a feeling of enthusiasm that renders them insensible to all dangersuch men were lord lake and generals ochterlony malcolm and adams and such are many others well known in india under the martinet the soldiers will never do more than what a due regard for their own reputation demands from them before the enemy and will sometimes do less under the real soldier they will always do more than this his reputation is dearer to them even than their own and they will do more to sustain it the army of the consul appius claudius exposed themselves to almost inevitable destruction before the enemy to disgrace him in the eyes of his country and the few survivors were decimated on their return he cared nothing for the spirit of his men the army of his colleague quintius on the contrary though from the same people and levied and led out at the same time covered him with glory because they loved him we had an instance of this in the war with nepāl in in which a kings regiment played the part of the army of appius there were other martinets kings and companys commanding divisions in that war and they all signally failed not however except in the above one instance from backwardness on the part of their troops but from utter incapacity when the hour of trial came those who succeeded were men always noted for caring something more about the hearts than the whiskers and buttons of their men that the officer who delights in harassing his regiment in times of peace will fail with it in times of war and scenes of peril seems to me to be a rule almost as well established as that he who in the junior ranks of the army delights most to kick against authority is always found the most disposed to abuse it when he gets to the higher in long intervals of peace the only prominent military characters are commonly such martinets and hence the failures so generally experienced in the beginning of a war after such an interval whitelocks are chosen for command till wolfes and wellingtons find chathams and wellesleys to climb up by to govern those whose mental and physical energies we require for our subsistence and support by the lash alone is so easy so simple a mode of bending them to our will and making them act strictly and instantly in conformity to it that it is not at all surprising to find so many of those who have been accustomed to it and are not themselves liable to have the lash inflicted upon them advocating its free use in china the emperor has his generals flogged and finds the lash so efficacious in bending them to his will that nothing would persuade him that it could ever be safely dispensed with in some parts of germany they had the officers flogged and princes and generals found this so very efficacious in making those act in conformity to their will that they found it difficult to believe that any army could be well managed without it in other christian armies the officers are exempted from the lash but they use it freely upon all under them and it would be exceedingly difficult to convince the greater part of these officers that the free use of the lash is not indispensablynecessary nay that the men do not themselves like to be flogged as eels like to be skinned when they once get used to it ask the slaveholders of the southern states of america whether any society can be well constituted unless the greater part of those upon the sweat of whose brow the community depends for their subsistence are made by law liable to be bought sold and driven to their daily labour with the lash they will one and all say no and yet there are doubtless many very excellent and amiable persons among these slaveholders if our army as at present constituted cannot do without the free use of the lash let its constitution be altered for no nation with free institutions should suffer its soldiers to be flogged laudabiliores tamen duces sunt quorum exercitum ad modestiam labor et usus instituit quam illi quorum milites ad obedientiam suppliciorum formido compellit though i reprobate that wanton severity of discipline in which the substance is sacrificed to the form in which unavoidable and trivial offences are punished as deliberate and serious crimes and the spirit of the soldier is entirely disregarded while the motion of his limbs cut of his whiskers and the buttons of his coat are scanned with microscopic eye i must not be thought to advocate idleness if we find the sepoys of a native regiment as we sometimes do at a healthy and cheap station become a little unruly like schoolboys and ask an old native officer the reason he will probably answer others as he has me by another question ghora ārā kyūn pānī sarā kyūn why does the horse become vicious why does the water become putridfor want of exercise without proper attention to this exercise no regiment is ever kept in order nor has any commanding officer ever the respect or the affection of his men unless they see that he understands well all the duties which his government entrusts to him and is resolved to have them performed in all situations and under all circumstances there are always some bad characters in a regiment to take advantage of any laxity of discipline and lead astray the younger soldiers whose spirits have been rendered exuberant by good health and good feeding and there is hardly any crime to which they will not try to excite these young men under an officer careless about the discipline of his regiment or disinclined from a mistaken esprit de corps or any other cause to have those crimes traced home to them and punished there can be no question that a good tone of feeling between the european officers and their men is essential to the wellbeing of our native army and i think i have found this tone somewhat impaired whenever our native regiments are concentrated at large stations in such places the european society is commonly large and gay and the officers of our native regiments become too much occupied in its pleasures and ceremonies to attend to their native officers or sepoys in europe there are separate classes of people who subsist by catering for the amusements of the higher classes of society in theatres operas concerts balls c c but in india this duty devolves entirely upon the young civil and military officers of the government and at large stations it really is a very laborious one which often takes up the whole of a young mans time the ladies must have amusement and the officers must find it for them because there are no other persons to undertake the arduous duty the consequence is that they often become entirely alienated from their men and betray signs of the greatest impatience while they listen to the necessary reports of their native officers as they come on or go off duty it is different when regiments are concentrated for active service nothing tends so much to improve the tone of feeling between the european officers and their men and between european soldiers and sepoys as the concentration of forces on actual service where the same hopes animate and the same dangers unite them in common bonds of sympathy and confidence utrique alteris freti finitimos armis aut metu sub imperium cogere nomen gloriamque sibi addidere after the campaigns under lord lake a native regiment passing dinapore where the gallant kings th with whom they had fought side by side was cantoned invited the soldiers to a grand entertainment provided for them by the sepoys they consented to go on one conditionthat the sepoys should see them all back safe before morning confiding in their sable friends they all got gloriously drunk but found themselves lying every man upon his proper cot in his own barracks in the morning the sepoys had carried them all home upon their shoulders another native regiment passing within a few miles of a hill on which they had buried one of their european officers after that war solicited permission to go and make their salām to the tomb and all went who were off duty the system which now keeps the greater part of our native infantry at small stations of single regiments in times of peace tends to preserve this good tone of feeling between officers and men at the same time that it promotes the general welfare of the country by giving confidence everywhere to the peaceful and industrious classes i will not close this chapter without mentioning one thing which i have no doubt every companys officer in india will concur with me in thinking desirable to improve the good feeling of the native soldierythat is an increase in the pay of the jemadārs they are commissioned officers and seldom attain the rank in less than from twentyfive to thirty years and they have to provide themselves with clothes of the same costly description as those of the sūbadār to be as well mounted and in all respects to keep the same respectability of appearance while their pay is only twentyfour rupees and a half a month that is ten rupees a month only more than they had been receiving in the grade of havildārs which is not sufficient to meet the additional expenses to which they become liable as commissioned officers their means of remittance to their families are rather diminished than increased by promotion and but few of them can hope ever to reach the next grade of sūbadār our government which has of late been so liberal to its native civil officers will i hope soon take into consideration the claims of this class who are universally admitted to be the worst paid class of native public officers in india ten rupees a month addition to their pay would be of great importance it would enable them to impart some of the advantages of promotion to their families and improve the good feeling of the circles aroundthem towards the government they serve notes this chapter and the following one were printed as a separate tract at calcutta in see bibliography that small volume included an introduction and two statistical tables which the author did not reprint he has utilized extracts from the introduction in various parts of the rambles and recollections i am not sure that the tract was ever published though it was printed for the author says in his introduction they scil these two essays may never be published but i cannot deny myself the gratification of printing them this order is confined to the indian army the punishment of working on the roads is long obsolete the author spells this word sipahee i have thought it better to use throughout the now familiar corruption the ordinary infantry pay was raised from seven to nine rupees in general orders by the commanderinchief of the th of january declare that no sepoy or trooper of our native army shall be dismissed from the service by the sentence of any but a general court martial general orders by the commanderinchief lord combermere of the th of march declare that his excellency is of opinion that the quiet and orderly habits of the native soldiers are such that it can very seldom be necessary to have recourse to the punishment of flogging which might be almost entirely abolished with great advantage to their character and feelings and directs that no native soldier shall in future be sentenced to corporal punishment unless for the crime of stealing marauding or gross insubordination where the individuals are deemed unworthy to continue in the ranks of the army no such sentence by a regimental detachment or brigade court martial was to be carried into effect till confirmed by the general officer commanding the division when flogged the soldier was invariably to be discharged from the service a circular letter from the commanderinchief lord combermere on the th of june directs that sentence to corporal punishment is not to be restricted to the three crimes of theft marauding or gross insubordination but that it is not to be awarded except for very serious offences against discipline or actions of a disgraceful or infamous nature which show those who committed them to be unfit for the service that the officer who assembles the court may remit the sentence of corporal punishment and the dismissal involved in it but cannot carry it into effect till confirmed by the officer commanding the division except when an immediate example is indispensably necessary as in the case of plundering and violence on the part of soldiers in the line of march in all cases the soldier who has been flogged must be dismissed a circular letter by the commanderinchief sir e barnes nd of november dispenses with the duty of submitting the sentence of regimental detachment and brigade courts martial for confirmation to the general officer commanding the division and authorizes the officer who assembles the court to carry the sentence into effect without reference to higher authority and to mitigate the punishment awarded or remit it altogether and to order the dismissal of the soldier who has been sentenced to corporal punishment though he should remit the flogging for it may happen that a soldier may be found guilty of an offence which renders it improper that he should remain any longer in the service although the general conduct of the man has been such that an example is unnecessary or he may have relations in the regiment of excellent character upon whom some part of the disgrace would fall if he were flogged still no court martial but a general one could sentence a soldier to be simply dismissed to secure his dismissal they must first sentence him to be flogged on the th of february the governorgeneral of india in council lord william bentinck directed that the practice of punishing soldiers of the native army by the catoninetails or rattan be discontinued at all the presidencies and that henceforth it shall be competent to any regimental detachment or brigade court martial to sentence a soldier of the native army to dismissal from the service for any offence for which such soldier might now be punished by flogging provided such sentence of dismissal shall not be carried into effect unless confirmed by the general or other officer commanding the division for crimes involving higher penalties soldiers were as heretofore committed for trial before general courts martial by act of passed by the legislative council of india on the rd of september it is made competent for courts martial to sentence soldiers of the native army in the service of the east india company to the punishment of dismissal and to be imprisoned with or without hard labour for any period not exceeding two years if the sentence be pronounced by a general court martial and not exceeding one year if by a garrison or line court martial and not exceeding six months if by a regimental or district court martial imprisonment for any period with hard labour or for a term exceeding six months without hard labour to involve dismissal act of provides for such sentences of imprisonment being carried into execution by magistrates or other officers in charge of the gaols w h sthis last paragraph has been brought up from the end of the volume where it is printed in the original edition the army has been completely reorganized since the authors time and the regulations have been much modified in october lord william bentinck had assumed the command of the army on the retirement of sir edward barnes and thus combined the offices of governorgeneral and commanderinchief as the marquis cornwallis and the marquis of hastings had done before him batavia was occupied by sir samuel auchmuty in august and the whole island was taken possession of in september but at the general peace which followed the great war the island of java with its dependencies was restored to the dutch the isle of france otherwise called the mauritius which is still british territory was gallantly taken at the end of november by commodore rowley and majorgeneral abercrombie full details of the java and mauritius expeditions are given in thorntons twentysecond chapter the brilliant operations in both localities deserve more attention than they usually receive from students of indian history the funeral obsequies which are everywhere offered up to the manes of parents by the surviving head of the family during the last fifteen days of the month kuār september were never considered as acceptable from the hands of a soldier in our service who had been tied up and flogged whatever might have been the nature of the offence for which he was punished any head of a family so flogged lost by that punishment the most important of his civil rightsthat indeed upon which all others hinged for it is by presiding at the funeral ceremonies that the head of the family secures and maintains his recognition w h s i have invariably found that natives of india enjoying a good social position who happen to be interested in an offender care nothing for the disgraceful nature of the offenders crime while they dread the disgrace of the punishment however just it may be the worst feature of this abolition measure is unquestionably the odious distinction which it leaves in the punishments to which our european and our native soldiers are liable since the british legislation does not consider that it can be safely abolished in the british army this odious distinction might be easily removed by an enactment declaring that european soldiers in india should be liable to corporal punishment for only two offences first mutiny or gross insubordination second plunder or violence while the regiment or force to which the prisoner belongs is in the field or marching the same enactment might declare the soldiers of our native army liable to the same punishments for the same offences such an enactment would excite no discontent among our native soldiery on the contrary it would be applauded as just and proper w h s subsequently corporal punishment in the indian or native army was again legalized the present law is thus stated by sir edwin collen a summary court martial may pass any sentence allowed by the articles of war except and may carry it out at once corporal punishment not exceeding fifty lashes may be given for certain offences but is rarely awarded and the amount of military crime is on the whole very small in the native army the native officers have power to inflict minor punishments ig vol iv p flogging in the british army in time of peace was prohibited in april by an amendment to the mutiny bill and was completely abolished by the army discipline act of the author also gives the hindustani word as kaelkurhin which seems to be intended for qāil kareñ or in rustic form karahiñ meaning confute no wonder that the native army pampered in this sentimental fashion gradually became more and more inefficient till it needed the fires of the mutiny to purge away its humours no army could be efficient when its subordinate officers on the active list were men of sixty or seventy years of age the sepoys were quite right no other service in the world was managed on such principles the illusion of the old companys officers about the gratitude and affection of the men generally was rudely dispelled nineteen years after the conversations recorded in the text but even in a noble minority remained faithful and did devoted service the best troops now are the sikhs gōrkhās and frontier muhammadans oudh men still enlist in large numbers but do not enjoy their old prestige the army known to the author comprised no sikhs gōrkhās or frontier muhammadans the recruitment of gōrkhās only began in and the other two classes of troops were obtained by the annexation of the panjāb in enlistment in the native army is absolutely voluntary and does not even require to be stimulated by a bounty a subsequent passage shows that the author refuses to describe the british army as an entirety voluntary one because a soldier when once enlisted is bound to serve for a definite term whereas the sepoy could resign when he chose desertions are frequent among the regiments recruited on the afghan frontier these regiments did not exist in the authors day an ordinance issued in france so late as required that a man should produce proof of four quarterings of nobility before he could get a commission in the

a day and a french soldier only six at the very time that the mortality of an army of forty thousand men sent to the colonies was annually or about one in three in our native army the sepoy gets about double the wages of an ordinary daylabourer and his duties when well done involve just enough of exercise to keep him in health the casualties are perhaps about one in a hundred w h s just precisely what the french soldiers were after the revolution had purged france of all the perilous stuff that weighed upon the heart of its people gibbon in considering the chance of the civilized nations of europe ever being again overrun by the barbarians from the north as in the time of the romans says if a savage conqueror should issue from the deserts of tartary he must repeatedly vanquish the robust peasantry of russia the numerous armies of germany the gallant nobles of france and the intrepid free men of britain never was a more just yet more unintended satire upon the state of a country russia was to depend upon her robust peasantry germany upon her numerous armies england upon her intrepid free men and poor france upon her gallant nobles alone because unhappily no other part of her vast population was then ever thought of when the hour of trial came those pampered nobles who had no feeling in common with the people were shaken off like dewdrops from the lions mane and the hitherto spurned peasantry of france under the guidance and auspices of men who understood and appreciated them astonished the world with their powers w h s the allusion is to the now halfforgotten war with the united states in the years during the course of which the english captured the city of washington and the americans gained some unexpected naval victories the author has already denounced the practice of impressment ante chapter note to in the original edition see mcculloch pol econ p st ed edinburgh w h s many german princes adopted the discipline of frederick in their little petty states without exactly knowing why or wherefore the prince of darmstadt conceived a great passion for the military art and when the weather would not permit him to worry his little army of five thousand men in the open air he had them worried for his amusement under sheds but he was soon obliged to build a wall round the town in which he drilled his soldiers for the sole purpose of preventing their running awayround this wall he had a regular chain of sentries to fire at the deserters mr moore thought that the discontent in this little band was greater than in the prussian army inasmuch as the soldiers saw no object but the princes amusement a fight or the prospect of a fight would have been a feast to them w h s it is hardly necessary to observe that the modern system of drill is widely

completed in these concluding supplementary chapters on the bengal army seem to have been written a little later perhaps in the year in which they were first printed the publication of the complete work took place in the mutiny broke out in and proved that the fidelity of the sepoys could not be so easily assured as the author supposed i believe the native army to be better now than it ever wasbetter in its disposition and in its organization the men have now a better feeling of assurance than they formerly had that all their rights will be secured to them by their european officers that all those officers are men of honour though they have not all of them the same fellow feeling thattheir officers had with them in former days this is because they have not the same opportunity of seeing their courage and fidelity tried in the same scenes of common danger go to afghanistan and china and you will find the feeling between officers and men as fine as ever it was in days of yore whatever it may be at our large and gay stations where they see so little of each other w h s the authors reputation for sagacity and discernment could not be made to rest upon the above remarks his judgement was led astray by his lifelong association with and affection for the native troops lord william bentinck took a far juster view of the situation and understood far better the real nature of the ties which bind the native army to its masters his admirable minute dated th march published for the first time in mr d boulgers wellwritten little book lord william bentinck rulers of india pp is still worthy of study as a corrective to the authors too effusive sentiment some brief passages from the governorgenerals minute may be quoted in considering the question of internal danger he observes those officers most conversant with indian affairs who were examined before the parliamentary committee apprehend no danger to our dominion as long as we are assured of the fidelity of our native troops to this opinion i entirely subscribe but others again view in the native army itself the source of our greatest peril in all ages the military body has been often the prime cause but generally the instrument of all revolutions and proverbial almost as is the fidelity of the native soldier to the chief whom he serves more especially when he is justly and kindly treated still we cannot be blind to the fact that many of those ties which bind other armies to their allegiance are totally wanting in this here is no patriotism no community of feeling as to religion or birthplace no influencing attachment from high considerations or great honours and rewards our native army also is extremely ignorant capable of the strongest religions excitement and very sensitive to disrespect to their persona or infringement of their customs in the native army alone rests our internal danger and this danger may involve our complete subversion all these facts and opinions seem to me to establish incontrovertibly that a large proportion of european troops is necessary for our security under all circumstances of peace and war i believe the sepoys have never been so good as they were in the earliest part of our career none superior to those under de boigne i fearlessly pronounce the indian army to be the least efficient and most expensive in the world the events of proved the truth of lord william bentincks wise words the native army is no longer inefficient as a whole though certain sections of it may still be so but the less that is said about the supposed affection of mercenary troops for a foreign government the better of course all the military forces british and indian are now alike the kings each service has its own rules and regulations general baird had started from bombay in the end of december but only arrived at kossir on the coast of upper egypt on the th of june in nine days with a force of british and native troops he traversed miles of desert

generals rome ever had were rendered almost useless by his disregard to the feelings of his soldiers he could not perceive that the civil wars under marius and sylla had rendered a different treatment

limited to the two offences i have already mentioned w h s namely l mutiny or gross insubordination plunder or violence in the field or on the march ante chapter note polybius says that as the human body is apt to get out of order under good feeding and little exercise so are states and armies bk ii chap wherever food is cheap and the air good native regiments should be well exercised without being worried i must here take the liberty to give an extract from a letter from one of the best and most estimable officers now in the bengal army as connected with the discipline of the native army i may here remark that i have for some years past observed on the part of many otherwise excellent commanding officers a great want of attention to the instruction of the young european officers on first joining their regiments i have had ample opportunities of seeing the great value of a regular course of instruction drill for at least six months when i joined my first regiment which was about forty years ago i had the good fortune to be under a commandant and adjutant who happily for me and many others attached great importance to this very necessary course of instruction i then acquired a thorough knowledge of my duties which led to my being appointed an adjutant very early in life when i attained the rank of lieutenantcolonel i had however opportunities of observing how very much this essential duty had been neglected in certain regiments and made it a rule in all that i commanded to keep all young officers on first joining at the instruction drill till thoroughly grounded in their duties since i ceased to command a regiment i have taken advantage of every opportunity to express to those commanding officers with whom i have been in correspondence my conviction of the great advantages of this system to the rising generation in going from one regiment to another i found many curious instances of ignorance on the part of young officers who had been many years with their corps it was by no means an easy task to convince them that they really knew nothing or at least had a great deal to learn but when they were made sensible of it they many of them turned out excellent officers and now i believe bless the day they were first put under me the advantages of the system here mentioned cannot be questioned and it is much to be regretted that it is not strictly enforced in every regiment in the service young officers may find it irksome at first but they soon become sensible of the advantages and learn to applaud the commandant who has had the firmness to consult their permanent interests more than their present inclinations w h s among the many changes produced in india by the development of the railway system and by other causes one of the most striking is the abolition of small military stations almost all these have disappeared and the troops are now massed in large cantonments where they can be handled much more effectively than in outstations the discipline of small detached bodies of troops is generally liable to deterioration many instances of semireligious honour paid by natives to the tombs of europeans have been noticed there are i believe many jemadārs who still wear medals on their breasts for their service in the taking of java and the isle of france more than thirty years ago indeed i suspect that some will be found who accompanied sir david baird to egypt w h s such old men must have been perfectly useless as officers sir david baird s operations took place in the rate of pay of jemadārs in the bengal native infantry now is either forty or fifty rupees monthly half of the officers of this rank in each regiment receive the higher rate the grievance complained of by the author has therefore been remedied the pay of a havīldār is still or was recently fourteen rupees a month chapter invalid establishment i have said nothing in the foregoing chapter of the invalid establishment which is probably the greatest of all bonds between the government and its native army and consequently the greatest element in the spirit of discipline bonaparte who was perhaps with all his faults the greatest man that ever floated on the tide of time said at elba there is not even a village that has not brought forth a general a colonel a captain or a prefect who has raised himself by his especial merit and illustrated at once his family and his country now we know that the families and the village communities in which our invalid pensioners reside never read newspapers and feel but little interest in the victories in which these pensioners may have shared they feel that they have no share in the éclat or glory which attend them but they everywhere admire and respect the government which cherishes its faithful old servants and enables them to spend the winter of their days in the bosoms of their families and they spurn the man who has failed in his duty towards that government in the hour of need no sepoy taken from the rājpūt communities of oudh or any other part of the country can hope to conceal from his family circle or village community any act of cowardice or anything else which is considered disgraceful to a soldier or to escape the odium which it merits in that circle and community in the year i was encamped near a village in marching through oudh when the landlord a very cheerful old man came up to me with his youngest son a lad of eighteen years of age and requested me to allow him the son to show me the best shooting grounds in the neighbourhood i took my joe manton and went out the youth showed me some very good ground and i found him an agreeable companion and an excellent shot with his matchlock on our return we found the old man waiting for us he told me that he had four sons all by gods blessing tall enough for the companys service in which one had attained the rank of havīldār sergeant and two were still sepoys their wives and children lived with him and they sent home every month twothirds of their pay which enabled him to pay all the rent of the estate and appropriate the whole of the annual returns to the subsistence and comfort of the numerous family he was he said now growing old and wished his eldest son the sergeant to resign the service and come home to take upon him the management of the estate that as soon as he could be prevailed upon to do so his old wife would permit my sporting companion her youngest son to enlist but not before i was on my way to visit fyzabad the old metropolis of oudh and on returning a month afterwards in the latter end of january i found that the wheat which was all then in ear had been destroyed by a severe frost the old man wept bitterly and he and his old wife yielded to the wishes of their youngest son to accompany me and enlist in my regiment which was then stationed at partābgarh we set out but were overtaken at the third stage by the poor old man who told me that his wife had not eaten or slept since the boy left her and that he must go back and wait for the return of his eldest brother or she certainly would not live the lad obeyed the call of his parents and i never saw or heard of the family again there is hardly a village in the kingdom of oudh without families like this depending upon the good conduct and liberal pay of sepoys in our infantry regiments and revering the name of the government they serve or have served similar villages are to be found scattered over the provinces of bihār and benares the districts between the ganges and jumna and other parts where rājpūts and the other classes from which we draw our recruits have been long established as proprietors and cultivators of the soil these are the feelings on which the spirit of discipline in our native army chiefly depends and which we shall i hope continue to cultivate as we have always hitherto done with care and a commander must take a great deal of pains to make his men miserable before he can render them like the soldiers of frederick the irreconcilable enemies of their officers and their government in the year i was encamped in a grove on the right bank of the ganges below monghyr when the marquis of hastings was proceeding up the river in his fleet to put himself at the head of the grand division of the army then about to take the field against the pindhārīs and their patrons the marāthā chiefs here i found an old native pensioner above a hundred years of age he had fought under lord clive at the battle of plassey ad and was still a very cheerful talkative old gentleman though he had long lost the use of his eyes one of his sons a greyheaded old man and a sūbadār captain in a regiment of native infantry had been at the taking of java and was now come home on leave to

lord lake few things in india have interested me more than scenes like these i have no means of ascertaining the number of military pensioners in england or in any other european nation and cannot therefore state the proportion which they bear to the actual number of forces kept up the military pensioners in our bengal establishment on the st of may were and the family pensioners or heirs of soldiers killed in action total out of an army of men i question whether the number of retired soldiers maintained at the expense of government bears so large a proportion to the number actually serving in any other nation on earth not one of the twentyfour thousand has been brought on or retained upon the list from political interest or court favour every one receives his pension for long and faithful services after he has been pronounced by a board of european surgeons as no longer fit for the active duties of his profession or gets it for the death of a father husband or son who has been killed in the service of government all are allowed to live with their families and european officers are stationed at central points in the different parts of the country where they are most

other points within their respective circles of payment where the pensioners can most conveniently attend to receive their money on certain days so that none of them have to go far or to employ any expensive means to get itit is in fact brought home as near as possible to their doors by a considerate and liberal government every soldier is entitled to a pension when pronounced by a board of surgeons as no longer fit for the active duties of his profession after fifteen years active service but to be entitled to the pension of his rank in the army he must have served in such rank for three years till he has done so he is entitled only to the pension of that immediately below it a sepoy gets four rupees a month that is about onefourth more than the ordinary wages of common

each regiment receive the higher rate of pay the circumstances which in the estimation of the people distinguish the british from all other rulers in india and make it grow more and more upon their affections are these the security which public servants enjoy in the tenure of their office the prospect they have of advancement by the gradation of rank the regularity and liberal scale of their pay and the provision for old age when they have discharged the duties entrusted to them ably and faithfullyl in a native state almost every public officer knows that he has no chance of retaining his office beyond the reign of the present minister or favourite and that no present minister or favourite can calculate upon retaining his ascendancy over the mind of his chief for more than a few months or years under us they see secretaries to government members of council and governorsgeneral themselves going out and coming into office without causing any change in the position of their subordinates or even the apprehension of any change as long as they discharge their duties ably and faithfully in a native state the new minister or favourite brings with him a whole host of expectants who must be provided for as soon as he takes the helm and if all the favourites of his predecessor do not voluntarily vacate their offices for them he either turns them out without ceremony or his favourites very soon concoct charges against them which causes them to be tumed out in due form and perhaps put into jail till they have paid the uttermost farthing under us the governorsgeneral members of council the secretaries of state the members of the judicial and revenue boards all come into office and take their seats unattended by a single expectant no native officer of the revenue or judicial department who is conscious of having done his duty ably and honestly feels the slightest uneasiness at the change the consequence is a degree of integrity in public officers never before known in india and rarely to be found in any other country in the province where i now write which consists of six districts there are twentytwo native judicial officers munsifs sadr amīns and principal sadr amīns and in the whole province i have never heard a suspicion breathed against one of them nor do i believe that the integrity of one of them is at this time suspected the only one suspected within the two and a half years that i have been in the province was i grieve to say a christian and he has been removed from office to the great satisfaction of the people and is never to be employed again the only department in which our native public servants do not enjoy the same advantages of security in the tenure of their office prospect of rise in the gradation of rank liberal scale of pay and provision for old age is the police and it is admitted on all hands that there they are everywhere exceedingly corrupt not one of them indeed ever thinks it possible that he can be supposed honest and those who really are so are looked upon as a kind of martyrs or penitents who are determined by long suffering to atone for past crimes and who if they could not get into the police would probably go long pilgrimages on all fours or with unboiled peas in their shoes he who can suppose that men so inadequately paid who have no promotion to look forward to and feel no security in their tenure of office and consequently no hope of a provision for old age will be zealous and honest in the discharge of their duties must be very imperfectly acquainted with human naturewith the motives by which men are influenced all over the world indeed no man does in reality suppose so on the contrary every man knows that the same motives actuate public servants in india as elsewhere we have acted successfully upon this knowledge in all other branches of the public service and shall i trust at no distant period act upon the same in that of the police and then and not till then can it prove to the people what we must all wish it to be a blessing the european magistrate of a district has perhaps a million of people to look after the native officers next under him are the thānadārs of the different subdivisions of the district containing each many towns and villages with a population of perhaps one hundred thousand people these officers have no grade to look forward to and get a salary of twentyfive rupees a month each they cannot possibly do their duties unless they keep each a couple of horses or ponies with servants to attend to them indeed they are told so by every magistrate who cares about the peace of his district the people seeing howmuch we expect from the thānadār and how little we give him submit to his demands for contribution without a murmur and consider almost any demand venial from a man so employed and paid they are confounded at our inconsistency and say where they dare to speak their minds we see you giving high salaries and high prospects of advancement to men who have nothing on earth to do but to collect your revenues and to decide our disputes about pounds shillings and pence which we used to decide much better among ourselves when we had no other court but that of our elders to appeal to while those who are to protect life and property to keep peace over the land and enable the industrious to work in security maintain their families and pay the government revenue are left without any prospect of rising and almost without any pay at all there is really nothing in our rule in india which strikes the people so much as this glaring inconsistency the evil effects of which are so great and so manifest the only way to remedy the evil is to give the police what the other branches of the public service already enjoya feeling of security in the tenure of office a higher rate of salary and above all a gradation of rank which shall afford a prospect of rising to those who discharge their duties ably and honestly for this purpose all that is required is the interposition of an officer between the thānadār and the magistrate in the same way as the sadr amīn is now interposed between the munsif and the judge on an average there are perhaps twelve thānas or police subdivisions in each district and one such officer to every four thānas would be sufficient for all purposes the governorgeneral who shall confer this boon on the people of india will assuredly be hailed as one of their greatest benefactors i should i believe speak within bounds when i say that the thānadārs throughout the country give at present more than all the money which they receive in avowed salaries from government as a share of indirect perquisites to the native officers of the magistrates court who have to send their reports to them and communicate their orders and prepare the cases of the prisoners they may send in for commitment to the sessions courts the intermediate officers here proposed would obviate all this they would be to the magistrate at once the tapis of prince husain and the telescope of prince alimedia that would enable them to be everywhere and see everything i may here seem to be travelling beyond the record but it is not so in treating on the spirit of military discipline in our native army i advocate as much as in me lies the great general principle upon which rests i think not only our power in india but what is more the justification of that power it is our wish as it is our interest to give to the hindoos and muhammadans a liberal share in all the duties of administration in all offices civil and military and to show the people in general the incalculable advantages of a strong and settled government which can secure life property and character and the free enjoyment of all their blessings throughout the land and give to those who perform duties as public servants ably and honestly a sure prospect of rising by gradation a feeling of security in their tenure of office a liberal salary while they serve and a respectable provision for old age it is by a steady adherence to these principles that the indian civil service has been raised to its present high character for integrity and ability and the native army made what it really is faithful and devoted to its rulers and ready to serve them in any quarter of the world i deprecate any innovation upon these principles in the branches of the public service to which they have already been applied with such eminent success and i advocate their extension to all other branches as the surest means of making them what they ought and what we must all most fervently wish them to be the native officers of our judicial and revenue establishments or of our native army are everywhere a bond of union between the governing and the governed discharging everywhere honestly and ably their duties to their employers they tend everywhere to secure to them the respect and affection of the people his highness muhammad saīd khān the reigning nawāb of rāmpur still talks with pride of the days when he was one of our deputy collectors in the adjoining district of badāon and of the useful knowledge he acquired in that office he has still one brother a sadr amīn in the district of mainpurī and another a deputy collector in the hamīrpur district and neither would resign his situation under the honourable company to take office in rāmpur at three times the rate of salary when invited to do so on the accession of the eldest brother to the masnad what they now enjoy they owe to their own industry and integrity and they are proud to serve a government which supplies them with so many motives for honest exertion and leaves them nothing to fear as long as they exert themselves honestly to be in a situation which it is generally understood that none but honest and able men can fill is of itself a source of pride and the sons of native princes and men of rank both hindoo and muhammadan everywhere prefer taking office in our judicial and revenue establishments to serving under native rulers where everything depends entirely upon the favour or frown of men in power and ability industry and integrity can secure nothing notes this can no longer be safely assumed as true newspapers now penetrate to almost every village fyzābād faizābād was the capital for a short time of the nawāb wazīrs of oudh in āsafuddaula moved his court to lucknow the city of ajodhya adjoining fyzābād is of immense antiquity in the south of oudh it is not now a military station monghyr mungēr is the chief town of the district of the same name which lies to the east of patna august such a spectacle is no longer to be seen in india four or five inconspicuous railway carriages or motorcars now take the place of the magnificent fleet the percentage is all these arrangements have been changed military pensioners are now paid through the civil authorities of each district wages are now generally higher this sentence might misled readers unacquainted with the details of indian administration every official who satisfies the formal rules of the accounts department gets his pension as a matter of course in accordance with those rules whether his service has been able and faithful or not the pension list is often the last refuge of incompetent and dishonest officials to which they are gladly consigned by codebound superiors who cannot otherwise get rid of them nor am i certain that british rule grows more and more upon the affections of those subject to it the author means secretaries to the government of india or provincial governments the sāgar and nerbudda narbadā territories now included in the central provinces the designations sadr amīn and principal sadr amīn have been superseded by the title of subordinate judge the officers referred to have only civil jurisdiction which does not include revenue and rent causes in the united provinces most experienced officers will i think agree with me that the author was exceptionally fortunate in his experience so far as i can make out the standard of integrity among the higher indian officials has risen considerably during the last century but is still a long way from the perfection indicated by the authors remarks these observations on the police are merely a repetition of the remarks in chapter which have been discussed in the notes to that chapter the districts in the united provinces of agra and oudh are usually much smaller than those in bengal or madras but even in northern india a district with only a million of inhabitants is considered to be rather a small one some districts have a population of more than three millions each all has been changed many comparatively well paid officials of indian birth now intervene between the district magistrate and the small people on twentyfive rupees a month sometimes the district magistrate himself is an indian the anthors note to this passage repeats the quotation from hobbess leviathan part ii sect which has been already cited in the text chapter following and need not be repeated here the note continues almost every thānadār in our dominions is a little tarquin in his way exciting the indignation of the people against his master when we give him the proper incentives to good we shall be able with better conscience to punish him severely for bad conduct the interposition of the officers i propose between him and the magistrate will give him the required incentive to good conduct at the same time that it will deprive him of all hope of concealing his evil ways should he continue in them w h s he still manages to continue in his evil ways and generally to conceal them this statement seems almost like sarcasm to a reader who knows what manner of men wellpaid inspectors of police commonly are and how they are regarded by the nonofficial population they are not usually reverenced as protectors of the poor the reader who is not practically acquainted with the work of administration in india will probably think that the magistrate who allows such intrigues to go on must be very careless and inefficient but that thought though very natural would be unjust the author was one of the best possible district magistrates and yet was unable to suppress the evils which he describes nor have the remedies which he advocated and which have been adopted proved effectual the thānadār now has generally to pay the inspector and the people in the district superintendents office in addition to the native officers of the magistrates court we have already seen how mistaken the author was concerning the army this statement requires to be guarded by many qualifications the authors following remarks only illustrate the wellknown fact that in india official rank is ardently desired by the classes eligible for it and carries with it great social advantages rāmpur is the small rohilla state within the borders of the bareilly district united provinces this description of the class of officials alluded to is somewhat idealized though it applies to a considerable proportion of the class these propositions were doubtless literally correct in the authors time but they are not at all fully applicable to the existing state of affairsappendix thuggee and the part taken in its suppression by general sir w h sleeman kcb note by captain j l sleeman royal sussex regiment the religion of murder known as thuggee was established in india some centuries before the british government first became aware of its existence it is remarkable that after an intercourse with india of nearly two centuries and the exercise of sovereignty over a large part of the country for no inconsiderable period the english should have been so ignorant of the existence and habits of a body so dangerous to the public peace the name thug signifies a deceiver and it will be generally admitted that this term was well earned there is reason to believe that between and the practice of thuggee thagī reached its height and that thousands of persons were annually destroyed by its disciples it is interesting to note the legendary origin of this strange and horrible religion in remote ages a demon infested the earth and devoured mankind as soon as created the world was thus left unpeopled until the goddess of the thugs dēvī or kālī came to the rescue she attacked the demon and cut him down but from every drop of his blood another demon arose and though the goddess continued to cut down these rising demons fresh broods of demons sprang from their blood as from that of their progenitors and the diabolical race consequently multiplied with fearful rapidity at length fatigued and disheartened the goddess found it necessary to change her tactics accordingly relinquishing all personal efforts for their suppression she formed two men from perspiration brushed from her arms to each of these men she gave a handkerchief and with these the two assistants of the goddess were commanded to put all the demons to death without shedding a drop of blood her commands were immediately obeyed and the demons were all strangled having strangled all the demons the two men offered to return the handkerchiefs but the goddess desired that they should retain them not merely as memorials of their heroism but as the implements of a lucrative trade in which their descendants were to labour and thrive they were in fact commanded to strangle men as they had strangled demons several generations passed before thuggee became practised as a professionprobably for the same reason that a sportsman allows game to accumulatebut in due time it was abundantly exercised thus according to the creed of the thug did their order arise and thus originated their mode of operation the profession of a thug like almost everything in india became hereditary the fraternity however receiving occasional reinforcements from strangers but these were admitted with great caution and seldom after they had attained mature age the thugs were usually men seemingly occupied in most respectable and often in most responsible positions annually these outwardly respectable citizens and tradesmen would take the road and sacrifice a multitude of victims for the sake of their religion and pecuniary gain the thug bands would assemble at fixed places of rendezvous and before commencing their expeditions much strange ceremony had to be gone through a sacred pickaxe was the emblem of their faith its fashioning was wrought with quaint rites and its custody was a matter of great moment its point was supposed to indicate the line of route propitious to the disciples of the goddess and it was credited with other powers equally marvellous the brute creation afforded a vast fund of instruction upon every proceeding the ass jackal wolf deer hare dog cat owl kite crow partridge jay and lizard all served to furnish good or bad omens to a thug on the warpath for the first week of the expedition fasting and general discomfort were insisted on unless the first murder took place within that period women were never murdered unless their slaughter was unavoidable ie when they were thought to suspect the cause of the disappearance of their menfolk children of the murdered were often adopted by the thugs and the boys were initiated in due course in the horrid rites of thuggee men skilled in the practice of digging and concealing graves were always attached to each thug gang these were able to prepare graves in anticipation of a murder and to effectually conceal all trace of the crime after they were occupied to assist the gravediggers in this duty all roads used by thugs had selected places upon them at which murders were always carried out if possible the thugs would speak of such places with the same affection and enthusiasm as other men would of the most delightful scenes of their early life it was these people versed in deceit and surrounded by a thousand obstacles to conviction that general sir w h sleeman so nobly set out to exterminate within seven years of his first commencing the suppression of thuggee it had practically ceased to exist as a religion and he had the privilege of seeing it entirely suppressed as such before giving up this work for the residentship at lucknow he was described when taking over the latter appointment as follows he had served in india nearly forty years his work had been of the best he had done more than any one to suppress thuggee finally and had a knowledge of the indian character and language possessed by very few he was personally popular with all classes of indians and respected feared and trusted by allsupplementary notes by the editor captain j l sleeman who had intended to contribute an account in some detail of his grandfathers operations for the suppression of thuggee has been ordered on active service and consequently has been unable to write more than the short note printed above the editor thinks it desirable to supplement captain sleemans observations by certain additional remarks the earliest historical notice of thuggee appears to be the statement in the history of fīrōz shāh tughlak by a contemporary author that at some time or other in the reign of that sovereign about one thousand thugs were arrested in delhi on the denunciation of an informer the sultan with misplaced clemency refused to sanction the execution of any of the prisoners whom he shipped off to lakhnauti or gaur in bengal where they were let loose elliot and dowson hist of india iii that absurd proceeding may well have been the origin of the system of river thuggee in bengal which possibly may be still practised the next mention of thugs refers to the reign of akbar both meadows taylor and balfour affirm that many thugs were then executed and according to balfour they numbered five hundred and belonged to the etawah district i have not succeeded in finding any mention of the fact in the histories of akbarthe memory of the event may be preserved only by oral tradition etawah between the ganges and jumna in the province of agra has always been notorious for thuggee and cognate crime in the year towards the close of shahjahāns reign the traveller de thevenot noted that the road between delhi and agra was infested by thugs his words are the cunningest robbers in the world are in that countrey they use a certain slip with a runningnoose which they can cast with so much slight about a mans neck when they are within reach of him that they never fail so that they strangle him in a trice english transl part iii p after the capture of seringapatam in the attention of the companys government was drawn to the prevalence of thuggee in the bodies of thirty victims were found in wells between the ganges and jumna and in dr sherwood published a paper entitled on the murderers called phānsigars sc stranglers in the madras journal of literature and science which was reprinted in asiatic researches vol xiii various officers then made unsystematic efforts to suppress the stranglers but effectual operations were deferred until during the years and the existence of the thug organization became generally known and intense excitement was aroused throughout india the konkan or narrow strip of lowlands between the western ghāts and the sea was the only region in the empire not infested by the thugs see h h wilson in supplement to mill hist of british india ed vol ix p balfour cyclopaedia of india rd ed sv thug and crooke things indian murray sv thuggee the records summarized above prove that the thug organization existed continuously on a large scale from the early part of the fourteenth century until sir william sleemans time that is to say for more than five centuries in all probability its origin was much more ancient but records are lacking it is said that a sculpture representing a thug strangulation exists among the sculptures at ellora executed in the eighth century no such sculpture however is mentioned in the detailed account of the ellora caves by dr burgess the magnitude of the organization with which sleeman grappled is indicated by the following figures during the years thugs were disposed of one way or another of whom were hanged and were admitted as approvers amīr alī whose confessions are recorded in meadows taylors fascinating book the confessions of a thug written in and first published in proudly admitted having taken part in the murders of persons and regretted that an interruption of his career by
