dates from hell an omnibus of novels by kelley armstrong lori handeland kim harrison and lynsay sands undead in the garden of good and evil kim harrison phone cradled between her shoulder and ear ivy tamwood scooped another chunk of chili up with her fries leaning over the patterned wax paper so it wouldnt drip onto her desk kisten was bitching about something or other and she wasnt listening knowing he could go on for half her lunch break before winding down the guy was nice to wake up to in the afternoon and a delight to play with before the sun came up but he talked too much which is why i put up with him she mused running her tongue across the inside of her teeth before swallowing her world had gone too quickly from alive to silent on that flight back home from california my god was it seven years now it had been unusual to foster a highblood living vampire child into a sympathetic camarilla taking her from home and family for her last two years of high school but piscary the master vampire her family looked to had become too intense in his interest in her before she developed the mental tools to deal with it and her parents had intervened at some cost probably saving her sanity i could keep freud in havana cigars all by my lone some ivy thought taking another bite of carbs and protein twentythree ought to be far enough away from that scared sixteenyearold on the sundrenched tarmac to forget but even now after multiple blood and bed partners a sixyear degree in social sciences and landing an excellent job where she could use her degree she found her confidence was still tied to the very things that screwed her up she missed skimmer and her reminder that life was more than waiting for it to end so she could get started living and while kisten was nothing like her high school roommate he had filled the gap nicely these last few years smiling wickedly ivy gazed through the plateglass wall that looked out on the floor of open offices weight shifting she crossed her legs at her knees and leaned farther across her desk imagining just what gap shed like kisten to fill next damn vampire pheromones she breathed and pulled herself straight not liking where her thoughts took her when she spent too much time in the lower levels of the inderland security tower working the homicide division of the is got her a real office instead of a desk in the middle of the floor with the peons but there were too many vampsboth living and undeaddown here for the air circulation to handle kistens tirade about prank phone calls ended abruptly what do vamp pheromones have to do with humans attacking my pizza delivery crew he asked in a lousy british accent it was his newest preoccupation and one she hoped hed tire of soon rolling her chair closer to her desk ivy took a swig of her imported bottled water eyes askance on the bosss closed door across the large room nothing you want me to pick up anything on the way home i might be able to wing out of here early arts in the office which means someone died and i have to go to work bet you first bite hes going to want to cut my lunch shortshe took another sipand im going to take it off the end of my day no kisten said danny is doing the shopping today one of the perks of living atop a restaurant she thought as kisten started in on a shopping list she didnt care about pulling her plate of fries off her desk she set them on her lap being careful to not spill anything on her leather pants the bosss door opened catching her eye when art came out shaking hands with mrs pendleton hed been in there a full half hour there was a stapled pack of paper in his hands and ivys pulse quickened shed been sitting on her ass going over arts unsolved homicides for too long the man had no business being in homicide dead did not equal smart unless being smart was in manipulating us into giving the undead our blood ivy forced herself to keep eating thinking the undead targeted their living vampire kin more out of jealousy than maintaining good human relations as was claimed having been born with the vampire virus embedded into her genome ivy enjoyed a measure of the undeads strengths without the drawbacks of light fatality and pain from religious artifacts though not in line with arts abilities her hearing and strength were beyond a humans and her sense of smell was tuned to the softer flavors of sweat and pheromones the undeads need for blood had been muted from a biological necessity to a bloodlust that imparted a high like no other when satedaddictive when mixed with sex her gaze went unbidden to art and he smiled from across the wide floor as if knowing her thoughts his steady advance never shifting and the packet of paper in his hand moving like a banner of intent appetite gone she swiveled her chair to put her back to the room hey kist she said interrupting his comments about dannys recent poor choice of mushrooms change of plans by the amount of paperwork its one of arts cleanup runs i wont be home till sunup again again she mocked fiddling with a colored pen until she realized it telegraphed her mood and set it down with a sharp tap god kisten you make it sound like its every night kisten sighed leave the paperwork for tomorrow love i dont know why you bust your ass so hard youre not moving up until you let artie the smarty go down on you is that so she said feeling her face warm and the chili on her tongue go flat tossing her plate to her desk she forced herself to remain reclining with her booted feet spread wide when what she wanted to do was hit someone martial arts meditation had kept her out of civil court until now selfcontrol was how she defined herself you knew the system when you hired in he coaxed and ivy tugged the sleeves to her skintight black pullover from her elbows to her wrists to hide her faint scars she could feel art crossing the room and adrenaline tickled the pit of her stomach it was a run she told herself but she knew art was the reason for the stir in her not the chance to get out of the office why do you think i wanted to work with piscary instead of the is kisten was saying words she had heard too many times before give him what he wants i dont care he laughed hell it might be nice having you come home wanting to watch a movie instead of ready to drain me reaching to her desk she finished her water wiping the corner of her mouth with a careful pinky she had known the politicshell she had grown up in thembut that didnt mean she had to like the society she was forced to work within she had watched it end her mothers life watched it now eat her father away killing him little by little it was the only path open to her and she was good at it very good at it thats what bothered her the most she stiffened when art fixed his brown eyes to the back of her neck undead vamps had been looking at her since she had turned fourteen she knew the feeling i thought you stuck with piscary because of his dental plan she said sarcastically his dentals in your neck ha ha very funny kisten said his good humor doing nothing to ease her agitation i like what i do she said putting a hand up against the knock on her open door she didnt turn smelling the stimulating erotic scent of undead vampire in her doorway im damn good at it she added to remind art she was the reason they had pulled his murdersolved ratio up the last six months at least im not delivering pizzas for a living ivy thats not fair it was a low blow but art was watching her and that would unnerve anyone after six months of working with her he had picked up on all her idiosyncrasies learning by reading her pulse and breathing patterns exactly what would set her rush flowing he had been using the information to his advantage lately making her life hell it wasnt that he wasnt attractivegod they all werebut he had been working the same desk for over thirty years his lack of ambition didnt make her eager to jump his jugular and being coaxed into something by way of her instincts when her thoughts said no left a bad taste in her mouth even worse she had realized after the first time she had come home hungering for blood and finding piscary waiting for her that the master vampire had probably arranged the partnership knowing shed resistand art would insistthe end result being shed be hungry for a little decompression when she got home the sad thing was she wasnt sure if she was resisting art because she didnt like him or because she got off on the anticipation of not knowing if it would be piscary kisten or both that shed be calming herself with but her weakness was no reason to bark at kisten sorry she said into the hurt silence kistens voice was soft forgiving since he knew art was playing hard on her you gotta go love he asked in that lame accent who was he trying to be anyway yeah kisten was silent and she added see you tonight that curious tightening in her throat and the need to physically touch someone settling more firmly inside her it was the first stage of a fullblown bloodlust and whether it stemmed from kisten or art didnt matter art would be the one trying to capitalize on it bye kisten replied tightly and the phone clicked off he said it didnt bother him but he was alive as she was with the same emotions and jealousy they all had that he was so understanding of the choices she had to make made it even worse she often felt they were like children in a warped family where love had been perverted by sex and the easiest way to survive was to submit her invisible manacles had been created by her very cells and hardened by manipulation and she didnt know if she would remove them if she could ivy watched her pale fingers as she set the phone down not a tremor showed not a hint of her rising agitation that was how she kept them awayplacid quiet no emotiona skill learned while working summers at pizza piscarys she had learned it so well that only skimmer knew who she really wanted to be though she loved kisten enough to show him glimpses carefully removing all emotion from her face she swiveled her chair boot tips trailing along the faded carpet art was standing to take up half her doorway with a packet of stapled paper in his long fingers clearly they had a run by the amount of paperwork it couldnt be pressing probably cleanup from before she became his partner and started following behind him with her dust broom and pan im eating she said as if it wasnt obvious can it wait a friggin ten minutes the dead vampireat least fifty years her senior on paper her contemporary by appearancesinclined his head in a practiced motion to convey a sly sophistication mixed with a healthy dose of sex appeal soft black curls fell to frame his brown eyes holding her attention his small boyish features and his tight ass made him look like a member of a boy band he had the same amount of personality too unless he made an effort but god he smelled good his aroma mixing with hers to set in play a series of chemical reactions that whipped her blood and sexual libido high ill wait he said smiling oh joy hed wait arts practiced voice sent a trail of anticipation down her back to settle at the base of her spine damn it all to hell he was hungry or maybe he was bored hed wait hed been waiting six months learning the best way to manipulate her and she knew shed more than enjoy herself if she let him bloodlust in living vampires was tied to their sex drive an evolutionary adaptation helping ensure an undead vampire would have a willing blood supply to keep him or her sane being bidden for blood imparted a sexual high the older and more experienced the vampire the better the rush the ultimate of course being bloodbidden by a powerful undead undead art had been dead for four decades having passed the tricky thirtyyear ceiling where most undead vampires failed to keep themselves mentally intact and walked into the sun why art was still working was a mystery he must need the money since he certainly wasnt good at his job the vampire breathed deeply as he stood on her threshold pulling in her mood the way she inhaled a rare fragrance sensing her rising agitation art rocked into motion rounding her desk and easing himself down in her leather office chair in the corner her face blanked as her pulse quickened art was the only person to ever sit there most people respected her attempts to avoid office friendshipsif her sharp sarcasm and outright ignoring them werent enough but then art didnt like her for her personality but for the reputation he had yet to get a taste of eyes on her immaculate desk ivy exhaled he was dead and she was alive they were both vampires driven by blood she sexually he for survival a match made in heavenor hell art reclined smiling with his long legs crossed and an ankle on one knee managing to look powerful and relaxed at the same time he brushed his hair back trailing his fingers suggestively across his face kept at a cleanshaven tidiness as he tried to blend in with the younger crowd who would be more receptive to what he offered a shiver of anticipation rose through her it didnt make any difference that it came from art pumping the air full of pheromones rather than true interest the desire to satiate herself was as much a part of her as breathing inescapable why not get it over with the gossip was because she was resisting not because it was expected and that was why he sat there in his expensive slacks and shirt with his twohundreddollar shoes and that confident badboy smile the dead could afford to be patient tying off some of your loose ends she said dryly glancing at the packet of papers and leaning back she wanted to cross her arms over her chest but instead put her boot heels up on the corner of her desk confident she was in control of herself and her desires art could turn her into a pliant supplicant if he bespelled her but that was cheating and he would lose more than face hed lose the respect of every vamp in the tower he had to bid for her blood playing on her bloodlust was expected but bespelling her would piss piscary off she wasnt a human to be taken advantage of and the paperwork adjusted she was the last living tamwood vampire and that demanded respect especially from him homicide he said his teeth a white flash against his dark skin that hadnt seen the sun in decades we can get there before the photographer if youre done with yourlunch she allowed a sliver of her surprise to show a homicide wouldnt come with that much information not anymore she had pulled their solved ratio high enough that they were often among the first on the scene which meant theyd get an address not a file as her eyes returned to the papers he had set over his crotch he moved them so she was looking right where he wanted her to irritation flickered over her her eyes rose to meet his gaze and his smile widened to show a glimpse of teasing fang this he said standing in a graceful motion too fast for a human this is your sixmonth evaluation ready to go its clear across the bridge in the hollows ivy stood part habit and part worry her work had been textbook exemplary art didnt want her moving up the ladder and out from under him but the worst scenario would be a reprimand and she hadnt done anything to warrant that actually the worst would be that hed give her a shitty review and shed be stuck here another six months her job in homicide was a short stop on the way to where she belonged in upper management where her mother had been and where piscary wanted her to be she had expected to be on this floor for six months maybe a year working with art until her honed skills pulled her into the arcane division and then to management and finally a lowerbasement office thank god her money and schooling let her skip the grunt position of runner runners were the lowest in the is tower the cops on the corner giving traffic tickets starting there would have put her back a good five years confident and suave art brushed by her his hand trailing across the upper part of her back in a professional show of familiarity that no one could find fault with as he guided her out of her office lets take my car he said plucking her purse and coat from behind her door and giving them to her a jingle of metal pulled her hand up in anticipation and she caught his keys as he dropped them into her waiting palm you drive ivy said nothing her faint bloodlust evaporating in concern that he was pleased with her evaluation meant she wouldnt be arms swinging as if unconcerned she walked beside him to the elevators finding herself in the unusual position of meeting the faces of the few people eating at their desks she hadnt made friends so instead of sympathy she found a mocking satisfaction her tension rose and she kept her breathing to a measured pace to force her pulse to slow whatever art had scrawled on her evaluation was going to keep her hereher family name and money had pulled her as far as they could unless she played office politics this was where she was going to stay with art the luscioussmelling dropdead gorgeous but lackluster art well screw that she whispered feeling her blood rise to her skin and her mind shift into overdrive that was not going to happen she would work so well and so hard that piscary would talk to mrs pendleton and get her out of here and where she belonged thats the idea art murmured hearing only her words not her thoughts but piscary wasnt going to help her the bastard was enjoying the side benefits of her coming home frustrated and hungry from arts attempts at seducing her blood if she couldnt handle this alone then she deserved the humiliation of picking up after art the rest of her life they halted at the twin sets of elevators in the wide hallway ivy stood with her hip cocked frustrated and listening to the soft conversation filtering in from the nearby offices art was attractivemore so given the pheromones god help herbut she didnt respect him and letting her instincts rule her conscious thought even to move ahead sounded like failure to her leaning closer than necessary art pushed the up button his scent rolled over her and while fighting the pure pleasure she watched his eyes go to the heavy clock above the doors to check that the sun was down she could feel his confidence that the sun would rise with him getting his way and it pissed her off her booted foot tapped and her image in the double silver doors did the same behind her arts reflection watched her with a knowing slant to his prettyboy features he was an ass a sexy powerful conceited ass because of who she was it was assumed that she would rise in status by way of her blood not her skills or knowledge it was how business was done if you were a vampire always had been always would be there were papers to sign and legalities to observe when a vamp set his or her sights on anyone other than another vampire but having been born into it she fell under rules older than human or inderland law that she had been conditioned to enjoy giving her blood to another left her feeling like a whore if it ended with her being alone and she knew it would with art as her mother had said the only way out was to give them what they wanted to sell herself and keep selling until she reached the top where no one would have a claim on her if she did this she would be promoted out from under art and someone a little smarter and more depraved would be her new partner everyone would want a taste of her on her way up god she might as well break off her fangs and become an unclaimed shadow but she had grown up with piscary and found that the more powerful and older the vampire the more subtle the manipulation until it could be confused with love taking a slow breath she touched the ponytail she had put her hair in this afternoon pulling the band out and shaking the black waistlength hair free it and her brown eyes were from her mother her sixfoot height and pale skin she got from her father accenting her asian heritage was an oval face heartshaped mouth thin eyebrows and a leggy body toned by martial arts no piercings apart from her ears and a belly button ring skimmer had sweettalked her into while high on brimstone after finals kept as a reminder twentythree and already tired of life art was gazing at her reflection beside his and his eyes flashed black when she melted her posture from annoyed to sultry god she hated thisbut she was going to enjoy it too what the hell was wrong with her pulling away from art she set her back casually against the wall and put one foot behind her balancing it on a toe as they waited for the lift youre a fool if you think im going to let an evaluation keep me in this crappy job she said not caring if the people in earshot heard they probably had a pool going as to where and when hed break her skin art moved with an affected slowness eyes pupilblack he knew he had her this was foreplay her eyes closed when he placed the flat of his arm beside her head leaning to whisper in her ear i like you following behind me tying off my loose ends picking up my slack doing mypaperwork he smelled like leaf ash dusky and thick and the scent went right to the primitive part of her brain and flicked a switch her breath caught then came fast she hesitated then with a feeling of selfloathing she knew would fade and return like the sun she breathed deeply bringing his scent deep inside coating her dislike for him with the sweet promise of blood ecstasy silencing her desire to avoid him with the quick bitter lust for blood she knew what she was doing she knew she would enjoy it sometimes she wondered why she agonized over it kisten didnt letting his keys drop to the carpet with her coat and purse she curled an arm around his neck and pulled him close an inviting sound lifting through her realigning her thoughts shutting down her reasoning to protect her sanity what do you want to change my evaluation she sensed more than saw his smile widen as she leaned forward his earlobe was warm when she put her lips on it sucking with just a hint of pressure from her teeth he slid his fingers along her collarbone to rest atop her shoulder easing his fingers under her shirt eyes closing at the growing warmth her muscles tensed he exhaled against her a soft promise to bring her to life with an exquisite need then satisfy it savagely the elevator dinged and slid open but neither of them moved art breathed deeply when the doors closed an almost subliminal growl that touched the pit of her soul your paperwork is above reproach he said his fingers moving to grip the back of her neck a jolt of bloodpassion lit through her without thought she jerked him forward into her spinning them until arts back hit the wall where hers had been breath fast she met his hungerlaced eyes with her own she felt her jaw tighten and knew her eyes had dilated why had she put this off it was going to be glorious what did she care if she respected him like he respected her like any of them did and my investigative skills are phenomenal she said maneuvering a long leg between his and hooking her foot behind his shoe tugging until their hips touched adrenaline zinged promising more art smiled showing his longer canines that death had given him hers were short by comparison but they were more than sharp enough to get the job done undead vamps loved them she likened it to how a sexual pervert loved children true he said but your interpersonal skills suck his smile widened more accurately you dont ivy chuckled low deep and honestly i do my job artie the vampire pushed from the elevator and together they found the opposite wall ivys jaw clenched as he tried to physically manipulate her making her feel as if she was moving on animal instinct she had been putting this off so long that it might last all night if she let it this isnt about your job art said his fingers tracing the trails he wanted his lips to follow but there was a strict policy against bloodletting in the tower she could tease and flirt drive him crazy let him drive her to the brink but no blood until later its about putting your time in he continued and ivy shivered when his lips touched her neck god help her hed found an old scar pulse hard and fast she pushed him away and around again so he was between her and the wall he let her do it i am putting my time in ivy put a hand to his shoulder and shoved him back he hit the wall with a thump black eyes glinting from behind his black curls what is my evaluation going to say mr artie she leaned into his neck taking a fold of skin between her lips and tugging her eyes closed and as her own bloodlust pulsed through her she forgot that they were standing in the elevator hallway deep underground amid the hum of circulation fans and electriclit black art rode the feeling she knew she was instilling in him letting it grow he had been dead long enough to have gained the restraint to string the foreplay out to their limits youre argumentative closed and refuse to work in a team environment he said his voice husky oh she pouted gripping the hair at the base of his scalp hard enough to hurt im not bad mr artie im a good little girlwhen properly motivated her voice had an artful lilt playful yet domineering and he responded with a low sound the bound heat in it hit her and her fingers released she had found his limit he moved so quickly she sensed more than saw the motion his hand abruptly covered hers forcing her fingers back among the black ringlets at his neck and making them close about them again your evaluation is subjective he said his eyes stopping her breath as time balanced i decide if youre promoted piscary said youd be a worthwhile hunt pull me up in the is hierarchy as you resisted but that youd give in and id have a better job and a taste of you at that ivy paused jealousy clouding her art was conceited enough to believe piscary was giving her to him when the truth was piscary was using art to manipulate her it was a compliment in a backward way and she despised herself for loving piscary all the more craving the master vampires attention and favor even as she hated him for it i am giving in she said anger joining her bloodlust it was a potent mix most vamps craved and here she was giving it to him the only thing they liked more was the taste of fear but arts domineering smile surprised her no he admonished using his undead strength to force her back to the elevators her back hit hard and she inhaled to catch her breath its not that easy anymore he said six months ago you could have gotten away with a nip and a new scar i could brag about but not now i want to know why piscary indulges you beyond belief the way he does i want everything ivy i want your blood and your body or you dont move from that shitty little office without dragging me with you fear unusual and shocking trickled through her and gripped her heart art sensed it and he sucked in air god yes he moaned his fingers jerking in a spasm give this to me ivy felt her face go cold and she tried to push art off her failing blood she could give but her blood and body both she had flirted with insanity the year piscary had called her to him breaking her lifting her to glorious heights of passion her young body could scarcely contain before dropping her soul to the basest of levels to pay for it to make her kneel for more and do anything to please him she knew it had been a studied manipulation one practiced on her mother and her grandmother and her greatgrandmother before that until he was so good at it that the victim wept for the abuse but that didnt stop her from wanting it true to his word she got as good as she gave and she almost killed herself from the highs and lows as piscary carefully built within her an addiction to the euphoria of sharing blood warping it mixing it with her need for love and her craving for acceptance he had molded her into a savagely passionate blood partner rich in the exotic tastes that evolve in mixing the deeper emotions of love and guilt with something that at its basest was a savage act that he had done it only to make her blood sweeter didnt matter it was who she was and a guilty part of herself gloried in the abandonment she allowed herself there that she denied herself everywhere else she had survived by creating the lie that sharing blood was meaningless unless mixed with sex whereupon it became a way to show someone you loved him or her she knew that the two were so mixed up in her mind she couldnt separate them but she had always been in a position to choose who she would share herself with avoiding the realization that her sanity hung on a lie but now her eyes fixed on arts black orbs taking in his mocking satisfaction and checked bloodlust he would be an exquisite rush both beautiful and skilled he would let her burn make her weep for his pull upon her and in return she would give him everything he craved to find and moreand she would wake alone and used not cradled among sheltering arms that forgave her for her warped needs even if that forgiveness was born in yet more manipulation jaw clenching she shoved art away and moved to get her back from the wall he fell back a step surprised she did not want to do this she had protected herself with the lie that blood was just blood and had been prepared for the mental pain of whoring that much of herself but art wanted to mix blood with her body it would touch too closely to the truth to keep the lie that held her intact she couldnt do it arts lust shifted to anger an emotion that crossed into death where compassion couldnt why dont you like me he questioned bitterly jerking her to him im not enough ivys pulse hammered as they stood before the elevators and she cursed herself for her lack of control he was enough he was more than enough to satisfy her hunger but she had a soul to satisfy too you have no ambition she whispered instincts pulling her into his warmth even as her mind screamed no arts jaw trembled and his heady scent sang through her starting a war within her what if she couldnt find a way past this she had always been able to avoid a test between her instinct and willpower by walking away but here that wasnt an option then you arent looking deep enough art gripped her shoulder until it hurt either i get a taste of why piscary indulges you or you take me up with you promotion by promotion i dont care ivy girl dont call me that she said fear mixing with the sexual heat he was pulling from her piscary called her that the bastard if she gave in it would start her on the fast track at work but kill what kept her sane and if she held to her lie and refused art had her doing his dirty work arts smile became domineering as he saw her realize the trap that piscary had probably arranged the situation to test her resolve only made her love the master vampire more she was warped she was warped and lost but her very familiarity with the system she had been born into would save her as she stilled her panic her mind started to work and a wicked smile curled the corner of her lips you forgot something art she said tension falling from her as she faked passivity and hung in his grip if you break my skin without my permission piscary will have you staked all she had to do was best her hunger she could do that he gripped her tighter his fingers pressing into her neck where the visible scars of piscarys claim had been hidden with surgery the scars were gone but the potent mix of neuron stimulators and receptor mutagens remained piscary had claimed her sensitized her entire body so that only he could make it resonate to past passions with just his thoughts and pheromones but she still felt a spike of desire dive to her groin at the thought of arts teeth sinking cleanly into her she had to get away from him before her bloodlust took over you knew that didnt you she mocked her skin tingling youll enjoy it he breathed and the tingles spun into heat when im done with you youll beg for more why would you care who bit who first because i like to say no she said finding it difficult to keep from running her fingernail hard down his neck to bring him alive with desire she could do it she knew exactly how exhilarating the feeling of domination and utter control over a monster like him would feel her fear was gone and without it the bloodlust returned all the harder you take my blood without my acquiescence and ill get you bumped down to runner she said you can coerce you can threaten you can slice your wrist and bleed on my lips but if you take my blood without me saying yes then youlose she leaned forward until her lips were almost touching his and i win she finished pulse fast and aching for him to run his hand against her skin he pushed her away ivy caught her balance easily laughing piscary said youd resist he said his eyes black and tension making his posture both threatening and attractive god the things she could do with this one she thought in spite of herself piscary is right she said cocking her hip and running her hand provocatively down it youre in over your head art i like saying no and im going to drive you into taking me without my permission and then she smiled coming close and curling her arms about his neck and playing with the tips of his curly hair eyes black with hunger art smiled taking her fingers in hers and kissing the tips the hint of teeth against her skin brought a shiver through her and her fingers trembled in his grip good he said voice husky the next six months are going to be pure hell instinct rose and gathered licking her lips she pushed him from her youve no idea he retreated to the wall beside the elevator with a friendly ding the elevator door opened as he bumped the call button he stepped into the elevator still wearing that shitgrin coming he mocked looking too damn good to resist in the back of the elevator feeling the pull she swooped for his keys beside her purse her pulse was faster than she liked and she felt wiretight from hunger thrumming through her damn it it was only nine how was she going to get to the end of her shift without taking advantage of the mail boy im taking my cycle she said throwing his keys at him ill meet you there better put your caps on i want out of this crappy job and id say youve got a week you wont be able to resist once i put my mind to it art laughed ducking his head im older than you think ivy youll be begging me to sink my teeth by friday the door closed and the elevator rose to the parking garage ivy felt her eyes return to normal as the circulation fans pulled away the pheromones they had both been giving off one week and shed be out from under him one week and shed be moving to where she belonged one week and ill have that bastard taking advantage of me she whispered wondering if at the end of it she would be counted the winner i went an entire two weeks saying no to piscaryonce ivy thought as she idled into the apartment complexs parking lot on her cycles momentum art didnt have a shits chance in a cincy sewer feeling a flush of confidence she parked her bike under a streetlight so the assembled is officers could get a good look it was a nightwing x one of the few things she had splurged on after getting her job at the is and a paycheck that wasnt tied to piscary or her mother when she rode it she was free she wasnt looking forward to winter engine rumbling under her provocatively ivy took in the multispeciescapability ambulance and the two is cruisers their lights flashing amber and blue on the faces of gawking neighbors the us health system had begun catering to mixed species shortly after the turn a natural step since only the health care providers who were inderlanders in hiding survived the tangel virus but law enforcement had split and after thirtysix years would stay that way the fib or humanrun federal inderland bureau wasnt here yet art wasnt here yet either she wondered who had called the homicide in the man in the back of the is cruiser in pajama bottoms and handcuffs the excited neighbor in curlers talking to an is officer art wasnt the only thing missing and she scanned the lot for the absent iss evidence collection van they wouldnt show until inderland involvement was confirmed and while many humans lived across the river to take advantage of the lower taxes in the hollows to think that this was strictly a human matter was a stretch the man in the car was in custody if he had been an inderlander hed be in the tower by now it seemed they had a human suspect and were waiting for the fib to collect him shed probably find the crime scene almost pristine with only the people removed to help preserve it idiot human she muttered her foot coming down to balance her weight as she shut off her cycle and slid the key into the shallow pocket of her leather pants to leave the skull key chain dangling she knew what shed find in his apartment his wife or girlfriend dead over something stupid like sex or money humans didnt know where true rage stemmed from fixing her face into a bland expression to hide her disgust she removed her helmet and took a deep breath of the night air feeling the humidity of the unseen river settle deep in her lungs the man in the back of the cruiser was yelling trying to get her attention i didnt mean to hurt her he cried muffled through the glass it wasnt me i love ellie i love ellie you gotta believe me ivy got off her cycle clipping her id to her short leather jacket she took a moment to collect herself concentrating on the damp night the mans fear not his girlfriends blood he was smearing on the windows pulled a faint rise of bloodlust into existence his face was scratched and the welts were bleeding the man was terrified locking him in the cruiser until the fib picked him up was for his own safety her boot heels making a slow seductive cadence to draw attention ivy walked to the front door and the pool of light that held two officers spotting a familiar face ivy let some of the tension slip from her and her arms swing free hi rat she said halting on the apartment complexs sixbyeight common porch havent you died yet its not for lack of trying the older vamp said his wrinkles deepening as he smiled wheres art biting himself she said and his partner a slight woman laughed the living vamp looked right out of high school but ivy knew it was a witch charm that kept her that way the woman was pushing fifty but the disguise was tax deductible since she used her looks to pacify those who neededpacifying ivy nodded warily to her and got the same in return the faint scent of blood coming from the hallway sifted through her brain it wasnt much but after arts play for her her senses were running in overdrive is the body still in there she asked thinking the situation could be useful art hadnt been up long and his resistance would be lower with a little planning she might tip him into making a mistake tonight and she stifled a shudder of anticipation for what that actually meant rat shrugged eyeing her speculatively bodys in the ambulance you okay his teeth sinking deep into her the salt of his dusty blood on her tongue the rush of adrenaline as he drew from her what made her alive im fine she said vampire she questioned since they usually left bodies for the morgue unless there was a chance it might decide it was well enough to get up rats expressive face went hard no his voice was soft and she took a pair of slipon booties that his partner extended to her witch pretty too but since her stakedexcuse of a husband was encouraged to ignore his rights and confessed to beating her up and strangling her they moved her out hes a paint job ivy only good for draining and painting the walls ivy frowned not following his gaze to the man shouting in the cruiser they moved her rat saw her annoyance and added shit ivy he confessed we got pictures theres nothing here theres nothing here when i say theres nothing here she said stiffening when the recognizable rumble of arts latemodel jaguar came through the damp night damn it she had wanted to be in there first ivys exposed skin tingled and she felt a wash of selfdisgust god help her she was going to use a crime scene to get art off her back someone had died and she was going to use that to seduce art into biting her against her will how depraved could she be but it was an old feeling quickly repressed like all the other ugly things in her life handing her purse to rat she got a packet of evidence bags and wax pencil in return i want the collection van here she said not caring that rat had just told her to collect any evidence she thought pertinent herself i want the place vacuumed as soon as im out and i want you to stop doing my job sorry ivy rat grinned hey theres a poll started about you and art ivy stepped forward coiled arm extending rat blocked it grabbing her wrist and pulling her off balance and into him she fell into his chest his weight twice hers his partner snicked ivy had known the strike would never land but it had burned off a little frustration you know rat breathed the scent of his partners blood fresh on his breath from an earlier tryst you really shouldnt wear those highheeled boots they make your balance suck ivy twisted and broke from him i hear they hurt more when i crotchkick bastards like you she said the fading adrenaline making her head hurt who else has been in there she asked thinking a room stinking of fear would be just the thing to tip art into a mistake he was currently standing by the cruiser looking at the human and letting his bloodardor grow idiot rat was rubbing his lower neck in invitation god it had started already by sunup theyd all think she was in the market to build up the ious necessary to reach the lower basement and shed be mobbed imagining the coming innuendos suggestions and unwanted offers ivy stifled a sigh like the pheromones werent bad enough already maybe she should start a rumor she had an std the ambulance crew the vampire was saying tia and me to get him out he was crying over her as usual a neighbor called it in as a domestic disturbance third one this month but when it got quiet she got scared and made the call frowning ivy took a last breath of clean night air and stepped into the hall not too many people to confuse things and rat knew not to touch anything the room would be as clean as could be expected and she wasnt going to sully it the tang of blood strengthened and after slipping on the blue booties she bent to duck under the tape across the open door she stopped inside taking in someone elses life low ceilings matted carpet old drapes new couch big but cheap tv even cheaper stereo and hundreds of cds there were selfframed pictures of people on the walls and arranged on the pressboard entertainment shelves the feminine touches were spotty like paint splatters the victim hadnt lived here very long ivy breathed deeply tasting the anger left in the air invisible signposts that would fade with the sun blue booties scuffing she followed the scent of blood to the bathroom a red handprint gripped the rim of the toilet and there were several smears on the tub and curtain someone had cut his scalp on the tub the pink bulb gave an unreal cast and ivy shut off the exhaust fan with the end of her wax pencil making a mental note to tell rat that she had the soft hum stopped in the new silence she heard the soft conversation and laugh track of a sitcom coming from a nearby apartment arts satisfied voice filtered in from the hallway and ivys blood pressure rose rat had said the man had strangled his wife shed seen worse and though he hadnt said where they found the body an almost palpable anger flowed over the bedrooms doorjamb broken about the latch with newly paintedover cracks ivy touched the hidden damage with a finger the bedroom had the same mix of careless bachelor and young woman trying to decorate with little money to spend cheap frilly pillows pink lace draped over ugly lampshades dust thick on the metal blinds that were never opened no blood but for smears and they were likely the suspects pretty clothes in pink and white were strewn on the bed and floor and the closet was empty she had tried to leave a black tv was in the corner the remote broken on the floor under a dent in the wall smelling of plaster on the carpet was rats card and a polaroid of the woman askew on the floor by the bed forcing her jaw to unclench ivy pulled the air deep into her reading the room as if the last few hours of emotion had painted the air in watercolors any vampire could the man in the car had hurt the woman terrified her beat her up and her magic hadnt stopped him she had died here and the heady scents of her fear and his anger started a disturbing and not entirely unwelcome bloodlust in ivys gut her fingertips ached and her throat seemed to swell the sound of arts scuffing steps cut painfully through her wideopen senses a thrill of adrenaline built and vanished eyes half lidded she turned finding a seductive tilt to her hips arts eyes were almost fully dilated clearly the fear of the man outside and its echo still vibrating through the room were tugging on his instincts maybe this was why he continued to work homicide pretty man couldnt get his fangs wet without a little help maybe ivy he said his voice sending that same shiver through her and she felt a dropping sensation that said her eyes were dilating i make the call for the evidence van not you posture shifting ivy stepped to keep him from getting between her and the door you were busy jacking off on the suspects fear she said lightly she moved as if to leave knowing if she played the coy victim it would trigger his bloodlust as expected arts pupils went wider blacker she felt his presence rise up behind her almost as if pushing her into him he was pulling an aura not a real one but simply strengthening his vampiric presence art snatched her arm domineering and possessive teasing she feigned to draw away until his grip tightened i call the van he said voice dangerous whats the matter art she said languorously pulling her wrist and his hand gripping it to her upper chest dont like a woman who thinks sexual tension lanced through her enjoying it she put a knuckle between her lips letting it go with a soft kiss and a skimming of teeth piscary had made her who she was and despite his experience art didnt have a chance you think im going to lose it over a fearlaced room and a pair of black eyes he said looking good in his italian suit and smelling deliciously of wool ash and himself oh im just getting started with her free hand she took arts fingers off her wrist he didnt stop her smiling she ran her tongue across her teeth hiding them even as they flashed the fear in the room flowed through her inciting instincts older than the pyramids screaming unhindered through her younger body she stiffened at the potent rush of blood rising to her skin she expected it riding and enjoying it it wasnt the scent of blood it was the fear she could handle this she controlled her bloodlust her bloodlust didnt control her and when she felt that curious drop of pressure in her face as her eyes dilated fully she turned to art her paperclad boots spread wide as she stood in the middle of the room stinking of sex and blood and fear lips parted as she exhaled provocatively a tremble lifted through her settling in her groin to tell her what could follow if she let it she wouldnt give him her blood willingly and that he might forcibly take it was unexpectedly turning her on mmmm it smells good in here she said the adrenaline high scouring through her because she was in control she was in control of this monster who could kill her with a backhanded slap who could rip out her throat and end her life who could make her powerless under himand who couldnt touch her blood until she allowed him bound by tradition and unwritten law and if he tried shed have his ass and a better job both pulse fast she took a step closer he wanted herhe was so ready his shoulders were rock hard and his hands were fists to keep from reaching for her his inner struggle was showing on his face and he wasnt breathing anymore there was a reason piscary indulged her this was part of it but art would never taste it all cant havethis she said her hand sliding up from her inner thigh fingers spread wide as they crossed her middle to her chest until they lay provocatively to hide her neck she felt her pulse lift and fall against them stirring herself as much as art her eyes were on the vampire before her he would be savagely magnificent she exhaled imagining his teeth sinking into her reminding her she was alive with the promise of death in his lips almostit might be worth letting him have his way art read her thought in the very air in a flash of motion too fast for her to follow he moved ivy gasped her core pulsing with fear he jerked her to him his hand gripped the back of her neck the other twisted her arm painfully behind her he hesitated as he caught himself his eyes black and pained with the control needed to stop she laughed low and husky cant have this she taunted wishing he would take it as she lolled her head back to expose the length of her neck oh god if only he would she thought a faint tickling in her thoughts warning her a war had started between her hunger and will give it to me art managed his voice strained and she smiled as he started to weaken give this to me no she breathed her pulse lifted under his hand and her eyes closed her body demanded she say yes she wanted to say yes why she thought hunger driving through her as she found his hard shoulders why didnt she say yes such a small thingand he was so deliciously beautiful even if he didnt stir her soul art sensed her falter a low growl rising up through him he pressed her to him almost supporting her weight with a new resolve he nuzzled the base of her neck ivy sucked in her air clutching him closer fire this was fire burning promises from her neck to her groin give this to me he demanded his lips brushing the words against her skin his hand slipped farther edging between her coat and shirt cupping her breast everything he breathed his exhalation filling her making her whole in a breathless wave instinct rose crushing her will no she panicked even as her body writhed for it it would turn her into a whore break her will and crack the lie that kept her sane but with a frightened jolt ivy realized her lips had parted to say yes reality flashed through her and with a surge of fear she kneed him in the crotch art let go falling to kneel before her his hands covering himself not waiting she fell back a step and snapped a front kick to his jaw his head rocked back and he hit the floor beside the bed you stupid bitch he gasped ass she panted trembling as her body rebelled at the sudden shift of passions she stood above him fighting the desire to fall on him sink her teeth into him while he knelt helpless before her damn it she had to get out of this room two unrequited plays for her blood in one night was pushing it slowly art lost his hunched position and started to chuckle ivy felt her face flame get off the floor she snapped backing up they havent vacuumed yet still laughing art rolled onto his side this is going to be one hell of a week he said then hesitated eyes on the carpet just beyond the bedspread knocked askew give me a collection bag he said reaching into his back pocket bloodlust still ringing in her ivy came forward pulled by his intent tone what is it give me a bag he repeated his expensive suit clashing with the ugly carpet she hesitated then scooped up the bags from where they had fallen checking the time ivy jotted down the date and location before handing it to art still on the floor art reached under the bed and rolled something shiny into the light with a pen from his pocket with an eerie quickness he flicked it into the bag and stood the growing brown rim about his pupils said he was in control and smiling to show his teeth he lifted the bag to the light seeing his confidence ivy felt a flash of despair it had been a game to him he had never been in danger of losing his restraint shit she thought the first fingers of doubt she could do this slithering about her heart but then she saw what he held and her worry turned to understandingand then true concern a banshee tear she asked recognizing the tearshaped black crystal suddenly the words of the distraught man in the car had a new meaning i didnt mean to hurt her it wasnt me pity came from nowhere making the slice of lowincome misery surrounding her all the more distasteful he probably had loved her it had been a banshee feeding him rage until he killed his wife whereupon the banshee wallowed in her death energy it was still murder but the man had been a tool not the perpetrator the murderer was at large somewhere in cincinnati with the alibi of time and distance making it hard to link her to the crime thats why the tear had been left as a conduit the banshee had targeted the couple followed them home left a tear when they were out and when sparks flew added to the mans rage until he truly wasnt capable of resisting it wasnt an excuse it was murder by magica magic older than vampires perhaps older than witches or demons art shook the bag to make the black jewel glitter before letting his arm drop we have every banshee on record well run the tear through the computer and get the bitch ivy nodded feeling her pupils contract the is kept close tabs on the small population of banshees and if one was feeding indiscriminately in cincinnati they could expect more deaths before they caught her now where were we art said slipping an arm about her waist bastard ivy said elbowing him in the gut and stepping away but the strike never landed and she schooled her face to no emotion when he chuckled at her a good eight feet back god he made her feel like a child why dont you go home after the sun comes up she snarled you offering to tuck me in go to hell from the hallway came the sounds of soft conversation the collection van was here art breathed deep bringing the scents of the room into him his eyes closed and his thin lips curled upward as he exhaled apparently happy with what he sensed ivy didnt need to breathe to know that the room stank of her fear now mixing with the dead womans until it was impossible to tell them apart see you back at the tower ivy not if i stake you first she thought wondering if calling in sick tomorrow was worth the harassment shed get the next day she could say shed been to the doctor about her case of stdtell everyone she got it from art art sauntered out of the room one hand in his pocket the other dropping the banshee tear onto the entering officers clipboard the werewolfs eyes widened but then he looked up eyes watering whoa he said nose wrinkling what have you two been doing in here nothing ivy felt cold and small in her leather pants and short coat as she stood in the center of the room and listened to art say goodbye to rat and tia she forced her hands from her neck to prove it was unmarked doesnt smell like nothing the man scoffed smells like someone ivy glared at him as his words cut off adrenaline pulsed this time from worry she had contaminated a crime scene with her fear but the mans eyes held pity not disgust are you okay he asked softly his clipboard held to himself as he obviously guessed what had happened there was too much fear in here for just one person even a murdered one fine she said shortly psychic fear levels werent recorded unless a banshee was involved that she hadnt known one was wasnt an excuse shed get reprimanded at the least worse if art wanted to blackmail her and he would damn it could she make this any easier for him flushed she scooped up the rest of the collection bags and gave them to the were i dont know how you can work with the dead ones the man said trying to catch her eyes but ivy wouldnt let him hell they scare my tail over my balls just looking at me i said im fine she muttered i want it vacuumed dusted and photographed dont bother with a fear level profile i contaminated it she could keep quiet about it but shed rather suffer an earned reprimand than arts blackmail keep the tear from the press she added glancing at it small and innocuous on his clipboard the last thing we need is the city in a panic calling us every time a high schooler cries over her boyfriend the man nodded his stubble was thick and stifling the thought of how it would feel to rake her fingers and then her teeth over it ivy strode from the room fleeing the stink of the dead womans fear she didnt like how it smelled exactly like her own ivy passed quickly through the living room and into the hallway trying not to breathe she should have planned this not made a fool of herself by acting on impulse because of her assumptions art had her by the short hairs avoiding him the rest of her day was going to be impossible maybe she could spend it researching banshees the files were stored in the upper levels art might follow her but the inderlander ratio would be slanted to witch and were not only reducing the pheromone levels but also making it easier to pull out early since the entire tower above ground emptied at midnight with their three to twelve shift only the belowground offices maintained the variable sunset to sunrise schedule wine she thought forcing herself to look confident and casual when she emerged on the stoop and found the lights of a news crew already illuminating the parking lot shed pick up two bottles on the way home so kisten would be drunk enough not to care if she hurt him even with her intentions to leave at midnight the sun was up by the time ivy was idling her bike through the hollowss rushhour traffic winding her way to the waterfront and the spacious apartment she and kisten shared above piscarys restaurant that she worked for the force that policed the underground he controlled wasnt surprising or unintentional but prudent planning though not on the payroll piscary ran the is through a complicated system of favors he still had to obey the lawsor at least not get caught breaking them lest he get hauled in like anyone else it reminded ivy of what camelot had probably really been like her mother had worked in the top of the is hierarchy until she died and ivy knew that was where she and piscary wanted ivy to be piscary dealt in gambling and protectionon paper both legal ways to make his moneyand the master vampire had more finesse than to put her where shed have to choose between doing what he wanted and what her job required the corruption was that bad or that good ivy thought checking to see that the guy behind her was watching before she slowed and turned left into the restaurants parking lot if it hadnt been for the threat of piscary coming down on aggressive vampires in backstreet justice the is wouldnt be able to cope she was sure that was why most people including the fib looked the other way the is was corrupt but the people actually in charge of the city did a good job keeping it civilized ivy slowed her bike by the door to the kitchen and cut the engine scanning the empty lot it was wednesday and whereas any other day of the week the restaurant would be emptying out of the last stragglers today it was deserted piscary liked a day of rest at least she wouldnt have to dodge the waitstaff and their questions as to why her eyes were half dilated she needed either a long bubble bath before bed or kisten or both the breeze off the nearby river was cool and carried the scent of oil and gas taking a breath to clear her mind she pushed the service door open with the wheel of her bike it didnt even have a lock to let the produce trucks make their deliveries at all hours no one would steal from piscary for all appearances he obeyed the law but somehow youd find yourself dead anyway purse and twin wine bottles in hand she left her bike beside the crates of tomatoes and mushrooms and took the cement steps to the kitchen two at a time she passed the dark counters and cold ovens without seeing them the faint odor of rising yeast mixed with the lingering odors of the vampires who worked here and she felt herself relax her boots making a soft cadence on the tiled floor the scent brought to memory thoughts of her summers working in the kitchen and when old enough on the floor as a waitress she hadnt been innocent but then the ugliness had been lost in the glare of the thrill now it just made her tired her pulse quickened when she passed the thick door that led to the elevator and piscarys underground apartments the thought that he would meet her with soothing hands and calculated sympathy was enough to bring her blood to the surface but her irritation that he was manipulating her kept her moving into the bar he wouldnt call her to him knowing it would cause her more mental anguish to come begging to him when she could take no more desperate for the reassurance that he still loved her it was comfortingly silent in the restaurant proper and the low ceilings and dim atmosphere seemed to follow her into the closedparty rooms in the back a wide stairway behind a door led to the private second floor her hand traced the wall for balance as she rose up the wide blackwood stairs eager to find kisten and an understanding ear that wasnt attached to a manipulating mind she and kisten lived in the converted apartment that took up the entire top floor of the old shipping warehouse ivy liked the openness arbitrarily dividing it into spaces with folding screens and strategically placed furniture the windows were spacious and smeared on the outside with the dirt and grime of forty years piscary didnt like being that exposed and this granted the two of them a measure of security wine bottles clinking ivy set them on the table at the top of the stairs thinking she and kisten were like two abused children craving the attention of the very person who had warped them loving him out of desperation it was an old thought one that had lost its sting long ago shuffling off her coat she set it and her purse by the wine kist she called her voice filling the silence im home she picked the bottles back up and frowned maybe she should have gotten three there was no answer and as she headed back toward the kitchen to chill the wine the scent of blood shivered through her like an electrical current it wasnt kistens her feet stopped and she breathed deeply her head swiveled to the corner where the deliverymen had put her baby grand last week it had dented her finances more than the bike but the sound of it in this emptiness made her forget everything until the echoes faded kist she heard him take a breath but didnt see him her face blanked and every muscle tightened as she paced to the couches arranged about her piano the dirty sunshine pooling in glinted on the black sheen of the wood and she found him there kneeling on the white persian rug between the couch and the piano a girl in tight jeans a black lacy shirt and a worn leather coat sprawled before him kisten lifted his head an unusual panic in his blue eyes i didnt do it he said his bloodied hands hovering over the corpse shit dropping the bottles on the couch ivy swung into motion moving to kneel before them habit made her check for a pulse but it was obvious by her pallor and the gentle mauling on her neck that the petite blond was dead despite her warmth i didnt do it kisten said again shifting his trim prettyboy body back a few inches his hands strong and muscular were shaking the tops of his fingernails red with a light sheen ivy looked from them to his face seeing the fear in his almost delicate features that he hid behind a reddish blond beard a smear of blood was on his forehead behind his brown bangs and she stifled an urge to kiss it away that both disgusted and intrigued her this is not who i wanted to be i didnt do it ivy he exclaimed at her continued silence and she reached over the girl and brushed his toolong bangs back the gentle swelling of black in his gaze made her breath catch god he was beautiful when he was agitated i know you didnt she said and kistens wide shoulders relaxed making her wonder if that was why he was upset it wasnt that he had to take care of piscarys mistake but that ivy might think he had killed her and somewhere in there she found that he loved her the pretty woman was piscarys favorite body type with long fair hair and an angular face she probably had blue eyes shit shit and more shit mind calculating how to minimize the damage she asked how long has she been dead minutes no more than that kistens resonant voice dropped to a more familiar pitch i was trying to find out where she was staying and get her cleaned up but she died right here on the couch piscary he met her eyes reaching up to tug on a twin pair of diamondstud earrings piscary told me to take care of it ivy shifted her weight to her feet easing back to sit on the edge of the nearby couch it wasnt like kisten to panic like this he was piscarys scion the person the undead vampire had tapped to manage the bar do his daylight work and clean up his mistakes mistakes that were usually four foot eleven blond and a hundred pounds damn it all to hell piscary hadnt slipped like this since she had left to finish high school on the west coast did she sign the release papers she asked do you think id be this upset if she had kisten arranged the small womans hair as if it would help god she looked fourteen though ivy knew shed be closer to twenty ivys lips pressed together and she sighed so much for getting any sleep this morning get the plastic wrap from the piano out of the recycling bin she said in decision and kisten rose tugging the tails of his silk shirt down over the tops of his jeans we open in eight hours for the early inderland crowd and i dont want the place smelling like dead girl kisten rocked into motion headed for the stairs move faster unless you want to have the carpet steam cleaned ivy called and she heard him jump to the floor from midway down tired ivy looked at the womans abandoned purse on the couch too emotionally exhausted to figure out how she should feel kisten was piscarys scion but it was ivy who did most of the thinking in a pinch it wasnt that kisten was stupidfar from itbut he was used to having her take over expected it liked it wondering if piscary had killed the girl on purpose to force kisten to take responsibility ivy stood with her hands on her hips her eyes going to the filthy windows and the river hazy in the morning sun it sounded just like the manipulative bastard if ivy had succumbed to art she would have spent the morning at his placenot only obediently taking the next step to the management position piscary wanted for her but forcing kisten to handle this alone that things hadnt gone the way he planned probably delighted piscary he took pride in her defiance anticipating a more delicious fall when she could fight no longer warped ruined ugly she thought watching the tourist paddleboats steam as they stoked their boilers was there any time she hadnt been the sliding sound of plastic brought her around and with no wasted motion or eye contact she and kisten rolled the woman onto it before her bowels released crossing her arms over her like an egyptian mummy they wrapped her tightly ivy watched her hands not the plasticblurred face of the woman trying to divorce herself from what they were doing as they passed the duct tape kisten had brought around her like lights on a christmas tree only when she had been transformed from a person to an object did kisten exhale slow and long ivy would cry for her later then cry for herself but only when no one could hear refrigerator ivy said and kisten balked ivy looked at him as she stood bent over the corpse with her hands already under the womans shoulders just until we decide what to do danny will be here in four hours to start the dough and press the pasta we dont have time to ditch the body and clean up kistens eyes went to the bloodsmeared rug he lifted a foot and winced at the tacky brown smear on it tracked downstairs and back again yeah he said his fake british accent gone then took the long bundle entirely from ivy and hoisted it over his shoulder ivy couldnt help but feel proud of him for catching his breath so quickly he was only twentythree having taken on piscarys scion position at the age of seventeen when ivys mother had accidentally died five years ago and abdicated the position piscary was active in his control of cincinnati and kisten had little more to do than tidy up after the master vamp and keep him happy stifling her tinge of jealousy that kisten had the coveted position was easy piscarys savage tutorial had made her old before she had begun to live she wouldnt think about what she was doing until it was over kisten hadnt yet learned the trick and lived every moment as it happened instead of over and over in his mind as she did it made him slower to react morehuman and she loved him for it is there a car to get rid of she asked already on damage control she hadnt noticed one in the parking lot but she hadnt been looking no kisten headed downstairs with her following his vampire strength handling the weight without stress she came in with piscary right around midnight off the street she asked in disbelief glad the restaurant had been closed no the bus station apparently shes an old friend ivy glanced at the woman over his shoulder she was only twenty at the most how old a friend could she be piscary didnt like children despite her size it was looking more and more likely piscary had orchestrated this to help kisten stand on his own not only planned it but built in the net of the womans cryptic origins in case kisten should fall the master vamp hadnt counted on ivy catching him first and she felt a pang of what she would call love for kistenif she knew she could feel the emotion without tainting it with the desire for blood ivy caught sight of kistens grimace when she moved to open the door to the kitchen piscary killed her on purpose he said adjusting the womans weight on his shoulder and ivy nodded not wanting to tell him about her own part in the lesson tucking a fabric napkin from the waiting stack into her waistband she yanked up the handle of the walkin refrigerator and slid a box with her foot to prop it open kisten was right behind her and in the odd combination of moist coldness piscary insisted his cheese be kept at she moved a side of lamb thawing out for fridays buffet insulating her hands with the napkin to prevent heat marks from making it obvious someone had moved it behind the hanging slab was a long low bed of boxes and kisten laid the woman there covering the blur of human features with a tablecloth ivy had the fleeting memory of seeing a similar bundle there once before she and kisten had been ten and playing hideandseek while their parents finished their wine and conversation piscary had told them she was someone from a fairy tale and to play in the abandoned upstairs seemed like they were still playing upstairs but now the games were more convoluted and less under their control kisten met her eyes their deep blue full of recollection sleeping beauty he said and ivy nodded that was what they had called the corpse feeling like a little girl hiding a broken dish she moved the slab of lamb back to partially hide the body cold from more than the temperature she followed him out kicking the box out of the way and leaning against the door when it shut her eyes went to the time clock by the door ill get the living room and stairs if you take the elevator she said not wanting to chance running into piscary he wouldnt be angry with her for helping kisten no hed be so amused she had put off art again that he would invite her into his bed and she would quiver inside and go to him forgetting all about kisten and what she had been doing god she hated herself kisten reached for the mop and she added use a new mop head then put the old one back on when youre done were going to have to burn it along with the rug right he said his jaw flushing as it clenched while kisten filled a bucket ivy made a fresh batch of the spray they wiped the restaurant tables down with diluted it removed the residual vamp pheromones but at full strength it would break down the blood enzymes that most cleaning detergents left behind maybe it was a little overkill but she was a careful girl it would be unlikely to have the woman traced here but it wasnt so much for eliminating her presence from a snooping is or fib agent as it was avoiding having the restaurant smell like blood other than hers and kistens that might lead to questions concerning whether the restaurants mixed public license or mpl had been violated ivy didnt think her explanation that no no one had been bitten on the premisespiscary had drained a woman in his private apartmentsand therefore the mpl was intact would go over well from the amount of aggravation piscary had endured to get his mpl reinstated the last time some fool were high on brimstone had drawn blood she thought hed prefer a trial and jail to losing his mpl again but the real reason ivy was being so thorough was that she didnt want her apartment smelling like anyone but her and kisten her thoughts brought her gaze back to him he looked nice with his head bowed over the bucket his light bangs shifting in the water droplets being flung up as it filled clearly unaware of her scrutiny he turned the water off i am such an ass he said watching the ripples settle thats what i like about you she said worried she might have made him feel inadequate by taking over i am he didnt look at her hands clenching the rim of the plastic bucket i froze i was so damn worried about what you were going to say when you came home and found me with a dead girl i couldnt think finding a compliment in there she smiled digging through a drawer to get a new mop head i knew you didnt kill her she had piscary all over her damn it ivy kisten exclaimed lashing the flat of his hand out to hit the spigot and there was a crack of metal i should be better than this im his fucking scion ivys shoulders dropped sliding the drawer shut she went to him and put her hands on his shoulders they were hard with tension and he did nothing to acknowledge her touch tugging into him she pressed her cheek against his back smelling the lingering fear on him and the womans blood eyes closing she felt her bloodlust assert itself death and blood didnt turn on a vampire fear and the chance to take blood did there was a difference her hands eased around his front fingers slipping past the buttons to find his abs only now did kist bow his head softening into her touch her teeth were inches from an old scar she had given him the intoxicating smell of their scents mixing hit her and she swallowed the headiest lure of all her chest pressed into him as she breathed deep intentionally bringing his scent into her luring fingers of sexual excitement to stir along her spine dont worry about it she said her voice low youd be a better scion then i am he said bitterly why did he pick me she didnt think this was about which one of them was his scion but his stress looking for an outlet giving in to her urge she lifted onto her toes to reach his ear because you like people more than i do she said because youre better at talking to them getting them to do what you want and having them think it was their idea i just scare people he turned slowly so he would stay in her arms i run a bar he said eyes downcast you work for the is you tell me which is more valuable ivys arms slipped to his waist pressing him back into the edge of the sink im sorry for the pizza delivery crap she said meaning it you arent running a bar youre learning cincinnati what moves who and who will do anything for whom me her attention went to the wisp of hair showing at the v of his shirt im learning how to kiss ass and suck neck his gaze hard with selfrecrimination kisten shook his head piscary dropped a dead girl in my lap and i sat over her and wrung my hands you walked in and things happened what about the next time when its something important and i fuck it up running her hands up the smooth expanse of silk to his shoulders she closed her eyes at the deliciously erotic sensation growing in her guilt mixed with it she was ugly all she had wanted to do was console kisten but the very act of comforting him was turning her on the thought of art and what had almost happened hit her between one breath and the next the muscles where her jaw hinged tightened and her eyes dilated shit may as well give in feeling like a whore she opened her eyes and fixed them on kistens his were as black as her own and a spike of anticipation dove to her middle warped and twisted both of them was there any way to show she cared other than this youll handle it she whispered wanting to feel her lips pulling on something anything the soft skin under his chin glistened from the thrownup mist begging her to taste it i save your ass you save mine she said it was all she had to offer promise he said sounding lost apparently it was enough the lure was too much and she pulled herself closer to put her lips softly against the base of his neck letting his pulse rise and fall teasingly under her she felt as if she was dying screaming because they needed each other to survive piscary pulse racing in what was going to follow and despairing that the two were connected i promise she whispered eyes closed she raked her teeth over skin but didnt pierce as her fingers lifted through the clean softness of his hair kistens breath came fast and with one arm he picked her up and set her on the counter forcing his way between her knees she felt her gaze go sultry when his hands went behind her hips edging over the top of her pants youre hungry he said a dangerous lilt to his voice im past hungry she said twining her hands behind his neck as if bound her voice was demanding but in truth she was helpless before him it was the bane of the vampire that the strongest was the most in need and kisten knew the games they played as well as she did her thoughts flitted to sleeping beauty in the refrigerator and she shoved away the loathing that she wanted to feel kistens blood fill her not ten minutes after a woman had died in their apartment the selfdisgust she would deal with later she was eminently proficient at denying it existed art bothering you again he said his almost delicate features sly as he slipped a hand under her shirt the firm warmth of his fingers was like a spike through her still she said stifling a tremor to entice the feeling to grow his free hand traced across her shoulder and her collarbone to slide up the opposite length of her neck ill have to write a letter and thank him he said eyes flashing open ivy yanked him to her wrapping her legs around him imprisoning him against her his hands were gone from her waist leaving only a cool warmth he wants my blood and my body ivy said feeling her lust for kisten mix with her disgust for art hes getting nothing im going to drive him into taking my blood against my will kistens breath was against her neck and his hands were at the small of her back whats that going to get you a smile unseen and evil spread across her as she looked over his shoulder to the empty kitchen satisfaction she breathed feeling herself weaken he promotes me out from under him to keep my mouth shut or he becomes the laughingstock of the entire tower but she didnt know if she could do it anymore he was stronger than she had given him credit thats my girl kisten said and she sucked in her breath when he bent his head his teeth gently working an old scar to send a delicious dart of anticipation through her youre such a political animal remind me never to cross stakes with you breathless she couldnt answer the thought of having to deal with the contaminated scene flitted past and was gone youll need practice saying no kisten murmured mmmm eyes open she found herself moving against him as his hands pulled her closer his head dropped and her hands splayed across his back curled so her fingers dug into him kistens lips played with the base of her neck moving ever lower could you say no if he did this kisten whispered grazing his teeth along her bare skin while his hands under her shirt traced a path to her breast the two feelings were joined in her mind and it felt as if it was his teeth on her breast yes she breathed exhilarated he worked the hem of her shirt and she gripped the hair at the base of his skull wanting more what if he made good on his promise he asked dropping his head and she froze at the wash of a silver feeling cascading to her groin when he set his teeth where his fingers had been it was too much to not respond pulse racing she jerked his head up it could have hurt but kisten knew it was coming and moved with her she never hurt him not intentionally lips parted she tightened her legs around him until she nearly left the counter and though she buried her face against his neck breathed in his scent and mouthed his old scars she didnt break his skin the selfdenial was more than an exquisite torture more than an ingrained tradition it was survival the truth was that she was very nearly beyond thought and only patterns of engraved behavior kept her from sinking her teeth filling herself with what made him alive she lusted to feel for that glorious instant total power over another and thus prove she was alive but until he said so she would starve for it it was a game but a deadly serious one that prevented mistakes made in a moment of passion the undead had their own games breaking the rules when they thought they could get away with it but living vampires held tight to them knowing it might be the difference in surviving a blood encounter or not and kisten knew it enjoying his temporary mastery over her she was the dominant of the two but unable to satisfy her craving until he let her and in turn he was helpless to satisfy himself until she agreed his masculine hands pushed her mouth from his neck forcing his own lips against her jugular rising and falling beneath him her head flung to the ceiling she wondered who would surrender and ask first the unknowing sparked through her and feeling it a growl lifted from her dropping her head she found his earlobe the metallic diamond taste sharp on her tongue give this to me she breathed succumbing uncaring that her need was stronger than his take it he groaned submitting to their twin desires faster than he usually did panting in relief she pulled him closer and in the shock of him meeting her she carefully sank her teeth into him shuddering kisten clutched her closer lifting her off the counter she pulled on him hungry almost panicked that someone would stop them blessed relief washed through her at the sharp taste their scents mixed in her brain and his blood washed into her making them one rubbing out the void that loving piscary and meeting his demands continually carved into her his warmth filled her mouth and she swallowed sending it deeper into her desperately trying to drown her soul somehow kistens breath against her was fast and she knew the exquisite sensations she instilled in him the vamp saliva invoking an ecstasy so close to sex it didnt matter his fingers trembled as they traced her lines and reached for the hem of her shirt but she knew there wasnt time she was going to climax before they could work themselves much more breathless and savage from the sensations of power and bloodlust she pulled back from him running her tongue quickly over her teeth she met his eyes pupilblack he saw her teetering take it she breathed desperate to give him what he needed craved it wouldnt make amends for the savagery of the act but it was the only way she could find peace with herself kisten didnt wait a guttural sound coming from him he leaned in sensation jerked through her the instant of heady pain mutated almost immediately into an equal pleasure the vampire saliva turning the sting of his fangs into the fire of passion oh god she moaned kisten heard and he dug harder going far beyond what he usually did she gasped at the twin sensations of his teeth on her neck and his fingernails on her breast body moving with his she pulled his hand from where he gripped the back of her neck and found his wrist she couldntbear it she needed everything everything at once his mouth pulled on her and with elation filling her she bit down slicing into old scars kisten shook his grip faltering as sexual and blood rapture filled them both he pulled away from the counter and her legs tightened around his waist she heard in his breathing that he was going to reach fulfillment and content that they would end this with both of them satisfied she abandoned all thought everything was gone leaving only the need to fill herself with him and she took everything he gave her not caring he was doing the same together they could find peace together they could survive ivys grip tightened and she sank her teeth deeper kisten responded a low rumble rising up through him it sparked a primitive part of her and fear instinctive and unstoppable jumped through her kisten felt it gripping her aggressively she cried out and with the pain shifting to spikes of pleasure she climaxed her pulse a wild thrum under kistens hand and in his mouth and through him he tensed and with a last groan his lips left her as he found the exquisite mental orgasm brought on by satiating the hunger and blood no wonder she was screwed up she thought even as her body shook and rebelled at the rapturous assault evil or wrong didnt matter she couldnt resist something that felt so damn good kist she panted when the last flickers faded and she realized she still had her legs wrapped around him her forehead against his shoulder and her body trying to figure out what had happened are you okay hell yes he said his breathing haggard god i love you woman as his arms tightened around her an emotion she seldom felt good about filled her she loved him more than she would admit but it was pointless to plan for a future that was already mapped out slowly he settled her back on the counter his muscles starting to shake the rim of blue about his pupils was returning and his lips still reddened from her blood parted and his eyebrows rose ivy youre crying she blinked shocked to find she was no im not she asserted swinging her leg up and around to get him out from between them her muscles protested not ready to move yet yes you are he insisted grabbing a cloth napkin and pressing it to his wrist and then his neck the small punctures were already closing the vampire saliva working to stimulate repair and fight possible infection turning away she slipped from the counter almost stumbling in her need to hide her emotions but kisten grabbed her upper arm and turned her back what is it he said and then his eyes widened shit i hurt you she almost laughed choking it back no she admitted then closed her eyes trying to find the words they were there but she couldnt say them she loved kisten but why did the only way she could show him involve blood had piscary completely killed in her how to comfort someone she loved without it turning into a savage act love should be gentle and tender not bestial and selfserving she couldnt remember the last time she had slept with someone without blood she didnt think she had since piscary first turned his attentions fully to her warping her until any emotion of caring love or devotion stimulated a bloodlust that seemed pointless to resist she had carefully built the lie to protect herself that blood was blood and sexandblood was a way to show she loved someone but she didnt know how much longer she could believe it blood and love had become so intertwined in her that she didnt think she could separate them and if she had to admit that sharing blood was how she expressed her love then shed have to admit she was a whore every time she let someone sink his or her teeth into her on her way to the top was that why she was forcing art into taking her against her will she had to submit to rape in order to keep herself sane kistens eyes roved the kitchen and she saw his nose widen as he took in their scent theyd endure a ribbing from the entire staff for having relieved their vampiric pressures in the kitchen but it would cover up the smell of the corpse at least what is it then he asked anyone else would have been pushed aside and ignored but kisten put up with too much of her crap all i wanted to do was comfort you she said dropping her head to hide behind the curtain of her hair and it turned into blood making a soft sigh kisten took her in a slow careful embrace a shiver lifted through her when he gently kissed away the last of the blood from her neck he knew it was so sensitive as to almost hurt and would be for a few more minutes hell ivy he whispered his voice telling her he knew what she was not saying if you were trying to comfort me you did a bangup job he didnt move and instead of pulling away she stayed allowing herself to accept his touch its what i needed too he added the smell of their scents mingling inciting a deep contentment instead of a dire need now that the hunger had been satisfied she nodded believing him though she still felt ashamed but why is that the only way i know how to be ivy swiveled her chair rolling the banshee tear safe in its plastic bag between her fingers and wondering if it was magic or science that enabled a banshee to draw enough emotional energy through the gem to kill someone science she was willing to believe a science so elaborate and detailed that it looked like magic resonating alpha waves or something like cell phones or radio transmissions the files hadnt been clear the office chatter coming in her open door was light because of the ungodly hour she was working today on the uppertower schedule having a threethirty afternoon appointment to talk to a banshee who had helped the is in the past that it would get her out of here at midnight was a plus but it was still damn early mood souring ivy leaned back in her chair and listened to the quiet the usual noises sounding out of place because of their sparseness the office atmosphere had changed the glances she caught directed at her having gone from bitter to sympathetic she didnt know how to react apparently the word had gone out that art had made a real play for her blood causing her not only to contaminate a crime scene but also to almost succumb and whereas she could have taken comfort in the show of sympathy she felt only a resentful bitterness that she was the object of pity how in the hell was she going to get rid of art if she couldnt say no to him it was a matter of pride now ivys eyes lifted to the humming wall clock art was tucked underground and knowing he wouldnt be coming in for several hours gave her a measure of peace shed like to stake the bastard maybe thats what piscary wanted her to do over the ambient office noise of keyboards and gossip she heard her name spoken in a soft unfamiliar voice focusing ivy listened to someone else give directions to her office ivy set the tear beside her pencil cup with its colored markers turning to her door when the light was eclipsed her breath to say hello hesitated as she evaluated the woman forgetting to invite her in shed never met a banshee before and ivy wondered if they all had that disturbing demeanor or if it was just mia harbor she was wearing a dramatic calflength dress made of strips of sky blue fabric it would have looked like rags if the fabric wasnt silk the cuffs of the long sleeves ran to drape over her fingertips and it fit her slight figure perfectly her severely short hair was black cut into downward spikes and iced with gold completely contrary to her pale complexion and meadowy attire but somehow harmonizing perfectly dark sunglasses hid her eyes small petite and agelessly attractive she made ivy feel tall and gawky as she stood in her doorway the expression on her delicate features shifting from question to a tired acceptance ivy realized she was staring immediately she stood hand extended ms harbor she said please come in im officer tamwood she moved forward her dress furling about her calves her hand was cool with a smooth strength and ivy let go as soon as it was polite the confidence of her grip caused ivy to place her somewhere in her sixties but she looked twenty witch charm ivy wondered or natural longevity please call me mia the woman said sitting in arts chair when ivy indicated it mia ivy repeated sinking back down behind her desk she considered asking the woman to call her by her first name but didnt and mia settled herself with a stiff formality unusually uncomfortable ivy leafed through the report to hide her nervousness banshees were dangerous entities able to draw enough energy from people to kill them much like a psychic vampire they didnt need to kill to survive able to exist on the natural sloughing off of emotion from the people around them but that didnt mean they wouldnt gorge themselves if they thought they could get away with it she had never had the chance to talk to one before they were a dying species as public awareness grew about this innocentlooking but highly dangerous inderlander race like black widow spiders they generally killed their mate after becoming pregnant ivy didnt think it was intentional their human husbands simply lost their vitality and died there had never been much of a population of them anywayevery child born was female and the magic needed to conceive outside ones species made things difficult i make you nervous mia said sounding pleased ivy glanced at her and then back to the papers giving up trying to maintain her stoic demeanor she leaned back in her chair setting her hands in her lap i wont be taking any emotion from you officer tamwood mia said i dont need to youre throwing off enough nervous energy and conflicted thoughts to sate me for a week oh joy ivy thought sourly she took pride in suppressing her emotions and that mia not only felt them but was sopping them up like gravy wasnt a pleasant thought why am i here mia asked pale hands holding her tiny bluebeaded purse on her lap ivy gathered herself ms harbor she said formally seeing mia grimace when ivy made an effort to calm herself id like to thank you for coming to see me i have a few questions that the is would be most grateful if you can help me with a sigh came from mia chilling ivyit sounded like the eerie moan of a lost soul which one of my sisters killed someone she asked looking at the tear in its evidence bag ivys prepared speech vanished relieved to be able to sidestep the formalities she leaned forward the flat of her forearms on the desk were looking for jacqueline mia held out a hand for the tear and ivy pushed it closer the woman let go of her purse and took the bag slipping a white nail under the seal hey ivy exclaimed standing mia froze looking at ivy over her sunglasses breath catching ivy stopped her vampfast reach for the evidence bag and rocked back the womans eyes were the shockingly pale blue of a near albino but it was the aching emptiness that halted ivy unmoving her heart pounded at the raw hunger they contained chained by an ironlaced restraint the woman was holding a hunger whose depths ivy had only tasted but ivy had learned enough about restraint to see the signs that her control was absolute her lack of emotional expression the stiffness with which she held herself the soft preciseness of her breathing the careful motions she made as if she would lose control if she moved too fast and broke through the envelope of her aura and will shocked and awed by what the woman confidently contained ivy humbly sat back down a smile quirked mias face the snap of the seal breaking was loud but ivy didnt stop her even when she shook the tear into her palm and delicately touched it briefly to her tongue you found this at the crime scene she asked and when ivy nodded she added this tear is not functioning ivy took a breath to protest and mia interrupted you found this in a room stinking of fear if it had been working every wisp of emotion would have been gone surprised ivy struggled to keep her emotions close that the room reeked of fear when she entered hadnt made it to her report since she had contaminated it it seemed pointless that might have been a mistake but amending her report to include it would look questionable mia dropped the tear back into the bag it wasnt jacqueline who killed it wasnt any of my sisters im sorry but i cant help you officer tamwood ivys pulse quickened thinking mia was protecting her kin she said the man admits to killing the victim but doesnt know why he did our theory is jacqueline left the tear knowing there was the chance domestic violence would cover her crime please mia if we dont find jacqueline an innocent man will be sentenced for murdering his wife the crackle of the broken seal was loud and ivy wondered what the black crystal tasted like a tear older than a week wont function as a conduit for emotions mia said and while that tear is jacquelinesshe tossed the bag to the deskit is at least three years old wondering how she was going to explain why the original seal was broken ivy frowned this had been a waste of time just as well she hadnt told art about it and you know that how maam she said frustrated you cant date tears from behind her black glasses mia smiled to show her teeth her canines a shade longer than a humans i know its at least that old because i killed jacqueline three years ago smooth and unhurried ivy rose and shut the door the hum of a copier cut off and ivy returned to her desk in the new silence trying to maintain her blank expression she watched the woman reading nothing in her calm silently she waited for an explanation we are not a wellliked group of people mia said bluntly jacqueline had become careless falling back on old traditions of murdering people to absorb their death energy instead of taking the paltry ambient emotions that inderland law grants us so you killed her ivy allowed herself a deep breath this woman was scaring the shit out of her with her casual admission of so heinous an act mia nodded the hem of her dress seeming to shift by itself in the still air we police ourselves so the rest of inderland wont she smiled you understand thinking of piscary ivy dropped her eyes we arent substantially different from each other the woman said lightly vampires steal psychic energy too youre just clumsy about it having to take blood with it as a carrier head moving slowly in acceptance ivy quashed her feelings of guilt generally only vampires knew that a portion of a persons aura went with the blood but a banshee would seeing as thats what they took themselves a more pure form of predation that stripped the soul and made it easy to break it from the body a person could replace a substantial amount but take too much aura too quickly and the body dies ivy had always thought banshees were higher on the evolutionary ladder but perhaps not seeing as vampires used the visible signs of blood loss to gauge when to stop its not the same ivy protested no one dies when we feed they do if you feed too heavily ivys thoughts lighted on the body in piscarys refrigerator yes but when a vampire feeds they give as much emotion as they get and though mia didnt move ivy stiffened when the slight woman seemed to gather the shadows in the room wrapping them about herself only living vampires with a soul give as well as take she said and thats why you suffer ivy her voice low and mocking shocked ivy at the use of her given name you could still find beauty amid the ugliness if you were strong enough mia continued but youre afraid ivys stomach clenched and her skin went cold it was too close to what she had been searching for even as she denied it existed you cant find love in taking blood she asserted determined to not get upset and unwittingly feed thiswoman love is beautiful and blood is savagely satisfying an ugly need and you dont need love thats not what im saying ivy felt unreal and she gripped the edge of her desk blood isnt a way to show you love ivys voice was soft but inside she was screaming she was so screwed up that she couldnt comfort a friend without tainting it with her lust for blood to mix her need for love and her need for blood corrupted love and made it vile her desire to keep the two separate was so close to her so vulnerable that she almost choked when mia shook her head thats not who you want to be she taunted i see it it pours from you like tears you lie to yourself saying that blood and love are separate you lie saying sanity exists in calling them two things instead of one only by accepting that can you rise above what your body demands of you to live true to who you want to bewith someone you love and who is strong enough to survive loving you back shocked ivy froze this slight woman sitting before her was pulling from ivy her most desperate hidden desires throwing them out for everyone to see she wanted to control the bloodlustbut it felt so damn good to let it control her and if she called it love then she had been whoring herself half her life as she stared at mias knowing smile memories filled her memories of piscarys touch his praise of his taking everything from her and saying it was proof of her devotion and love and her flush of acceptance of finding worth in being everything he wanted it was as raw as if it happened last night not almost a decade ago years of indulgence followed as she found that the more dominating she was the more satisfaction she craved and the less she found it was a cruel slipknot that sent her begging for piscary to give her a feeling of worth and though she never found it he had turned the pain sweet now this woman who could sip misery from another as easy as breathing wanted her to accept that the dichotomy that had saved her sanity was a hollow truth that she could find beauty in her cravings by calling it love it is not love she said feeling as if she couldnt breathe then why do you resist art she accused a hint of a smile on her face and one eyebrow raised tauntingly the entire floor is thinking about it you know its more than a casual act its a way to show your love and to give that to art would mean you were a demimonde noa whore a filthy perverted slut selling herself for a moment of carnal pleasure and professional advancement it was so close to what she had been thinking herself that ivy clenched her jaw glad the office door was closed she felt her eyes dilate but the memory of mias leashed hunger kept her sitting she knew that mia was provoking her inciting her anger so she could lap it up it was what banshees did that they often used truth to do so made it worse you cant express love in taking blood ivy said her voice low and vehement why not why not it sounded so simple because i cant say no to blood ivy said bitterly i need it i crave it i want to satisfy it damn it mia laughed you stupid whiny little girl you want to satisfy it because its tied to your need for love its too late for me i cant find beauty in satisfying my needs since anyone a banshee loves dies you can and to see you so selfish makes me want to slap you you are a coward she accused too frightened to find the beauty in your needs because to do so would admit that you were wrong that you have been fooling yourself for most of your life lying that it has no importance so you can indulge yourself you are a whore ivy and you know it stop deluding yourself that you arent ivy felt her eyes flash entirely to black pulled by anger you need to leave she said muscles so tense it took all her restraint to keep from striking the banshee mia stood she was alive and vibrant her smooth face flushed and beautifulan accusing angel hard and uncaring you can live above your fate she mocked you can be who you want to be so piscary warped you so he broke you and remade you to be a pliant source of emotionrich blood its up to you to either accept or deny it you think i like being like this ivy said standing when her frustration spilled over that i like anyone with long teeth able to take advantage of me this is what i was born intotheres no way out its too late too many people expect me to be the way i am too many people force me to be the way they want me to be the truth was coming out pissing her off mias lips were parted and her face was flushed her eyes were lost behind her sunglasses and the gold in her short black hair caught the light that is the excuse of a lazy frightened coward she said and ivy tensed ready to tell her to shut up but for the memory of the leashed hunger in her eyes admit you were wrong admit you are ugly and a whore then dont be that way anymore but it feels too good ivy shouted not caring if the floor heard her mia trembled her entire body shuddering breath fast she reached for the back of her chair when she brought her gaze up from behind her sunglasses ivy realized that the air was as pure and pristine as if the argument hadnt happened pulse fast ivy breathed deeply finding only the hint of mias perfume and the softest trace of her sweat damn the bitch was good i never said it would be easy mia said softly and ivy wondered exactly what the hell had just happened the hunger will always be there like a thorn every day will be worse than the previous until you think you wont be able to exist another moment but then youll see the filth in your eyes trying to get outand if youre strong youll find the will to put it off another day and for another day you will be who you want to be unless youre a coward the humming of the wall clock grew loud in the new silence almost deep enough to hear mias heartbeat and ivy stood behind her desk not liking the feelings mixing in her im not a coward ivy finally said no youre not mia admitted subdued and quiet satiated and i am not weak of will ivy added louder mia inhaled slowly her pale fingers tightening on her purse yes you are ivys eyes narrowed and mias mien shifted again forgive me for asking she said sounding both embarrassed and nervous but would you consider living together ivys gut tightened get out mia swallowed taking off her sunglasses to show her pale blue eyes her pupils carrying a familiar swelling of black that made her look vulnerable i can make it worth your while she said her eyes running over ivy as if she was a past lover and moistening her lips my blood for your emotion i can satisfy everything you need ivy and more and you could kindle a child in me with the pain you carry getout head bowing mia nodded and moved to the door i am not weak of will ivy repeated shame joining her anger when mia crossed the small office mia opened the door hesitating to turn and look at her no she said a gentle sadness in her ageless features you arent but you do need practice dress furling the woman left the click click of her heels silencing the entire floor the fluorescent lights catching the highlights in her hair angry ivy lurched to the door slamming it shut and falling back into her chair i am not weak of will she said aloud as if hearing it would make it so but the idea she might be wiggled in between thought and reason and it was too easy to doubt herself her boot heels went up onto her desk ankles crossed she didnt want to think about what mia had saidor what she offered eyes closed ivy took a breath to relax forcing her body to do as she told it she hadnt liked mia using her but thats what they did it was ivys own fault for arguing with her again ivy inhaled slower to make her shoulders ease she could ignore everything but what she wanted to focus on if she triedshe spent a great deal of her life that way it made her quick to anger depressed her appetite and caused her to be overly sensitive but it kept her sane ivys eyes opened in the silence falling upon the tear as inescapable as shadows her mind fastened on it desperately seeking a distraction disgust lifted through her at the torn bag how was she going to explain the broken seal to art leaning forward she felt her muscles stretch as she pulled the bag closer and in a surge of selfindulgence shook the tear into her palm a moment of hesitation and she touched it to her tongue she felt nothing tasted nothing with a guilty motion she dropped it back in and pressed the seal shut tossing it to her desk the tear was three years old found in a room stinking of fear a banshee hadnt been responsible the man had murdered his wife with a plan already in place to shift the blame where had he gotten a tear a tear three years old no less three years that was a long time to plan your wifes murder especially when they had been married only eight months according to mr demeres file longterm planning ivy leaned forward in a spike of adrenaline and fingered the bag vampires planned that long jacqueline had a record only a vampire who worked for the is would be in a position to know she was dead unable to clear her name and only an is employee would have access to a tear swiped from the oldevidence vault a tear no one would miss holy shit ivy softly swore this went to the top dropping the tear ivy reached for the phone art would crap his coffin when he found out but then a thought struck her and she hesitated the buzz of the open line a harsh whine the apartment had been full of fearanger and fear that should have been soaked up by the tear but wasntfear that art had covered up with her own emotions the buzz of the phone line turned to beeping and she set the phone back in the cradle the acidic taste of betrayal filling her thoughts art had used her to muddle the psychic levels in the room the guy from the collection van had commented on it when he had come in blaming it on her after he saw the banshee tear not knowing she had only added to what was already there no one documented psychic levels unless a banshee was involved and they hadnt known until after she contaminated the scene after art stole and planted the tear she muttered aloud art who was so dense he couldnt find his pretty fangs in someones ass plucking a pen from her pencil cup she tapped it on the desk wanting to write everything down but resisting lest it come back to bite her maybe not so dense after all motive she breathed enjoying the adrenaline rush and feeling as if it cleansed her somehow why would art help plan and cover up a murder what would he get out of it being undead art was moved only by survival and his need for blood blood she thought had the suspect promised to be arts blood shadow in exchange for the opportunity to murder his wife didnt sound right her lips curled upward and she smiled money arts rise in the is had stopped when he died and was no longer a potential source of blood without the currency of blood for bribes he couldnt rise in the vampiric hierarchy he was existing on the interest from his postdeath funds but by law he couldnt touch the principal if the suspect gave art a portion of his wifes insurance money it might be enough to move art up a step that the undead vampire had openly admitted he wasnt adverse to using ivy to pull him up in the ranks only solidified her belief that he was having money problems undead vampires didnt work harder than they had to that art was working at all said something pen clicking open and shut so fast it almost hummed ivy tried to remember if she had ever heard that art had died untimely hed been working the same desk over thirty years jerking in sudden decision she dropped the pen and pulled out the yellow pages looking for the biggest insurance ad that wasnt connected to one of cincinnatis older vamp families she would call them all if she had to pulse quickening she dialed using the suspects social security number to find out his next payment wouldnt be due until the fifteenth it was for a hefty amount and she impatiently kept hitting the star button until the machine had a cyber coronary and dumped her into a real persons phone were insurance a polite voice answered ivy sat straighter this is officer tamwood she said and im checking on the records of a mr and mrs demere could you tell me if they upped their life insurance recently there was a moment of silence youre from the is before ivy could answer the woman continued primly im sorry officer tamwood we cant give out information without a warrant ivy smiled wickedly thats fine maam my partner and i will be there with your little piece of paper as soon as the sun goes down were kind of in a hurry so he might skip breakfast to get there before you close uh the voice came back and ivy felt her eyes dilate at the fear it held no need im always glad to help out the is let me pull up the policy in question ivy tucked the phone between her ear and her shoulder picking at her nails and trying to get her eyes to contract here it is the woman gushed nervously mr and mrs demere took out a modest policy covering each of them shortly after getting married the womans voice trailed off sounding puzzled it was increased about four months ago just a minute ivy swung her feet to the floor and reached for a pen okay the woman said when she returned i see why mrs demere finished getting her degree she was going to become the major breadwinner and they wanted to take advantage of the lower payment schedule before her next birthday it has a payout of a half million the woman chuckled someone was a little enthusiastic a data entry degree wont get her a good enough job to warrant that kind of insurance a zing of adrenaline went through ivy and the pen snapped damn it she swore as ink stained her hand and dripped to the desk maam the woman questioned a new wariness to her voice staring at the blue ink on her hand ivy said nothing my pen just broke she dropped it in the trash and using her foot she opened a lower drawer and snatched up a tissue it might be in your companys best interest to misfile any claim for a few weeks she said as she wiped her fingers could you give me a call when someone tries to process it thank you officer tamwood the insurance officer said cheerfully over the sound of a pencil scratching thank you very much ive got your number on my screen and ill do just that embarrassed ivy hung up still trying to get the worst of the ink off her she felt a stirring of excitement it wasnt in any report that the tear wasnt functioning this had possibilities but she couldnt go to the basement with her suspicions if art had promised someone down there a cut of money her suspicions would go nowhere and shed look like a whiny bitch trying to get out of giving art his due blood that she was doing just that didnt bother her as much as she thought it would balling up the inkstained tissue ivy reached again for the phone kisten kisten could help her on this maybe they could have lunch together the muted sounds of the last patrons being ushered out the door vibrated through the oak timbers of the floorboards and ivy relaxed in it finding more peace there than shed like to admit extending her long legs out under the piano she picked up her melted milkshake and sipped through the straw as she planned arts downfall before her on the closed lid were writtenout plans of contingencies neatly arranged on the black varnished wood below her piscarys living patrons stumbled home in the coming dawn the undead ones had left a good hour ago the scent of tomato paste sausage pasta and the deathbychocolate dessert someone had ordered to go drifted up through the cracks the light coming in the expansive windows was thin and ivy looked from her pages set in neat piles and stretched her laced fingers to the distant ceiling she was usually in bed this time of daywaiting for kisten to finish closing up and slide in behind her with a soft nibble somewhere more often than not it turned into a breathless circle of give and take that left them content in each others arms as they fell asleep with the morning sun warming their skin focus blurring ivy plucking at the itchy fabric of her lace shirt her thoughts returning to mia banshees were known for inciting trouble often hiring themselves in to a productive company and putting old friends at each others throats with a few wellplaced words of truth whereupon they would sit back and lap up the emotion while everything fell apart that they usually did this with the truth made it worse she loved kisten but to call it love when she took his blood that was savage need there could be no love there eyes dropping to the papers surrounding her she pushed at them as if pushing away her thoughts bringing her hand up to slide a finger between her neck and the collar of itchy lace ivy felt like a vamp wannabe dressed in tight jeans and a black stretchy shirt with a high collar of peekaboo lace and an open low neckline a pair of flat sandals finished the look it wasnt what she would have picked out for framing her partner for homicide but it was close to what sleeping beauty had on she had been here at the piano for hours having called in sick after meeting kisten for lunch blaming it on bad sushi kisten wasnt convinced putting art in jail by dumping piscarys mistake in his apartment was a good way to get promoted but ivy liked its inescapable justice going to the is would gain her nothing but their irritation for interfering true mr demere wouldnt be going to jail for murdering his wife but that didnt mean he was going to walk away from it shed take care of him later when he thought he had escaped unscathed it surprised her that she was enjoying herself she liked her job at the is working backward from where someone elses plan went wrong to catch stupid people making stupid decisions but plotting her own action to snare someone in her own net was more satisfying she was headed for management but shed never stopped to ask herself if it was something she wanted and so after she had discussed it with kisten he had reluctantly bought her car for cash and she had gone shopping with the untraceable money she had felt ignorant at the first charm outlet she had gone into but the man had become gratifyingly helpful once she showed him the money fingers cold from her melted shake ivy set the wet glass on a coaster and reached for the sleep amulet safe in its silk bag she had wanted a potion she could get art to drink or splash on him but the witch refused to sell it to her claiming it was too dangerous for a novice he had sold her an amulet that would do the same thing though and she felt the outlines of the redwood disk on its cord carefully through the bag satisfied it would work the man had cautioned her three times to be sure there was someone there to take it off her or shed sleep for two days before the charm spontaneously broke for safety reasons a second metallic amulet would give her the illusion of blond hair and take off about eight inches of height making her closer to the size and look of sleeping beauty she didnt know how witches in the is managed to make any money seeing as the two charms had cost as much as her car and she wondered if the witch had upped the price because she was a vampire she had been sitting here writing out contingencies for nearly two hours and she was growing stiff the is tower had cleared out by now and art was home he had called her cell phone shortly after sunset feeling her out as to what she was doing avoiding him and with her charms literally in her hand she had agreed to a date with him sunup his place agitated ivy clicked her pen open and shut imagining he had probably spent his time in the office talking himself up big as to his plans for tonight her eyes fell on the purple stains in her cuticles from breaking her pen earlier and she set it down a creak on the stairway brought her heart into her throat she hadnt told piscary what she was doing and only he or kisten would be coming up but then her eyes went to the windows and she berated herself piscary would never come up here so close to sunrise determined to keep her back to the stairs she hid her unease behind turning off the table lamp and shuffling her papers but she didnt think kisten was fooledhe was grinning from behind his reddish blond beard when she looked up eyebrows rising she sent her gaze across his shiny dress shoes up his pinstripe suit and to the tie he had loosened who are you trying to be she asked sharply rarely seeing him in a suit much less a tie sorry love he said using that british accent didnt mean to startle you he bent to slip a hand around her waist and give her a soft tug but she ignored him pretending to study her papers i dont like your accent she said releasing some of her tension in a bad mood she smelled someone on him and it made things worse and you didnt startle me i smelled you and some tart halfway up the stairs who was it that little blond thats been coming in here every payday to make black eyes at you shes early its only thursday fingers sliding from her kisten edged a step away eyes down he picked up a paper ivy it was low and coaxing and her jaw clenched im doing this ivy hes an undead with a soft sound he sat beside her on the piano bench if you make a mistaketheyre so damn strong when they get angry they dont even pretend to remember pity they both knew that all too well her pulse quickened but she kept her face impassive i wont make a mistake she said scratching a notation on her paper kisten took the pen from her and set it atop her papers all you have is a few witch charms and the element of surprise if he has any idea that you might betray him hes going knock you out and drain you and no one will say anything if you went down there looking to tag him even piscary ivy pulled her fingers from his as if unconcerned he wont kill me if he does ill sue his ass for unlawful termination clearly unhappy kisten opened the piano the light made shadows on him throwing his faint scars into sharp relief i dont want you to get hurt he said spreading his fingers to hit almost an entire octave but he made no sound and i dont want you dead you wont be any fun that way her eye twitched and she forced it to stop with pure will if things went right art would be really pissed if things went wrong art would be really pissed and in a position to hurt her i dont want to die either she admitted tucking her feet under the bench kisten struck a chord modifying it into a minor that sounded wrong as the echoes lifted through the brightening room she cursed herself for being so addicted to blood that it was such an overriding factor in her life mia had said all it took was practice to say no ivy had always scorned living vampires who abstained from blood thinking they were betraying everything they were now she found herself wondering if this was why they did it the eerie chord ended when kisten lifted his foot from the pedal and reached for the blue silk pouch careful ivy warned gripping his wrist its already invoked and will drop you quicker than tequila dark eyebrows high kisten said this and she let go what does it do hiding her nervousness ivy bent back over her paper it gets art off my neck he held it from the drawstring like it was a rat clearly he didnt like witch magic either its harmless she said giving up on her lastminute planning just bring sleeping beauty when you get my call kisten leaned backward touching the front pocket of his slacks ive got my phone its on vibrate call me call me a lot ivy allowed herself a smile setting the pen aside she stood gingerly wedging the amulet safe in its bag into a pocket kisten turned on the bench to keep her in view and she tucked a placebo vial of saltwater down her bustierenhanced cleavage the man at the charm outlet had insisted she take the vial since it could do doubleduty as a quick way to permanently break the sleep charm if she spilled it on the amulet the cool spot it made caused her to shift her shoulders until the glass warmed kisten was wearing a shitgrin when she brought her head up how do i look she asked posing smiling he drew her to him mmmm dressed to kill baby he said his breath warming her midriff since he was still sitting on the piano bench i like the shirt do you eyes closing she let the mingling of his scent with hers stir her bloodlust her hands ran aggressively through his hair and when his fingers traced the outlines of her buttocks and his lips moved just under her breast she wondered if finding love in blood might be worth the shame of having lied to herself of letting others tell her who she was and letting them make her into this ugly thing feeling the rise of indecision she pulled away ive got to go kistens face was creased in worry and as he ran a hand through his hair to straighten it she found herself wanting to arrange his tie or better yet rip it off him im going to change then ill be right behind you he said your wine is downstairs on the counter thanks she hefted her duffel bag with its change of clothes and hesitated she wanted to ask him if he thought it was possible to find love in sharing blood but shame stopped her sandals loud on the hardwood floor she walked to the stairs feeling as if she might never walk this floor again or that if she did shed be changed beyond recognition burn those papers for me she called and got an already ahead of you in return the restaurant had emptied of patrons and the soft chatter of the waitstaff was pleasant as she passed the bar music was cranked in the kitchen over the sounds of the oversized dishes being hand washed and everyone was enjoying the span between piscary becoming unavailable and quitting time like children left home alone they laughed and teased ivy liked this time the best often lying in bed and listening never telling anyone she could hear why the hell couldnt she join in why was everything so damn complicated for her grabbing a bottle of piscarys cheapest wine in passing she gave a highfive to the pizza delivery guy coming in the receiving dockgarage as she went out she couldnt help but notice that the kitchen atmosphere was radically different from the one she found in the is tower the office held pity the kitchen was sly anticipation shortly after opening this afternoon the entire staff knew there was a body in the refrigerator they also knew kisten was in a good mood and with her change in her work patterns they knew she was up to something maybe kisten had it right the wine went into the duffel bag which she then strapped to the back of her cycle swinging on to it she started it up eyes closing at the power beneath her as she put her helmet on waving to the second delivery guy pulling in she idled into the rush hour traffic it would soon slack off as humans took over cincinnati calling it theirs alone until noon when the earlyrising inderlanders began stirring ivy felt insulated in her helmet the wind tugging at her hair a familiar sensation she was alive free the smooth movement of the earth turning under her instilling a peace she couldnt readily find wishing she could just get on the interstate and go she sighed it would never happen her need for blood would follow her and without piscary providing protection as her master she would be taken by the first undead vampire she ran into there was no way out there never had been mias invitation surfaced and ivy tasted it in her thoughts trying it on before dismissing it as a slow pleasant way to suicide the sun was rising as she crossed the bridge into cincinnati she was late art would be either pissed or still glowing from the mensclub talk of the day the thought that she was a whore flitted through her before she quashed it she wasnt going to sell herself to move up the corporate ladder she could resist art long enough to knock him out and then shed nail his ass to the wall and use it to make a new ladder pulse quickening she took a sharp right weaving in and out of traffic until she reached fountain square the plaza was empty and she found a parking spot near the front of the belowground garage nervousness crept into her as she shut off her cycle a moment with a small mirror and a red lipstick and she was ready leaving her helmet on the seat she fumbled for her duffel bag and headed to the rectangle of light with more confidence than she felt there was no reason for her anxiety shed planned sufficiently a furtive glance to make sure no one was watching and she found the charmed silver that would change her appearance she pulled the tiny pin out of the watchsized amulet to invoke the disguise tossed the pin aside and laced the metallic amulet over her head this one didnt need to touch her skin just be on her person the witch had said it worked using her own auras energy but she really hadnt cared beyond what she needed to make it function properly an eerie feeling rippled over her and ivy shuddered her sandals grinding the street grit it wouldnt make her look like sleeping beautythat was illegal she had been primly toldbut with the clothing hair and attitude it would be close enough she squinted in the brighter light when she came out onto the sidewalk and headed for the bus stop witch magic was powerful shit and she wondered if no one realized the potential it had or if no one cared seeing as witches didnt try to govern anything but themselves quietly going about their business of blending with humanity the bus was pulling up as she got thereprecisely as she had timed itand she was the third one on dropping a token in before finding a seat and putting her duffel bag to prevent someone from sitting beside her she had a swipe card but using a token would add to her anonymity jostled she watched the city pass the professional buildings giving way to tall thin homes with dirt yards the size of a buick her clenched jaw eased when the yards got nicer and the paint jobs fresher as the house numbers rose by the time she reached arts block the saltrusted dented vehicles had been replaced by latemodel expensive cars she watched arts house pass waiting two blocks before signaling the driver she wanted off it wasnt a regular stop but he pulled over letting irate humans on their way to work pass him as she said thank you in a soft voice and disembarked she was walking before the door shut behind her free arm swinging she hit her heels hard to attract attention warming she shortened her pace to accommodate her smaller look the clipclack clipclack cadence was unnatural and she dropped her head as if not wanting to be seen when she heard a car start at arts house she hesitated pretending to check an address it was smaller than she expected though wellmaintained her parents had a modest mansion built with railroad money earned by her greatgrandfather the elaborate underground apartments added after her greatgrandmother had attracted piscarys attention art couldnt have much of a bedroom the footprint for the twostory house was only fiftybythirty swinging her duffel bag to her front she took the stairs with a series of prissy steps thirty years ago the house would have been low highclass and it was obvious why art needed the money his interest income when he died had been sufficient to keep him at low highclassof the seventies inflation was moving him down in the socioeconomic ladder he needed something to pull himself up before he slid into poverty over the next hundred years there was a note on the door smirking she pulled it from the screen and let it fall to the bushes for the forensics team to find late am i she muttered wondering if he had the front miked pitching her voice high she called art i brought wine can i come in there was no answer so she opened the door and entered a modest living room the curtains were drawn and a light was on for her she wandered into the spotless kitchen with a dry sink again there were leather curtains hidden behind a lightweight white fabric to disguise them leather curtains couldnt protect an undead vamp from the sun but boarding up the windows was against the city ordinances another note on an interior door invited her down her lip curled and she started to wish she had arranged this during night hours so she didnt have to play this disgusting game crumpling the note she dropped it on the faded linoleum she took off the charmed silver amulet shivering when something pulled through her aura her hair lost its corn yellow hue and she hung the amulet on the knob so kisten would know where she was knocking she opened the door to find a downward leading stair and music she wanted to be annoyed but hed done his research and it was something she likedmidnight jazz a patch of cream carpet met her glowing under soft lights gripping her duffel bag she called art shut the door he snarled from somewhere out of sight the sun is up ivy took three steps down and shut the door noting it was as thick as coffin wood and reinforced with steel with a metal crossbar to lock it there was a clock stuck to its back along with a page from the almanac a calendar and a mirror her mother had something similar again ivy wanted to belittle him but it looked professional and businesslike no pictures of sunsets or graveyards the only notation on the calendar about her was date with ivy no exclamation points no hearts no hubbahubba thank god she touched her pocket for the sleep amulet and looked down her cleavage for the fake potion relying on witch magic made her nervous she didnt like it didnt understand it she had had no idea witch magic was so versatile much less so powerful they had a nice little secret here and they protected it the same way vampires protected their strengths by having them out in the open and shackled by laws that meant nothing when push came to shove sandals loud on the wooden steps she descended watching arts shadow approach the landing the faint scent of bleach intruded growing stronger as she reached the floor she kept her face impassive when she found him glad he was still wearing his usual work clothes if he had been in a hugh hefner robe and holding a glass of vodka she would have screamed ignoring him watching her she looked over his belowground apartments they were plush and comfortable with low ceilings it was an old house and the city had strict guidelines about how much dirt you could pull out from under your dwelling they were in what was obviously the living room a woodpaneled hallway probably leading to a traditional bedroom her eyes went to the lit gas fireplace and she felt her eyebrows rise it dries the air out he said you dont think im going to romance you do you relieved she dropped her duffel bag by the couch hand on her hip she swung her hair glad it was back to its usual black art im here for one thing and after im done im cleaning up and leaving romance would ruin my entire image of you so why dont we just get it over with arts eyes flashed to black okay it was fast he moved reaching out and yanking her to him instinct got an arm between them as he pulled her to his chest her pulse pounded and she stared when he hesitated her naked fear striking a chord with him it was a drug to him and she knew he paused so as to prolong it she cursed herself when her own bloodlust rose heady and unstoppable she didnt want this she could say no her will was stronger than her instincts but her jaw tightened and he smiled to show his teeth when she felt her eyes dilate against her will lips parting she exhaled into it the savage desire to force her needs on him vibrated through every nerve mia was wrong there could be no love here no tenderness and when art forced her closer and ran his teeth gently across her neck she found herself tense with anticipation even as she tried to bring it under control concentrate ivy she thought her pulse quickening in her conflicting feelings she was here to nail his coffin not be nailed he knew she wouldnt say yes to him until he pulled her to the brink where bloodlust made her choices and even as she thought no she gripped his shoulder poised as he ran his hand down her hips and eased to the inside of her thighs searching a rumbling growl came from him shivering through her his hands became possessive demanding and she willed the feeling to grow even when selfloathing filled her how had it come on so fast she thought had she been wanting this all along teasing herself or was mia right in that she had refused art because giving in would prove she knew she could find love in the ugliness but was too cowardly to fight for it art carefully hooked a tooth into the lace of her collar and tore it the sound of the ripping fabric cutting through her his teeth grazed her promising and she lost all thought but how to get him to sink them to fill her with glorious feeling proving she was alive and could feel joy even if she paid for it with her selfrespect art didnt speak as he stood holding her against him the demanding pressure in his lips his fingers his very breathing waking every nerve in her he hadnt bespelled her he hadnt needed to she was willing to be everything he wanted and a tiny part of her screamed drowned out by her need to give to him and to feel in return even though she knew it was false his fingers rose from his grip upon her waist tracing upward with a firm insistence until they found her chin and tilted her head give this to me he whispered his fingers among her hair this is mine give ittome it was haggard almost torn by the need in him that her tortured willingness had sparked the thought that she was buying empty emotion rose like bubbles to pop against the top of her mind mia had said she could live above the bloodlust mia didnt know shit didnt know the exquisite pleasure of this she wanted his blood and he wanted hers what difference did it make how she would feel in the morning tomorrow she could be dead and it wouldnt matter and then she remembered the leashed hunger mia contained and counted it stronger than her own she remembered the scorn in mias voice calling her a whiny little girl who could have everything if she had the courage to live up to her greater need for love even if she did have to taint it with bloodlust ivys heart pounded as she tried to find the will to pull away but the lure of what he could fill her with was too strong she couldnt it was ingrained too deeply it was what she was but she wanted more damn it she wanted to escape the ugliness of what she really was as she struggled with herself she found arts mouth with her own drawing his lips from her neck and putting them on hers the salty electric taste of blood filled her but it wasnt hers art had cut his own lip sending her into a dizzy lust for the rest of him gasping she pushed away it would stop here she fell back fingers fumbling for the vial eyes black art gripped her wrist the tiny glass bottle exposed ivy flushed hot as she stood her arm stretched between them hunched from the pain of breaking from her art wiped his mouth of his blood he let go of her and she stumbled back in arts hand was the vial whats this he asked wary but amused when he unscrewed the top and sniffed at it nothing she said truly afraid even as her body ached at the interruption he sucked in her fear his eyes going blacker and his smile more predatory really panicking that he would drop it and come at her again she fumbled in her pocket bringing out the real charm invoked but quiescent in its silk pouch arts eyes went to it and before he could think she jumped at him arm moving in a quick arc art flung the contents of the vial at her heavy droplets warm from her body struck her like shocks from a whip adrenaline pounding to make her head hurt she forced her muscles to go slack she collapsed as if shed run into a wall falling to where he had been standing a second earlier the carpet burned her cheek and she exhaled as if passing out from across the room she heard him shift his feet against the carpet trying to figure out what had happened she forced her breathing to slow feigning unconsciousness it had to work if not she had only an instant to escape i knew youd try something art said going to the wet bar and pouring himself something the undead didnt need to drink but it would cleanse his cut lip not as clever as piscary said youd be he said amid the heavy clink of a bottle against glass did you really think i wouldnt have you followed on your shopping ivy clenched her stomach muscles when a dress shoe edged under her and flipped her over forcing herself to remain flaccid she kept her eyes lightly shut as her back hit the carpet he might bite her anyway but fear and desire tainted the blood with delicious compounds and hed rather have her awake heart pounding she loosened her fingers and let the pouch slip from them curiosity could put the cat in the bag when force could not im fortytwo years dead he said bitterly you dont survive that long if youre stupid there was a slight hesitation and then and what the hell was this supposed to do ivy heard him pick up the silk pouch and shake the amulet into his hand she tensed springing to her feet as he exhaled he was still standing his eyes losing their focus when she shot her hand out curling his slack fingers around the amulet before it could slip from him with a sigh he collapsed and she went down with him desperate to keep the amulet in his grip they hit the carpet together her arm wedged painfully under her you can survive that long if youre stupid and lucky she said and your lucks run out artie slowly ivy shifted her legs under her into a more comfortable position her hand still gripped around arts fingers hooking her foot in the handle of her duffel bag by the couch she dragged it closer with one hand she opened it to pull out a plasticcoated metallic zipstrip the is used to bind ley line witches to keep them from escaping by jumping to a ley line art couldnt use ley line magic but the strip would hold the amulet to him at the sound of the plastic ratcheting against itself to pinch the amulet between his palm and the strip she relaxed exhaling she got to her feet drawing her foot back she kicked him hard bastard she said wiping his spit off her neck limping she went to the stereo and clicked it off shed never be able to listen to skylark again she rummaged in her duffel bag and upon finding her phone headed for the stairs three steps from the top and she had enough bars she hit speeddial one struggling to listen and take off her disgusting shirt simultaneously ivy came kistens voice and she pinched the phone between her shoulder and her ear hes down bring her in she said without waiting for an answer she ended the call adrenaline making her jumpy shaking she stripped off her clothes and slipped into her leather pants and a stretchknit shirt wiping her neck free of arts scent with a disposable towelette that then went into the contractor garbage bag she shook out with the sharp crack of thick plastic she considered the lacy shirt for an instant then dropped it in too her sandals went into her duffel bag barefoot she crouched by art lifting his lips from his gums she sucked up blood and saliva with a disposable eyedropper putting a good quarter inch into the empty saltwater vial done she opened the wine sat on the raised hearth and with the hissing flames warming her back took a long pull it was bitter and she grimaced taking another drink smaller this time anything to get rid of the lingering taste of arts blood in her mouth toes digging into the carpet she looked at art out cold and helpless witch magic had done it god they could be a serious threat in inderland politics if they put their mind to it the sound of feet upstairs brought her straight and she set the bottle aside it was kisten thumping down the stairs with a large cardboard box in his arms ivy looked then looked again he had changed into an institutional gray jumpsuit but that wasnt it youre wearing the charm she said and he flushed from under his new blond bangs he was shorter too and she didnt like it i always wanted to know what id look like blond he said and it will help with the repairman image grunting he set down the box with sleeping beauty in it god almighty he swore as he stretched his back and looked at art with the amulet strapped to his palm it smells like a cheap hotel down here all blood and bleach did he wing you no ivy handed him the bottle unwilling to admit how close art had come kistens adams apple bobbed as he drank and he exhaled loudly as he lowered the bottle his eyes were bright and his smile was wide just one big joke to kisten ivy thought depressed she had acted just in time if she hadnt dropped art she would have said yes to himeven when she hadnt wanted to mia was right she needed more practice where do you want to put her kisten said cheerfully a shrug lifted her shoulders the bathtub clearly enjoying himself he lifted the box and headed into the paneled hallway holy christ he shouted faint from the wall between them have you seen his bathroom tired ivy rose from the hearth trying not to look at art sprawled on the floor no im going to put her in the hot tub hes got a hot tub that would explain the scent of chlorine and ivy went to see her eyebrows rising at the small tub flush with the floor kisten had turned it on and though it wasnt warm yet tiny bubbles swirled in the artificial current putting sleeping beauty in that was going to make a mess but it would help remove any traces of piscary and blur that she had been stuck in the refrigerator for a day not to mention a dripping wet corpse was harder to get rid of than a dry one art wasnt smart enough to manage it before the is knocked on his door kisten had gone respectfully silent and keeping the woman in the box they worked at getting her out of the plastic and duct tape jaw clenched ivy worked her out of her clothes handing them to kisten one by one to be sprayed with the deenzyme solution from the bar to remove piscarys scent the bottle was heavy as it hit ivys palm and with kistens help they sprayed her down as well taking extra care with the open wounds disturbed she met kistens eyes in the silence and together they slipped sleeping beauty into the water wedging the corpse between an edge and the railing while kisten tidied ivy went back for the wine and a glass carefully keeping her prints off it ivy pressed sleeping beautys hand around the glass several times before adding a few lip prints she dribbled some wine into the womans mouth then the glass which she set at arms length there wouldnt be any in her stomach and there wouldnt be any of her blood in arts system either but it was a game of perception not absolutes besides all she needed to do was eliminate any evidence of piscary kisten had the vial of arts spit and crouching by the tub she took a sterile swab and ran it through the womans open wounds finished she stood and together they looked down at her she had a nice smile kisten finally said gaze flicking to ivy you okay with this no im not okay with this ivy said feeling empty but shes dead isnt she we cant hurt her anymore kisten hesitated then grabbed the box and maneuvered his way out ivy picked up the heavyduty shears he had left and tucked them behind her waistband looking at the woman she crouched to brush the long hair from the corpses closed eyes an impulsive thank you slipped from ivys lips and flustered she stood sickened she backed out of the room this was ugly she was ugly the things she did were ugly and she didnt want to do them anymore her stomach was cramping when she found kisten standing above art and she forced herself to look tall and unbothered the brokendown box and plastic wrap were already in the trash bag along with everything else you sure you dont want me to move him upstairs he asked they might call it a suicide ivy shook her head checking the bottom of the womans shoes and setting them by the stairway everyones going to know what i did but as long as there is no easy evidence theyll let it go as me thinking outside the box no one likes him anyway but if i kill him theyll have to do a more thorough investigation it was perfect in so many ways art would be cited for piscarys homicide and end up in jail she would get to write her own sixmonth review no one would mess with her for a while not wanting a dead body showing up in their bathroom she was a force not to be taken lightly the thought didnt make her as happy as she thought it would kisten seemed to notice since he touched her arm to bring her eyes to his she blinked at the color of his hair and the fact that he was shorter than she even if it was an illusion it was a damn good illusion you did all right he said piscary will be impressed she hid her face by leaning to scoop up the duct tape that piscary would be proud of her lacked the expected thrill too for a moment only the sound of the tape being unwound and wrapped about arts wrists and ankles rose over the hiss of the propane fireplace the tape wouldnt stop him but all they needed was to get to the stairs ready ivy asked when she tossed the tape into her duffel bag and took out her boots kisten turned from his lastminute wipe down of fingerprints all set as she sat on the hearth and laced her boots ivy looked over the room the scent of chlorine was growing stronger as the water warmed hiding the odor of dead girl she wanted a moment with art why the hell not shed earned a little gloating let him know she caught him covering up a murder wait for me in the van she said ill be right there kisten grinned clearly not surprised two minutes he said any longer than that and youre playing with him she snorted giving him a swat on the ass as he started up the stairs with her duffel bag and the trash his blond hair caught the light and she watched until he vanished in a flash of morning sun still she waited until the faint sound of the van starting up met her before she turned arts hand palm up and cut the strip with the shears tucking them behind her waistband she stepped back and teased the amulet off his hand and into its little bag for a panicked moment she thought she had killed him but her fear must have scented the air since art jerked his eyes black when they focused on her he tried to move his attention going to the duct tape about his wrists and ankles chuckling he wedged himself into an upright position against the couch and ivys face burned piscary thinks so much of you he said condescendingly he needs to wipe the sand from his eyes and see you as the little girl you are playing with boys too big for her he tensed his arms and ivy forced herself to stay relaxed but the tape held and she bent at the waist to look him in the eyes you okay this isnt winning you any friends but yes im okay satisfied she hadnt hurt him she rose and plucked up the wine bottle and gave it another pull the heat of the fire warming her legs youve been a bad boy art she said hip cocked he ran his eyes over her going still when he realized she was wearing her usual leather and spandex his face abruptly lost its emotion why is my hot tub going what day is this who was here again he pulled against the tape starting a rip ivy set the bottle down and moved closer sending her wine breath over him to shift his silky black curls it didnt matter if her presence was placed here the entire is tower knew where she was this morning im not happy she said i came over here to make good on our arrangement and i find another girl down here art shifted his shoulders arms bulging what the hell did you do ivy smiling she leaned over him its not what i did artie its what i found you need to be more careful with your cookies youre leaving crumbs all over your house this isnt funny he snarled and ivy moved to the stairway no it isnt she said knowing that the tape would last as long as his ignorance you have a dead girl in your hot tub artie and im out of here the deal is off i dont need your approval to move into the arcane division youre going to jail adrenaline struck through her when she turned her back and her foot touched the lowest stair the door was open and ambient sunlight was leaking in he couldnt put one foot on them without risking death she almost hoped he would ivy art exclaimed and she turned at the sound of ripping tape pulse pounding she hesitated she was safe it was done you made one mistake art she said taking in his anger you shouldnt have tried to use me to cover up that witchs murder she said and the color drained from him that pissed me off giving him a bunnyeared kisskiss she turned and took the stairs with a slow taunting pace this isnt going to work ivy he shouted and her pulse leaped at the sound of the tape ripping but she had reached the top and it was far too late she smiled as she emerged into his kitchen he was stuck down there with that corpse until the sun went down if he called in help to get it out it would damn him faster an anonymous tip from a concerned neighbor was going to bring someone knocking on his door within thirty minutes no hard feelings art she said strictly business she went to shut the door so he wouldnt get light sick hesitating really she added closing the door on his scream of outrage scooping up her duffel bag from where kisten had left it she sauntered out the front door and down the steep walk to the street kisten was waiting and she slipped into the passengerside seat throwing her bag into the back she imagined the fury belowground glad she could walk away it didnt matter if anyone saw her leave she was supposed to be here two minutes on the nose kisten said leaning over to give her a kiss he was still wearing her disguise amulet and she caught him looking at himself and his hair are you okay love he asked hitting his new accent hard and fussing with his bangs rolling down the window she put her arm on the sill as he drove away and the sun hit her the memory of being unable to say no to art resounded in her and the lure of the bloodlust saying no had been impossible but she had stopped himand herself it had been hard but she felt good in a melancholy way it wasnt the glorious shock of ecstasy but more like a sunbeam unnoticed when you first find it but its warmth growing until you feltgood im all right she said squinting from the morning sun i like who i am today ivy dropped the empty box on her desk and sat before it swiveling her chair back and forth until someone walked past her open door adopting a more businesslike mien she looked over her office her eyebrows rose and she plucked her favorite pen from the cup and then tossed the empty box into the hall the thump silenced the gossip and she smirked they could have everything all she wanted was her favorite pen well and a pair of thicker leather pants and an updated map of the city a computer would be helpful but they wouldnt let her take the one shed been using some really comfortable boots sunglassesmirror sunglasses a soft knuckleknock at her open door brought her head around and she smiled without showing her teeth rat she said companionably come to see me off the large officer eased into her office a manila folder in his hand i won the pool he said ducking his head ive got your ah transfer papers how you doing depends she leaned across her desk biting her finger coyly whats the word on the street he laughed youre bad no one will be looking at you for a while brow pinching he came in another step you sure you dont want to work arcane its not too late ivys pulse quickened at the lure of bloodlust she knew she couldnt resist i dont want to work in the arcane anymore she said eyes lowered i need to get out from underground spend some time in the sun the officer slumped the folder before him like a fig leaf youre ticking them off with this rebellious shit this isnt piscarys camarilla its a business they had a late meeting about you this morning in the lowest floor fear slid through her quickly stifled they cant fire me there was no evidence that i had anything to do with that girl in arts tub no youre clear and remind me to stay on your good side he grinned but it faded fast you did contaminate that crime scene and theyre almost ignoring that you should lay low for a while do what they want you to do you have your entire life and afterlife ahead of you dont screw it up your first six months here ivy grimaced flicking her attention past him to the outer offices theyre already blaming my demotion on mylapse they cant punish me twice for the same thing the reality was she was being demoted because she refused to move up to the arcane that was fine by her publicly he said making her agitated what happens behind closed doors is something else youre making a mistake he insisted they can use your talents down there dont you mean a new infusion rat winced and she held up a hand and leaned back into her chair well aware it put her in a position of power with him standing whatever i wont be manipulated rat id rather take a pay cut and go where i dont have to worry about it for a while if only it was that easy rat dropped the folder on her desk as if it meant something ah i thought youd like to see your new partners file in a smooth alarmed motion ivy sat up whoa put your caps on i agreed to move upstairs but no one said anything about a partner rat shrugged his wide shoulders bunching his uniform they cant give you a pay cut so youre pulling double duty chaperoning a newbie for a year intern with two years of social science and three years pulling familiars out of trees management wants her under someone with a more ah textbook technique before they instate her as a runner so shes all yours ivy dont let her get you killed we like you juuuust the way you are the last was said with dripping sarcasm and her face hot ivy pushed the folder away shes not even a full runner ive worked too hard for my degree to be a babysitter no way rat chuckled and pushed it back with a single thickknuckled finger yes way unless you want to move down to arcane where you belong ivy almost growled she hated her mother she hated piscary no she hated their control over her slowly she pulled the folder to her and opened it oh my god she breathed as she looked at the picture thinking it couldnt get any worse a witch they partnered me with a witch whose brightass idea was that rat laughed pulling ivys eyes from her partners picture slumping back she tried not to frown though it was clearly meant to be a punishment this might not be a bad thing a witch wouldnt be after her blood and the relief of not having to fight that would be enough to compensate for the extra work that having such a weak partner would engender a witch they were laughing at her the entire tower was laughing at her you said management doesnt want her on her own whats wrong with her she asked and rat took her shoulder in a thick hand and drew her reluctantly to her feet nothing he said grinning shes impulsive is all its a match made in heaven ivy youll be best friends before the week is out going shopping eating chocolate catching chickflicks after work youll love it trust me ivy realized she was clenching her jaw and she forced her teeth apart before she gave herself a headache her partner was a flake she was partnered with a girlygirl flake who wanted to be a runner this was going to be pure hell rat laughed and seeing no other option ivy dragged the folder to her tucked it under her arm and headed for the door with rat leaving her old office and its comforting walls behind for an open office with pressboard walls and bad coffee it was only

the claire switch project lynsay sands a bunny the disgust john heathcliffe poured into those two words made claire beckett roll her eyes as she rinsed out and refilled the water bottle from the rabbit cage he wasnt finished with his bitching however and continued i dont know why we cant you do know why john kyle lockhart countered with what claire considered the patience of a saint he didnt raise his head from the report he was reading but added because we have to follow safety procedures we test it on animals to ensure that its safe before we let it anywhere near humans claire glanced toward john as she moved back to the rabbit cage noting the irritation that flashed across his face john apparently didnt appreciate kyles patience but then she suspected there was little john appreciated about kyle claire knew he resented dr cohen putting kyle in charge of the lab john felt it should have been he both men were in the last stage of attaining their doctorates and it made their relationship somewhat competitive at least on johns part kyle didnt seem to have the same issues but then he was the one in charge weve already tested it on a dozen mice and rats and now three bunnies john pointed out impatiently as claire reset the water bottle in the rabbit cage yes kyle agreed this time he did glance up from the reports as he added pointedly and the first couple of those animals ended up a puddle of mush john waved that away as unimportant only the first few and that was because we were giving them too much juice we fixed that we now know the amount needed per pound we we are testing it on the rabbit john kyle said firmly and then well test it on a bigger animal like a yes yes the other man said impatiently well test it on half a dozen bunnies then half a dozen cats and then another half a dozen dogs and then monkeys and then and then and thenill be an old man before we test it on an actual human if im still alive he said with disgust what use is it testing it on these animals anyway they cant tell us what its like they dont understand what weve done to them and they cant follow commands and try to change they they can tell us if its safe by surviving the procedure kyle countered shortly they can tell us what damageif anythe procedure does to them physically by our following and testing them over the years years john muttered stupid safe science yeah kyle said dryly as he closed the file and got to his feet sucks huh claire bit her lip to keep from laughing and raised her eyebrows in question as kyle turned his sky blue eyes her way claire i need to go give dr cohen the latest test results of our subjects would you mind getting thumper out of his cage and strapping him into place while im gone well start when i get back yes kyle claire turned back to the cage as he headed out of the lab but her eyes immediately found him in the rectangular mirror on the wall over the cage her gaze dropped over kyle in his long white smock he looked so sexy in the smock she wouldnt mind playing doctorpatient with him she thought then her eyes moved to her own reflection and she sighed as she took in the familiar features under the mop of red hair she had scraped back into a ponytail shed been told she was pretty more than a time or two in her life and had a certain amount of confidence in her looks but they didnt seem to matter to kyle he treated her more like a buddy or kid sister than a woman yes kyle john mimicked nastily thank you kyle bend me over the counter and you are such a jerk sometimes john claire interrupted as she reopened the rabbit cage she managed to use bored tones despite her irritation and embarrassment if the man knew he was getting to her hed be like a dog with a bone she knew that from experience john had become increasingly rude since shed refused his invitation to dinner two months ago hed decided her refusal was because she had the hots for kyle which was true but claire had no idea how he knew that come on thumper she cooed scooping the white rabbit out of the cage theres nothing to be scared of right john agreed as he moved to the panel that controlled the destabilizer were just going to zap you with a molecular destabilizer that will turn you into a puddle of goo claire glared at his back as she closed the cage door then turned her attention to thumper petting the rabbit soothingly she said dont listen to him that hasnt happened for a long time not since we figured out we were using too much juice youll be fine claire continued to whisper soothing nonsense to the rabbit as she carried him into the experiment chamber it was a small room built in the center of the wide back wall of the lab the chamber was only ten feet square its front and side walls made of protective glass to allow viewing this was where the molecular destabilizer waited it looked like nothing more interesting than an xray machine but it wasnt photons of electromagnetic interference that this machine shot out the automatic door shushed open for claire then closed behind her with the same soft sound as she carried thumper to the table under the destabilizer setting the rabbit on the surface she began to strap him down for some reason this part of her job always bothered claire she didnt like strapping the animals down of course they always panicked and began to struggle at this point but she couldnt blame them she wouldnt like to be strapped down either then too they were probably picking up on some of her nervousness as she worked claire found her eyes flickering nervously up to the funnelshaped projector the destabilizer beam came out of she was always nervous around the thing afraid it would suddenly start spitting its beam at her which of course it couldnt do someone would have to turn it on for that to happen that thought made claire glance over her shoulder and through the glass to the control panel john was there frowning and muttering to himself as he worked out the necessary calculations for the proper amount of power to use with thumper it was a very weightspecific process needing a specific amount of power per pound of the animal too little and nothing would happen too much andbut that had only happened with the first couple of trials sighing she turned back to thumper and continued fixing the straps making sure they were firmly in place but not so tight theyd harm him despite her reservations about working so close to the destabilizer itself claire enjoyed her job this was an exciting field to work in this experiment on the cutting edge they had used research on chameleons as well as various changes natural in nature such as gas turning into liquid when under pressure and liquid to solid when cold putting it all together they had created their destabilizer hoping that it would bring about cellular changes that would allow other animals to effect tonal changes that could act as camouflage in effect creating a chameleon rabbit or a chameleon mouse rat dog andeventuallya chameleon human finished with thumper claire turned to head out of the room pausing when johns voice came over the intercom claire thumper isnt aligned under the projector go back and fix it frowning she turned and moved back to the table to peer at the rabbit he looked to be in the right position to her are you sure claire asked knowing john would hear her through the open intercom he looks right from here the camera is only showing his lower half she could hear the irritation in his voice maybe its the camera thats off kilter claire glanced up peering at the destabilizer itself the camera is on the far side of the projector john announced take a look at it for me will you claire frowned as far as she could see there was no way to get to the far side of the projector without crawling over the table the table slides back he said helpfully just slide the table backward then crawl under the projector and look up on the other side for a small camera it should be aligned with the projector if it isnt ill need kyle to pick up some special tools on his way back from dr cohens office so i can adjust it she pushed gently on the table thumper was strapped to as john had said it slid easily backward leaving the floor under the destabilizer clear claire stared at the space reluctant to fill it she really didnt like the idea of climbing right under the projector it would put her in the direct path of the destabilizing beam which is perfectly safe so long as it isnt on she assured herself hello im waiting here john said testily sighing claire dropped to her knees and crawled into the space where the table had been once under the projector she raised her head and peered up claire spotted the camera at once but it didnt look out of line to her it looks fine she said with a frown it the words died in her throat as a white beam suddenly shot out of the destabilizers projector it hit her with a jolt and claire suddenly found herself unable to move or even scream it felt exactly what she imagined being hit by lightning would be like a quick crack of agony shot through her hitting seemingly every nerve ending then she went numb and unconsciousness claimed her claire the voice sounded urgent and upset but it took a moment before claire could move or open her eyes in response when she did it was to find herself staring up at kyle lockhart his blond hair was endearingly tousled something shed rarely seen since high school his sky blue eyes were crinkled with concern and his mouth a firm line in his chiseled face kyle claire breathed oh thank god he closed his eyes briefly then opened them just as quickly and straightened come on lets get you up claire peered around as kyle helped her to her feet they were still in the experiment chamber but by the front wall as far from the molecular destabilizer as possible the white beam that had shot such teethjarring pain into her was still pouring from the projector this way kyle began to usher her to the door but claire glanced back toward the beam and frowned as she recalled what had happened the destabilizer went off somehow while i was checking the camera claire said as he urged her out of the room she shuddered at the recollection of the beam jolting through her body john is the somehow kyle said grimly john claire asked sharply as he led her to a lab chair and eased her into it you mean he deliberately zapped me yeah the bastard was determined to try his human trials and must have decided you would be the test subject the jerk kyle placed a hand on her forehead and used his thumb to pull one eyelid up he peered into her eye for a moment then shifted his hand to the other side to repeat the process your eyes are a little dilated he said with a frown hows your vision fine claire assured him the moment he removed his hand from her forehead she turned her head to glance toward the control panel looking for john the darkhaired man was out cold on the floor in front of the machine what happened to him she asked more out of curiosity than any real concern it was hard to feel concern for the man after what hed done i knocked him out kyle muttered as he took her pulse claires eyes shot to his face in surprise john was six feet tall and handsome in his own way but he had the body of a scientist long and lean he also had the studious nature of a scientist and wasnt the kind of guy who ran around getting into fights kyle shrugged uncomfortably under her startled glance i came back in and saw what he was doing and punched him he said almost apologetically then i ran in to the experiment chamber to pull you out from under the beam you punched him claire asked still marveling over the fact it was justinstinct kyle explained with embarrassment i wasupset oh claire said huskily thank you kyle shrugged and avoided her eyes by staring at his watch as he took her pulse but then his lips twisted with displeasure and he said its my fault i should have realized john would try a stunt like that hes been crabbing about the animal trials from the start and insisting we need to do human trials its not your fault claire said quickly ive heard all his complaining but didnt expect him to pull a stunt like this either kyle nodded but she could tell he still felt responsible your pulse is a little fast but not alarmingly so he straightened and peered at her how do you feel claire paused and considered she felt a little shaky but then shed been knocked out by the beam other than that however she felt pretty much normal i feel fine claire said at last i dont feel different or anything kyle hesitated his gaze moving around the lab then asked do you think youre up to walking when claire nodded he urged her back to her feet come on then this has been more than enough for the day lets get out of here claire couldnt have agreed more she felt fine but didnt want to stay in the lab and she definitely didnt want to be there when john woke up if he said a single word to her claire might be tempted to commit bodily harm on the jerk he could have killed her with that stunt kyle took her arm eyeing her closely he was just opening the door when claire suddenly recalled the poor rabbit still strapped to the table in the experiment chamber wait she paused and turned back what about thumper oh kyle glanced toward the glasswalled room after a hesitation he said wait here and hurried over to the control panel to switch off the destabilizer then continued on to the small room claire watched him unstrap the animal smiling as she saw his lips moving as he petted and soothed the rabbit like herself kyle tended to murmur and coo nonsense to the lab animals and she knew he got just as distressed when something went wrong it was only john who treated them like blocks of wood thoughts of the other man drew her attention to his unconscious form and she scowled john heathcliffe had done some rotten things in the time shed known him but today had taken the cake it wasnt just that she could have been killed but who knew what effects the destabilizer could have on her the door to the experiment chamber opened with a soft swish and claire glanced over relieved to be distracted from her thoughts kyle was quick about putting thumper in his cage and then he hurried to join her at the door what are we going to do about him claire asked nodding toward johns still form leave him id call security but kyle hesitated then admitted im worried about dr cohens reaction if he learns you were exposed to the molecular destabilizer it was all he had to say if anyone found out claire could expect to be kept here in the lab in her very own cagethough it would probably be a sterile white room rather than an actual cage she would be subjected to hundreds of tests and asked a million questions every day to see just how her mind had been affected by exposure to the destabilizer no thank you claire didnt know what effect her exposure would have on her but no matter what it was shed rather not be locked up while it happened you dont think john will tell she asked anxiously and risk being banned from the scientific community kyle asked with a snort not to mention being arrested for assault because thats what it was he shook his head no hell keep his mouth shut relief soaking through her claire nodded and allowed kyle to take her arm and lead her out of the lab they didnt run into anyone on the way down to the parking garage claire was so unsettled by the whole experience that they were in kyles car before she remembered her own vehicle what about my car claire asked as kyle started the engine of his little red car pausing he glanced in the direction of her parking spot a small frown playing about his lips then he shook his head i dont think its a good idea for you to be driving just now in fact i dont want you to be alone i was planning on taking you home with me so i could keep an eye on you for at least tonight preferably the weekend but if nothing happens and you continue to seem fine ill bring you by to pick up your car tomorrow morning when she nodded her agreement kyle added fortunately its friday so youll have the weekend to recover before we have to decide whatif anythingto tell dr cohen about this i thought we didnt want him to know claire asked with a frown i mean if nothing has happened i dont want john to get away with this kyle said solemnly we could tell dr cohen that he tried to turn the destabilizer on you and i arrived as he did it and knocked him out that you managed to throw yourself out of the way when you heard it power up claire blinked with a sudden realization what is it kyle asked i didnt hear it power up she said slowly perplexed by the fact usually the soft hum started while she strapped down the animal then built to a highpitched whine as she left the room he must have powered it up before you went in kyle said thoughtfully and his expression became even more forbidding the bastard must have planned to try this all along he was just waiting for a time when i was out of the lab kyle cursed i never should have claire placed her hand over his on the steering wheel and patted him soothingly you couldnt know its fine lets just go blowing his breath out kyle nodded and shifted the car into gear then backed out of his parking spot youre okay with staying over tonight kyle asked once they were out of the parking garage yes claire nodded to tell you the truth if somethings going to happen id rather not be alone kyle gave a nod and fell silent leaving claire to worry over what might result from the experiment nothing much had appeared to happen yet to the animals theyd tested it on if put in front of a white background some of them lightened in color like a chameleon taking on its surroundings but it didnt happen to all the animals and it didnt happen regularly this didnt seem to bother kyle claire supposed he was just happy it happened at all as john had pointed out the animals didnt understand what was done to them so simply might not be using their full abilities she did understand however and supposed that was why john had broken all the rules and exposed her to the destabilizer claire peered down at her hands the only part of her body that wasnt covered by clothing and that she could see at the moment she stared at where they rested in her lap but they looked the same as always to her her skin wasnt suddenly lightening to match the white smock she wore for a moment she considered trying to make them lighten but then changed her mind she was almost afraid to find her exposure had had some effect here we are claire glanced up and felt herself relax they were pulling into the driveway of the home kyle shared with his twin sister jill it was an old victorian house on the edge of the city their childhood home kyle and jill had inherited it jointly when their parents died in a car accident some years back the twins got along well enough that theyd decided to live there together until one of them married at which point theyd either sell the house and split the profits or one of them would buy the other out claire had been in the charming old house many times over the years she and jill had been best friends since grade school claire had slept over countless times as a teenager and still did it was a second home to her and she wasnt surprised to feel relief ease through her as kyle parked the car in the drive jills home early kyle commented with a frown i wonder whats up claire shook her head her eyebrows drawing together with concern after the accident that had taken their parents lives kyle had taken his half of their parents insurance money and invested it jill had used her half to purchase a little clothing store downtown it was doing well mostly because jill was a very dedicated store owner willing to put in long hours to make it work she usually started early and worked late her being home in the middle of the day was unusual kyle slid out of the car and started around to her side but claire opened the door and stepped out before he could get there to open it for her she smiled faintly as he took her arm to walk her to the door noting the worry still visible in his eyes as he peered her way his concern was sweetand encouraging to claire shed had a crush on him all through high school it had blossomed into something more since shed started working with him unfortunately despite jills assertions to the contrary claire suspected he thought of her as nothing more than a buddy and coworker she wished it was otherwise jill kyle called out as they entered the house kyle jills voice came from the living room her tone suggested she was just as surprised at his arrival home in the middle of the day as they had been to know she was here yeah are you okay kyle led claire up the hall you arent sick or something are you or something claire frowned at the weariness evident in jills voice as they entered the living room she stepped around kyle and peered at her friend jill sat balled up in a corner of the couch her shoulders slumped and posture dejected she was pale her eyes redrimmed and she held a freshly opened container of ice creamalways a bad sign whats wrong claire asked with concern as she moved to sit beside her on the couch what are you doing here jill asked with surprise never mind that claire said tell us whats wrong nothing jill said then sighed and admitted actually i just got dumped what claire asked with amazement jill had been seeing a store owner named ted leacock for the last six months claire knew her friend had thought it was the real deal that shed found the man she would marry and raise babies with yeah jill held up the container of ben jerrys ice cream so i came home for lunch oh honey claire hugged her with sympathy jill shrugged plenty of good men out there and right now ben and jerry are being very sympathetic kyle shifted and claire glanced his way to see a myriad of emotions cross his face anger for his sister a frown of concern then discomfort well he said finally you cant just eat ice cream jill ill see about lunch claire watched him leave the room then glanced back to jill as the blond slid a spoonful of ice cream into her mouth im sorry jill she said quietly jill shrugged better now than later youre too good for him anyway i thought you liked him jill asked with a frown i did he seemed nice claire said quickly though he obviously had bad taste if he broke up with youand you deserve a guy with good taste a super guy super guy huh jill smiled briefly then sighed he wasnt as nice as we thought anyway it seems i wasnt the only woman he was dating what claire asked with surprise then understanding crossed her face all those late nights working yeah it seems he was working on a couple of other girls trying to decide who would be the winner in the teds wife lotto i apparently made it to the final two but the other finalist won out what claire repeated with amazement jill grimaced it was apparently close so close in fact that he couldnt bring himself to break the news to me until now a week before the wedding to the winner claire opened her mouth but jill forestalled her with please dont say what again claire closed her mouth frowned then shook her head but you two went away last weekend yes and have been sleeping together for the last four of the six months weve been dating jill grimaced i guess i should be glad i wasnt the winner who needs a jerk like that for a husband claire nodded hell never be faithful oh honey i am sorry she gave her another hug i guess ill have to go to the grocery store kyle announced coming back into the living room well need lunch and supper i thought you two were going to the school reunion tonight claire reminded him peering over jills shoulder she had decided not to go herself but the twins had planned to attend and claire was sure that getting out would be the best thing for her friend jill snorted at the idea like im going to the reunion without a man on my arm you have got to be kidding magda would spend the entire night insulting methe bitch she added on a sniff and id rather not leave you alone kyle said he was speaking to claire but his concerned gaze was bouncing between her and his sister i need to keep an eye on you for at least twentyfour hours though the whole weekend would be better jill stiffened in claires arms then pulled back to peer at her why whats happened claire merely grimaced while kyle said john zapped her with the destabilizer what claire winced at the shriek as jill peered from her to kyle and asked how was it an accident no kyle said grimly youre kidding jill looked outraged she was one of the very few people privy to their experiments and what they entailed how sighing claire shook her head i had strapped in the bunny and started out of the room but he sent me back to check on the camera he said it was offline and told me how to move the table so i could kneel under it and check the camera alignment once i was there zap she finished with a shrug so thats how he did it kyle murmured and she realized he hadnt known how john had got her under the camera and therefore under the beam the toad jill said with disgust tossing the ice cream carton on the coffee table yeah claire sighed really it was unconscionable she could have been killed and was just lucky kyle had got her out before any damage was done dangerous toad kyle said grimly he was tired of running trials and decided to speed the experiment along ben jerryand even tedbriefly forgotten jill caught claire by the arms and looked her over as if expecting to find her glowing green and falling to pieces are you okay im fine claire assured her firmly really i dont feel bad at all well you arent suddenly turning the same color as the couch or anything jill murmured eyes narrowed claire glanced toward the paisley couch and muttered thank god still kyles right we cant leave you alone this weekend jill said firmly claire shrugged uncomfortable with all the concern although im not going to be any fun tonight jill added with a grimace then brightened her expression that of someone whos just had an idea you two could go to the reunion together though that way kyle could go and still keep an eye on you claire flushed knowing jill was playing matchmaker her friend had known about claires crush on kyle for years and thought they would be perfect together as far as jill was concerned the only thing keeping them apart was their own shyness claire didnt doubt for a minute that jill was trying to push them together and while she appreciated it one glance at kyles reluctant expression told her it wasnt working well im not certain its a good idea to take claire anywhere until were sure shes okay kyle said slowly turning he moved back up the hall toward the front door saying keep an eye on her while i go to the grocery store okay jill i wont take my eyes off her jill promised he is so not interested in me claire bemoaned as the door closed behind kyle yes he is jill said with exasperation ive been telling you that since we were all twelve hes crazy about you claire yeah right she snorted thats why he jumped at the chance to go to the reunion with me tonight jill tsked with disgust and snapped the lid back on the container of ben jerrys you two are so pathetic honestly youve adored him for years and hes been following you with calf eyes just as long yet neither of you has the balls to do anything about it when he comes back you should just follow him into his room jump his bones and get it over with i bet the two of you wouldnt surface until mondayif then claire imagined what would happen if she followed jills advice she imagined kyle coming home putting away the groceries in the kitchen then going to his room for something she would follow close the door thenthen then what did she throw off her clothes and wait for him to do something the only problem was hed likely assume her behavior was a result of being subjected to the destabilizer then hed start checking her pulse and such what if she just walked in closed the door then kissed him claire bit her lip at the idea hed probably blame that on the destabilizer too hed think her brain had been destabilized by the exposure blowing her breath out on a sigh she shook her head if he were interested hed have done something about it like you have jill asked archly taking the ice cream with her as she stood up what makes you think hes any less shy than you are besides hes in a much more delicate spot than you hes your supervisor at the lab asking you out could be considered sexual harassment claire frowned over that as jill carried the ice cream out to the kitchen shed appreciated kyle getting her the job at the lab while hed gotten his bachelor of science and continued on for his masters and doctorate claireto avoid costing her parents too much moneyhad stopped with her bachelors since then shed taken courses toward her own masters at night while bouncing from contract position to contract position during the day to support herself and her further education then last year kyle had gotten her a job in the lab where he was interning under dr cohen at the end of this year she would have her masters and kyle his doctorate now jills comment made claire wonder if she should have taken the position in the lab after all the mails here god they deliver later and later all the time claire glanced toward jill as she returned to the living room carrying a stack of mail bill bill bill jill muttered leafing through the envelopes she paused at a magazine stared at the cover then heaved a depressed sigh i bet ted would have picked me for his wife if i looked like her youre better off without him claire murmured yeah but if i looked like her i probably would have been the dumper rather than the dumpee she pointed out dropping the magazine on the coffee table its always better to be the dumper claire peered down at the magazine noting who was on the cover brooke jordan one of the worlds most popularnot to mention successfulmodels tall leggy slim and gorgeous the woman exuded both beauty and sex appeal in megawatts men all over the world would kill to be with her and women all over the world would kill to be her apparently that included jill and me claire acknowledged to herself then said aloud well i wish we both looked like her then you could dump ted and maybe i could get kyle i bet he wouldnt be so shy if i looked like her jill made a clucking sound and propped her hands on her hips as she glared down at her he likes you just the way you claire glanced up in question at the way jill suddenly cut herself off midsentence the blond appeared frozen her mouth still open and eyes wide with shock claire felt herself go stiff in reaction as concern welled up within her what is it ohmygod the words were drawn out and spaced apart for emphasis what claire asked getting to her feet she peered down at herself in a panic afraid shed suddenly taken on the paisley pattern of the couch but her hands were still her hands she peered back to jill what you look likeher jill said faintly what claire asked her heart beating wildly in her chest i look like who her like whatshername you look like that model that jill snatched up the magazine off the coffee table and shoved it in her face her claire peered down and found herself staring at the photograph of brooke jordan she shook her head slowly with disbelief i canti dont the hell you dont jill grabbed claire by the arm with her free hand to drag her across the living room she was muttering the whole way i cant believe this i just cant believe it oh my god this is incredible do you realize how incredible this is claire just stumbled along behind her anxiety and confusion rife in her head she couldnt look like the model it was impossible jill was playing a joke on her that thought gave her some relief from the welter of emotions whirling through her head of course that was it jill was playing a joke here jill slammed through the bathroom door she tossed the magazine on the counter then shoved claire in front of the mirror claire stared at herself and stared jill wasnt playing a joke claire was staring into the mirror but the stunned face looking back was brooke jordans she tentatively touched her face it felt normal both in that her fingers felt like they were touching skin and her skin felt the fingers touching them but it wasnt her face she was looking at and those gorgeous chestnut waves were not her hair either claire was a natural redhead you look exactly like her exactly jill breathed with awe right down to her clothes claire blinked then switched her gaze to her body at first she didnt understand what jill was talking about she was still wearing the white smock and black pants shed left work in then claire noticed the pink collar of a tshirt was visible under the open neckline of her white blouse and smock what bewildered claire stripped off the smock and unbuttoned several buttons of her white blouse underneath was the same pink tshirt brooke jordan had been wearing on the magazine cover are you wearing her capri pants too jill reached for the waist of her black dress pants but claire danced instinctively away then paused and undid them herself holy jeez jill breathed as baby blue linen was revealed poking up from under her white lace panties youre wearing her capri pants too i cant be claire said faintly then finished stripping her own clothes away until she stood there in a pink tshirt blue capri pants and brooke jordans face she stared at herself in the mirror with bewilderment youre a dead ringer but how claire asked faintly this doesnt make sense of course it does it makes perfect sense its the destabilizer jill said triumphantly then tilted her head and asked do you think kyle would let me try it out just imagine what i could it cant be the destabilizer claire argued its supposed to cause a chameleon effect the ability to change skin tone not shape jill paused to consider that then suggested well maybe you havent really changed shape maybe youre still under there and its just like a painting over your skin catching claire by surprise jill suddenly reached out and began to feel her face a frown immediately tugged at her lips this doesnt feel like your face what do you mean alarmed by the statement claire put her own hands to her face once more but this time doing more than just touching her cheeks she began to explore her face like a blind person examining features your nose should be turned up jill pointed out you have the cutest little turn at the end but brooke has a straight nose kind of roman your nose feels roman now i guess it isnt just a chameleonlike painting on your face claire immediately shifted her fingers to her own nose it didnt feel like her nose it was too straight youve actually changed shape jill said then brightened like a shapeshifter the destabilizer made you a shapeshifter how did you do it i didnt claire said faintly as she tried to absorb what had happened to her john did not that jill said swiftly then waved to her face and body this how did youyou knowshift i dont know claire admitted glancing down at herself with bewilderment i just stared at the picture thinking that kyle might be more interested in me if i looked like herand wishing that i didlook like her i mean ive told you and told you claire kyle likes you as you are jill insisted then paused frowned and amended well he did like youas you were claire blinked at the correction anxiety crowding in at what it suggested never mind jill waved the problem of kyle away and snatched up the magazine shed tossed on the counter here look at another model and see if you can do it again i dont think i can claire admitted i dont know how i did it the first time just try jill insisted leafing through several pages before settling on a shorthaired blond here do her jill i try jill ordered claire hesitated then peered down at the blond she was beautiful with full red lips and big green eyes claire took the magazine from jill and concentrated on the picture trying to put herself in the same frame of mind shed been in earlier while looking at brooketrying to drum up the same longing to be so beautiful and attractive to the opposite sexto kyle oh my gawd jill squealed suddenly concentration broken claire glanced up did it work kyles sister nodded dumbly claire turned to the mirror and found herself staring at yet someone elses face this time the blond with short cropped hair and large red lips her body shape and clothing had also changed her breasts appearing larger as they pushed up out of the strapless black blouse she was now wearing with black satin pants how do you do the clothes jill asked with amazement reaching out to touch the pants i dont know claire admitted it must be me i mean the pink tshirt and capri pants were under my own clothes you meanlike this is you jill asked touching the satin your cells it must be claire repeated faintly it was the only thing that made sense they werent really clothes at all just her body shifting and changing color to look like them the chameleon effect was there after all it just wasnt alonethe ability to shift her shape was there as well jill nodded slowly then stiffened and said hang on she glanced around with confusion as jill rushed out of the bathroom claire had no idea where the other woman was going but couldnt seem to care much at the moment her poor mind was struggling to accept her new abilities she peered at herself in the mirror with fascination until she heard jill cursing and the sound of thumping and drawers and door slamming in the room across the hall jills bedroom claire started out of the bathroom then paused to snatch up her clothes the last thing she needed was for kyle to come home and stumble over her bra and panties in the bathroom what on earth are you doing claire asked with amazement as she entered jills room to find it in chaos jill was a whirlwind rushing about her room searching drawers and closets and tossing things willynilly what are you trying to find i had a magazine here jill explained kneeling to look under her bed i know i put itaha claire raised her eyebrows at this triumphant cry as jill dragged a magazine out from under the bed and got back to her feet it was a celebrity magazine she saw as jill began to leaf through it suddenly her friend paused folded the magazine over and thrust it forward try this claire tossed her clothes on the bed and took the magazine she peered down at the picture it was open to and blinked then glanced up asking with disbelief brad cruise jill nodded yes but hes a guy claire protested which was something of an understatement brad cruise wasnt just a guy he was the guy he was the male equivalent of brooke jordan he was also the biggest action movie star of their time raking in doubledigit millions for each role he took the most familiar face in film brad cruise was the man women lusted after and men would kill to be no really i hadnt noticed jill said sarcastically then smacked her in the forehead and said duh claire rolled her eyes and shoved the magazine back at her i cant do it oh come on how do you know until you try youve changed into brooke and the blond you can do this jill said encouragingly i shifted into brooke and the blond by wanting to be them claire argued theyre women beautiful successful women brad is a guy guy guy male a man the opposite sex i have no desire to be a man think freud think penis envy jill said quickly i dont have penis envy claire assured her oh come on jill pleaded just try justimagine it being brad cruise feted and adored by everyone rich beyond your wildest dreams just try please for me claire blew her breath out with exasperation then sighed fine ill try for you thank you thank you thank you jill gave her a quick hug then stepped back nodded and said with excitement go ondo it claire shook her head and peered down at the picture sure she wouldnt be able to do it for one brief moment shed had a real longing to look like brooke as for the blond claire had even managed a little excitement and interest in looking like her but brad cruise she just didnt really have any desire to become him though she supposed it might be interesting sighing inwardly she concentrated on the picture noting the features the shape the holy shit claire glanced up when jill breathed those two words one look at her wide round eyes was enough to make claire head back to the bathroom to peer at herself in the mirror wow claire breathed as she stared at brad cruises reflection looking back at her rugged good looks short tousled light brown hair and the same black suit the man had worn in the magazine photo it was as if hed stepped right out of the page and into the room only he hadnt it wasnt brad cruise she was staring at it was herself yeah jill sighed following her into the bathroom wow claires gaze narrowed at the sudden spark in her friends eyes a spark that was usually reserved for members of the opposite sex oh yeah jill walked around claire her eyes sweeping over her body in the suit this is incredible you look just like him yeah claire agreed dryly i look like him but its still me in here jill stopped behind her and peered at their reflection in the mirror oh wow look its me and brad cruise i gotta get a picture of this all those women at the reunion tonight would just eat their hearts out i thought you werent going claire reminded then shook her head as jill started out of the room but her friend had barely taken a step into the hall before stopping abruptly and whirling back what claire asked warily i have an idea jill said slowly claire noted the mounting excitement on her face and began to shake her head excitement and ideas were a bad mix with jill no you dont even know what it is jill protested i dont need to jill i know that look its the look that always got me in trouble when we were teenagers claire said her mouth tightened when jills shoulders drooped and her face took on a pathetic dejected cast it was the look that always got her knowing she would regret it claire sighed and asked what is it jill hesitated then blurted be my date for the reunion tonight claire blinked what be my date like that jill explained gesturing to her brad cruise guise oh no no no no no claire said shaking her head oh yes yes yes yes yes jill countered quickly then clapped her hands together as if in prayer and begged please please claire it could be fun fun she echoed with disbelief yes fun just think about it jill said magda the bitch would eat her heart out for once in life we would have it over her claire grimaced at the idea of magda the bitch a barbie doll lookalike with blond hair and boobs shed had everythingexcept personality compassion and heart magda had been a devoted subscriber to the belief that when you looked as good as she did you just didnt have to be nice more than that shed gone out of her way to be cutting and cruel to anyone shed felt beneath her on the food chainwhich had been everyone in the school who wasnt male and on the football team claire seriously doubted the woman had improved with age the idea of magdas distress if jill walked into the reunion on the arm of brad cruise really had some charm to it and then theres ted jill said adding to her argument hed eat his heart out too ted claire asked with confusion he didnt even go to our high school why would he be there hell be there with magda its why he had to end it today rather than wait until the very last minute like the day of the weddingor maybe months after she added magda won the teds wife lotto claire asked with horror she was the other finalist jill nodded stonefaced after he told me he was dumping me i was foolish enough to ask if he couldnt at least attend the reunion with me tonight and he told me about magda i cant believe he told you about magda claire gaped hes got some balls that guy what if you tell her everything tonight jill snorted he knows i wont magda would just sneer and point out that sheof coursewon him from me and i was a loseragain magda had made something of a hobby of stealing other girls boyfriends in school shed stolen jills prom date a week before the prom then gone on to steal claires prom date on the actual night of the prom after he and magda were crowned prom king and queen claire pressed her lips together then nodded okay well do it well go to the reunion and rub magda and teds face in it but only because i love you like a sister and only this once only this once jill agreed then squealed and hugged her oh youre the greatest claire smiled wryly as she patted jills back yeah yeah now we have another problem whats that jill asked pulling back to peer at her how do i change back into myself claire asked quietly jill stared at her blankly then frowned youwell she brightened suddenly i have tons of pictures of you you can look at one and turn back jill rushed out of the room leaving claire to turn and survey herself in the mirror in the picture of brad cruise hed had a serious case of five oclock shadow going on claire now had that case herself curious she lifted a hand and ran it over her cheek and chin grimacing at the scrape of short hair against her fingers man this was so weirdbut kind of cool here jill hurried back in and started to hold out a picture then pulled it back wait first try to do it without the picture without it claire asked with surprise well sure i mean it is your body just close your eyes and concentrate on being you again just think i want to be me jill suggested isnt that a song claire asked with amusement will you concentrate jill said with irritation just try to change sighing claire closed her eyes and concentrated on being herself she didnt have a picture to think of she didnt need one she had lived with her face and body for years ooops claire blinked her eyes open as she felt a soft towel being wrapped around her i guess the clothes you were wearing really were you jill said with a shrug holding the towel together until claire reached up to take over the task jill had wrapped a bath towel around her shoulders claire shifted it under her arms and wrapped it around herself sarong style she was completely and utterly nude under the towel which meant that the pink tshirt and blue capri pants the black satin dressy outfit and the mans black suit had been purely her that seemed kind of weird both women stiffened at the sound of the front door opening im back claire jill claire was the first to break out of her surprise suddenly aware of her nudity she quickly pushed the bathroom door closed hello kyle apparently heard the door close his voice now came from somewhere in the hall yes claire called hello claire kyle asked his voice now right outside the door yes are you okay what are you doing hearing the worry in his voice she said quickly im fine imim in the bath when jills eyebrows rose at her choice of activity claire gestured to her attire she was in a towel and her clothes were in jills bedroom claire could hardly tell kyle she was just using the loo he might wait in the hall until she came out so that he could see for himself that she was okay he seemed terribly worried about her and had every right to be the destabilizer had affected her after all bath kyle sounded surprised then asked wheres jill claires eyes widened on her friend sheser at the store jill suggested in a whisper shes at the store claire said dutifully damn it she was supposed to watch you kyle sounded irritated what if something had happened she only went a minute agoto the corner store shell be right back claire assured him she could hardly watch me in the bath any more than you would right claire heard kyles sigh through the door silence followed then he cleared his throat and said maybe thats for the best i wanted to ask you something claire and jill raised their eyebrows at each other there was more throatclearing then kyle said i was wondering yes claire prompted when he hesitated and found herself taking a step closer to the door as she waited look he said abruptly would you go to the reunion with me tonight claire froze sure her heart briefly stopped then she swallowed and asked so you can watch me or as your date there was a moment of silence then kyle asked would you be interested in being my date claire hesitated afraid to say yes and then learn that it wasnt what hed intended you dont have to answer that it isnt fair when i havent given you any indication of my feelings he said before she could decide how to answer him look i really suck at this kind of thing im great with beakers and bunnies but personal relationships are just kind of beyond me in some waysbutclaire i like you ive liked you for the longest time since we were twelve years old and you were pestering me about the science kit my parents bought me for christmas i even almost asked you out in high school but you were dating that football guy jack claire murmured thinking she would have dumped jack in a heartbeat if kyle had said a word especially since he was the one who had abandoned her for magda on prom night yeah jack kyle muttered sounding jealous even now claire smiled and lifted a hand to the door running her finger lightly over the wooden surface and wishing it was he then kyle paused before offering a vague well something happened that made me wait what claire asked curiously ill tell you another time kyle promised he cleared his throat so to answer your question what im interested in here is a date claire sucked in her breath hardly able to believe hed said it claire yes she breathed yes claire could hear the grin in his voice and found herself smiling too until movement made her glance toward jill the blond was shaking her head frantically in a definite negative gesture no claire asked jill with bewilderment no kyle said sharply through the door obviously having heard her speak no claire cried she hadnt meant the word for him at all i mean yes which is it yes to going to the reunion and no i wasnt talking to you when i said no claire explained who were you talking to then she could hear the frown in his voice and scrambled to think of an excuse imyself she said quickly then added i saw i had a broken nail andersaid no becausewell because i didnt want it to be broken claire finished lamely ohi see it didnt sound like he saw it sounded like he thought her a fruitcake claire frowned over the possibility she didnt want him to think she was a fruitcake or a freak she added unhappily as she considered what she could now do kyle might not think it as cool as she and jill did he would probably find it exciting scientifically hed want to study her and test her andshed become a lab animal to him instead of a prospective girlfriend well ill let you get back to your bath kyle said interrupting her grim thoughts then he offered well go over to your place after youre done your bath to pick up some clothes if you like okay claire said quickly shrugging her worries away she wouldnt tell him about the destabilizers effect at least not until she saw how this date went if it went wellwell she might wait a couple months if it went badly she might wait forever claire had no desire to become a lab rat okay kyle said there was silence for a minute then claire heard his footsteps moving away once the sound had faded claire turned away with a little sigh she was going on a date with kyle finally after all these years she you cant go with him claire blinked and peered at jill blankly what why you promised to be my date kyle lockhart and claire beckett maureen brighton beamed as they approached the registration table at the entrance to the reunion wow you both look great so do you maureen claire said with a smile as kyle accepted the blank name tags the brunette held out while he bent to write their names on them she chatted with maureen the brunette had been one of the nicer girls on the cheerleading squad with claire magda and her crew being the not so nice ones when another couple came up to the table claire stepped away to make room for them and peered curiously around the reunion was being held in murphy high schools smaller gymnasium a suitable spot claire supposed as she glanced over all the welldressed people maneuvering around under the streamers and decorations inside she didnt care where it was held claire was just glad to be here at last claire beckett was having her first date with kyle lockhart there were several points this afternoon and evening when she hadnt thought it would happen jill had been the first stumbling block with her determination to hold claire to her promise to be her date as brad cruise fortunately after several moments of claire pathetically pleading to be free of her promise so she could go with kyle jill had come up with an alternative they could both live with shed proposed that claire keep both dates with jill as brad cruise and with kyle as herself first she would enter on kyles arm as herself then after half an hour she would excuse herself to use the ladies room and slip out to the parking lot where jill would be waiting she would change into brad in the car then reenter the reunion with jill claire was to switch back and forth all night simple yeah right claire muttered to herself unhappily this was going to be the date from hellor the double date from hell did you say something kyle asked catching her comment as he finished at the registration table and joined her claire forced a smile but shook her head as she reached for the name tag he was holding out she accepted it then froze as she saw it was a pinon name tag oh this was bad claire thought faintly in order to do the quick change between herself and brad cruise claire had borrowed a black satin strapless gown from jill however she wasnt wearing it now shed showered done her hair and makeup then donned the gown only to have jill take a picture with her digital camera theyd printed it then claire had used it to shapeshift into herself that had been jills idea and claire had thought it brilliant at the time it saved her having to worry about stashing her dress somewhere while she was brad unfortunately it also meant that claire had nowhere to pin her name tag there was no way she was poking it through her her skin or her cells or whatever she wasnt sure exactly what it was but it was part of her and she so wasnt harpooning herself with a name tag do you need a hand shall i put it on for you kyle asked noting that she was still just staring at the pin no claire said sharply then forced another smile and said more calmly no i dont want to put holes in jills satin gown do they have stickon name tags oh i dont know he turned to the table to ask maureen swiveling back a moment later to say apparently if you slide the label out of the clear casing the label itself peels off its backing oh good claire breathed and set to work taking the label apart there we are kyle smiled as she finished with the pin and slapped the label onto the black satin of her chest which really was her chest claire realized and hoped it wouldnt hurt to peel it off shall we shrugging off the concern of removing the name tag claire smiled she placed her hand on the arm he offered and allowed him to lead her into the reunion once through the doors claire peered around at the tables set everywhere they were covered with marooncolored tablecloths and had silver and maroon centerpieces these were the school colors and most of the decorations carried them with the lighting low as it was and all the decorations hanging about it was easy to forget it was a gymnasium someone had decorated it with the same moonlight stars and heavenly aspect theme as at their prom some ten years ago it feels strange to be back here doesnt it kyle said with a wry smile yes claire agreed and gave a small shake of her head as she peered over the people milling about wondering who they all were im torn between feeling old because i dont recognize anyone and yet feeling like a teenager again id almost expect old mr hardwick to come marching up and ask for my book report kyle chuckled at her words but frowned slightly as he peered around everyone looks so different surely we havent changed as much as everyone else appears to have maybe claire said peering at him kyle had aged well growing into his looks and his body hed been much thinner when he was young almost gawky as had she claire supposed but merely said do you recognize anyone not really but there were a lot ofoh i spoke too soon i do recognize someone who claire asked curiously following his gaze magda richardson at two oclock and closing in on us like a shark he announced then added i apologize in advance for any nastiness she may spew our way why should you apologize claire asked with surprise because magda has gone out of her way to be rude to me and anyone i was with since she cornered me in the science lab in grade twelve and tried to trade kisses for help with homework i refused magda hit on you in high school claire asked with shock yeah but i think she just wanted help with her science project still she wasnt too pleased when i said thanks but no thanks the few times ive run into her over the last ten years shes been sure to be rude he frowned is that ted with her i thought he broke up with jill because he was marrying some magda was the teds wife lotto winner claire informed him dryly as she noted the smug look on the mans handsome face as they approached kyle of course hadnt been privy to the news when jill had shared it with her youre joking kyle said half with disgust and half with disbelief i wish i were claire muttered under her breath as the other couple reached them well if it isnt murphy highs very own science geeks magda drawled looking down her nose at them so you two twits finally got together magda kyle greeted her dryly charming as ever i see charm is overrated kyle magda informed him sweetly honesty is in now she tightened her hold on teds arm and dragged him forward i should introduce my fiancé ted leacock hes an important business owner here in town important kyle asked dryly not bothering to extend his hand in greeting as it happens ted and i are well acquainted you are magda didnt look pleased at this news but ted claire was more interested in watching the man with incredible balls had lost his smug look and was starting to appear a tad nervous it seemed while hed been sure jill would keep their relationship quiet he hadnt considered kyle in the equation yes weve met at least once a week for the last six months when he came to pick up my sister for dates or weekends away kyle announced calmly then smiled at magda of course theyre broken up now i guess that means youre marrying jills castoff dead silence fell between the four of them during which magdas face flushed with a mounting fury when teds mouth began to work silently like a fish out of water kyle took claires arm and said we should circulate but it was so nice seeing you i do hope the two of you are as happy as you deserve to be claire bit her lip at the doubleedged comment as kyle led her away a glance over her shoulder showed magda had turned furiously on ted and was now berating him something fierce if he wasnt such a jerk claire might almost have felt sorry for the man shaking her head she turned to kyle and murmured you handled that beautifully ted lost his smug look in a hurry yes but jill will be upset with me i suppose he said on a sigh i dont think she will you put both of them in their place with the jills castoff crack claire said with amusement besides she has a special date herself tonight one that should finish setting magda and ted on their ears really kyle asked with interest who claire bit her lip and hesitated unsure how to answer he was going to be shocked enough when he saw jill enterseemingly on the arm of brad cruise in the end claire decided to let jill deal with it and shook her head youll see soon enough kyle peered at her closely for a minute she feared he might press the issue but he apparently decided to let it go he merely asked if shed care for a drink then moved toward the bar claire peered around at the other attendees as she waited at least half the tables were filled no doubt most of the attendees would show up over the next half hour before she slipped out to the parking lot jill and her date would probably be nearly the last if not the last people to arrive which was just as jill wanted it if everyone was seated for the meal when they entered it meant absolutely everyone would see whoor who they would believewas on her arm as she sashayed in claire took a deep breath and tried not to let panic overwhelm her as she thought about what was to come she and jill had discussed it in detail before shed left with kyle for the reunion trying to cover every possible problem with their plan the first issue to crop up was her voice while claire could make herself look like brad cruise nothing she could do would make her sound like the man they had decided she wasnt to talk jill would claim shehe claire corrected herself hebrad cruisehad a bad case of laryngitis claire had also insisted on no autographs it was one thing to pretend to be brad cruise at a school reunion and quite another to indulge in forgery by signing his autograph for a couple hundred people they didnt have châteauneufdupape so i got you montepulciano claire glanced up and smiled as kyle offered her a glass of wine thank you kyle nodded his eyes moving over her solemnly as he took a sip of his own drink lowering the glass he asked how do you feel any ill effects from this afternoon claire shook her head quickly and told herself she wasnt lying as she took a sip of wine after all being able to shapeshift wasnt necessarily an ill effect was it sighing she lowered her glass and glanced around the tables had been set up around the outside of the large room leaving a wide space to dance in and couples were out there now sweeping along to a tenyearold love song would you like to dance kyle asked following her gaze claire hesitated and nearly said no but it would have been a lie she really would like to dance she was just afraid of stumbling and making a fool of herself deciding to be brave she nodded kyle took her wine and set it on a table next to them he then took claires arm and led her out onto the center of the floor claire was as tense and sweaty as a teenager as kyle took her in his arms she hadnt been this nervous with a man in a long time but then none of the men shed dated had meant as much to her as kyle did she was so wired up it took a moment for her to notice that they fit perfectly together her body matching itself to his as if fitting into a puzzle slot we fit together perfectly kyle whispered by her ear claire stiffened in surprise at his verbalizing her thoughts then lifted her head to peer at him he stared back his gaze traveling over her face in a caress that she could almost feel her lips parted slightly of their own accord when his eyes settled there and claire felt her breathing become more swift and shallow with anticipation she was finally finally going to be kissed by kyle lockhart claire thought almost faint at the prospect but rather than kiss her kyle used a hand to urge her head back to his chest claire sighed and tried to relax against him but her mind was on the fact that hed passed up the perfect opportunity to kiss her why she wondered what was wrong with her was it her figure perhaps if she had larger breasts claire stumbled in the dance and blinked in surprise as her neck was suddenly forced to bend farther forward to keep her head on kyles chest for a moment she didnt understand what had happened then she realized her breasts had suddenly grown between them like two balloons inflating erclaire kyle said uncertainly apparently noticing something was amiss oh god claire breathed and squeezed her eyes closed thinking go away go away go away claire kyle pulled back and she forced her eyes open relieved to find her chest normalsized again yes she raised her head to his but kyle was peering at her cleavage with confusion after a moment he shook his head i thought kyle is that you claire and kyle broke apart to peer at the excited man suddenly standing beside them it is you the man said he had boyish good looks and a full head of dark hair but was almost painfully short at a couple of inches less than five feet it was his height that helped claire to recognize him right away bobby loth she said happy for the distraction claire you remember me he said with surprised pleasure of course i do claire smiled bobby had been in the science club with them intelligent and goodhumored hed been a good friend in high school who could forget you bobby kyle asked lightly how are you old friend good bobby beamed as they shook hands then stepped back to catch the arm of a petite brunette waiting shyly a step behind him this is my wife meredith meredith this is kyle and claire claire and kyle smiled and said hello the four of them stood talking on the dance floor for several minutes before moving to collect their drinks and settle at a table together the conversation continued but claire was slightly distracted as she kept one eye on the wirecovered clock on the wall as pleasant as she found the interlude with bobby and his wife claire just couldnt relax it was almost a relief when it was time to leave at least it meant an end to her tense waiting excusing herselfostensibly to visit the ladies roomclaire slipped from the table and made her escape right on time jill said cheerfully as claire slid into the front passenger seat of her car a moment later she was obviously looking forward to what was to come claire wasnt there were too many things that could go wrong thanks she murmured as jill handed her the photos she handed back the snapshot of herself then took the picture of brad cruise theyd ripped out of the magazine and hesitated as she squinted at it in the dark i dont suppose you brought a flashlight or something no i didnt think of it just a minute jill dug through her purse briefly then held out a small item a lighter claire asked with surprise as she took it you dont smoke ted smoked cigars once in a while and always forgot his lighter oh claire glanced around nervously but the parking lot appeared empty she flicked the lighter on and concentrated on the picture once more perfect the one word from jill a moment later told claire shed finished the change she let the lighter go out with relief it had started to get warm under her thumb distracting her but shed feared letting it go out before she was done okay claire asked lifting her head jill flicked the interior car light on just long enough to look her over then flicked it back off to avoid attracting attention as i said perfect she assured her come on sighing claire slid out of the car and walked around to meet her then handed back the magazine photo for her to put away take my arm like a gentleman jill instructed as they started toward the entrance to the school claire took her arm and mentally reminded herself that she was now a man so she should pull out chairs take jills arm and all those other little courtesies what are you doing claire glanced at jill with surprise what do you mean youre swaying your hips no im not yes you are youre walking like a girl i am a girl claire said with irritation not tonight youre not jill said firmly think manly try to swagger and dont talk anything else claire asked dryly yes jill patted her hand and said thank youby the way how is the date with kyle going gooduntil i had to come out here claire said then recalled the incident with magda and ted and quickly related it to jill whofortunatelywasnt upset the registration table was empty when they reached the gym they truly were going to be the last to enter jill paused outside the closed gym doors took a deep breath then glanced at her and said show time just smile and nod and agree with anything i say okay against her better judgment claire nodded her agreement then added just dont leave me alone like id abandon brad cruise in the same room with a bimbo like magda on the loose jill said dryly then pushed through the door still holding her arm claire pushed her own door open and entered with her noting that everyone was now seated and servers were moving through the tables delivering the first entrée perfect jill whispered pausing just inside the doors to peer around their entrance had not gone unnoticed several people had turned their way to see who had entered then more people looked toward them as the first people nudged those next to them a loud whispering began to move through the crowd most of it made up of the name brad cruise claire forced herself to keep her head upright and not flinch and shrink behind jill she couldnt have anyway jill was now sailing forward forcing claire to accompany her where are we going to sit claire asked bending her head to jills ear so she wasnt overheard were sitting with kyle what claires eyes widened in horror but that way we can distract him from noticing youre gone so you dont have to turn back so soon claire thought this was a very bad idea but it was too late to stop it they were already halfway to the table where kyle sat gaping at their approach and no wonder she supposed it must be a bit disconcerting to see your sister enter the reunion on the arm of the biggest film star in the world where are magda and ted jill asked as they neared the table where kyle bobby and meredith sat in a frozen tableau i dont know claire murmured her gaze swiveling to the right then pausing as she found the pair several tables over from their own the couple were gaping openmouthed but then everyone was claire thought as she whispered to jill to look to their right when she did jills shoulders straightened and a look of satisfaction crossed her face that made claire glad shed agreed to this she just hoped she still felt that way at the end of the night magda is ready to shriek and ted looks like he just ate his shorts jill said glancing at claire with amusement the amusement vanished abruptly and she forced them to a halt not three feet from the table what is it claire hissed urgently as she noted the alarm on her friends face jill hesitated then turned to fully face her she put one hand on claires chest and leaned up as if to kiss her claire instinctively turned her head to the side to avoid the kiss and hissed no kissing im still claire right jill murmured then claire gasped as jill took her hand away ripping the claire name tag away with it as she added wryly no need to advertise it though the name tag had remained when she had changed it was little things like this that were likely to catch them up in this charade claire thought grimly but merely caught jills arm in her hand as the blond continued on to the table sorry were late jill sang gaily as kyle got to his feet jill kyle greeted but his gaze was locked on claireor brad really she supposed his expression was a combination of confusion and suspicion then he turned his gaze to his sister to say i didnt think you were coming tonight brad changed my mind she said lightly jill is that you bobby loth got to his feet as well to greet her and claire had no doubt jill was grateful for the distraction the blond turned quickly to greet the man and be introduced to meredith whichunfortunatelyleft claire alone to face kyle kyle lockhart he introduced himself and held out his hand claire automatically put her hand in it forgetting that she was supposed to be a guy and should be giving a firm handshake she barely held back her wince as his hand squeezed her own and you are kyle asked when she kept her mouth shut much to claires relief jill had been paying attention and suddenly whirled back saying oh kyle you know who this is unfortunately brad has a bad case of laryngitis which is why i wasnt sure i would be coming after all when ted bowed out but brad bravely agreed to accompany me claire blinked as jill pressed a kiss to her cheek then allowed her to urge her to a seat at the table jill had the good sense to seat her between herself and meredith keeping her away from kyle and his questions claire felt herself relax a little as meredith offered her a shy smile until she quietly asked if brad could sign her table napkin before claire could panic too much jill leaned around clairebrad to say im sorry meredith the one promise i had to make to get brad here was that he wouldnt have to sign autographs he hurt his wrist on set a couple weeks ago and hes trying to rest it up before he starts a new movie next week oh i think i heard something about that meredith said with understanding didnt you fall off a horse while filming your last movie and land badly on your wrist claire turned blankly to jill who nodded solemnly and told meredith he was lucky it was just a sprain and he didnt break it claire inwardly shook her head as meredith cooed sympathetically honestly where did they find out all this stuff and why waste their time on it the only thing she knew about brad cruise was that he was rich goodlooking and an actor jill and meredith seemed to know all sorts of details about him you dont have name tags claire stiffened at kyles sharp comment but jill merely turned to smile at her brother the registration table was empty when we got here i guess we were a bit late kyle nodded and claire was just starting to relax again when he said but it looked like it was a name tag you ripped offbrads chest as you approached the table claire felt her eyes widen in alarm they hadnt been far from the table when jill had noted the claire name tag and ripped it off had kyle seen and been able to read it before his sister could take it away brad was at a press conference before picking me up and still had his star pass on jill lied glibly i removed it hmmm kyle was silent for a minute then glanced to the side i wonder whats holding claire up oh you know womens washrooms they always have a terrible line shes probably still waiting to get into a stall kyle turned his head slowly back and claire felt the hair rise on the back of her neck at the look in his eyes shed seen it before it was his aha look and she nearly closed her eyes with a groan when he said did i mention shed gone to the ladies room jill looked taken aback for a minute then improvised with i just assumed where else would she be much to claires relief bobby leaned toward kyle then claiming his attention but she was tense now and impatient to get to the bathroom and return as claire they had agreed that she would stay through the entrée as brad then jill would remind him he had to make a phone call and she could escape to change back the entrée couldnt come quick enough for her claire only grew more impatient to escape as the next twenty minutes passed a few of their braver exclassmates began to approach the table eager to tell brad how much they enjoyed his movies and requesting autographs jill did an excellent job of fending them off for her but it was disconcerting to have peoplemostly womengushing to her about how wonderful he was it was a great relief when jill finally said oh brad you were supposed to call your agent maybe you should do it now before the main course arrives how can he make a phone call i thought he had laryngitis kyle commented claire had just closed her hand around the pictures jill had passed to her under the table and started to get to her feet but froze like a deer in headlights at this comment yes of course id better go with him then hadnt i jill said sweetly he knows claire hissed as they headed for the exit at the back of the gymnasium knowing the washrooms were in the side hall no he doesnt jill assured her how could he kyle doesnt have any idea the destabilizer can do this its only supposed to cause a chameleonlike effect remember hes just freaked out that i have a date with a big star claire was about to remind her that she didnt really have a date with a big star when jill suddenly cursed and began to urge her to move faster ted and magda are closing in she hissed great claire muttered as they hurried out of the gym they hadnt gone far when ted called out after them gritting her teeth jill gave her a push go on ill handle them hand tightening on the pictures she still clutched claire hurried for the bathrooms slowly becoming aware of the tap of highheeled shoes following her she glanced over her shoulder expecting to find jill had only paused long enough to make some quick excuse then had followed but instead found that jill had been stopped in the hall by ted and it was magda trailing after her the barbie doll lookalike gave her a sultry smile and picked up speed in an effort to catch up claire just panicked her heart lodged itself in her throat and she broke into a run for the last few feet and sped into the bathroom relaxing a little once the door swung shut behind her claire slowed to a walk and glanced around relieved to find the bathroom was empty she walked into the first empty booth and started to close the stall door then heard the bathroom door open again surprised claire paused blinking at magda as the woman hurried into the bathroom the blonds steps didnt even slow magda rushed forward and straight into the booth placing one hand on claires chest and forcing her back against the stall wall as she closed and locked the stall door with her other hand oh brad claire stared in horror as magda pressed eagerly up against her i saw you notice me when you came in with jill and felt sure youd want me how clever of you to lead me to the ladies room oh dear claire thought faintly shed unthinkingly entered the ladies room rather than the mens room and magda was taking that as a comeon and she couldnt talk to explain otherwise catching at magdas hands as they wandered over her wide brad cruise chest claire used the only avenue of communication she had open to her and shook her head firmly she then tried to slip past her to unbolt the door and get out however magda wasnt cooperating laughing as if she thought brad was playing games magda shook her hands free to again run them over brads body dont worry ted will keep jill busy hes been steaming ever since we saw you arrive let them have their fun we can have our own i promise ill show you a better time than that homely little wannabe ever could claire stiffened indignant on her friends behalf magda was a cow a manstealing cow she decided grimly then found her ability to think buried under an avalanche of shock as magda suddenly kissed her for one moment claire was so stupefied she couldnt think when her brain did manage to function again the only thing it spat out was the fact that in high school the boys had all claimed magda was an awesome kisser claire was no expert but to her magdas kiss was limp and sloppy wait till jill heard she thought then regained enough sense to begin to struggle claire didnt have to struggle hard this time while she had been distracted by magdas kiss the other woman had slid her hand down to where brads groin should have beenand got the surprise of her life breaking the kiss magda said with shock you dont have a penis yeah well youre a rotten kisser claire growled in as manly a voice as she could manage she then shoved her away pushing her in the only direction available to her toward the toilet unfortunately for the blond it had obviously been cleaned recently and the toilet seat had been left up magda shrieked as she landed with a splash then began to thrash and struggle to get out claire didnt wait to see if she did unbolting the door she hurried from the stall and straight out of the bathroom she didnt hesitate or glance around but charged straight out of the womens washroom and across the hall into the mens room then into the first open stall she saw slamming the booth door closed claire leaned her forehead against it and took several deep breaths then groaned this was bad magda would go out and tell everyone that brad didnt have a penis and jill would be upset and claire brad stilling at the sound of jills voice claire unbolted the door opened it and dragged jill inside we have a problem what happened jill asked anxiously as she relocked the stall door i saw magda follow you into the ladies room she kissed me claire blurted with disgust then added and she is a really bad kisser all those guys in high school must have been lying their heads off they probably hadnt even kissed her because there is no way they would have thought what she gave me was a good kiss jill stared at her blankly and then burst out laughing go on laugh claire muttered but you wont be laughing when you hear the rest jill stopped at once her eyes narrowing warily what she grabbed me only there was nothing to grab jill blinked slow to comprehend you mean her gaze dropped to brads groin yes jill frowned you mean you dont have a package was there a package in the picture claire asked dryly then answered herself no there were pants i have pants no package oh thats just wrong jill said unhappily and then dug around in her purse coming up with a black marker give me the picture perplexed claire handed over the pictures shed been clutching through all this and watched in amazement as jill put a noticeable bump in brads pants in the magazine photo what are you there now concentrate on the picture and give yourself a package im supposed to be turning back to myself jill im here with kyle tonight too not till we clear this matter up she said firmly when claire opened her mouth to argue jill added you agreed to be my date first sighing claire lowered her head and concentrated on the picture giving herself a definite bump where brads package should have been nice jill said with approval then turned to unlock the stall door now wed better get out of here before another guy comes in and sees us everyone would think we were having sex or something jill had opened the stall door but now paused as if reconsidering how bad an idea it would be for everyone to think she was having sex in the bathroom with brad cruise claire gave her a determined push forward she just wanted to get this over with so she could get back to her date what is it jill asked as they left the mens room claire followed her gaze to her new bump and shrugged a bump just a bump yeah but whats it look like under there jill reached for the zipper of her trousers but claire knocked her hand away there is no under there under there is me remember this is me there are no clothes its really all just me right jill said slowly and gave an abrupt nod we need to find a picture of brad naked what claire asked with disbelief and then snapped do not even think it oh please jill pleaded just once you could keep your mouth shut and i could have my fantasy night youd never have to buy me a birthday gift or christmas present ever again she tried the pitiful expression that always worked on claire but this time she wasnt falling for it this whole brad nonsense was ruining her date with kyle a date shed waited forever for she was all out of sympathy youve lost your mind claire snapped impatiently these are my lips my eyes looking out and my brain i am not brad cruise and neither am i a lesbian and i am so not having sex with you jill sighed giving up the attempt to talk her into it yeahi get it too bad though she suddenly reached out to poke at the lump where does it feel like im poking you my leg claire answered really she poked some more thats kind of weird isnt it i guess it means that leg cells were used to make up the lump and jill magda was just telling maureen and me claire and jill glanced over with surprise as meredith rushed out of the womens room with maureen on her heels her words had died abruptly and she gaped as she spotted jill standing there with her hand on brads package what maureen peered over merediths shoulder with curiosity at her sudden silence then said oh as she took in what appeared to be jill caught feeling up the superstar sorry jill said retracting her hand as claire flushed with embarrassment i wasertalking to brad what is it magda was saying meredith hesitated exchanging a glance with maureen then she grabbed jills arm and pulled her several feet away the three women went into a huddle and began to whisper in earnest claire shook her head wondering if this night would ever end as abruptly as it had started the huddle broke apart meredith and maureen threw clairebrad almost leering smiles as they rushed off back toward the gymnasium well claire asked as jill returned to her side what did they say that magda kissed you in the womens washroom and felt you up and you had no package shoot i was afraid of that claire sighed what did you say that magda was just jealous that she dragged you into the bathroom threw herself at you kissed you and you said she was a lousy kisser and gave her the brush off and shes jealous so shes spreading false stories smart claire said with a smile yeah it helps that brad cruise did that full frontal nudity scene in the british movie he did last year there was a definite package there claire blinked that was like a split second on the screen too fast to see anything youve never heard of pause jill asked arching one eyebrow you paused it to see him nude she asked with disbelief me and twenty million other women why do you think the dvd sold so well dear god claire muttered i am so seeing a side of you i didnt know about sure you knew about it jill countered you know me better than anyone maybe its just different because youre a guy now kind of could be claire sighed and promised herself she would never again slag men for being pigs women could be just as bad now that the crisis is handled can i change back into me yeah go on claire turned back to the mens room with relief only to stiffen as she noted the door was cracked open as she stared it opened the rest of the way revealing the man who had been listening to everything kyle claire squawked and then covered her mouth with horror at having given the gig away kyle arched his eyebrows sternly but merely said i find it hard to believe that neither of you thought to check to see if you were alone in the bathroom before talking so freely anyone might have heard you but how did you get here jill asked with dismay we left you at the table i followed when i didnt see you jill said with bewilderment you were busy talking to ted when i slipped by telling him you werent interested in his offer to start dating again he added dryly he had the balls to ask you out again claire asked with amazement then smiled so you got to be the dumper after all it wasnt as much fun as i thought it would be jill told her morosely really he turned out to be a major greaseball claire started to pat her back in sympathy then gave a startled bleat as kyle suddenly tugged her into the mens room hey jill followed them but kyle just dragged claire into a booth and slammed the door in his sisters face would you care to explain he asked as he bolted the door claire opened her mouth but he forestalled her by saying on second thought dont bother i heard enough to understand i gather the destabilizer had an effect after all did it jill snorted from outside the booth even as claire nodded kyle tossed a glare toward the door but merely asked more than the chameleon effect yes claire said reluctantly i can shapeshift i take it you discovered this while i was at the grocery store claire nodded again and you didnt tell me when i came back claire eyed him warily kyles expression was blank no emotion showing at all but there was something in his voice that suggested he wasnt at all happy why he finally asked allowing his anger to now show because she didnt want you to see her as a lab rat jill answered from outside the booth when claire hesitated a lab rat kyle unlocked the door and jerked it open to glare at his sister jill immediately squeezed inside forcing claire to move between the toilet and one wall of the booth kyle hesitated then pushed the stall door closed and bolted it again what do you mean she didnt want me to see her as a lab rat well youre a scientist jill pointed out with a shrug as if that said it all then she added and youd finally just asked her out after the two of you have mooned over each other for years claire didnt want to spoil it by telling you what had happened she was afraid the scientist in you would start to see her as an experimental subject rather than a date kyle hesitated for a moment then opened the door again and pushed his sister out hey you cant leave me out here jill protested as he locked the door again what if someone comes in then get out of the mens room kyle suggested there was a moment of silence then the tap of jills high heels moved into the booth on their right as she said not on your life brother this is partially my fault and i am not leaving you two alone to screw things up kyle rolled his eyes and sighed but turned to claire and said i may be a scientist claire but i could never see you as just an experiment i am a man too a snort came from overhead drawing their attention to the fact that jill had apparently mounted the toilet to look over the top of the stall will you leave us alone kyle asked with exasperation not till i straighten this out jill insisted i love you two too much to see you ruin this chance kyle opened his mouth to snap at her then seemed to change his mind okay say what you have to say and then go jill nodded her satisfaction and turned to claire see he isnt as stupid as most men he knows women are better at communication and lets me talk claire bit her lip to keep back a laugh and nodded solemnly so kyle jill turned her attention to her brother claires liked you forever ive listened to her moan over you since we were twelve and if you think its easy hearing someone rhapsodize over your brother think again but she was my friend and she liked you so i put up with it and claire she turned to claire now kyle has been secretly lusting after you for just as long hes had a snapshot of you in his wallet since he started carrying a wallet and he has another bigger picture of you hidden in his top drawer at home how did you know kyle began but jill cut him off today youshe glared at her brotherfinally had the nerve to ask her out and claire accepted unfortunately shed already agreed to help me out tonight the only fair solution was to do both she didnt want to jill added she just wanted to go out with you but i blackmailed her into it by threatening to tell you about her newerabilities okay now kiss and make up there was a moment of silence as kyle surveyed clairebrad then he raised his eyes to his sister and said succinctly out jill opened her mouth as if to protest then seemed to think better of it and shrugged ill be waiting in the hall she disappeared from the top of the booth and they heard the tap of her heels as she exited the stall and left the mens room kyle sighed with relief and turned to claire she stared up at him wideeyed her palms suddenly sweaty at the idea of his finally kissing her but after a hesitation kyle cleared his throat and shook his head i know its you in there but do you think you could change back to yourself now i really dont want to kiss you as brad oh claire jerked up the pictures she still held in her hand and switched the snapshot of her to the top she hesitated suddenly shy but then bowed her head and concentrated on the picture wow kyle breathed and claire relaxed and peered down at herself to see she was back in the black satin dress she was herself again claire glanced up there you are he said gently and lifted his hand to caress one cheek then before she was quite ready his mouth dropped to cover hers claire stilled her heart thumping in her chest as kyle kissed her then she released a little moan and relaxed against him for one moment shed feared what would happen what if his kiss wasnt all shed imagined it would be reality would be hard pressed to compare to more than ten years of fantasy but there was nothing to fear unlike magda kyle knew how to kiss his mouth was firm on hers slanting over her own and sending her pulse racing as he slid his tongue out to urge her mouth open she opened for him welcoming him in with an excited gasp that died abruptly as the bathroom door opened outside the stall they both stood frozen listening for jills tapping shoes but there was no tapping releasing her kyle moved to the door and peered out at the room beyond through the crack between door and stall claire guessed by his frown and the fact that he didnt berate jill that someone else had entered the bathroom a man she presumed since it was a mens room kyle turned back and raised a finger to his lips to warn her to silence then a stall door farther down the row squeaked as it was opened kyle waited until it had closed then unlocked their door and led her quickly out of the stall you changed back jill cried on spotting them of course she did kyle said with irritation shes my date too yes but jill said then hesitated her expression calculating before she said ill make a deal with you she changes back to brad so that we can leave together then shes all yours for the rest of the night claires eyes widened with surprise you dont want me to continue being your date too no theres no need to carry on the charade everyones seen me with brad cruise thats all i wanted besides its ruining your date she glanced from claire to kyle and its not like you can talk anyway so its like a serious instance of show and tell well ive shown and told them enough i can go home happy now claire felt kyle relax beside her and knew he was feeling the same relief now coursing through her then too jill added with an evil grin theyll all just think i went home to have hot monkey sex with brad cruise anyway and if they dont ill be sure to spread the rumor myself hot monkey sex claire echoed with disbelief ive got news for you jill ive seen two monkeys have sex and its not pretty shes right kyle informed his sister not pretty at all oh god jill shook her head with despair honestly the pair of you deserve each other youre both pathetic sex between any species is not pretty its not supposed to be its she stopped abruptly then said eww you mean like you two have stood there and watched monkeys have sex thats sick claire and kyle exchanged glances but kyle spoke first i saw them at university when i was working as a ta in the lab i didnt stand there and watch but i saw enough well i did watch claire admitted with a bit of embarrassment but it was part of my job at the time we were studying she paused and shook her head never mind lets get me changed and get you and brad out of here so kyle and i can have our date good idea jill led her into the empty womens washroom and into a stall hey she protested when kyle squeezed in with them i want to see kyle said well get up on the toilet seat then jill ordered after a hesitation that way if anyone enters and peers under the stall door it wont look so weird theyll just see that two women are in here and thats not weird kyle asked with disbelief not as weird as two women and a man she pointed out dryly we could just be gossiping or comforting one another over something just get on the toilet she finished when he stared in doubt shrugging kyle carefully maneuvered himself to stand on the toilet seat and jill relaxed and turned to claire okay go for it claire lifted the pictures and switched her own to the bottom so that brad cruise smiled back at her she cast an almost apologetic glance kyles way then turned her attention to the picture claire had barely begun to concentrate on the magazine photo when the outer bathroom door opened jill half jerked around toward the stall door at the sound bumping claires hand she gasped with alarm as the pictures slipped from her fingers they shot down like paper airplanes curving to the side on a draft and sliding under the divider between the stalls instinct made claire bend to grab for them but then she froze as the door to the neighboring stall suddenly opened hissing with alarm jill caught at her arm to bring her upright even as claire saw that she was now wearing the black blazer of brad cruise it seemed shed managed to change into brad that quickly amazing she thought retracting her suitcovered arm before it could be seen claire straightened once more and the three of them exchanged slightly embarrassed grimaces as they waited for the woman to finish her business and leave all three breathed a sigh of relief when the toilet next door finally flushed and the door opened claire immediately bent and peered at the floor in the next stall frowning when she saw that there was only one picture there now it was the snapshot she saw and it had come to rest near the opposite side of the next stall too far away for her to reach it at the moment wheres the other one wheres brad jill asked in a bare whisper against her ear and claire shrugged her confusion what is it kyle hissed from his perch on the toilet they straightened and whispered the explanation to him all three stared at each other blankly each trying to sort out where the picture might have gone as they listened to the sound of water running in the sinks in the main part of the bathroom then jills eyes widened lifting her eyebrows in question she jerked a thumb toward the door claire stared at her taking a minute to realize she was suggesting the woman who had entered must have picked it up frowning over the possibility claire moved to press her face to the crack on one side of the door jill promptly crowded up next to her to peer out the crack on the other side claire had a pretty good view of the girl through the crack as she turned off the taps and walked over to the hand drier good enough to see that she wasnt carrying any pictures in her hand there didnt appear to be any pockets in the formfitting black dress the woman was wearing either she noted claire was about to pull away from the crack and kneel to give the floor of the next booth a more thorough look over when kyle gave a psst both she and jill glanced over their shoulders to find hed stood up on the toilet to look out at the room obviously hed seen something theyd missed for he was gesturing down toward his feet claire glanced down didnt see anything and glanced back up to find kyle pointing toward the door claire turned back to her crack and peered out this time focusing on the womans legs then feet at first she didnt see anything then as the girl finished at the hand drier and turned to walk out of the room her eyes widened incredulously at the sight of the folded magazine photo stuck to the bottom of one highheeled shoe that is so me claire muttered as the door closed behind the girl with the picturebearing shoe what do you mean kyle asked stepping off the toilet it left him standing behind her his chest against her back in the small space im usually the girl with the toilet paper trailing behind her on her way out of the bathroom claire explained with a wry twist of her lips yeah well shes walking out with my date under her heel jill said with disgust kind of like magda with ted under her thumb maybe kyle commented but i cant think of a guy more deserving of magda than ted god what an arrogant ass he turned out to be yeah claire agreed and i thought i had bad taste thank you very much kyle said with amusement and claire flushed i meant other than you of course she amended most of the guys ive datedaside from youhave been total turds like ted thank you very much for pointing out what bad taste i have jill said shortly oh thats not what i meant claire said quickly yeah he had me fooled too jill kyle assured her slightly mollified jill sighed and gestured claire out of the way back up ill go get the other picture god why couldnt it have been your picture she walked out with well im glad it was brad claire countered backing into the small bit of space between the toilet and the side wall to leave room for kyle and jill to juggle around and get the stall door open im already brad cruise hardly jill snorted managing to struggle her way out of the booth claire frowned as the stall door swung closed on her back then turned to kyle to ask what does she mean hardly kyle hesitated his expression pained jills voice came from the stall next door youre only half changed claires head jerked sideways at the announcement and then she tugged the stall door open and hurried to the mirror over the sink to peer at her reflection oh my god claire breathed with horror some of the features staring back at her were her own she was looking at her green eyes and her little turnedup nose but they rested above brad cruises mouth and chin with the five oclock shadow her hair was a strange mix of short light brown hair and long red waves and her bodywellit was a mishmash of brad and claire she had the jacket and pants from his suit but the pants ended above her knees and she also had boobs they didnt go well with the bulge between her legs that was his package this is a nightmare she breathed no longer caring which picture it was so long as it was a whole somebody she could not leave the bathroom looking like this and while she could turn back to herself without a picture she would be naked its all right kyle murmured slipping out of the stall to pat her back as he met her gaze in the mirror well fix it with the other picture oh dear claire turned sharply toward the stalls as jill came out with the remaining picture in hand oh dear what nothing itll be fine jill said quickly suddenly picking at the picture then she paused and said oh no oh no dont say oh no claire started forward to take the picture but jill suddenly frowned at her as if just realizing she was out of the stall what are you doing she cried get back in the stall someone could see you holding the picture out of claires reach she grabbed her with her free hand and wrestled her into the stall then slammed the door behind them and sighed jill kyle asked from the other side of the door and she grimaced then opened the door again and waved him in she waited until they were all situated in their original places again before locking the stall door once more tell me claire ordered grimly jill sighed then held out the snapshot claire snatched it from her hand peered down and nearly bit off her own tongue the picture had landed facedown on a wad of gum the girl who had used the stall must have stepped on it because it had really been worked into the picture when jill had tried to pick it away the image itself had ripped off the photo backing hell kyle muttered it will be all right jill assured them both as she turned to the door wait here wait here claire grabbed at her arm with alarm where are you going the corner store is only a couple minutes away ill get a fan magazine with a picture of brad in it and be right back she assured her brad what about her do you have another picture of her kyle asked with concern no unfortunately we only took the one snapshot jill admitted and kyle turned back to claire can you do it without the picture no she said on a sigh have you tried kyle asked and claire smiled faintly thinking he sounded just like his sister earlier that day when shed been coaxing her to be brad cruise she can turn back into herself but shell end up naked without a picture to look at jill announced naked kyles gaze flickered over her in such a way she thought he might be picturing her that way and might not necessarily think it was a bad thing what time is it claire asked suddenly i dont know why jill asked with confusion i was just wondering how much of this double date from hell ive spent in the bathroom she admitted and kyle who had glanced at his wristwatch now let it drop to his side without telling the time that long she thought with a sigh look you two wait here and ill go get a magazine at the store jill repeated no enough of this nonsense kyle said shes not turning back into brad shes supposed to be claire now well she isnt claire now and surely a full brad is better than a brad with boobs for getting her out of here jill pointed out we can leave then ill take her home and she can change into herself and put on the dress and come back to finish the date with you while the twins continued to argue claire peered down at herself with a frown recalling the incident on the dance floor when shed accidentally made her boobs grow and then shrink could she do it again squeezing her eyes closed she concentrated on making them go away and leaving her flatchested oh man that is so awesome claire blinked her eyes open at jills words and peered down to find her chest flat can you make them grow jill asked curiously i believe she did on the dance floor tonight kyle said dryly and claire felt herself flush it was an accident she admitted do you know how cool this is jill asked with disbelief a boob job without silicone or surgery oh kyle can i get zapped too jill claire cried staring at her with disbelief no kyle said firmly at the same time jill chose to respond to kyles answer asking a plaintive why not we dont know what side effects there are he said as if explaining things to a child there could be all sorts of repercussions to this kind of molecular alteration her cells are now unstable they might when he paused abruptly claire finished what he was reluctant to say they might yet break apart altogether and leave me a puddle of goo they were all silent for a minute then jill asked youre kidding right kyle reached out to caress claires cheek then cleared his throat and changed the subject you did that without a picture do you think you could change yourself back to yourself in a dress without a picture claire hesitated not at all certain she could manage the trick her boobs werewellher boobs but he was talking about the whole body never mind kyle said suddenly i dont want you to do too much shifting until were sure that it doesnt cause the cells to destabilize further you mean her switching back and forth tonight might have been dangerous jill asked with dismay claire frowned at the possibility it was something she hadnt considered i dont know kyle admitted this is all new ground and im not sure what could happen nothing has happened to the animals so far but theyve only been changing color not shifting their shapes jill looked briefly stricken that this favor claire had done her might have been dangerous and harmful then she shook her head thats it then switch back to yourself ill be naked claire pointed out with alarm you can wear kyles suit jacket jill suggested i am not walking out of here wearing nothing but kyles suit jacket claire said emphatically kyle cleared his throat and said im afraid there are only two choices hereno three he corrected himself which are claire asked warily sure she wouldnt like any of them one you and i can stay here and wait while jill drives home and fetches you some clothes claire grimaced at the suggestion too many embarrassing situations could come out of that they were two men in a womens washroom after all well one and a half men she supposed two you can leave here as you are kyle continued but his expression suggested this wasnt really an option at all having seen herself claire had to agree so she didnt even bother to comment instead she prompted or or three you can change back to yourself and leave here naked with my jacket on he finished with a shrug no offense claire said unhappily but those options all suck turning away she leaned her head against the cool metal of the stall wall and tried to think of something herself what jill asked when claire suddenly stiffened you have an idea maybe what if you went and got one of the phoebuses and i shifted into one of the teachers i could leave here then we could go get another presentday photo of me and she paused at the thunderous expressions on the faces of both lockharts they looked furious that she would even suggest the extra shift never mind okay kyle give me your jacket all three of them were forced to shift and bend and juggle about to allow him to remove the suit coat and then to do so again as she donned it they were all hot and sweaty and relieved when it was done okay shift jill instructed once claire had the jacket on over her bradclaire body claire closed her eyes and concentrated on being herself honest to god claire youre the only woman i know who could make a mans jacket look sexy claire blinked her eyes open at jills words am i me she asked glancing down at herself eyebrows rising at just how short the jacket was on her dear god she wasnt going to be bending over any time soon oh yeah youre you kyle said huskily and claire flushed under his admiring glance oh please jill said lets get out of here i can smell the hormones starting to ooze out of the two of you and while i love you both id rather not think of either of you naked doing the wild thing especially not together she ended her comment with a delicate little shudder of distaste that made both claire and kyle grimace go check and be sure the hall is empty first jill kyle suggested oh right be right back she had barely slid from the stall when kyle turned claire into his arms and covered her mouth with his claire gasped in surprise at the abrupt action and kyle took advantage of her open mouth and thrust his tongue inside oh god jills exclamation drew them apart cant you at least wait until you get her to the car claire flushed as they turned to face kyles sister and jill shook her head the coast is clear if you want to leave or the two of you could just do it right here in the girls bathroom and get it over with honestly turning she stomped back to the door muttering he waits forever to finally ask her out then hes all over her mr octopus hands everywhere it really is the quiet ones you have to watch biting her lip claire hurried after jill aware that kyle was at her back she could feel his gaze traveling over the back of her bare legs and was grateful the jacket covered at least her behind damn kyle muttered several moments later as they stared at the third exit door theyd approached since leaving the washroom this like the two before it was chained shut the door by the gymnasium must be the only one they left open tonight jill suggested they should have a second door unlocked in case of fire kyle said with a frown maybe they do on the other side of the gym claire suggested both kyle and jill peered at her their gazes sliding over her skimpy wear they had managed to avoid being seen so far the first door they had tried had been the only one with any real risk of being seen the last two were down halls no one had any real business being down including themselves under normal circumstances the gym bisects this end of the school kyle pointed out the only way to get to the other side is through the gym or across the stage claire said kyle blinked i forgot about the stage he acknowledged the small gymnasium was used for plays as well as sports or had been when theyd attended murphy high its curtained off tonight jill began to grin we can sneak across it to the other side and slip out unseen okay kyle took an arm of each of them and turned back the way theyd come luck seemed to be on their side and they reached the door to the back of the stage unseen all three of them sighed with relief as they slipped into the dark alcove at the foot of the stairs leading onstageuntil the door closed leaving them in utter blackness i cant see a thing jill complained in a whisper her hand grabbing at claires arm just wait here a minute until our eyes adjust kyle suggested they waited several minutes listening to someone giving a speech in the gymnasium itself from the alcove the voice was really just a low incomprehensible drone occasionally punctuated by clapping or laughter from the reunion attendees but it was soothing in its tenor okay kyle said after several useless moments had passed and their vision didnt improve i guess this is as good as it gets ill lead the way claire you take my hand jill you hold on to claire claire almost protested that she couldnt hold the jacket closed if both her hands were occupied but then let the matter drop after all it was so dark no one would be able to see if the coat hung open shed just retrieve her hand before they slipped out through the door on the opposite side kyle moved very slowly up the stairs to the stage claire followed just as slowly carefully feeling out each step as she drew jill behind her once on the stage itself it was less difficult the flat floor was easier to negotiate it was also easier to hear the speech being given on the other side of the curtain up here though claire was too tense to listen as she blindly followed kyles firm hand claire never considered that there might be anything on the stage itself to trip them up presumably kyle didnt either for he moved a bit more quickly as they crossed the floor trading caution for speed when he suddenly came to a halt with a grunt of surprise claire crashed into his back then stumbled to the side their handhold briefly broken before she could tumble to the stage floor to alert those beyond the curtains that someone was onstage she crashed into kyle and his hands closed around her waist steadying her sorry claire whispered relaxing against him what happened jill hissed tightening her hold on her hand we ran into something what i dont know claire whispered who is that a baritone voice asked over her head and claire stiffened that wasnt kyles voice the hands around her tightened as if sensing she would try to break free and claire began to struggle in earnest then stilled and blinked as she realized it was growing lighterfast i give you your prom king and prom queen from the voice died midyear and claire whirled around as the hands holding her suddenly dropped away oh god claire heard jill breathe as the stage lights suddenly went on blinding them to the sight of the people staring at thembut highlighting them on the stage youre not claire claires hands had gone up to shield her eyes the minute the lights blinked on now she turned her head toward that startled comment from kyle and saw him almost off the stage with magda by the hand the blond was wearing a long red robe over her dress and a tiara on her head she also had a furious expression on her face that said she wasnt pleased claire she glanced over her shoulder at the man who had caught her when shed stumbled and found herself staring at jack mccarthy the football player shed dated in high school he too wore a robe over his suit but his head was topped by a crown prom king and prom queen claire recalled the speaker saying magda and jack had been the prom king and prom queen the year theyd all graduated obviously theyd been waiting back here in their robes and crowns to be presented to their cograduates kyle must have stumbled into one of them and the moment their hands had broken apart confusion had set in hed ended up dragging magda offstage and shed ended in jacks arms the silence that had gripped the gymnasium suddenly gave way to the roar of shouts and clapping it was so loud claire almost didnt hear jills shout she did however notice the way she was trying to pull the lapels of kyles suit coat closed over her nakedness squealing in horror claire finished the task herself and turned her back to the pandemonium in the gymnasium only to find herself staring at a leering jack you aged well babe are you still single jack asked reaching for her no she isnt kyle snarled suddenly at their side snatching her hand he dragged her quickly offstage leaving jill to rush along behind them well id say thats a reunion no one will forget jill gasped as they ran out of the school and hurried across the parking lot claire groaned and felt her already flushed face darken a bit more she would really rather not think about what had just happened did you see magdas face jill added she was furious we stole her moment claire groaned again then sighed as they reached kyles car and leaned weakly against the side of it cheer up claire jill said rubbing her back this might have been the double date from hell but magda had it worse worse claire asked with disbelief well sure first she finds out her fiancés been cheating on her from kyle and that shes dating my castoff then ted goes and asks me to see him again then brad cruise says shes a lousy kisser and drops her in the toilet then her crowning moment as the prom queen revisited is spoiled when shes dragged offstage at least you got a standing ovation for your figure you were a hit claire groaned and dropped her head i dont think that helped jill kyle said archly get in the car no thanks you two go on ill wait for you at home jill announced but claire straightened abruptly feeling as if she was being abandoned i have my car here and you two need to talk jill said firmly as she moved off claire blew a breath out and glanced at kyle he didnt say anything but merely unlocked and opened the passenger door of his car for her to get in then closed it behind her biting her lip she watched him move around to the drivers side to slide behind the wheel a moment of silence filled the dark interior and then kyle gave a short laugh what claire asked warily i was just thinking that you were twotiming me tonight with my own sister claire grimaced it was more like a double date where i was both brad and claire this night would have gone much easier if youd just told me what was going on kyle pointed out i know claire bowed her head but you didnt trust me not to immediately rush you back to the lab and treat you like thumper he said quietly no claire said quickly i mean not really i was just afraid youd think i was a freak or that youd see you as an experimental subject rather than as yourself he finished quietly claire sighed unable to deny it that would never happen claire kyle said solemnly weve known each other too long for me to think of you as anything but the beautiful intelligent young woman you are claire felt tears well in her eyes but forced them away and quickly changed the subject to one shed been wondering about all night you said youd tell me why you didnt ask me out when we were in high school she reminded him kyle grimaced then admitted actually its because your father had a talk with me and asked me not to my father claire asked with surprise kyle nodded he said it was obvious the two of us liked each other and that we were very compatible and would probably make a good team but he cautioned me that i might want to wait until we were both out of school to start up anything with you that we already knew we liked each other so if we found we had passion together we might do something unfortunate and become pregnant or marry impulsively and destroy the possibility of two promising careers he also wanted you to gain some independence and learn you could stand on your own two feet rather than move from living with your parents to living with a husband daddy said that she asked with outrage claire couldnt believe her own father had interfered in her love life that way she was definitely going to have a chat with the man he was right claire kyle said quietly it was better this way youll have your masters soon and i my doctorate you experienced independence and know that if you arent happy you can leave and take care of yourself youve also dated other men and ive dated other women so well never wonder what we were missing out on claire blinked that sounds rather longterm kyle yeah it does doesnt it he smiled wryly then took her hands and said look claire ive known you since you were a skinny little twelveyearold brat with braces more than long enough to know i love you ive always loved you you love me claire asked with pleased surprise yes i love you too she said happily kyle leaned forward and kissed her and claire felt her heart thrill at the passion that again exploded between them they definitely had some chemistry going on there which was good to know she thought and then felt kyles hand slide beneath the jacket to find and cup one breast claire moaned and arched against him as his lips began to travel down her neck oh kyle she breathed clutching at his shoulder with one hand as the other started doing a little traveling of its own oh claire he gasped shifting around and trying to find a better position for them both without the stick shift and steering wheel to get in the way they were both panting half with excitement half with frustration when he reached past her and pulled the lever to let the upper part of her seat down claire gasped as she suddenly slammed backward in the front seat and then simply began to crawl backward leading him into the backseat where the steering wheel and stick shift wouldnt be a problem kyle growled and followed tugging the sides of his jacket aside to leave her exposed to him as he joined her on the backseat then he paused and glanced around blinking at the sight of the already fogged window he frowned and reluctantly offered we could go back to the house too far claire muttered reaching for him she then paused and smiled wryly as she realized they were so eager for each other that they were about to make love in the back of a car like a pair of teenagers shaking her head she said daddy was right oh yeah kyle admitted wryly stretching himself so he lay half on her and half on the seat and then he kissed her again shuddering and moaning she arched against him again then gasped with excitement as his hand found and cupped the center of him moaning into his mouth she shifted her hips upward into the touch then reached to find him as well smiling against his mouth as he groaned in response to her own hand covering him he was already hard but his erection was still growing and she blinked her eyes open in surprise as his more than healthy erection continued to grow under her hand and grow and grow dear god she thought faintly shed hit the jackpot the man was really well endowed kyle broke their kiss and moved his mouth to her ear to murmur did i mention the destabilizer ray was still on when i ran into the experiment chamber to drag you out i discovered the effect itd had and my new abilities in the parking lot of the grocery store this afternoon when i went to get groceries claires eyes widened at this news you mean youre doing this youre shifting to make it bigger he nodded then caught the lobe of her ear in his teeth and sucked lightly anything for my ladys pleasure but kyle she cried you shouldnt be shifting what about the possibility of destabilizing the cells further to the point of breakdown kyle straightened with a sigh i dont really think thats likely mostly i just didnt want to have to share you with jill anymore tonight he said then added with a wry smile getting you naked was also a consideration claire narrowed her eyes on him kyle you may be able to fool jill with that but im as savvy on the experiment as you are i know there is some worry that some small worry he acknowledged but very small and youre worth the risk oh kyle claire breathed pulling him back down toward her thats just the sweetest thing ever epilogue five years later i cant believe kyle agreed to babysit jill said as they got out of the car claire laughed as she led the way around to the trunk to unload the goods theyd bought he knew i wanted a special dress for the graduation next week i have to look good when i become dr claire lockhart jill smiled faintly at her obvious pride in finally achieving her doctorate but shook her head still oh come on claire chided kyles a great dad he loves little beth jill snorted he loses little beth every time he babysits and it drives him wild claire laughed again the laugh of a wife and mother who was happy and satisfied it was five years since their high school reunion and her first date with kyle lockhart four years since shed become mrs claire lockhart and two years since theyd had their first child claire was now three months pregnant with their second child and already couldnt wait for beths little brother or sister to be born she was hoping for a boy nothing would make her happier than giving kyle a son to go with his daughter kyle claire yelled as she led jill into the house were back a childish giggle answered her from the end of the hall and claire started slowly forward carefully scanning the floor as she moved toward the kitchen she was nearly at the kitchen door when she stopped abruptly and shook her head you little dickens claire chided are you playing hide and seek with your daddy again the uneven bit of floor shed noted gave another little giggle and suddenly shifted into a naked baby girl with curly strawberry blond hair and big blue eyes claire kyle came rushing down the stairs his hair and clothes a tousled mess his eyes slightly frantic and a diaper and pink dress in hand i cant find beth she shed her clothes and is hiding on me again she he paused blinking abruptly as he noted the child standing leaning against her mothers knee oh beth kyle breathed with relief hurrying forward to scoop her up into his arms naughty girl scaring daddy like that when his daughters only response was to giggle kyle shook his head and bent to kiss claire softly on the lips i love you he breathed by her ear before straightening and i love you claire assured him she watched with a soft smile as kyle moved off down the hall reprimanding their daughter as he went five years had passed since the day theyd both been exposed to the destabilizer theyd managed to keep their secret and still see john heathcliffe lose his position for his attempt to test the destabilizer on a human and so farmuch to their relief since theyd passed their condition on to their childthere didnt appear to be any terrible side effects to the exposure to the destabilizer if anything it tended to make life more than

everywhere with stories of the unexpected visit her official website at wwwlynsaysandsnet chaotic kelley armstrong for alexander and marcus who keep my life chaotic but in a good way so what kind of stories do you cover he asked bathing my face in champagne fumes bat boy goes to college elvis shrine found on mars he laughed without waiting for me to answer god i cant believe people actually buy those rags obviously they must or you wouldnt have a job my standard line flew to my lips something about tabloids functioning as a source of entertainment not news quirky pieces of fiction that people could read and chuckle over before facing the horrors of the daily paper i choked it back and forced myself to smile up at him i did a hell spawn feature once i said as brightly as i could manage thats true newss version of bat boy i covered his graduation from kindergarten he was so cute with a little mortarboard perched on his horns i crossed my fingers under my cocktail napkin and prayed for the look the curl of the lip the widening of the eyes as they frantically searched for an escape escape would be so easya crowded museum gala everyone in evening wearcome on douglas just excuse yourself to use the bathroom and conveniently forget where you left me he threw back his head and laughed hell spawns kindergarten graduation now thats a fun job you know what the highlight of my workweek is nine holes of golf with the other avps see now that was the problem with guys like douglasthey werent evil boring boorish and borderline obnoxious but not so awful that you could justify abandoning them so you were stuck hoping theyd be the ones to declare the date a dud and beg off early dinner had been a mistake i should have insisted we meet here at the party so if things didnt go well wed have only been sentenced to a couple hours of each others company but he invited me to dinner first and even as id been thinking no my mouth had done the right thing the polite thing and said sure dinner would be great id spent fortyfive minutes at the table by myself fending off sympathetic youve been stood up looks from the servers and watching my salad wither on the plate then douglas had arrivedand id spent the next hour listening to him complain about the cause of his lateness some corporate calamity too complex for my laypersons brain to comprehend it wasnt until we were here at the opening of the museums new wing that hed even gotten around to asking what i did for a living so whats the weirdest story youve ever covered he asked i laughed oh there would be plenty of contenders for that one just last week i had this ufo what about celebrities he cut in tabloids cover that right celebrity gossip whats the best one of those stories youve done ummm none true news includes some celebrity stories but im strictly the weird tales girl mainly paranormal although paranormal like ghosts again he didnt wait for me to answer our frat house was supposed to be haunted frederick and iyour brotherinlaw and i were frat brothers but i guess your mother told you that anyway one night my poor mother reduced to canvassing my sisters husbands college buddies for potential mates for her youngest child shed long since gone through every eligible bachelor she knew personally i dont need you to find me dates mom i said the last time as id said the hundred times before im not so bad at it myself dates yes relationships no i swear hope you go out of your way to find men you wouldnt want to know for more than a weekend yes i know youre only twentysix hardly an old maid and im not saying you need to settle down but you could really use some stability in your life dear i know youve had a rough go of it what do you expect i wanted to say sometimes you gave me a demon for a dad of course that wasnt fair mom didnt know what my father was id been born nine months after my parents separated and grown up assuming like everyone else that i was my fathers parting shot before hed run off with his nurse only at eighteen had i begun to suspect otherwise when id realized that my feelings of being different were more than adolescent alienation douglas finished his haunted frat house story then asked so what kind of education does a tabloid writer need obviously you dont go to journalism school for that actually i did he had the grace to flush oh uhbut you wouldnt need to right i mean its not real reporting or anything i searched his face for some sign of condescension none he was a jerk but not a malicious one damn another excuse lost i had a halfdozen girlfriends who wouldnt need a justification for ending this date early whod just cut and run so why couldnt i i was halfdemon for gods sake i could be as nasty as i wanted i scanned the room the gala was being held in the reception hall which was alsoas discreet signs everywhere reminded usavailable for weddings parties and corporate events a jazz trio played in the corner beside a portable parquet dance floor that was small enough to be a solo stage as if the organizers acknowledged this wasnt a dancing crowd but felt obligated to provide something most of the guests were big business so the main event here was schmoozing fostering contacts while basking in the feelgood glow of supporting the arts largescale artifact replicas such as statues and urns dotted the room reminding guests where they were and whyalthough the pieces seemed to be getting more use as coatracks and leaning posts the buffet table looks amazing i said is that poached salmon wild i hope but you cant be too careful these days i had dinner with a client last week and hed been to a fivestar restaurant in new york the week before and theyd served farmfed salmon do people just not read the papers you might as well eat puffer fish which reminds me of the time i was in tokyo hold that thought i said im going to grab something and scoot back i bolted before he could stop me as i crossed the floor to the buffet i was keenly aware of eyes turning my way a wonderful feeling for a womanif those eyes are sweeping over her in admiration and envy not glued to her dress in what the hell is she wearing bemusement it was the dresss fault it had screamed to me from across the store a canary yellow beacon in the rack of blacks and olive greens and navy blues a ray of sunshine in the night thats how id pictured myself in it cutting a swath through the darkness in my slinky bright yellow dress ray of sunshine i looked like a banana in heels sadly it wasnt my first fashion disaster the truly sad part was that i had no excuse for my lack of dress sense my mother routinely showed up on the local society papers as a shining example of the wellbred and welldressed my sister had paid her way through law school by modeling even my brothers had both made the annual best dressed bachelor lists before their marriages disqualified them it didnt matter my whole family could have accompanied me to that store told meyet againthat yellow was the worst color anyone with dark hair and a dark complexion could choose and id still have walked out with this dress blinded by my sunbright delusions at least i hadnt spilled anything on it i paused midstride and looked down at myself nope nothing spilled yet and as long as i stuck to white wine and saucefree food id be fine i picked up a plate and surveyed the table a roast duck centerpiece surrounded by poached salmon marinated prawns on ice chocolatecovered strawberriesi wasnt hungry but theres always room for chocolatecovered strawberries as i reached for one my vision clouded oh god not now i tried to force the vision back concentrate on the present the buffet table the smell of perfume circling the room the soft jazz notes floating past focus on that keep myself grounded in the everything went dark images smells and sounds flickered past hard and fast like physical blows a forestthe shriek of an owlthe loamy smell of wet earththe thunder of running pawsa flash of black fura snarlteeth flashingthe sharp taste of i ricocheted from my vision so fast i had to grab the edge of the table to steady myself i swallowed and tasted blood as if id bitten my tongue a deep breath then i opened my eyes there in the center of the table wasnt a roast duck but a newly dead one ripped apart bloodied feathers scattered over the ice and prawns and poached salmon steaming entrails spilling out on the white tablecloth i wheeled smacked into a man standing behind me and knocked the plate from his hands i dove to grab it but my charm bracelet snagged on his sleeve and i nearly yanked him down with me the plate hit the floor shards of china flying in every direction oh im so sorry i said a soft chuckle quite all right im better off without the added cholesterol my doctor will thank you i fumbled to extricate his sleeve from my bracelet he reached down hand brushing mine and with a deft twist set us free as he did i got my first glimpse of him and inwardly groaned if i had to make a fool of myself it would be in front of someone like this who looked as if hed never made a fool of himself in his life tall dark and handsome he was elegance personified marred only by a slight hawkish cast to his face every response to my stammered apologies was witty and charming every move as we untangled was fluid and graceful the kind of guy you expected to speak with a crisp british accent and order his martinis shaken not stirred as a bevy of serving staff rushed in to clean up i apologized one last time and he smiled his last reassurance as sincere as his first but his gaze grown distant as if hed mentally already moved on and in five minutes would forget me altogetherwhich under the circumstances i didnt mind at all as i walked back to douglas the working big ben replica clock in the middle of the room chimed the hour ten oclock already no that made sensewith douglas being almost an hour late for dinner we hadnt arrived at the gala until past nine i hurried over to him theres a he cut me short with a discreet nod toward my bodice you have a spot he whispered i looked down to see a dimesized blob of marinara sauce beside my left breast fallout from the buffet table debacle naturally if food flew id catch some and in the worst possible place i thanked him and tried to blot it with my napkin it grew from a dime to a quarter and i stretched my purse strap to cover it i was going to say theres a special behindthescenes tour of the new exhibit starting now i said id love to see it and it would be a great way to meet people minglesave me from another two hours of your corporate war stories speaking of mingling did you see whos here he directed my attention to a group of middleaged couples wedged between a bronze urn and a terracotta bull robert baird he whispered reverently he paused as if waiting for me to drop and touch my forehead to the floor ceo of baird enterprises he said oh well if you know him i guess we could i dont but im sure you donot directly maybe but his wife and your mother both serve on the ryerson foundation board and you thought i could introduce you you would thanks hope youre a gem sure right after the tour too late he was already heading for the bairds i sighed adjusted my purse strap and followed thirty minutes later the tour was over the attendees were returning gushing over the new exhibitand i was still stuck with douglas and the bairds now that id won him an audience he wasnt leaving until they did i began to wonder whether hed notice if i left maybe i could slip away conduct a little selfguided tour douglas put his arm around my waist and leaned into me as if to take some of the weight off his feet i bit back a growl of frustration fixed on my best gosh this is all so interesting smile and did what im sure every other significant other in the group had done an hour ago turned off and tuned out while every other partners mind slid to mundanities like juggling the childrens schedules planning next weekends dinner party or contemplating the report he or she had to write for work mine went straight to the dark realm of human suffering evil and chaos i cant help it the moment i let my mind wander it turns into a dedicated chaos receiver picking up every nearby trouble frequency unlike the buffet table vision these werent mental blackouts more like semidozing that state right before sleep where youre still conscious but the dream world starts to encroach on reality the first thing i saw was a woman sitting at mrs bairds feet her knees pulled up under her party dress her makeup running her shoulders heaving with silent sobs as the apparition vanished i felt my gaze slide to the left and i knew somewhere down a hall id find a woman huddled and sobbing in some quiet place maybe someone had called with bad news or maybe shed seen her husbands hand snake onto another womans thigh i never knew the causes only the outcomes tonight a mans voice hissed at my ear he had to do it tonight while the offices are empty i didnt bother looking beside me instead i let my subconscious draw my attention across the room to two men near the door one was shaking his head the others face was taut as he talked quickly the voices faded and others took their placeangry words accusations whimpers sobs a babel of voices joined in the common tongue of chaos images flashed superimposed on reality burning themselves onto my retinas an unending parade of chaos in every conceivable form from grief to rage to sorrow to jealousy to hate i saw heard felt experienced it all and the worst of it even as my brain rebelled throwing up every proper reaction horror sympathy and anger my soul drank it in like the finest champagne reveling in the sweet taste and the bubbles popping against my tongue and the delicious caress of giddy lightheadedness every halfdemon has a power inherited from his or her father some can create fire some can change the weather some can even move objects with their minds this was mine for six years id struggled with my growing power this innate radar for chaos this thirst for it id fought like the most selfaware junkie knowing my addiction would destroy me but unable to stop chasing it years of dark moods dark days and darker thoughts thensalvation through my growing network of halfdemon contacts someone had found me someone who could help i wouldnt say i was surprised for community support you cant beat the supernatural world most races had formed core groups centuries ago like the witch covens werewolf packs sorcerer cabalswhen you live in a world that doesnt know you exist and it seems best to keep it that way community is a must for everything from training to medical care halfdemons are often considered the least communal of the races but id argue the opposite we may not have a core group or hold meetings or police our own but the halfdemon regional communities encompass everyone in that region which is more than i can say for the others because we lack the family support of the hereditary races halfdemons are always on the lookout for others and once youre found a world of support opens up to you so when a local halfdemon i knew only through a mutual acquaintance called me i wasnt surprised and when she asked me to meet with someone who might be able to help me hone and control my powers i didnt say no the meeting had been scheduled for lunch at a sidewalk café someplace public and private at the same time which reassured me from the start id arrived to find just one person at the table a slight fairhaired man in his thirties dressed business casual like everyone else in the restaurant handsome in a delicate way wellmannered with an easy smile and warm brown eyes tristan robard had put me at ease from that first handshake wed ordered a pitcher of sangria chatted about local events and spent the first half of the meal getting a sense of each other then halfway through lunch hed looked up from his salad met my gaze and said have you ever heard of the interracial council when i hesitated he laughed they really need a better name dont they the sumerian council the grand guild or something like that thats the problem with trying to be understatedif you dont give yourself a fancy name no one remembers who the heck you are get a good name a clever slogan a nice logo he grinned then people would remember who you are and more importantly remember you when they need you is thatits the delegates council isnt it the heads of the various supernatural racesthe american ones at least exactly do you know what the council does i made a face sorry only the vaguest idea im afraid i smiled like you said they need a better marketing plan theyre supposed to help supernaturals right general policing resolving conflicts between groups protect and serve thats the councils mottoor it would be if they had one the problem is that for about twenty years theyve been slipping so far under the radar that no one knows theyre there so no one reports problems theyre trying to fix that now and step one is broadening their reach recruiting so to speak new delegates you mean he laughed no those positions are filled and far loftier than you or i can aspire tofor now at least what theyre doing instead is creating a network of eyes on the ground supernaturals willing to join the payroll look for trouble and eventually help them solve it my hand clenched around my napkin as i struggled to keep my face neutral help look for trouble was there anyone better suited for such a task if i could helpuse my power for goodoh god please i dont think i breathed for that next minute waiting for him to go on in particular they want people in careers suited to troubleshooting like law enforcement officers social workers or he met my gaze and smiled journalists and the ideal candidate would be someone not only with a suitable job but from a race that could prove equally useful werewolves or vampires for their tracking skills or maybehis smile grew to a grina halfdemon with a nose for trouble you mean the words jammed in my throat on behalf of the council hope id like to offer you a job and so it began with tristan as my contact id been working for the council for eighteen months now i hadnt been fortunate enough to meet the delegates to thank them personally but in the meantime i thanked them with every job i did putting my all into each task they assigned me however simple tristan had gotten me the job at true news not exactly a prestigious position for an upandcoming journalist but i knew it would help the council and that was more important than my professional ego tabloids do stumble on the truth now and then and its usually trouble a careless vampire an angry halfdemon a powerhungry sorcerer as tristan had taught me my powers were particularly honed for supernatural trouble so i used my job at the paper to sniff it out i was good at my job damn good so after the first year the council had expanded my duties to cover bounty hunting supernaturals who cause trouble often flee with the right cues i could find supernaturals even when they werent creating chaos if they came near my part of the country i could sniff out the guilty party then call in the cavalry for this the council paid me and paid me well but the best part wasnt the money it was the guiltfree excuse to quench my thirst for chaos to help the council i needed to hone my powers and to do that i had to practice i had a long way to goi still picked up random visions like that silly one with the duck whod probably seen his mother ripped apart by a dog or some such nonsense but i was improving and while i was i had every excuse to indulge in the chaos around me so when my mind wandered during the conversation thats exactly what i didpracticed i concentrated on picking out specific audio threads and visual images pulling them to the forefront and holding them there when they threatened to fade behind stronger signals the one i was working on was a very mundane marital spat a couple trading hissed volleys of you never listen to me and why do you always do this the kind of fights every relationship falls into in times of stressor so my siblings and friends told merelationships as my mother pointed out are not my forte theres too much in my life i cant share so i concentrate on friends family work and my job with the council and try to forget what im missing when i hear stuff like this meaningless bickering ruining what should have been a romantic night together im not convinced that im missing anything the very banality of the fight made it a perfect practice target even at a social function like this there were a halfdozen stronger sources of chaos happening simultaneously and my mind kept trying to lead me astray like a puppy straining on the leash in a new park keeping my focus on the bickering couple was a struggle and you arent supposed to be back here sir said a gruff voice in my ear this area is offlimits to guests i mentally waved the voice aside like a buzzing mosquito back to the couple the husband was bitching about the wife ordering fish for dinner when she knew he hated the smell of it which is why i had it when we were out she snapped so i dont stink up the kitchen cooking it and what the the same gruff voice now shrill with alarm my head shot up pulse accelerating body tense with anticipation as if my mental hound had just caught the scent of fresh tbone steak no please the plea slid into a wordless scream one syllable one split second then the scream was cut short and i was left hanging there straining for more i whipped my thoughts back and turned to pinpoint the source of the chaos another jolt this one too dark too strong even for me like that last gulp of champagne when youve already had too much and your stomach lurches in rebellion the sweetness turning acidsour hope douglass hand slipped from my waist and he leaned toward my ear to whisper are you okay bathroom i managed the champagne here let me take you i brushed him off with a smile then i made my way across the room my legs shaking hoping i wasnt staggering by the time i reached the hall the shock of that mental jolt had been replaced with an oddly calm curiosity a few more steps and i began to wonder whether id been picking up a chaosmemory i often sensed strong residual vibes from events long past like that dead buffet duck im working on learning to distinguish residuals from current sources but im always secondguessing myself i arrived at the end of the hall where it split into two to the right i could detect traces of the source that had bitchslapped me but i also caught another fresher source of trouble to the left my attention naturally swung left the chaospuppy again far more interested in that squirrel gamboling in plain sight than an old rabbit trail i gave in to the impulse already ninety percent convinced that whatever id felt had been a chaosmemory i looked around then slipped past the sign reminding guests that this area wasnt part of the gala in other words keep out worded nicely to avoid insulting current and future museum benefactors as the sounds of the party faded behind me the clicking of my heels grew louder i stopped backed into a recessed doorway and removed them then with the shoe straps threaded through my purse strap i leaned out of the doorway looked both ways crept out and padded down the hall id nearly made it to the end when a flashlight beam bounced off the walls i backpedaled heart tripping a security guards shoes clomped through the next room then receded i started out again at the end of the hall i peeked into the next room the chaos signal was stronger now a sirens call luring me in it came from down yet another darkened hallway as i stepped into the room a red light blinked a surveillance camera shit again i scooted into the hall i crouched nearly to the floor then shuffled forward too low for the camera to pick up i craned my head back to look for that light there it was on a video camera lens fixed on the display cases squinting i visually charted a safe path around the perimeter still crouched face turned from the camera i started forward it wasnt easy moving in the near darkness through an unfamiliar room dotted with obstaclespriceless obstacles but i reveled in every terrified heart thump part of me wanted to rise above that to dismiss this as an inconvenienteven sillypart of my job skulking about dark corridors avoiding security guards i blame my upbringing in a world that prized detachment and emotional control but that only made the thrill that much more precious the glittering allure of the forbiddenor at least the unseemly i made it to the next hall this time i had the foresight to look before i strolled in i needed more practice at this sort of thing my bounty hunting missions often required some degree of stealth and spying another skill i didnt mind having an excuse to hone as i peered around the corner i saw another corridor this one wide and inviting with a carpeted floor and benches paintings and prints decorated the left wall the right needed no adornmentit was a sloping sheet of glass overlooking the special exhibit gallery below i had seen tutankhamen in that gallery relics from the titanic peat bog mummies and most recently feathered dinosaurs now if i remembered correctly it displayed a traveling collection of jewelry this secondstory viewing hall stretched along two sides of the gallery below through the glass i saw something move on the adjoining side the pale circle of a face i eased back but the face stayed where it was bobbing only slightly as if the owner were cleaning the glass a janitor was my trouble alert on the fritz again i really needed more practice a shard of light reflected off the glass on the other side again i moved back expecting the guard with his bouncing flashlight but by then my eyes had adjusted enough for me to see a dark figure beneath that pale face and the light had reflected off a sheet of glassin his darkgloved hands i bit back a laugh so thats what id picked up not a janitor or some bored partygoer wandering around offlimits areas but a robberyinprogress my gaze still fixed on the wouldbe thief i reached into my purse my fingers brushed two objects that tristan insisted i carry at all times a gun and a pair of handcuffs even tonight hed been so concerned for my safety that hed had me meet someone from the security detail before id gone to dinner pass my gun and cuffs to him and pick them up again inside the gala circumventing the security at the door overkill but it was sweet of him to care id rolled my eyes as id gone through tristans cloakanddagger routine with the gun and cuffs but now i was actually in a position where they could come in handy that would add some excitement to my night but no apprehending a thief wasnt my job no matter how tempting instead i pulled out my cell phone to call the police an unexpected positive use for my powers across the way the thief was climbing over the edge through the hole hed cut in the glass now this would be interesting how would he get down rappel or lower himself like tom cruise in mission impossible curiosity stayed my finger on the phone buttons id just see this then back out the man jumped i sucked in a gasp my god it was at least thirty feet down was he crazy surely hed break the man landed on his feet as easily as if hed hopped off a twofoot ledge i put my phone away no human could make that leap not like that i knew now why id picked up the trouble signal so clearly from so far a supernatural thief this was my job after all the figure moved across the welllit gallery his back was to me as he started working on the security panel what was he knowing his supernatural race would help the first time id followed a paranormal lead from true news without council backup id ended up with seconddegree burns from a very pissedoff fire halfdemon my own fault hed been torching abandoned buildings what did i think his demonic power was i looked down at the man no clues there there never were halfdemons witches sorcerers werewolves vampiresyou couldnt tell by looking or with the vampires and werewolves id heard you couldnt tell ive never met one of either race both being rare he could be a vampire vampires had more than their share of thievesnatural stealth combined with invulnerability made it a good career choice as he continued working on the security panel i ran through a few other possibilities so id be prepared my mental databanks were overflowing with supernatural facts most for types i had never and maybe would never meet sometimes poring over my black market reference books i felt like an overeager army recruit digesting ballistic tables for weapons hed never fire tactical manuals for situations hed never encounter yep i was a keener devouring everything in an effort to be all that i could be the council had taken a chance on me and turned my life around and damned if i wasnt going to give them all i had to give security system disabled the man walked to the display and with a few adroit moves scooped up three pieces of jewelry as easily as if hed been swiping loose candy from a store shelf as he moved something about him looked familiar when he did turn face glowing in the display lights i let out a silent oath it was the man id crashed into at the buffet table the oath was for meid been inches from a supernatural and hadnt noticed i could blame that silly dead duck vision and the ensuing confusion but i couldnt rest on excuses i needed to be better than that jewelry stashed in an inside breast pocket the man crossed the floor i pulled the gun from my purse and crept forward crouched to stay under the glass when he came through that open window again id wait how was he going to climb out of it he hadnt left a ropemeaning he didnt plan to exit the way hed come in shit i popped my head over the window ledge to see him at the door it was barred on the insidevertical metal barsthe extra security hidden from passersby who would see only a closed door the man reached one gloved hand through the bars and pushed the handle the door opened a crack any electronic security having been overridden from the panel hed disabled great but that still left those metal bars he took hold of the nearest bar flexed his hand and pulled as i stared he pried open a space big enough to slip through and wake up girl hes going to get away i snapped my hanging jaw shut and broke into a hunchedover jog as i moved i mentally ran through the layout of the museum take the first junction and thered be back stairs to the main level the stairs led to an emergency exit but the stairwell itself could be used without tripping a fire alarm a courtesy to museumgoers who knew their way around and didnt care to cross to the main stairs and elevator but even if opening the door didnt set off a fire alarm did it trigger anything else maybe a signal in the security station i couldnt worry about that when i hit the doorway i quickly checked for security cameras saw none pushed open the door and tore down the steps pulse racing i forced myself to slow enough to peek out the main level door first it opened into a dark hallway no security cameras in sight i put on my shoes stuffed my charm bracelet into my purse and stepped out as i hurried down the hall i put the finishing touches on my plan was it a good plan of course not i needed time for that the best i could do was concentrate on him his situation his certain desire to get the hell out of the museum before the theft was discovered sure enough i looked around the next corner to see the thief step into the welllit main hall leading to the front door cheeky bastard waltzing right out the front he wasnt even hurrying i did hurry i raced down the hall and called excuse me he didnt slowor speed up just tipped his head to a trio of women at the coat check i picked up my pace he made it to the door and paused to hold it open for an exiting elderly couple i covered the last few paces at a jog he saw me thenthe yellow dress did it im sure a friendly smile and nod he did remember me im sure in his profession he made it a rule to remember anyone who might be able to identify him later my bracelet i said breathing hard as if id chased him from the party charmmy charm braceletit snagged slow down his fingers touched my arm and he frowned in polite concern here lets step out of the way his fingers still resting on my arm he steered me into a side hall a scant yard or so in far enough from the door to speak privately but not so far from others to alarm me damn smoothand damn calm for a guy with a pocketful of stolen jewelry my bracelet snagged on your jacket i said in the buffet line yes of course it isnt broken is it his frown grew i did try to be careful so i hope its gone i noticed it right away and ive been trying to find you ever since it must have been caught on your jacket or slid off into your pocket or or more likely fell onto the floor im sorry but if it did catch on mehe lifted his arms and displayed his sleevesits long since fallen off and it didntanother demonstration reaching into his pocketsfall in here it must be on the floor somewhere it isnt i checked everywhere frustration darted behind his eyes then i would suggest as reprehensible as the thought is that someone picked it up with no intention of returning it reprehensible amazing he could say that with a straight face then again i suspected he could say pretty much anything with a straight face you mean someone stole it i said possibly although considering the guest list i realize thats hard to believe oh i believe it i said letting my voice harden i wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt but your conclusion just proved me wrong it didnt fall into your pocket did it he chased away his surprise with a laugh i believe someone has had one glass of champagne too many what on earth would i do with acheap bauble like that he faltered on cheap bauble the man could spin lies with a face sincere enough to fool the angels but lying about his specialty gave him pause even in that brief moment of untangling my bracelet he recognized it for what it wasa valuable heirloom each charm custommade i was surprised he hadnt tried to nick it in the confusion of our collision he continued and if i recall correctly you bumped into me i tripped over youand im pretty sure that wasnt an accident you think i tripped a security guard glanced down the hall he lowered his voice i assure you i didnt steal your bracelet and i would appreciate if you didnt accuse me quite so publicly you think this is public i strode past him toward the main hall lets make this public well catch up with that guard you let him search you and if im wrong he grabbed my arm his grip tight then loosening as i turned toward him he managed a smile i would rather not end my night being frisked why dont i help you search for it and if we dont find it ill willingly submit to the search i pretended to think it over then nodded last time i saw it was when you freed it from your jacket i said then i went to the cloakroom to get my scarf to cover this i pointed to the marinara spot and i noticed the bracelet was gone maybe i paused when i was looking for the cloakroom i walked into the wrong roomit was dark and i brushed against something perfect lets start there then as we walked down the semidark hall music and chatter drifting in from the party beyond i prayed the door would be open the room i had in mind was a janitorial closet id discovered in fourth grade when my best friend and i had hidden to avoid our teacher after wed been caught ducking out of the pottery exhibit and sneaking into the arms and armor one my fault id loved that gallery even more than mummies and dinosaurs those marvelous ancient weapons where i could even at eight stand in front of the display close my eyes and hear the clash of metal on metal smell the bloodstreaked sweat see the rearing horses feel the hate the fear the panicand feel my own soul rise to drink it in at the time perhaps thankfully id seen nothing wrong with my fixations nor had anyone around meat my mothers insistencechalking it up to a childs bloodthirsty imagination my second visit to the janitorial closet had no such demonic backstory only the raging hormones of youth id been with a cute boy and a dark closet held infinitely more attraction than even the weaponry exhibits on a tenthgrade field trip if the door wasnt open i had a backup plan but i really hoped here i said he waved at the door this one i nodded and he reached for the handle i slid my hand into my purse crossed my fingers and the door opened seems to be a janitors closet he said how far in did you i pressed the gun barrel against the small of his back he stiffened as if recognizing the sensation at this point he could call for help even just cry out but in my experience no supernatural likes calling attention to himselfeither that or our powers make us cocky when others would panic whatever the reason he did as i expectedonly sighed then walked into the closet i flipped on the light and closed the door behind us once inside the man turned to me and smiled nicely done an excellent trap and i admit myself caught my cuff links are gold and youre welcome to them but if youd prefer cash theres a few hundred in my wallet no banking or credit cards im afraid i believe you have something more valuable check your inside breast pocket the left side surprise darted behind his blue eyes but he masked it with a laugh well done again and again i surrender and offer my forfeit your choice of the bounty he started to reach into his pocket uhuh hands out i said i dont want any of your bounty but i think the museum does ah museum security i presume i believe you might find my offer morelucrative than the pat on the back the museum will give you nice try im not interested in a bribe im impressed and im sure your superiors will be as well you see they hired me to test their security system they didnt inform your team to test you as well your efficiency and if possible your integrity youve outdone their expectations and i will personally recommend you for a bonus stuff it im not museum security he only gave a small smile still unfazed so this is a citizens arrest very admirable but police wont appreciate being called for an authorized test of museum security so id suggest you reconsiderand i do hope you have a permit for carrying that gun because im not calling the police as im sure you already know our sort have special ways of handling our special problems ones better dealt with internally normally this was enough but he only arched his brows feigning confusion our sort the sort who can jump thirty feet and bend metal bars with their bare hands ah that i can explain im sure you can save it for the council his brows arched council you dont mean the jingle of the handcuffs as i pulled them from my purse swallowed his last words id heard enough already he didnt have anything important to say but would keep saying it in every possible form until i either lowered my guard or got so confused i set him free you carry handcuffs in your purse he chuckled perhaps when this misunderstanding is cleared up we can get to know each other better i drowned him out by snapping open the cuffs he only sighed and held his hands in front of him as helpful as could be that too is typical id only arrested four supernaturals so far but three of them had done just this surrendered and let themselves be taken into custody the council had a reputation for fairness and even criminals trusted them as for the fourth arrest the witchi pushed the thought back that one had been a lesson to menot every supernatural would come along easily you said council he said as i fastened the cuffs that wouldnt be the interracial council would it had some experience with them have you surprise surprise and youre adelegate im a bit young dont you think i said as i tested the cuffs no not really he murmured so youre a contract agent his brows shot up agent i hope you dont really expect me to believe that figures he might not be physically fighting back but he sure as hell was going to use whatdespite his superhuman strengthwas obviously his weapon of choice i took my scarf from my purse he continued perhaps that story works with others but im afraid whoever youre working for has underestimated my knowledge of the interracial council they dont employ i lifted the scarf he looked at it im already cuffed and i can assure you i dont need to be bound in any other way oh i think you do i jammed it into his mouth his eyes widened he looked at me eyes narrowing then with a noise almost like a snarl he turned his gaze away and let me tie the scarf wait here i said im going to make a call one last check to make sure my quarry was secure then another checkthis one outside the doorand i slipped into the hall i didnt dare go far not when i wasnt sure of his powers he wasnt a vampire the samson routine with the metal bars had disapproved that theory contrary to some legends vampires didnt have superhuman strength my guess was that he belonged to the most complex of racesmy own i couldnt recall a halfdemon type with his particular skill set but we were a varied lot with plenty of rare and poorly documented types like my own one thing i did know this meeting had been no accident and i kicked myself for not realizing that the moment tristan offered me tickets to the gala granted he did that kind of thing oftenthe perks that came with this job were phenomenal and i sometimes felt guilty accepting them id told tristan and through him the council that i didnt need any extras to boost my job satisfaction but he assured me they were all freebies like these gala tickets a gift from a grateful supernatural that would go to waste if i didnt use them still this was the second time tristan had sent me someplace and id stumbled onto a supernatural crime in progress they were testing me the council wanted to see how good my chaos nose worked and i guess i couldnt fault them for that but when i made that call i couldnt help snapping at tristan okay okay he said laughing no more tests can you blame us hope youre an expisco halfdemon were like kids with a new toy dying to see what it can do and you outdid yourself as always karl marsten caught by a halfdemon rookie agent so the councils been after this guy for a while they have which is why i should remind you that you shouldnt take down targets on your own thats why we provide backup youre too valuable it wasnt much of a risk superhuman strength or not he didnt even try to fight i paused those handcuffs will hold him wont they you said theyre specially made to hold anything supernatural a moments hesitation you cuffed him so they wont hold well hes still in that room anyway the doors closed and he cant break the cuffs hope thats not the problem i thought you knewdidnt youyou usually know what they are sometimes this time i didnt get a vision oh yes i had standing in line at the buffet with him behind me a vision of forest and fur and fangs and blood hes a werewolf i said and a very dangerous one you need to subdue him should i if hes dangerous dont you want me to wait no time as charming as marsten seems hes a werewolf the most brutal and unpredictable kind of supernatural and now hes cornered which makes him ten times as dangerous if he knows its the council who captured him hell do anything to get awaykill anyone in his path i swallowed okay so how do i subdue a werewolf disable him knock him unconscious shoot him if you have to you dont need silver bullets i know dont kill him just disable him got it i was already hanging up as tristan promised me a backup team was on the way i made it as far as the door one hand on the knob the other on my gun still hidden in my purse i turned the handle and you there i dropped the gun into my purse and wheeled as a whitehaired security guard strode toward me what are you doing in that room he said room oh this room the one i was clutching for dear life i let go of the knob and stepped away inside a broom clattered to the floor the guard turned toward the door his eyes narrowing sorry i said guess i jostled it too hard this isnt the coatroom is something clanged against a metal bucket then a clacking like nails against linoleum oh god hed changed into a wolf of course hed changed into a wolf what else would a cornered werewolf do the guard reached for the handle in that split second i saw him pulling open the door and a wolf leaping at his throat i grabbed the knob and held it its jammed see i made a show of jangling it that noise thats what i heard thats why i was trying to open it but its jammed probably locked er no i dont think the janitor has the keys oh actually then i bet youre right i said quickly its probably locked why dont you go find the janitor ill wait here the guard started to leave then paused and turned first let me try the door it might just be jammed i backed into the door so fast my head cracked against it the guard reached to steady me heels i mumbled im always tripping in them i stepped forward and let my knee give way the guard grabbed my arm as i grimaced my ankle i think i twisted it we should get you to please i said through my teeth still grimacing ill wait here all right just let me try the door first as he turned toward the door again i had no idea what to do short of falling to my knees and howling in agony he reached for the handle okay one pratfall coming up before the guard touched the knob it turned the door opened a figure stepped out karl marsten fully dressed well that was embarrassing he said with a selfdeprecating halfsmile i couldve sworn this was the bathroom and then the door jammed thank you you saved me from the even more serious embarrassment of having to call for help he shook the security guards hand then he turned to me and with a murmured thank you a tip of his head and a smile he strolled off down the hall i took a step after him miss do you want me to call a doctor doctor oh right my ankle no mydatehes a doctor ill just i looked up and down the hall the guard pointed toward the party in the opposite direction of the one marsten had taken damn i managed a weak smile and a thank you and headed back to the gala tossing in the occasional limp for good measure when i reached the party douglas was still with the bairds i tried making a beeline for the other door to go after marsten but douglas hailed me i headed over sorry i said i was justtheres an old friend over there you stay with the bairds ill just go talk friend he perked up what company does he work for shes a musician classical with the symphony his face fell ah well you go on then he nodded toward the bairds im fine here ill bet you are i thought as i hurried away and by the way my stomachs fine too thanks for asking when i reached the corner where id last seen marsten he was gone i switched on my mental radar to find him before he escaped with the jewelry yes according to tristan i had far bigger things to worry about than stolen goods butmaybe im being naïve but marsten hadnt acted like a cornered wild beast i couldnt imagine him ripping through innocent partygoers in a frenzied dash to the exit especially not when i wasnt picking up any chaos signals to suggest such a thing tristan could be quite a mother hen as hed said i was valuable expisco halfdemons were rare and one willing to work on the side of the white hats was rarer still so i understood when tristan did things like this not letting me in on a takedown keeping me sequestered from other agents or overreacting with someone like marsten but understanding isnt accepting i knew my limitations which were many and i was careful yet i had lost karl marsten and damned if i was going to sit on my butt and wait for the backup team to find him again so i practiced my developing bounty hunter skills i cleared my mind and pulled up the images id seen at the buffet table forest running fur fangs as i did i tried with debatable success not to chastise myself too much for failing to recognize the meaning of the vision from the start i knew little about werewolves like vampires they were rare and kept to themselves unlike vampires they also policed themselves meaning the council had no reason to deal with them i knew only one halfdemon whod ever even met a werewolfand she wasnt all that sure thats what it had been so i had an excuse for not leaping to hes a werewolf conclusions but again i didnt accept excuses after about a minute of mental scanning i picked up marstens frequency it was faint and flatmeaning he wasnt causing any trouble not yet i focused on the signal and followed down two dark halls skirting past the gala down another hallthe same one i started in when id first left the party i reached the fork again marstens trail went left in the direction of that chaos residual id been tracking when his theft had diverted me he was heading for the back exit still concentrating on his trail i went down the next corridor turned the cornerand was smacked by a wave of chaos marsten shit he was no a deeper calmer part of me replied its not him its here something happened here something recent id been hit by two chaos waves both originating in this area they had to be connected i pushed aside the werewolf images and focused on this new signal the voice came again that gruff voice telling someone he shouldnt be back here the plea then the scream when the wave hit me this time i only rocked on my heels half the strength of the slap id felt in the main room earlier even though i was at the apparent locus of the trouble i filed this away as a lesson in separating residuals from current chaos then closed my eyes and pivoted trying to find the exact location there around that next corner i hurried to it then walked into a wall of darkness i braced myself as the visions flashed past metal glinted a blade winked in a flashlight beam the flashlight clattered to the floor a plea no please the blade sheered down hands flew up blood sprayed i froze the vision there as i panted my heart racing i struggled to hold that last thoughtand wondered why i was holding it blood sprayed blood i fumbled in my purse for my keys took them out and turned on my penlight i waved the weak beam over the walls there blood droplets invisible in the neardarkness were the blood drops still wet i almost reached up to one before snatching my hand back look dont touch stupid standing on my tiptoes i moved the light closer to the specks they glistened still wet but drying i swung the beam to the floor and found faint smears of blood that would go undetected until they turned on the lights in the morningor noticed they were one security guard short so where was follow the trail i stopped at a door a few yards away tissue over my hand i turned the knob i halfexpected a body to fall out on top of me too many horror movies i guess the door opened into an office i shone my flashlight around nothing as the door closed behind me i grabbed it and twisted the knob to make sure it wouldnt lock me inside reassured i eased the door shut and moved toward the center of the room as i walked i picked up a twinge of trouble yes this had to be the right place so where was the a booted toe protruded from behind the desk i hurried to it the desk faced the wall with a wide gap for computer cord access behind it and thats where the killer had stuffed the body one end of the desk was against the adjoining wall and the other against a metal filing cabinet so i had to crawl onto the desk to peer behind it i shone the flashlight beam into the gap and bit back a yelp i resisted the urge to pull away with something like this i was sure the council would expect a report so i had to get a good look a man lay faceup in the gap his eyes stared at me wide with that last minute of i dont believe this is happening horror his security uniform shirt was a mess of gaping holes the edges torn shredded unlike anything a knife would do the flesh beneath the holes lookedmangled chewed it looked as if hed been a hand clamped over my mouth found something you were missing a voice hissed i kicked backward my foot connected but a second arm clamped around my neck and yanked me off the desk it spun me around and i found myself looking into a pair of blue eyes so cold and hard that my heart leaped into my throat karl marsten did you think i wouldnt smell the body when i walked by his voice was as cold and hard as his eyes all traces of smooth charm gone you would have been wiser to let me leave through the front door i pulled back my fist and plowed it toward his gut he caught my hand easily and squeezed tears of pain sprang to my eyes oh god you stupid stupid he brought his face down to mine and the thought dried up im going to let go he said his voice calm if you scream i will crush your fingers do you understand i blinked back tears and nodded he took his hand from my mouth and released the other one just enough to stop the throbbing pain but still gripped it so tightly that i didnt dare even try to wiggle my fingers i will only ask you this once he said who do you work for thei told youthe interracial council he interrupted is that so then tell me which delegate of the council hired you i was approached by a representative which delegate hes not a delegate he works for them he exhaled as if in frustration all right then which delegates have you met none i only work through my contact he cut me off with a humorless laugh oh they have you well trained dont they im sure this story has worked well for you in the past but it falls a little flat when dealing with someone who actually knows the interracial council knows most of the delegates and knows beyond any doubt that they do not have employees or recruits or agents a noise from the hall voices marsten halfturned his attention diverted just long enough for me to ram my spiked heel into his shin and wrench my hand free he grabbed for me i kicked and lashed out at the same time my nails clawing his face he fell back i ran for the door threw it open and raced into the hall a splitsecond decision run toward the voices or away from them running to them might have been safer but i couldntwouldntendanger others id already underestimated marsten once i tore down the halls marstens soles squeaked behind me as he wheeled out of the office that reminded me that he was in flat dress shoesand i was in heelswith no hope of outrunning him i grabbed the first doorknob i came to locked i dove for the one across the hall as my fingers closed around it i saw marsten running toward me the handle turned the door opened i darted through and slammed it even as i turned the lock i knew i might as well not have bothered it was a flimsy household privacy lock one that could be snapped by any strong man let alone a werewolf i reached for my purse but it wasnt on my shoulder it must have fallen when marsten yanked me off the desk no purseno gun marstens footsteps had slowed to a walk of course they had he didnt need to hurry id trapped myself in an office with no second door no windows no way to escape blockade the door the council backup team was on the way if i could slow marsten down long enough to call tristan the footsteps stopped inside the door the handle turned someone laughedthe sound close byand the handle stopped turning a drunken giggle a voice growing closer i grabbed the sides of the metal filing cabinet it didnt budge the printer stand like that would slow down a werewolf oh someone said near the door didnt see you there unless youre staff this hall is off limits marsten said oh right we were just lost the woman giggled then i suggest you turn around go back to the end of the hall and follow the sounds of the party you cant miss it i looked around for something to block the door but anything big enough was too heavy for me to move outside the man was telling marsten to mind his own business but his companion was already moving away and calling to him to do the same no time to phone tristan i needed my gaze rose to the ventilation shaft over the desk oh please you have seen too many movies i silenced the inner voice and climbed onto the desk as marsten threatened to call security as much as i appreciated the distraction the couple was providing i prayed they moved on before marsten gave up trying to handle them discreetly as the woman cajoled her partner away i quickly unscrewed the ventilation cover with a quarter from a dish of coins on the desk im coming im coming the man slurred then muttered a parting obscenity at marsten as the mans footsteps faded i yanked on the cover one side came free i tugged again but the other side caught the footsteps were almost gone palms sweating i fumbled for a better hold the cover popped off with a ping that i was sure could be heard throughout the museum i shoved the cover into the shaft grabbed the edges heaved and managed to get inside up to my breasts then i found myself stuck upper torso in butt hanging out legs flailing arms trembling with the strain of just holding myself up with no extra strength for hauling the rest of me through goddamn it id been spending three evenings a week at the gym and i couldnt do better than this the door handle turned shit shit shit id never make and another thing asshole the mans voice boomed from the end of the hall one last push boosted by a wave of relief and i heaved the rest of my torso into the shaft come on rick the woman called do you want me to go back to the party i wriggled and twisted getting my legs in and my body turned around so i was facing the shaft opening i tugged the cover from under me hooked my fingers through the slats and pulled it into place just as the doorknob twisted and the lock snapped marsten threw open the door fastas if he expected me to be standing there armed with a heavy stapler door wide he paused in the opening gaze tripping across the room nostrils flaring nostrils flaringwerewolfhe could smell me damn it i tried to twist around my shoulder knocked against the metal a dull thump but he heard it of course he heard it werewolf heightened smell heightened hearing heightened strength i knew all this so why did i keep forgetting until it was too late i was out of my league way out of it and i would pay for my hubris lets make this easy he said his smooth mask back in place you dont want to play hideandseek with me i have all the advantages and a low tolerance for frustration so well skip the games if you feel safer in your hideyhole he scanned the room youre welcome to stay there you can hear me and thats all that matters he turned slowly searching for me even as he said he wouldnt bastard i shifted my shoulders testing my space limits again too tight id been able to turn around with the vent open but without that added space i was stuck no not stuck i could move backward awkward slow and probably loud but if it came to that i would hed barely fit in hereif at allso i could still move faster than he could whoever you are youre of no interest to me he continued that means i have no particular desire to hurt you so you have a choice tell me who youre working for and ill step aside and let you out this door refuse and ill use you for leverage thats not a position you want to be in i stayed still and quiet i dont have all night he said nor do you when i hear your associates approachwhich im sure will be soonill sniff you out and the choice will be made after that whether you walk out of here depends on how willing your employer is to negotiate i said nothing as he moved his nostrils flared still searching then he stopped and smiled his gaze lifted to the ventilation shaft ah there you are a quick leap and he was on the desk as he pulled off the cover i scrambled backward i got about five feet before my shoulders hit the sides stopping me while i struggled to back up he peered into the shaft and smiled his teeth glinting in the dark i do believe youve backed yourself into a corner i wriggled but the shaft had narrowed and the more i moved the tighter i wedged myself in are you going to tell me who you work for he said i already did i snarled and i told you i know better his voice was calm conversational no trace of the cold fury from earlier youre obviously a bright young woman and quite capable of thinking on your feet as you proved earlier so why you insist on sticking to this story dont bother i know who i work for and nothing you say is going to make me secondguess thator betray them he lifted his hand to his mouth and rubbed it his gaze searching mine you didnt kill that security guard did you he said kill i gritted my teeth we both know whoand whatkilled him so dont try pinning that on me that spot on your dress i suppose youll tell me it isnt blood i snorted its the marinara sauce from the damn mussels you threw at me in the buffet line i threw he rubbed his mouth and growled or i thought it was a growl until i saw his eyes dancing and realized he was laughing all right here he reached into the shaft come on out of there i believe we both have a problem and wed best set about resolving it before your associates arrive you really think im a fool dont you he tilted his head as if considering it a fool young yes reckless yes naïve probably but foolish no not foolish you a sound from the hall a door opening then closing he swiveled his eyes narrowing as if tracking something i couldnt hear his gaze shot to the door handle and he mouthed a silent oath couldnt lock it could you i said thats the problem with breaking things they tend to stay broken he shushed me grabbed the vent cover and knocked it back into place then he peered through the slats and whispered if you want to find out whether im lyingand i think you dostay there and stay quiet marsten jumped off the desk and was halfway to the door when it opened two men strode in guns in hand part of the council security force i recognized both from other operations i crawled forward ready to push open the vent then i stopped palms against the cover i didnt need to eavesdrop to know karl marsten was full of shit i heard the web of lies hed spun when id first confronted him with the theft hed say anything to get out of thisto use me to get out of it yet there was reason to stay up here hidden and silent the perfect position to watch marsten and make sure he didnt try anything or thats what i told myself a man strolled in midthirties average height and slightly built with light brown hair and a delicate almost feminine face tristan my council contact ah karl he said i didnt know you were a patron of the arts tristan robard marsten said id say i should have known but id be lying after the last time i thought youd have the sense to leave me alone i guess i overestimated you tristans eyes narrowed i should give you credit though marsten continued you have quite a clever setup here and your young agent well done a beautiful young woman lays the most irresistible traps and it seems even im not immune he paused arent you going to ask where she is not terribly worried marsten smiled oh but you should be the one problem with using beautiful young women as bait they make equally irresistible hostages so you have her as marsten nodded i opened my mouth to call out and let tristan know i was safe tristan smiled as i said not terribly worried i blinked but shook it off of course tristan would say that he was a skilled negotiator he wouldnt let marsten know he had leverage i dont think your superiors will approve of that attitude marsten said oh but your superiors have nothing to do with this do they this is personal a little boy lashing out because the big bad wolf embarrassed him tristans jaw set i didnt embarrass you tristan marsten continued you did it to yourself you offered me a job i turned it downrespectfully and politely but that wasnt good enough because youd already promised them id do it if i refused youd need to explain that youd overreached and there was no way you were doing that so you came after me i was happy to let the matter resta rejected business proposition no cause for animositybut you came after me that was your mistake tristan give a tight laugh my mistake youre the one being held at gunpoint and youre talking about my mistake delusional to the end marsten only shrugged if you say so marsten stepped forward as if ready to go with them then he stopped ill suppose youll want me to tell you where i hid that security guard you had killed backup plan i presume tristan said nothing only reached for his cell phone marstens gaze flicked to the vent shaft then back to tristan so you didnt trust your girl to do the job if she failed youd still have a mauled security guard found at the scene of a jewel theft a little tale you could take to the interracial council tristan only smiled gaze still down as he checked messages on the phone i think the pack would be more interested in that story ah of course the werewolf pack a clever plan and one that might have workedif i hadnt been part of the pack myself for the past two years tristan looked up marsten laughed not very good at doing your homework are you thats obvious from that preposterous story you told the girl working as an agent for the interracial council im sure aaron paige adam and the other delegates will be thrilled to know they have a team of secret agents working on their behalf marsten caught tristans look and smiled surprised i know their names your story probably works much better on those who dont know the delegates personally i could toss a few more names at you including the werewolves but i doubt youd recognize them and they wouldnt appreciate me filling that void for you he paused head tilted feigning deep thought oh but i do have another name one you might find infinitely more interesting you know who paige winterbournes husband is i presume you cant possibly be that out of touch tristan stiffened ah you do know a very nice young man i did some work for him last year quite pleasant marsten frowned i hear his father isnt always so pleasant though a decent employer im sureunless he finds out one of his employees has been building his own little spy network behind his back i havent been doing anything behind benicios back he knows all about my initiative and hes very impressed oh so this is a cabalsanctioned hit funny i couldve sworn it smelled like personal revenge well what do i know a cabal kills a pack werewolfthat shouldnt cause too much trouble or i suppose it wont if the cabal doesnt know about it tristan waved to the guards get him out of here he turned and marsten started to follow then one of the guards spoke up sir what about the girl oh i wouldnt worry about her marsten said shes quite resourceful im sure shell get herself free if she hasnt already but the security guard now thats a problem you should tristan turned sharply hopes still alive is that her name of course shes alive you didnt think id marsten shook his head i suppose considering who im talking to i shouldnt need to ask oddly enough i find the best hostages are the live ones yes hope is fine and as i said will almost certainly free herself so theres no need where is she the question is wheres the dead guard the girl can take care of herself that guard sadly is beyond where is she marsten paused and rubbed his chin as if realizing he wasnt going to talk his way out of handing me over im sure he had some selfinterested reason for not wanting to do so but i was grateful for the effort nonetheless i didnt know how id face tristan knowing the truth oh godthe truth my stomach heaved ive been tricked the whole time id been up here listening as the facts rolled out id processed them without absorbing them without letting myself absorb them shes in a janitors closet marsten said tied with her own handcuffs which i thought was appropriate i can take you there youll wait here ill come back for you when im finished with her finished with me what did he mean by i pushed the thought away and as marsten gave tristan directions to the closet id used earlier i scrambled for an escape plan yes escape maybe i was being paranoid and tristan had only meant hed return when hed finished freeing me yet marstens life was in danger and id put it there tristan left with one guard when he was gone the second one backed up to the desk and gun still trained on marsten slid his rear onto it i eased the vent cover out marstens gaze shot up but he looked away before the guard noticed then flicked his fingers telling me to stay where i was as quietly as i could i moved the cover into the shaft and laid it down beside me marstens gaze met mine and he shook his head in case the waving hadnt been understood when i grabbed the edge of the vent he threw me one last glare then cleared his throat you do work for the cortezes i presume he said to the guard his voice loud in the small room the guard said nothing i gauged the distance between us then pulled my legs forward moving into a crouch ive heard the cabals frown on this marsten continued employees taking outside jobs yes i know youre working for a cabal avp so one could argue its not truly moonlighting but i suspect mr cortez wouldnt be so quick to see the distinction i braced myself on the edge of the opening marsten continued an avp using cabal resources for a personal vendetta ill wager mr cortez would like to know about that and would richly reward i jumped marsten leaped to the side out of the range of the gun i hit the guard in the back an oomph and he fell forward marsten snatched the gun then he tossed it to me the move caught me offguard and i scrambled for it but was too late and my hand knocked it flying the gun ricocheted onto the desk and tumbled down behind it marsten grabbed the guard around the neck the guard flailed marsten swung him off his feet and bashed his head against the filing cabinet as the guards body went slack marsten looked over at me still crouched on the desk staring dont worry he said i didnt kill him the last licks of chaos rippled through me i shuddered eyes rolling in rapture marstens brows arched i turned the shudder into a more appropriate shiver of fear youre sure i said he looks hes fine marsten kneeled beside the guard as he pulled my handcuffs from his pocket though i do hate to waste these on him another dig into his pocket and he tossed me my scarf since you did such a good job tying this earlier we secured the guard then marsten waved me to the door as he doublechecked my knot my fingers brushed the knob but marsten yanked me back i was going to look first i said you dont need to i can hear them he looked around you take the vent he grabbed my arm and propelled me to the desk go headfirst this time and youll be able to squeeze through after you i said no time just after you he gave me a look as if contemplating the chances of stuffing me in the shaft himself then with a soft growl hopped onto the desk he grabbed the edge of the shaft and easily swung himself up and in then paused in the opening his rear sticking out its very narrow he said im not sure i can try i said and gave him a shove he wriggled through then reached back between his legs and helped haul me up the door clicked no time to replace the cover i pulled my legs in scrunched down on my hands and knees and followed him in the movies ventilation shafts are the escape route of choice for heroes trapped in industrial buildings theyre clean and roomy and soundproof and will take you anywhere you want to go all like a habitrail system for the beleaguered protagonist on the run i dont know where hollywood buys their ventilation shafts but they dont use the same supplier as the museum we crept along shoulders whacking the sides with every few steps the sound reverberated through the shaft i could feel skin sloughing off my knees as they scraped over the rivets and imagined a snails trail of blood ribboning behind me and the dust i sneezed at least five times and managed to whack my head against the top with each one breathe through your mouth marsten whispered his voice echoing down the dark tunnel sure that helped the sneezing but then i was tasting dust as it coated my tongue would it kill the museum to spring for duct cleaning now and then i resumed crawling and smacked my face into marstens assagain warn me when you stop i mutteredagain a low chuckle at the next branch you can take the lead then you wont have that problem i willbut i suspect i wont complain about it you wont have an excuse werewolves have enhanced night vision mines been a little rusty lately you seem to be doing just fine i headbutted him in the rear now move after that we did switch positionsthree timesas we ran into three dead ends im taking the next exit marsten said on the fourth aboutface not arguing the next vent we hit he hit driving his fist into it and knocking it clattering to the floor guess i wasnt the only one getting claustrophobic marsten crawled out i started to then my dress snagged on a rivet and i tumbled out headfirst floor flying up to meet me marsten grabbed me and swung me onto my feet i regained my balance and took a deep breath of cleanreasonably cleanair well there goes two thousand dollars he muttered looking down at himself both elbows of his jacket were torn and the front of his shirt was streaked with dirt as were his face hands and pretty much every exposed inch of skin cobwebs added gray streaks to his dark hair his shoes were scuffed as were his pant knees while he surveyed the damage he looked so mournful i had to stifle a laugh well i tried to stifle it kind of dont snicker he said youre just as bad but i dont care as he brushed himself off i looked around we were in some kind of laboratory with microscopes and steel tables and what looked like pots of bones in the middle of being defleshed at any other time curiosity would have compelled me to take a closer look tonight only one thing caught my attention the exit door as i strode to it marsten grabbed my arm you cant go out like that he said oh please my life may be in danger you really think i care how i look you stay here and pretty up if you like but im bolting for the nearest exit his grip tightened as i tried to pull away i yanked harder he squeezed harder i glared at him that hurts yes i know but youll hurt a lot worse if tristan catches you we dont know that he plans to kill you he wasnt heading to that closet to congratulate you on a job well done hope he wants me dead and to do it safely without risking his own life on the repercussions he needs to clip off his loose ends that includes you and later those guards kill four people because you embarrassed him theres more to it than that what did whatever i did it came after he retaliated because i turned down his job offer it doesnt matter to a man like tristan robard killing four people to avenge his ego is perfectly reasonable he studied my face then shook his head you dont believe me fine but at least give me the benefit of the doubt by not strolling out that door and testing my theory you dont think hell have all the exits covered uhyes of course but there are plenty of other exits i know my way around good but if we start wandering the halls looking like this were going to raise alarms if not tristan and his men then a security guard or a concerned guest who will cause a fuss which will alert tristan okay lets pretty up then marsten declared his tux jacket a writeoff no big deal it was nearing midnight and jackets and ties would be coming off anyway as the party wore down under it his shirt needed only a brisk wipe down my dress had actually fared quite well with only a rip under the arm and a smear of blood on the skirt take off my nylons wipe down my dusty shoes and bloody knees with a damp paper towel and i was finebelow the neck anyway there were no mirrors and my distorted reflection in the stainless steel table wasnt very helpful here marsten said ill get your face if you can clean mine he wet a fresh paper towel in the lab sink and walked over to me i lifted my face he raised the cloth to my cheek then paused to brush cobwebs from my hair when he finished he smiled took a stray strand and wrapped it around his finger as he did i could see out of the corner of my eye that it was more than a stray strand it was a huge hunk of hair which thirty minutes ago had been battened down in an upswept twist i groaned how bad is it its a bittousled very sexy i lifted my hand to my hair and swore at least half of it had come free beyond repair without a brush and a mirrorand a halfhour of styling time i yanked out a handful of bobby pins and gave my hair a shake letting it fall down my back mmmmvery sexy down boy were fleeing for our lives here remember i raked my fingers through my hair any better a wolfish grin much you look like you just crawled out of bed damn itnot the look im aiming for he caught my hands as i tried to smooth out the damage its fine tousled yes but it looks intentional he put his hand under my chin and lifted the wet cloth again then he paused again what now i said a low chuckle i was just thinking ive never seen a woman who looked so beautiful in dirt and cobwebs trouble suits you you have no idea i muttered no im sure i dont but i certainly hope i get the chance to find out he brushed his finger over my cheek fleeing for our lives remember lets save the flattery and soulful gazing until after we escape is that a date date i jumped so fast i knocked the paper towel from his hand sorry my date douglas hell be looking for me i need to tell him tell him what dont worry i was held captive by a werewolf but im okay nowexcept for the deranged cabal sorcerer on my tail i glared up at him im serious hell be worried let him worry from what i saw its onlywhat a first maybe second date and you didnt seem very enamored hes a nice guy kind of hes not evil marstens brow shot up thats your dating criterion you know what i mean he was worried and i cant just walk out on him plus if my mother finds out i abandoned the guy she set me up with your mother sets you up blind dates with guys like that the corners of his mouth twitched she doesnt like you very much does she my mother i bit back at the rest and started again my mother is just fine which is why i wont embarrass her like this i do that enough as it is his face softened all right but while i do understand youre forgetting the whole fleeing for our lives part i took a deep breath youre right ill have toill work something out later apologize to my mother make it up to douglas i dont think you owe douglas anything he paused if we need to go past the party you can tell him make an excuse to leave and call it even i nodded and we finished getting ready i was picking cobwebs out of marstens hair when i remembered something else the gun i said i shouldve grabbed the gun i wouldnt worry about it in my experience guns are only good for threatening in combat im as likely to shoot my own foot best to avoid them altogether easy to say when you have super strength super senses fangs claws he glanced up at me as i plucked out another cobweb you are awhats the word they use a supernatural arent you sure but not all of us come with builtin defense mechanisms why do you think i carry a gun so what is your speaking of my gun its also still back there in my pursewith my bracelet damn it the braceletan heirloom i presume so you didnt mistake it for a cheap bauble after all and you still didnt try to nick it im shocked he glowered as he got to his feet what i said ive offended you i should be ashamed of myself those pieces in your pocket just fell in there didnt they damn museum displays stuff just drops off them point taken he said as he stood and smoothed his hair but no your bracelet isnt at risk valuable or not its worth more to you than to me these he reached into his jacket and transferred the jewels to his pants pocket worth something only to an insurance company which i realize is no excuse but he shrugged as for your bracelet considering its with your gun and youd probably feel safer carrying that i suggest we make that office our first stop presuming tristan has moved on i shook my head yes i want it back but i have to trust my purse will still be there when all this is done ill make sure i get it for you later later i hoped that didnt mean he planned to come back and steal something else no hed been leaving when id first stopped him he took my elbow and propelled me toward the door lets go before they find us it took a few minutes to get my bearings the laboratories werent part of your typical museum visit and thus were woefully lacking in directional signs i knew we were on the first floor which helpedexcept that most of the sprawling first floor was offices and labs which didnt help nor did the lack of windows id never noticed it before but the building was windowfree great for security and artifact preservation not so great for those needing to end their visit in a hurry there i whispered to marsten thats the media room i was there last month for a story youre a journalist i nodded not mentioning id been covering the story of an ancient curse that a former worker swore was responsible for his herpes outbreak that thought pinged another did all this mean id never cover another silly curse story an unexpected pang of panic followed the thought i liked what i did once id worked past the im too good for this phase id genuinely enjoyed tracking down ufos and hell spawn sightings far more than id ever liked covering driveby shootings and political scandals but if i wasnt working for the council and wouldnt be plugging supernatural leaks had i ever been suppressing leaks helping my fellow supernaturals survive under the cover of secrecy or had i just been covering up a cabals messes my gut twisted oh god what had i done i thought id been stop it not now i looked up at marsten were in the northeast quadrant closest to the main doors which i know we cant use but there must be an emergency exit theres one along the west side probably fifty feet from the front perfect ill watch for exit signs you listen for company we found the exit as marsten strode toward it i called it might trigger an alarm a chance im willing to take i stayed at his heels eager to be out of this place every hair on my body leaped to attention and i stopped short lips parting in an involuntary hiss then i grabbed marsten by the back of the shirt its trapped i said i said not alarmtrapped traptrapped magically they must have a witch or a sorcerer i stopped myself earlier you said something about a cabal sorcerer you meant tristan didnt you as marsten nodded i winced another unforgivable faux pas tristan had let on he was halfdemon but id never seen a display of his powers or even asked what those powers were if id known he was a sorcerer i would have been suspicious of his working for the council story witches led the interracial council and witches and sorcerers had as little as possible to do with one another the cabals were the great sorcerer achievementpowerful corporations staffed by supernaturals and run by sorcerers i knew little about cabalsevery halfdemon i knew stayed away from them and had warned me to do the same but if id realized what tristan was id have had a good idea who id really been working for what kind of trap is it marsten asked i shook my head no idea i can just tell that its there and its trouble when i caught his frown i said thats my socalled power chaos detection like you said trouble suits me your power so youre a halfdemon when i nodded his frown grew i thoughtadmittedly my knowledge of demons is next to none but i was under the impression that they were all chaotic they feed off chaos or some such thing demons yes halfdemons no halfdemons inherit their fathers special power without his affinity for chaos lucky me im the one type that gets the reverse i walked toward the door and peered at it all i can tell you about this is that someone cast a spell on it and i know as much about spells as you do about demons it might just alert tristanor it could immolate us instantaneously having no great desire to end the evening in flames i say we dont test it agreed i paused im sure then that hell have the other unguarded exits trapped too so now what well skip the fleeing part and revert to the second mode of defense hiding well start by getting that gun for you then find a safe place and try to outlast them eventually someone is bound to realize a security guard is missing and sound the alarm making it too hot for tristan to stick around or hot enough for us to escape out the front door in the confusion when we reached the hall adjoining the one with the offices marsten made me wait while he scouted when he came back i could tell the news wasnt good tristan left a guard behind he whispered either in case we come back or to forestall discovery of the crime scene maybe theyre moving the guards body getting rid of it he shook his head tristan will want it found eventually thats his backup plan but you said i stopped that was a lie wasnt it about being part of the werewolf pack notentirely im what you might call a quasimember but the alphathe pack leaderknows im not a maneater my reputation in that respect is spotless so why are you worried some membersive done things in the past to the pack and while ive had a change of heart in that regard the ink on your reprieve is still wet and you cant afford to test it yet exactly which is why you tried persuading tristan to take care of the body no i was trying to divert his attention from you he paused but yes admittedly i had a secondary goal in mind okay so why dont we look after it now take out tristans guard and we can move the body someplace safer to dispose of it later plus well have my gun one side of his mouth twitched for an amateur youre remarkably good at this sort of thing its in my genes remember but i suppose you want the guard disabled not killed preferably im not ready to completely give in to the dark side yet his smile broke through lets see what we can do then i leaned against the wall closed my eyes and focused the guard was a supernatural probably halfdemon after a moment i picked up his vibe but it was too far away to be in the first office with the body hes in the second one isnt he i whispered as marsten returned the room we escaped from marstens brows shot up supernatural radar comes with my package oh but you didnt detect me earlier he smiled not even when you ran right into me i did thats why i ran into you i shook off the urge to explain im still practicing the package doesnt come with a users manual well it worked fine this time he is in the second room replacing the vent cover cleaning up it seems good then lets ill look after him you stay he caught my expression and breathed the softest sigh just stay clear then as you said im better equipped for this provide backup if you want but dont turn this into a hostage situation exactly marsten started to leave then wheeled back to me hes coming he held his finger to my lips before i could answer his eyes narrowed as he tracked the footsteps a moment passed then he shoved me in the opposite direction prodding me to the next adjoining hall we barely made it around the corner before the guard stepped into the hall wed vacated marsten pressed me against the wall still listening body against mine as if he expected the guard to veer around the corner and open fire the footfalls grew softer the guard was leaving that would certainly make getting into the office easier marsten started to pull away from me then froze was it okay a muffled womans voice asked she giggled im kind of tipsy it was great babe marsten winced as he recognized the privacyseeking couple from earlier guess theyd found what they were looking for a door opened less than ten feet away marsten swore and looked toward the corner but it was too late to runwed risk being seen by the departing guard but if we stayed here the couple would recognize him and if the man got belligerent again the guard would hear marstens mouth dropped to mine he pushed me up against the wall his hands wrapping in my hair and pulling it up to shield the sides of our faces as he kissed me i felt a stab of disappointment his kissing was excellent of course polished and perfect just like the rest of him for most women an excellent kisser is cause for celebration but me i prefer the ardent gropes and kisses of an enthusiastic if less experienced lover behind us the man laughed looks like we arent the only ones looking for a little diversion theres an empty office right over there guys marsten raised his hand in thanks the couple moved on i let the kiss continue for five more seconds then pulled away theyre gone i said marsten frowned as if surprisedand disappointedthat id noticed i tugged my hair from his hands okay coast clear i said lets go he let out a small laugh i see i need to brush up on my kissing no you have that down pat she says with all the excitement of a teacher grading a math quiz aplus now lets move before someone else comes along we reached the office safely this time the door was locked but tristan hadnt triggerspelled it he must have assumed we wouldnt come back the door lock was only for snooping partygoers or privacyseeking couples marsten gave the handle a sharp twist and it snapped open ill find my purse i said as we hurried inside you pull the body out yes maam i flipped on the light and looked around no obvious sign of my purse it must have fallen its gone marsten said no im sure it just fell i glanced up to see him leaning over the desk you meant the body a grim nod he pulled the desk farther from the wall then glanced at me find your purse ill find this he leaped onto the desk hopped into the gap behind it bent and disappeared i resumed my purse search i looked under the desk beside it between the desk and filing cabinetevery place my purse could have fallen when marsten yanked me off the desk earlier marsten popped back over the desk started to crouch then noticed me watching what i said when he paused i have to sniff the floor then sniff the floor again he paused as if trying to think of a dignified way to do it i sighed and turned my back to give him privacy a moment later he said nothing they mustve carried him out meaning you cant pick up the trail not of the security guard at least but what about tristans guard questionable i can try but its difficult to do in human form and without getting on the floor close to the scent which is a whole lot tougher to do in a semipublic place he motioned for me to keep looking and pitched in checking the other side of the room he continued ill still try tracking i know a few tricks ah so you did get your users manual most werewolves do oh right most of you are hereditary so your father raised me and taught me everything i needed to know about following a scent a quick grin although there was usually a diamond or two at the other end your father raised you to be a thief his gaze chilled my father raised me to have a career suitable for a nonpack werewolf who cant stay in one place without being rousted by the pack or his fellow mutts the pack doesnt let he cut me off with a wave his anger receding its not like that anymore not entirely but in my fathers day a nomadic life was a must and thieving skills helped tell you what then you dont slam my mom for setting me up on blind dates and i wont slam your dad for teaching you to steal he laughed fair enough no jabs against wellmeaningif occasionally misguidedparents as for your purse its gone isnt it tristan or his guard found it when they were cleaning up and they took it to erase any sign of me being here most likely as for the body though billy the voice echoed down the hall we both froze and turned toward the closed door billy you down here then softer damn kid it was a security guard looking for his dead colleague marsten waved for me to get behind the desk and we both jumped on it just as the door opened you the guard said a flashlight beam pinged off our backs marsten slipped his arm around me in an awkward interrupted embrace we looked over our shoulders to see the same older security guard whod helped me open the janitors closet he speared marsten with a glower get lost on your way to the bathroom again sir he said this is bigger than that storage closet but im sure the young lady would be more comfortable in a hotel there are two right down the road uh oh yes of course marsten stammered we werentthat is to say we wanted to look around the museum see the sights oh i know what sights you wanted to see sir he waved us off the desk youre a long way from the dinosaur exhibits we complied getting off the desk and pretending to straighten up the guard continued to glare at marsten as if disgusted that a man wealthy enough to afford tickets to this gala couldnt spring for a bed theres a holiday inn three doors down he said as we walked past but im sure the lady would prefer the embassy which is a movement at the door stopped him one of tristans guards strode in hed swung around the right side of the door meaning he hadnt noticed the security guard against the right wall his attentionand his gunwere on us i thought i heard voices he said to us as the security guard stepped up behind him surprisingly silent for a man of his size good thing i came back tristan will the security guard pressed the barrel of his gun between the younger mans shoulder blades didnt see me huh the old guard chortled as the other man stiffened a word of advice boy always check the room before you walk into it now lower that gun the younger man spun gun going up finger on the trigger the security guards eyes widened and he froze whatever excop reflexes he had were buried under years of chasing kids off dinosaur displays and foiling amateur thieves the old guard stumbled back as if forgetting he still held a gun marsten threw himself at tristans guards back i wish i could say i did the same god how i wish i could but the truth was that i just stood there shocked into impotence like the old guard it all happened in a heartbeat not even enough time for me to feel the chaos rising and not enough time for marsten to make that fivefoot leap the young guard spun on the old and fired marsten hit the shooter in the side knocking him away even as the silencers pffttt still hung in the air even as the old guard was still falling bloody hole in his chest even as i was reeling backward from the chaos explosion i hit the floor and for a moment could only lie there system shocked by the highvoltage jolt if there was any pleasure in that shock i didnt feel it i lay there gasping mind blank then another shot snapped me from my shock and i leaped up limbs flailing as if id been jolted again marsten was crouched over tristans guard who lay in a heap neck twisted eyes open and staring the shot i said did he hit you marsten waved to a bullet hole in the wall but didnt speak just stayed crouched with his back to me his breath coming in sharp short pants i ran to the old security guard even as my fingers went to his neck i knew he was dead the bloody spot on his breast now covered half his shirt and was still growing as i looked down at him i saw him again sneaking up behind tristans guard eyes dancing as he imagined himself retelling the story of how hed singlehandedly apprehended an armed man again i heard his see ive still got it chortle as he put his gun to the young mans back the hair on my arms rose and i rubbed them trying to chase away the chill unable to pull my gaze from his body my first murder my first witness to death and only an hour earlier peering behind this desk id seen my first dead body outside a funeral home before tonight id never even seen a dead body and yet id fancied myself some kind of secret agent what had marsten said when id asked if he thought me a fool naïve probably but not a fool probably naïve dear god could i have been any more naïve id pulled a gun on a werewolf thief i was lucky marsten hadnt done what he just did to tristans guard and snapped my neck i need to hide the bodies he said his voice soft you can wait in the next room if youd like no ill clean i took a deep breath ill clean up thats what i did cleaned up the crime scene when i realized really realized what i was doing my blood went cold ohho so now youre worried all this time playing secret agent and now that youre actually doing something illegal you get scared i chased the thought back yes i was scared and yes id been the biggest damn fool enough of that as i wiped away evidence of a crime and watched marsten hide the bodies in the ventilation shaftanother handy vent shaftall i could think about was what would happen to my family if i was caught the shame the embarrassment the humiliation but most of all the why didnt we do more to help bewilderment and grief and what could i say no no you got it all wrong see i thought i was helping supernaturals with this interracial council but really i was working for this sorcerer corporation and then this werewolf i loved my family way too much to inflict that explanation on them its clean marsten murmured behind my head when i tried to give the tile one last rub he caught my hand its clean hope out damned spot i said trying to smile theres no blood on your hands i wouldnt be so sure of that i said softly i thought of all the cases id solved the criminal supernaturals id turned in i could see that one witch so terrified she couldnt even cast a spell begging mebegging menot to hand her over swearing it wasnt that council who wanted her but a cabal hope marsten grasped my shoulder his grip hard enough to push back the vision sorry i murmured justghosts whatever you did you thought you were doesnt matter does it its actions that count not intentions ignorance isnt an excuse thats what my ethics prof always said ignorance isnt i champed down on my lip hard enough to draw blood then pushed myself to my feet so no gun no body but one guard down i paused three guards i should i shook it off one of tristans guards one goal achieved out of three not doing so hot are we so whats next resume the plan and find a place to hide he nodded well try that that didnt sound terribly optimistic but considering our luck so far i cant say i blamed him we discussed options and settled on hiding in one of the less sexy exhibitsthose displaying artifacts unlikely to interest a bored partygoer conducting his own offlimits tour the ceramics or textiles galleries seemed like the safest bets both required passing the party but we would take the back hall around it rather than walk through seeing two people die had convinced me this wasnt the time to worry about my abandoned date we hurried into the hall skirting the gala then veered left we jogged through the looming skeletons of the dinosaur exhibit and were crossing to the grecoroman wing when i picked up the twang of a supernatural vibe i grabbed marstens arm and told him he listened for footsteps then inhaled the scents tristan and the other guard he said coming right where well be going is there another he stopped and answered his question by looking at the open doors down the hall a quartet of men lounged in the doorway ties and jackets off beyond them were more gaggles of partygoers we could go back i said too late he said and steered me toward the party well cut straight across to the main exit i said as we moved from there the first left will take us to ceramics we squeezed past the drunken quartet who were illinclinedor too unsteadyto move out of our way once inside i motioned to our goal across the room we were passing the buffet table when i caught sight of douglas less than ten feet away still talking to the bairds seeing me douglas blinked and looked beside him figures here i was worrying that hed been searching for me and he probably hadnt even noticed id been gone marsten reached for my arm to steer me away from douglas but i waved him back and veered onto a new course myself douglas only lifted his brows in polite question when i gestured to the buffet table he smiled nodded and turned back to the bairds dont mind me i muttered im just passing through killers in hot pursuit no no its okay you go back to whatever you were doing im fine beside me marsten chuckled your mother knows how to pick them doesnt she as i rolled my eyes marstens gaze shot back to the door and i saw tristan and the other guard brush past the drunken quartet at that moment douglas turned and lifted a finger motioning me over probably wanted me to grab him something from the buffet when i hesitated trying to gesture back marsten grabbed the back of my dress and nearly yanked me off my feet i backpedaled as fast as i could to keep from tripping as marsten dragged me into a large group of people and out of douglass sight hes coming he hissed by my ear as i spouted apologies to the partygoers whose circle wed invaded tristans guard was striding around the back of the buffet table moving as fast as he dared without calling attention to himself how hed seen us in the crowded room i couldnt imagine as we broke free from the group marsten gave me a shove none too gently toward the main door with him behind me i hurried out it then left toward the exhibits when i rounded the first corner marsten caught up and pushed something at me a tuxedo jacket which presumably he had grabbed from a chair in the gala take it he said when i made no move to do so put it on i almost said but im not cold an automatic response that under the circumstances would have made me sound like an idiot instead i settled for an equally idiotic huh stare your dress he said my oh shit my canary yellow dress how had tristan spotted us in that crowded room well duh when id bought this dress i pictured myself as a glowing beacon in the black night now i had my wish marsten steered me through around the next corner no i said the ceramics are the other i know were circling back he wont expect that now put this on i took the jacket as we jogged into a room of grecian urns the coat fell past my short skirt and wrapped around me easilycould have wrapped around me twice the sleeves hung past my fingertips a bit big i whispered no youre just a bit small now move he grabbed my arm and stopped me from moving before i could comment i caught the distant sound of footstepsrunning footsteps growing louder marsten pushed me into a gap between two stelae and squeezed in with me when only one set of footfalls entered the room marstens eyes narrowed and his fingers flexed against my sides as he tracked the steps his face went taut and a glimmer of that icy rage id seen earlier seeped into his gaze what had tristan said about a cornered werewolf that they were ten times as dangerous as any other supernatural looking up at marstens face i knew tristan was right and i knew why no predator willingly accepts the position of prey so when marstens lips moved to my ear i knew what he was going to say wait here i opened my mouth but took one look at marstens eyes and stopped he was right things had changed since the last time hed halfheartedly tried to keep me from following him into danger two men had died and id learned this wasnt some movie jewel heist caper as much as i wanted to help marsten and stop tristan now wasnt the time to redeem past stupidity so i nodded and let him slip off into the darkness alone the footsteps had stopped as if our pursuer had paused to look around was it tristan or his guard i wished i could tell but trusted marstens nose could it would make a differencefacing a sorcerer versus a halfdemonpresuming thats what the guard was i should have tried harder to figure out the guards race when wed been tying him up id need to practice more practice for what youre not i stifled the voice and concentrated on listening with the other man gone still the room was silent but marsten managed to move without breaking that silence i could see his white shirt gliding his white shirt why hadnt i offered him the jacket i told myself he must have known what he was doing and prayed i was right pulling the jacket tighter around me i eased forward enough to glance out there about fifteen feet away by a gilt statue of athena was the guard wed originally knocked out and handcuffed he faced the other side of the room his profile to meand his back to marsten marsten crept forward his gaze fixed on the guard managing to skirt obstacles as if by instinct his feet rolled from heel to toe soundless the guards gaze swept a hundred and eighty degrees and i fell back but marsten only froze in place the guard took three steps then peered around another statue marsten kept pace less than five feet behind so close i halfexpected the guard to feel marstens breath on his neck marsten took one last step he tensed then sprang at the last second the guard turned too late to fire his gun but soon enough to throw marsten off his trajectory marsten checked his leap at the last second and smacked the guards gun arm back hard and fast the guard let out a hiss part pain part rage and dove for the gun as it spun across the room marsten knocked the guard flying the guard crashed into a vase stuffed with replica scrolls as he reached up sparks flew from his fingertips and i knew his power fire the guards hand closed around the scroll even as my lips were parting to shout a warning to marsten the paper burst into flame the guard swung the fiery torch at marsten who was already in midleap coming straight at him the scroll caught marsten in the side of the face and he fell back the guard dropped the paper now nearly ash and dove for marsten his good hand going to marstens throat marsten drilled his fist into the guards stomach as the guard fell he grabbed marstens arm and marsten yanked away but i could see the guards scorched handprint on his white sleeve it was then as the two men launched into a full supernatural strength versus fire brawl that i snapped out of my chaos intoxication and realized that i too had a weapona loaded gun lying forgotten less than twenty feet away so i left my hiding place instead of dashing across the open room to the guards gun i crept along the shadows moving from exhibit to exhibit while ill admit i was worried about the guard seeing me and deciding i made an easier target i was even more worried about marsten seeing me out of my hideyhole and being if not concerned at least distracted whether marsten could be distracted was another question he fought with a singleminded purpose of someone whos done a lot of it not what i would have expected but was i surprised no id seen that look in his eyes as the civilized skin sloughed away and i hoped never to be on the receiving end of it again as the two men fought i circled around the outside the gun had slid under a scale model of pompeii i managed to get behind the low table then stretched out on my stomach i reached into the narrow opening until my shoulder jammed against it then swept my hand back and forth feeling nothing but gum wrappers and dust i peered under the display table in the dim emergency lighting i could see the gun its barrel pointed toward me still inches from my fingertips i wriggled and stretched and twisted and finally brushed the guns barrel another wiggle and i got my index finger into the lip of the barrel not the safest thing to do with a loaded gun im sure but i managed to tug it forward an inch or two enough to grab it from a safer angle and pull it out as my hand slid around the grip i envisioned myself leaping from behind the table gun trained on the guard giving marsten the kind of distraction he could use to get the upper hand i crouched steadied the gun then jumped up marsten was sitting beside the guards prone body surveying the burn damage to his own shirt he looked over at me i was poised dirty harry style gun drawn hair wild still drowning in the oversized tux jacket his lips twitched i uh have the gun so i see and i see you have the situation uh under control so ill just i let the sentence trail off as i lowered the gun and moved from behind the table ignoring his barely stifled laughter if you can stand guard ill hide this one he said as i approached i looked down at the dead guard and pushed back the initial stab of did we really need to kill him regret and doubt this had long passed the point of just knock him out solutions we already had knocked this guard out and handcuffed him and hed still come after us ready to kill a solid justification but still if i had leaped up from behind that table what if id needed to do more than distract him could i have pulled the trigger youve been carrying a gun for a year and you dont know whether you could have fired it what did you think it was a fashion accessory hope still crouched beside the body marsten touched my leg gently prodding me back to reality if you are not up to it he began guard duty got it the burning scroll hadnt triggered any fire alarms nor had the grunts and punches of combat been loud enough to bring partygoers running as marsten stowed the dead guard i concentrated on both exits looking sensing and listening i caught a supernatural vibe just as marsten looked over footsteps he said supernatural i nodded are they coming this way he said from the direction we did i glanced toward the far exit but knew without asking that marsten had no intention of fleeing only tristan was left and when he realized hed lost both his guards he wouldnt walk away hed call in reinforcements hide back where you were keep the gun ready but his eyes narrowed as he turned to track the approaching footsteps more than one set he murmured probably partygoers can you tell i concentrated but my heart was pounding reminding me with each ribjangling beat that those footsteps were getting closer and i didnt have time to dawdle my powers caved under the pressure and i couldnt even pick up one vibe anymore it doesnt matter marsten whispered when i told him well see them soon enough the last word was leaving his lips as tristan came into view flanked by what could only be two additional guards marsten let out an oath biting it off midsyllable he propelled me back to our original hiding spot between the stelae this time when we heard footsteps into the room marsten didnt move one opponent was fine two maybe but three at once not if we didnt have to as they passed tristan took his cell phone from his ear and scowled russell still not answering one of the guards said tristan shook his head ill try mike see if he can go look for russell marsten and i looked at one another then at the spot where marsten had hidden mikes bodyless than three feet from us as tristan finished dialing marsten tensed and i fumbled to get the gun from my pocket then leaned out to see tristan as he kept walking phone to his ear seconds ticked past he stabbed the disconnect button vibrate marsten whispered that made sensethat theyd have their phones set to vibrate nothing blows your cover faster than the ride of the valkyrie resounding through a supposedly offlimits hall when the three were gone we headed back the other way across the main hall and into the biodiversity wing aka the stuffed animal gallery on the other side was the ceramics exhibit halfway across the biodiversity room we caught strains of a lively monologue coming from the ceramics gallery the midnight behindthescenes tour marsten frowned at the direction of the voices as if debating joining them and taking refuge in numbers that depended on how likely he thought tristan was to avoid public confrontation after a moment he shook his head and prodded me toward the narrow opening between a pillar and the african savanna diorama when i stepped into the gap he tugged me out then backed in and crouched sitting on a fan box he motioned for me to turn around and back onto his lap as i did i knew why hed picked the lower positionwed be hidden from casual viewers by a nearby meerkat display as i shifted onto his lap his arms went around me holding me steadyor thats the excuse i let him have we settled in for what could be a long wait as things went quiet i struggled to hold back all the thoughts i didnt want to think all the regrets and selfrecriminations id deal with later my heart raced filling the void by indulging in replays of the running the fighting those delicious spurts of chaos that only sent my heart tripping faster still as i luxuriated in the memories other visions crept in a vulture circling overhead an ocean of long dry grass whispering a breeze bringing the heavenly scent of musk my stomach growling tail twitching in anticipation marsten shifted his fingers accidentally brushing my hardened nipples and i groaned my breath coming faster he chuckled not immune to me after all i see hmmm he cupped his hand under my left breast and pressed it there as my heart raced beneath his fingers when those fingers climbed to my nipple again i let out a soft moan sorry i said its not you another chuckle if you want to tell yourself that i closed my eyes and saw the lioness crouch hind quarters twitching mouth watering in anticipation i could feel her excitement pulse racing and my own raced to match it i moaned again as marstens hand slid up to my shoulder he hesitated either you have some strange erogenous zones or youre right its not me is it i opened my eyes its i waved at the display i pick things up from the pastchaos another brush against my hard nipples and this is what happens mmm yes my eyes closed again strange i know actually no not to me at least should i stop mmm no a soft laugh he unzipped my dress and tugged it off my shoulder pulling the bra down with it a wave of cool air rushed over my bare breast and i shivered backing against him as his hand went to my breast lips to my neck tongue sliding over the sensitive spot behind my ear raising more shivers i shifted again and he put his free hand around my waist and repositioned me on his lap i felt his erection hard against my rear and pushed against it thrusting softly he let out a low growl and moved his lips to my ear tell me what you see he whispered when i hesitated his free hand moved to my leg pushing up my skirt fingers tickling up the inside of my thigh he traced the edges of my panties then slid a finger under it i parted my legs to let him in but he only teased me with his finger tell me he said itsa hunt mmmm a growling chuckle nothing like a good hunt what do you see i told him the words coming hesitant at first then flowing faster as his finger slid in moving expertly as he thrust against me egging me on when i slowed my excitement feeding his as the lioness sprang for the kill i felt the first wave of climax then he stopped its still not me is it whwha his lips moved down my neck its insufferably vain of me but if im going to seduce you i want to be the cause of your arousal not passive recipient you dont seem all that passive to me he laughed but shook his head fingers on my thigh i craned around to look at him so youre just going to leave me hanging he hesitated then shook his head that wouldnt be very gentlemanly of me would it not at all hmmm he still hesitated toying with the edge of my panties well i said im trying to decide i say yes he laughed i doubt it and i doubt were thinking of the same question which is control as in can i help you without helping myself to you i stood turned around and repositioning myself on his lap facing him squarely straddling him hands around his neck what if im offering he growled deep in his throat and reached for me pulling me against him hands tugging up my skirt as i unbuttoned his pants an alarm rang so fast and sudden i almost toppled backward off him i looked around smoke wafted from the hall i pictured the fire demon again reaching for the vase of scrolls sparks raining from his fingertips a few must have fallen into the vase smoldered there and caught fire from the other room came the shrieks of people hearing alarms smelling smoke and reacting as if the building had transformed into the towering inferno i caught the first lick of chaos and shivered then shut it off marstens arms went around me pulling me back against him with a hard thrust and a soft growl i rotated to face him my hands going around his neck mouth finding his drinking in the chaos arising around us burning building who cared i had a more urgent fire to put out marsten growled again this one harsher as he pulled his lips from mine i hate to be the one to bring this up but the buildings on fire unfortunately i slipped my hands under his shirt how fast can it burn a low growling chuckle as he pressed against me you have no idea how badly im tempted to test that but i have to remind myself that youre acting under the influence of something something other than you you mean theres that too vain i said poking him in the chest he caught me up in a hard deep tonguediving groingrinding kiss then put me back on my feet time to go he said and started across the room tease he tossed a smile over his shoulder just giving you something to remember once all this interference is out of the way we reached the main hall to find it logjammed with people marsten hesitated then took my arm and led me straight into the heart of the mob the crowd buoyed us along and before i knew it the cool night breeze was rippling through my hair i looked up and only then seeing the stars winking against the citys glow could i truly believe it we were out free if tristan and his guards were here theyd be watching with dismay as the museum expelled a steady river of white shirts and black jackets and nary a yellow dress to be found the crowd was so thick that even if i hadnt covered my dress theyd probably never have picked me out as fire engines and taxis competed for curb space sirens and blaring horns rose above the din of partygoers yelling for their lost spouses and friends a few taxis managed a passenger snatchandgrab before the police cordoned off the area we let the crowd carry us across the road where the taxis were regrouping marstens grip suddenly tightened and he ducked sideways nearly plowing me into a whitehaired woman with a walker as i glared at him a voice cut through the din hope hope dont look marsten muttered by my ear as he steered us into another pocket of people just pretend you dont hope douglas cut between a couple he smiled at me there i was bedraggled and dirty hair flying everywhere wearing a tux jacket running from a burning building and he only smiled as if id just popped back from the buffet line the bairds have invited us for drinks he said i stared the words not penetrating certain i was mishearing and somehow the din around us had turned oh my god are you okay into an invitation for postinferno cocktails ii have to go i said finally thethe paper the fire i need to oh youll need to write it up wont you he smiled and winked for a cause id go with spontaneous human combustion i was thinking more of fire demons i muttered sure thats different ill let you go then have fun and dont work too hard marsten yanked me backward again as douglas slipped off through the crowd when we reached the sidewalk marsten bodychecked a young man and shoved me through an open cab door then crawled in after me and slammed it he looked over your address i gave it to the driver though marsten just said head east oh riverside is beside the river i said which is north marsten didnt correct the driver just shut the panel between the front and rear seats and buckled up to be safe you should spend the evening someplace else your mothers maybe is she in the city yes but if im in danger im certainly not taking it to her no matter how slight the risk friend sibling cousin i shook my head same thing this is my problem so until its resolved im keeping it that way we should find a hotel or motel on the outskirts of town and get some rest before we figure out how to resolve this because im assuming tristan wont just give up and go away he wont all right then well find a hotel and ill make sure its safe then when i come back back where are you going he patted his pocket where the jewels were i need to take care of these tonight i shouldnt be more than an hour or so just long enough to hunt down tristan and kill him when marsten looked over sharply i said i may be foolish but im not stupid and after tonight not nearly so naïve the only way to end this is to kill tristan so thats what youre going to do that why you said youd retrieve my bracelet lateryou meant once i was out of the building and you went back for tristan he hesitated and studied my expression then nodded ive tried walking away twice and he refuses to leave it that as much as i hate to bother with someone like tristan robard i cant walk away again thats why you asked for my address isnt it because you think thats where hell go right now im the more urgent threat the one who could let his cabal know about his extracurricular activities marsten nodded well you know im not going to any hotel i held up a hand against his protest have i interfered yet no but and i wont i am so far out of my league i shook my head lets just say i wont embarrass myself further or endanger you by interfering but tristan wants me and if you show up alone at my townhouse hell know somethings up for a moment marsten and i just looked at each other then he nodded and gave the driver my address i live in a brownstone backing onto the river and surrounding parkland not your typical twentysomething tabloid journalist digs the house technically belongs to my mother i say technically because her ownership is really only a technicalityand a contentious one at that my mother had bought the place while id been in jschool only a mile away shed called it an investment but when id graduated shed wanted to give it to me college had been a strugglenot academically but personally coming at the worst time in my life when id been dealing with my demon powers i think the brownstone was moms graduation giftand a hoped source of stability for a daughter sorely in need of it i love the townhouse love the area love my beautiful riverfront backyard with its winding forest trailsan escape route whenever i needed it which seemed often so id agreed to keep living there as a property manager of sorts maintaining the building and protecting moms investment but i refused to take the deed and insisted on paying all expenses and upkeepthough the property taxes alone were nearly enough to bankrupt me thank god i had two jobs two jobs as the taxi disgorged us on the front lawn i stared up at my beloved brownstone and realized i no longer had two jobs and probably not even one of course my mother couldand wouldstep in and pay the bills i so desperately didnt want that id given my mother enough sleepless nights to last a lifetime i often wondered whether at some level she knew my problems were rooted in something shed done that brief postseparation encounter that no one could blame her for even if she didnt know the true nature of my trouble i think she blamed herself and i didnt want that i wanted to be strong and independent and stable and to be able to take her for lunches on my dime and say see mom im doing fine and i had reached that point stuffed with the newfound confidence my council job had given me wed better get inside marsten whispered as the cab pulled away he looked around nostrils flaring body tense as if wed just stepped into a trapwhich we probably had definitely not the time to worry about my lifes recent crash and burn when this was over i should just be thankful i still had a life to repair good security marsten whispered as i undid the dual deadbolt are the other doors and windows all armed motion detectors in every room too my mom worries i hurried in to disarm the system it was still active if tristan had beat us here hed backed off when hed seen the security this wasnt the kind of neighborhood that ignored screaming sirens better to wait for us to disarm the system what now i said as marsten relocked the front door turn on a couple of lights and stay away from the windows is that open land out back a park i said mostly forest good thats where ill try to get him then away from the houses well stay here for a bit give him time to arrive and stake out the house then ill change and lead him into the forest change the words but i dont have anything for you to wear were on my lips when i realized what he meant into a wolf he nodded by far the preferred way for dealing with these things easier to track easier to fight anda quick smilea builtin disguise if anyone sees me i flipped on the living room and hall lights what about the television i said should i turn that on too a brow arch we escape death flee to the safety of your townhouseand watch television so what would tristan expect i followed his gaze to the stairs leading to the second level ah of course youd want a good nights rest and thats probably all id get he muttered unless i set the place on fire first from tristans point of view though we just had a harrowing evening i saved your life you did play along you take me upstairs oh reward sex i paused but for proper reward sex i wouldnt take you upstairs we probably wouldnt even make it past the front door i just push you against the wall get down on my knees he cut me off with a growl id suggest you stop there unless you plan to follow through oh but i would follow throughif youd saved my life i swung around the banister onto the stairs not that youd let me though no sex unless its you i want remember no chaos sex no reward sex thats your rule he muttered something and followed me up the stairs at marstens suggestion the first thing i did was remove my dresswhich sounds a whole lot more interesting than it was as he pointed out heels and a slinky yellow dress didnt make good latenight commando gear while he cleaned up i put on jeans a tshirt and sneakers then we headed for my bedroom yes i have a separate dressing room its a threebedroom townhouseim just trying to make efficient use of space really i walked into my darkened bedroom flicked on the light then made a face sorry i said its a mess i wasnt expecting company poor doug marsten walked to the unmade bed plunked down on it and gave it a test bounce doesnt get a lot of use ill bet im picky sorry a wolfish grin dont be i like picky he pushed to his feet well no usually i dont like picky but this time i think i do with a sidelong glance through the window he put his arms around my waist leaned down and kissed me it was a slow kiss easy and relaxed with none of the practiced attention to art of his first one setting the scene i murmured with a nod toward the window a good excuse he kissed me again then sighed you really are immune arent you to what i caught his look and rolled my eyes oh please you really are vain arent you i already admitted that i cant help itim accustomed to having my attentions returned ah not even going to bite for that are you i stepped back and sat on the edge of the bed what you admit that you find me attractive so im honorbound to return the compliment fine yes you have your charms a twist of his lips oh thats not good enough okay let me try again i think youre the most gorgeous thing ive ever seen and i can barely keep my hands off youwell not when theres a decent source of chaos around he growled and scooped me up off the bed kissing me again enough already i said squirming free i admitted you were charming i said you had your charms which means you find me charming no well yes you are charming but i dont find that charming he laughed and shook his head all right you find me physically attractive then yes you are but no i dont find that particularly attractive he bared his teeth in a quick grin and stepped closer my wit i moved back and shrugged witty enough though not as witty as you think you are ouch he gave an almost selfmocking grin then it must be my undeniable sense of style because you can pick out a decent tux i snorted theres what one color option and two or three styles a feigned look of shock you mean you dont find me irresistibly suave debonair where i grew up guys learn suave from the cradle his grin only grew then whatever you find attractive about me has nothing to do with any of this he waved his hands over himself this infinitely polished package nope sorry good good very good he caught me up in a kiss as he did a distant vibe twanged through me theyre here i whispered marsten glanced out the window his body blocking mine gaze scanning the dark street theyre across the road he murmured as he turned back to me they must have just arrived on the count of three im swinging you past the window and onto the bed he did as soon as i hit the mattress i rolled to the far side and dropped onto the floor marsten followed we crawled into the hall down the stairs and to the back door arriving just in time to duck behind the kitchen cabinets when we heard footsteps on the rear deck the guard tested the door peered in then moved on quickly marsten murmured theyll be back in a minute this is the safest place to break in as we slipped out the door i started pushing in the handle to relock it when it closed but marsten caught my hand we want them to know we came out this way he whispered hunched over and darting from bush to tree to garden shed i led him across my tiny yard and down the small hill to the woodland beyond marsten found a place for me to hide he made sure i had my gun and warned me to stay where i was whatever happened then he gave me a card from his wallet and told me if he didnt return in an hour i was to run to a public place call the handwritten number on the back and explain everything a moment later he was gone i stayed where i was as impotent as i felt cowering in those bushes i knew if i tried to help id more likely get us both killed so i hid and i listened i listened as the soft lullaby of cricket and frog calls went silent under the heavy footfalls and guttural muttering of tristan and his guards i listened as those mutters gave way to orders and oaths i listened as those trudging footsteps divided and turned into running feet i listened as a scream shattered the night a scream cut off by flashing fangs that wasnt my imagination working overtime i saw those fangs flash smelled bowels give way felt hot blood spatter my face and the visions brought not a split second of chaos bliss with every cry every scream every silenced pistol shot i was certain marsten had been hit the death vision came twice and still i heard multiple running feet and voices my god how many were there how would he ever another shot then the sound that broke my resolve a piercing canine yelp of pain i broke from my cover then but i resisted the urge to run pellmell toward the noise toward the laughs of triumph instead i gripped my gun tight and slunk through the shadows until i was close enough to see a flashlight beam cutting a swath through the dark forest the beam stopped and my gaze followed its path a black mound of fur lay motionless at the end of that flashlight beam a guard stood beside the mound gun pointed down oh god god no something flashed near the top of the heap a blue eye reflected in tristans flashlight beam the eye rolled following tristan i took another three steps until that dark mound became a massive wolf lying on his belly his head lowered but not down his ears and lips drawn back as he watched tristans approach the fur on marstens shoulder was matted with blood the guard had his gun pointed at marstens head and i couldnt tell whether he was staying down because of that gun or because he was too badly injured to rise hope tristans voice rang out so loud and sudden that i jumped only the barest rustle of dead leaves gave me away but marstens ears swiveled in my direction his black nostrils flared then he let out a low growl and i knew that growl was for me as clear a get the hell out of here as if hed shouted the words hope tristan yelled again i know youre out there marstens muzzle turned sharply as the bushes across the clearing crackled the top of a head bobbed from the darkness tristan waved for the guard to stand near marsten hope dont you think youve caused enough trouble tonight two men dead and another to follow all because you couldnt do your job and catch one mana thief no less isnt that what youd signed on to do help us put away scum like karl marsten as tristan tried to guilttrip me into giving myself up i looked around for a better position he had no intention of letting marsten gothis was more about his vendetta against marsten than about shutting me downso i wasnt stupid enough to even consider turning myself over marsten was alive and would stay that way until tristan got me too if i could find a better position with a better view i might be able to help marsten i still had the gun oh right the guna weapon youve never even fired didnt matter it was still a planand the only one i had when marsten had found hiding spots hed emphasized protecting my back if your back was open anyone could sneak up behind you so where could i safely i looked up the trees while tristan shouted for me again i scurried to the nearest candidate grabbed the lowest branch and channeled my inner tomboy in minutes i was lying on my stomach on a thick branch about seven feet off the ground perfect in the darkness someone could walk right under me hope you have thirty seconds to show yourself or i put a bullet in this mutts head yeah sure kill the only way you have to get to me right my sight line into the clearing was less than ideal i could make out heads and torsos but nothing below waist level including marsten i wriggled farther along the branch ah there he was still on the ground at the guards feet his head up glowering at tristan tristan walked over to marsten and lowered the barrel of his gun marsten tensed the guard put his foot on marstens neck to hold him down but the move was halfhearted my gut twisted as i realized marsten was badly hurthe had to be if the guard was so unconcerned with restraining him hope last chance tristans finger moved on the trigger and even as i told myself it was a ruse that he had no intention of pulling it my mind washed back the reassurances with a tidal wave of doubt tristan wanted marsten dead wouldnt leave this forest until he was dead so why not just kill him now wait the word flew out before i could stop it tristan smiled and lowered his gun thats my girl oh christ now what maintain position and think think fast and stall i want to negotiate i said ii made a mistake yes hope you did tristan lowered the gun and handsignaled for one guard to search in the direction of my voice uhuh i said im not coming out not yet tristan jerked his chin motioning for the guard to circle around from behind and dont tell him to sneak up on me either i called my voice ringing in the stillness i can sense him remember he comes anywhere near me and ill do what you threatened to do to karl put a bullet in his head ah a bullet tristan said with a laugh from your gun i presume he reached into his pocket this gun maybe i unscrewed the silencer and fired the guards gun into the ground below no this gun so you have a gun wonderful it would be even better if you knew how to use it but they dont teach marksmanship in debutante classes do they i laughed do you really think id let you get me a gun and not even learn how to use it im a keener tristan remember i was at the gun club an hour after you handed it to me and yes the west hills country club does have marksmanship facilities excellent facilities youd like itif they ever let you in tristan stiffened found a weak spot there didnt i now if only i had some clue what to do with it i made a mistake i said karl tricked me tristan smiled charmed you more like no he lied to me i said as i looked around babbling while i searched for a way to help marsten he told me i wasnt working for the council he said im working for a cabal one of the guards shot tristan a confused look mouthing council they didnt know the other two guards had been in on tristans scheme but these ones had no idea what i was talking about marsten said tristan was working on personal revenge that the cabal would never have sanctioned his death the other two guards had known that had been moonlighting outside the cabal with tristan but these two werent interesting i called down again i dont know what you hope to gain by killing me tristan i pulled out the business card marsten had given me weve already called i squinted at the card earlier id glanced at it just long enough to register the last namecortezand id remembered marsten saying hed done work for benicio cortezs son the one who wasnt part of the cabal so thats the name i expected when i saw what was really printed there my heart thudded i turned it over a handwritten phone number oh god was that real what if it wasnt yes hope you were saying id been about to say that id called the person on the card and told him everything but that wouldnt work now had i really called already these guards wouldnt be here thinkthink who am i really working for tristan i said who sanctioned this job his gaze shot to the guards the cortez cabal hope you already said that yes but iim confused you two down there when you were called in what did mr cortez say karls crime was the guards looked at one another wait i said mr cortez didnt give the order did he that came straight from tristan so what did tristan say karls crime was hes a thief tristan said between his teeth surveying the forest as if trying to pinpoint my voice okaybutwell hes been a thief all his life right and his father before him but now out of the blue mr cortez decides he deserves to die for it right after karl joins the pack right after the pack joins the interracial council isnt that a diplomatic crisis in the making i thought mr cortez was pretty careful about stuff like that the guards turned to tristan their eyes narrowing but still expecting a logical explanation i dont question my orders tristan said maybe but i do im going to call mr cortez got his card right here i read off the office numbers so theyd know i was telling the truth and while im sure those numbers would get me through to some flunky eventually i can probably save some time by using the number on the back benicio cortezs personal number howd she get one of the guards began she didnt you tristan clipped off the insult its a stalling tactic you really are a naïve little girl arent you hope where did you get benicio cortezs number the phone book the second guard snickered but the first took out his cell phone here he said give me the number and ill call tristan smiled in my direction yes hope give him the number i resisted the urge to rattle it off and stammered it out instead as if i was making it up where had marsten got this number what if someone had given it to him as a joke i looked down at him trying to gauge his reaction but his eyelids were flagging as if he was struggling to stay conscious my hesitant delivery made tristan smile and he made no attempt to stop the guard from dialing just leaned back against a tree and awaited my downfall ten seconds after the guard finished dialing his head jerked up mr cortez tristan chuckled and shook his head this is bryan trau the guard said sa unit im sorry to disturb you sir but we have a situation here tristan jumped so fast he nearly tripped his hand flew out and he motioned for the guard to hand over the phone but the guard stepped away tristan started to lift his gun then stopped as the second guard raised his halfway the threat respectful but clear the guard explained the situation and i swore i could see tristan sweating when the guard finished he listened said yes sir then held out the phone mr cortez would like to speak to you tristan stepped back and looked ready to bolt then he caught sight of marsten and must have in that second seen a possible way out the elimination of the only person who could confirm the entire story he lifted his gun a shot sounded i didnt think i jumped from the tree the second i started falling my brain screamed idiot and i saw the gun still in my hand i managed to fling it aside before i landed on top of it and shot myself in the gut i hit the ground hard but scrambled up grabbed the gun and ran as i made it to the clearing i heard yes sir pause no sir hes gone i flew into the clearing to see the guard kneeling beside a body tristans body in the guards other hand he held his gun yes sir i did you said if he made a move a pause then the guard nodded and glanced over at me shes here now the guard held out the phone i hesitated then took it is this the young woman who was with karl a voice asked a pleasant voice calm and alert as if he hadnt been woken in the middle of the night he asked a few questions about me whether i was hurt and what had happened his tone mild but concerned almost avuncular not what id expect from the head of the most powerful cabal after a few questions he said youve had a very long night and im sorry you had to go through this but i can assure you mr robard was acting outside his jurisdiction since he is an employee though i take full responsibility for his actions and will do everything i can to put things right starting with looking after karl is he badly hurt oh god id been so shocked i hadnt even checked i blurted an apology and raced to marsten the second guard was already there tending to marsten who was unconscious hed been shot through the shoulder and his entire side was wet and sticky blood must have been pumping out the whole time hed been lying there mr cortez assured me a doctor one from his local satellite office would be on the way then he left me to help the guard bind marstens wound as we waited the guards took marsten back to my house then left me there to wait for the doctor while they returned to the scene to clean it up they werent even out of the backyard when the doctor arrived he got the wound cleaned and covered left antibiotics and painkillers and told me to call if marstens condition worsened the two guards stopped back at the house to let me know everything was cleaned up they brought something for me toomy purse left by tristan in the van my bracelet was still in there as were my wallet and gun everything back in order just as mr cortez had promised wed left marsten in the living room on a blanket i found a second blanket and laid it over him he looked ridiculous of course this huge wolf on my living room floor with a pink and white knit afghan tucked in around his muzzle at least i didnt get him a pillowthough i did consider it i lay down on the sofa above him intending to keep watch until he woke but within minutes i was asleep i awoke to the sound of running water marsten was gone up here he said when i called for him i climbed the stairs he was in the bathroom with the door open a crack i stopped a few paces from the door you need your clothing dont you let me get found and onmostly whats left of them anyway now if i can just he growled this bandage fit me better as a wolf here i can i started pushing the door open then stopped realizing he might not want the help he kicked it open the rest of the way as he quickly shrugged on his shirt i laughed feeling shy i gestured at the shirt i cant fix your shoulder like that he hesitated then let the shirt fall off his chest and upper arms were a loose patchwork of scars he tensed as if waiting for me to comment or react i grabbed bandages and iodine from the closet and set to work fixing him up the cabal sent a doctor over i said im not sure he did a very good job he didnt seem to know much about werewolves thats fine i know someone who does he glanced at me so i didnt imagine that then you contacted benicio cortez i nodded and thats all it took tristans dead youre alive the mess is cleaned up and mr cortez has promised to look after any fallout which of course led me to wonder if you had that number why didnt you use it right away i think i know the answer but im hoping im wrong probably not he murmured i looked up at him as nice as mr cortez was im guessing he didnt get where he is by playing santa claus cleaning this up for us wasnt a free gift was it marsten shook his head we owe him he wouldnt say that because it would have been crass under the circumstances but its a chit owed he rubbed his shoulder adjusting the bandage and made a face then looked at me when i turned down tristans offer benicio came to me and made one personally he was much more persuasive he threatened you marsten laughed benicio cortez does not threaten he knows a lollipop can be a better motivator than a swat on the behind he made me a lucrative offer and when i respectfully refused unlike tristan he let it go but gave me that card in case i ever needed help and now ive accepted it on your behalf putting you in his debt god im so sorry if i hadnt wanted you to use it i wouldnt have told you to given the choice between being dead and owing benicio cortez were better off with the latter as uncomfortable as it may be he will eventually call in the chit but in the meantime you can go back to your life including your job at the paper assuming thats what you want it is i sat on the edge of the counter id like towell maybe im kidding myself thinking i could do anything on my own you could still monitor and report problems to the real council this time they have someone doing something similar another journalist and i know shed love the help i shrugged torn between not knowing if that would be enough and not knowing if i could offer more if i still had more to offer marsten stepped in front of me and leaned forward a hand on each side of me balancing against the counter its a start he murmured take it slow and start there the only drawback im afraid would be the payor lack of it the real council isnt a group of whitehaired philanthropists most of the delegates arent much older than you meaning its pretty much a nobudget operation that doesnt matter i never even wanted tristan to pay me i get paid well enough i stopped and shrugged well you know in chaos dollars my cheeks heated i know that sounds awful helping others because i get something out of it he put his hands on my hips and leaned closer to me you need an outlet do you think i dont understand that he reached into his pocket and took out the jewels this is mine a way to get my regular adrenaline shot without ripping apart strangers in alleyways and with you it isnt all about the chaos you have balance the good impulses with the bad me he grinned a little more inclined to the latter his eyes glinted though not irredeemably so i laughed something tells me that would be a fun but futile challenge challenge is good i shook my head if youre happy with what you are then anyone who wants you would need to accept that he ran his fingertips along my jawline wouldnt be easy im sure no but if you look hard enough im sure youd find someone willing to try you know my moms great at finding dates he growled and kissed me when he pulled back he ran the tip of his tongue over his lips as if sampling the kiss the immunity is breaking down he murmured but still has a ways to go he leaned toward me again id ask if i should stay for a while but i suspect the answer would be no a reluctant no maybe but a no nonetheless so instead ill ask whether i can come back i smiled yes you can come back good better actually better much i laughed and shook my head marsten stepped back i should go i have a doctor to visit and goods to dispose ofnot necessarily in that order and i will make those calls for youensure the termination from your old job and the start of your new one go smoothly thanks i appreciate that i caught his hand and met his gaze i really do karl he leaned over for a kiss little more than a brushing of the lips but verynice when he pulled away he backed up to the door started to turn then stopped im too old for you too old for what to come back for a visit a dramatic sigh he shook his head and walked out of the bathroom from the hall i heard a murmured im going to make a fool of myself itll look good on you i called after him his chuckle returned i smiled and listened to his footsteps recede down the stairs across the floor and finally disappear out the back door then i took a deep breath one life gone another on the way was i up for it god i hoped so kelley armstrong kelley armstrong is the author of the popular women of the otherworld series the newest book broken will be out in summer she lives in rural ontario with her husband and three children want more info go to wwwkelleyarmstrongcom dead man dating lori handeland on the day he died eric leaventhall had a date that couldnt be broken so he went dead and all too bad i was his date turned out dead dating was the only way he could get what he needed sustenance are you confused yet i know i was maybe i should start at the beginning but im not quite sure when that was probably when i decided to become a client of wwwtruelovecom pretentious maybe but id hoped that any man who chose a service by that name might be a little more grown up than mosthad at least moved beyond a desire to bang supermodels and begun to think about finding a life being a literary agent i should have known that semantics were as dead as most peoples belief in a soul mate the date itself started out well enough we met at a martini bar near my office a new place kind of sex and the city which should have tipped me off right away if not to the whole demon issue then at least to his hopes for the evening he wasnt after true love i hadnt been completely honest either in my bio id said i was in publishing id learned that the quickest way to a stack of manuscripts from the wannabe famous was to tell anyone but immediate family what i really did for a living of course some people figured it out as soon as they heard my name my mother had been one of the top agents in the business before shed gone and died on me was i following in her footsteps trying to regain some of the happiness id enjoyed while she was alive you betcha however that wasnt working out i liked to read but i didnt like to sell sadly my degree in ancient civilizations made me fit to do little but teach and i doubted id be very good at that either kids kind of scared me at loose endsin my job and my personal lifeid decided to start searching for that soul mate id been dreaming of just my luck the first candidate didnt even have a soul i should have caught a clue to erics intentions the instant id seen his photo on the web he was dropdead gorgeousdead being the operative word although in truth he hadnt been dead at the time still what on earth would a man like him want with a woman like me one thing and one thing only whats that horrible saying about all women being the same in the dark im not a hag but i am short and just a little dumpy with long black hair that curls too much and the dark eyes and olive complexion of either my fathers sicilian ancestors or my mothers hebrew ones take your pick with a name like mara naomi elizabeth morelli id never be mistaken for a nordic bimbo even if id had a prayer of looking like one anyway call me kit everyone does i was never able to carry off the mara naomi elizabeth thing now back to the dateif not from hell at least from a place very near by manhattan rich blond and handsome eric was every plain girls dream he was not very tall which i liked since big men always made me nervous his teeth were white and straight his eyes deep blue he was also a surgeon of course he was too good to be true im so glad you came he said and his smile warmed the chill of the early spring night eric led me to a secluded table held my chair let his fingertips drift over my hair sure he got a little too close rubbed his knee against mine a little too soon laid on the interest in my job my future and me a little too thick but i was lonely confused unhappy and here was this great guy hanging all over me what do you say we take this to your place eric murmured stroking the back of my hand i hesitated uncertain how to say no id never been one for sex on a first date i wasnt one for sex at all i might be smartmouthed just a little sarcasticblame my motherbut i was also shy with men the thought of baring my body to a strangerwell it wasnt a thought i entertained very often however i was suddenly struck by the odd notion that tonight was the night id met the man id been waiting for all of my life okay i said had that word come out of my mouth id been raised on my mothers tales of love at first sight shed taken one glance at my italiancatholic workingclass father and defied her wealthy intellectual jewish family to marry him theyd been happy until the day she died id been in my last semester of college uncertain of what i should do with my life thenbammy mother had died from a brain aneurysm life suddenly seemed so short her work wasnt done and i had no pressing place to be so i slid into her job and two years later i was still doing it my father never recovered from her death hed passed away just this winter i was so lost without him i felt hollow inside which had no doubt precipitated my sudden search for true love hand in hand eric and i left the bar and strolled south toward chelsea i had an apartment on west twentyfourth street my mother had been a very good agent throughout her married life shed made three times the money of my electrician father theyd deposited the checks and never mentioned it so when daddy died id nearly choked at the size of his bank account which was now mine id spent the money on a condo not too far from my fifth avenue office trying to live up to my mothers reputation meant i had to work harder and longer than everyone else saving commute time had seemed like the best way to invest my inheritance erics arm slid around my waist sighing i leaned my head on his shoulder this is nice i murmured itll get nicer i promise his palm drifted lower cupping my bountiful butt squeezing a little his thumb slid down the center and i jumped i cant wait to get inside you youll die of the pleasure baby baby uck i was going to have to put a stop to that he sounded like a used car salesman trying to sell me a vehicle i did not want his thumb teased me again and i decided later would be time enough to discuss endearments whod have thought a guys thumb could be so arousing of course i couldnt recall ever being this aroused eric must have felt the same way because he yanked me in between two buildings and shoved me against the wall slapping his lips against mine a little too hard i tasted blood when my teeth cut my lip shuddered when he licked the blood away i should have been angry disgusted a little scared instead i feltwanted something id never felt before sure in a tiny sane portion of my mind i knew id lost it but right now i couldnt summon the will to care erics body shielded mine from the night his erection pressed against me too high to be of any help id have to climb his body wrap my legs around his waist if i wanted any relief i was contemplating doing just that when the snick of a match made me still someone else was in the alley i yanked my mouth from erics his lips slid across my jaw then latched onto my neck my gaze went past his shoulder to the man hovering in the shadows the glow of his cigarette did nothing to reveal his face i got a sense of height breadth and darkness eric i whispered he continued to rain kisses across my chest then rooted at the neckline of my brandnew black dress like a nursing child my nipples tightened in anticipation even as the glitter of eyes from the shadows caused a tingle of unease to dance across my skin what in hell was wrong with me i was definitely not an exhibitionist theres someone here i said more loudly doesnt matter eric muttered fumbling with his pants gotta do you now or ill fade away that got through to me i might be attracted aroused insane but i was definitely not so far gone that id let a virtual stranger screw me in an alley while another one watched no i said he ignored me sliding my dress up my legs yanking at my pantyhose the nylon went ping as his thumb popped through a run shot down my leg even as his erection beat a pulse against my stomach i began to struggle becoming just a little afraid yet in the midst of all that i wanted him and that scared me more than anything else youll die happy baby he muttered they always do a hand slapped onto erics shoulder she said no hibrido though the words were harsh the tone was mellow the accent south of the border a voice that could haunt me for the rest of my life eric shifted his shoulders blotting out everything but him neither the hand on his shoulder nor the whispered warning even slowed him down the salt however did i wouldnt have known what had been thrown in erics face except some of it hit me the grains burned my eyes like hellfire eric made a sound that was half snarl half shout and shoved away from me so hard my shoulder blades scraped the brick wall he swung around and the other man shot him right in the head the shot was muffledsilencer i thoughtyet the sound still bounced off the walls and echoed down the alleyway tensing in expectation of the blood splatter my eyes slammed closed nothing happened when i opened them again i was alone no eric no stranger no blood what the hell i stepped onto the street no one appeared to have heard the gunshot or if they had they didnt care continuing on their way with the typical zombielike trance of lifetime new yorkers the tourists were too busy staring upward either dazzled by the neon or trying to find their way to their hotels by way of the skyscrapersa method similar to using the stars in places where stars could actually be seen i was dizzy with the adrenaline both confused and frightened so i wandered back into the alley and i saw him just a shadow a slip of darkness against the light as he moved onto the street one block over i didnt think i ran if he vanished into the crowd what would i do how would i prove anything that had happened tonight i didnt consider why i thought i needed to prove anything i burst out of the alley and someone grabbed me around the waist the force of my forward motion and the sudden end to it swung me about so fast my feet lifted off the ground a choked sound came from my throat but i didnt have the air left to scream even if i had it wouldnt have mattered since he slapped his hand over my mouth and dragged me backward i just couldnt win tonight why are you following me he asked why do you think my lips moved but the words were garbled his body rockhard against mine tensed if i lift my hand do you promise not to scream since screaming hadnt worked very well for me so far i nodded and the hand went away you shot my date in the head what date i blinked the guy in the alley what guy eric leaventhall slim blond handsome he snorted what does that mean he didnt bother to answer continuing to hold me aloft my feet dangling near his knees he was so much taller so much broader so much stronger i felt helpless and while that should have unnerved me instead i got kind of annoyed you mind i swung my feet almost cracking him in the shin and he set me down but kept his arm around my waist i could neither see him nor run away there wasnt any man he said of course there was he bought me a drink hehe i ran my tongue across my lip felt the telltale ridge where my teeth had ravaged the skin when eric kissed me i wasnt crazy but this guy was let me go i ordered amazingly he did and i scampered out of his reach and spun around my first thought what a shame he was too gorgeous to be insane as if beauty and lunacy were mutually exclusive as dark as eric had been light bulky where eric had been slim this man was large hard his hair shaggy his face shadowed by at least two days growth of beard the clothes had obviously been slept in a lot though even before that theyd been years away from new his blue work shirt had faded nearly to white from repeated washings with it unbuttoned to his sternum i saw the hint of a tattoo though i couldnt tell what the shape was the jeans were ancient too the boots scuffed and dusty his black leather jacket a relic his eyes were as dark as mine but he had longer lashes isnt that always the way high cheekbones a fine blade of a nose i wasnt certain but i thought i saw the sparkle of an earring nothing fancy or swingy just a shiny silver stud piercing one lobe he was so different from anyone id ever encounteredexotic and wildi had to remind myself hed just murdered my date in cold blood except where was the blood according to him there hadnt even been a date i was back to the eternal questionwas he crazy or was i there was a man with me i said and you killed him if i had you shouldnt be troubling your pretty little head my eyes narrowed but he ignored me thats the quickest way to getting it shot off he continued in other words eric troubled his pretty little head about what i dont know any eric i walked through the alley you were leaning against the wall figured you were high on something i was i broke off as i remembered what id been doing suddenly i was mortified why had i been making out with a stranger why had i been bringing him back to my apartment both behaviors were completely out of character with eric no longer attached at the lip i couldnt figure out why id been so enthralled by him he was here i repeated and you shot him the man cursed under his breath a long stream of indecipherable spanish that brought ricky ricardo to mind come along he snapped and stalked back in the direction id come on the opposite end of the alley he paused knelt peered at the ground no blood no body he lifted his gaze no shooting and no guy joining him i stared at the stained but not with blood asphalt you want me to take you somewhere he asked i didnt answer as i inched closer to the wall id been leaning here eric had been standing there crazy man with a gun had been there so i peered more closely at the brick and found the bullet hole aha i stuck my finger into it and glared at the guy triumphantly aha what a bullet hole you shot him i frowned remembering the no blood no body problem or at least at him you missed he joined me then poked his finger into one two three other holes so did a lot of people i yanked my hand away more miffed than scared i know what happened listen chica i didnt see any guy i am not crazy and i dont do drugs maybe you should at my glare he lifted his hands in surrender i meant prescription ones you need help maybe i did definitely i did if id not only imagined eric but also his murder did i miss my dad even more than i thought frustrated i shoved my hand into the pocket of my dress my fingers brushed paper and i remembered id printed out the last email from eric withdrawing the sheet i thrust it at the man im not nuts and heres the proof the guy narrowed his eyes read the words scowled then he pulled out his gun and pointed it at me why had i never learned to leave well enough alone lets go he flicked the barrel of the gun toward the street whwhere your place i shook my head i dont think so you dont get to think youre kidnapping me what was your first clue if i wasnt so scared i might have found him funny he lost patience and grabbed me by the arm either take me to your place or ill take you to mine i doubted id care for his place at least in my own id be surrounded by the familiar and have a hope in hell of escape mine i murmured on west twentyfourth his eyebrows lifted he obviously knew the neighborhood swell now hed want money in addition towhatever else he wanted my kidnapper set his left arm over my shoulders and i tensed trying to inch away but he wouldnt let me instead he drew me close then slid his right hand beneath his jacket and pressed the gun to my ribs i guess thered be no shouting for help hed obviously done this before who are you i asked as we stepped onto the street chavez is that your first name or your last both right he shrugged the movement rubbing his side against mine making the gun skitter across my skin i flinched and he tightened his hold relaje he murmured in that voice that would have been seductive if he hadnt been kidnapping me at gunpoint i dont want to hurt you chica then why are you doing this youll be safer with me i promise i snorted my opinion of that and i could have sworn he laughed the sound became a cough as i glanced up as the neon lights spilled over us his face resembled something carved on a western mountainside not a hint of emotionno humor definitely no compassion how could i possibly be safer with him right now the most frightening thing in my world was him whats your name he asked i debated ignoring the question but since he was dragging me home hed find out anyway and did i really want him to continue calling me chica in a voice that reminded me of tequila on a scalding summer night kit i said though not very nicely what kind of name is kit nickname my whole name is longer than your i paused and he stared down at me from on high arm i finished and his lips twitched what is kit short for my father called me my voice broke suddenly embarrassingly my fathers death was too new too painful too private to talk about with a kidnapper kitten chavez blurted i stopped walking how did you know that fits no one but my father had ever thought i resembled a kitten strange and disturbing that this stranger saw it too we continued on silently every once in a while i couldnt stop myself from looking at him he was everything foreign to me i should be frightened instead that foreignness had turned my fear toward fascination especially when his hair shifted a streetlight blared and his earring sparkled a tiny silver cross how strange i lowered my gaze saw where we were and paused indicating the building on the other side of the street with a dip of my chin this is it he scowled youve got a doorman so dont even think about tipping him off say im your boyfriend right out of the blue i come home with a boyfriend like you whats wrong with me besides the gun the leather the earring and the i stopped short of mentioning his tattoo i wasnt sure it was there and i didnt want him thinking id been staring at his chest the killing i finished i didnt kill anyone his eyes narrowed yet if were both lucky ill get what i want and be out of your hair in a few days a few days i shouted managing to startle several passersby shh he jerked me more tightly against him i wont hurt you as long as you help me out thats what all the psycho kidnappers say right before they kill someone you have a lot of experience with psycho kidnappers i think im going to his lips tightened im not crazy which is what all the crazy people say he glanced at the sky as if asking for guidance for some reason that calmed me if he believed in the divine he couldnt be all bad ill tell you whatever you want to know chavez lowered his gaze from the heavens to my face inside since i didnt have much choice and he had the gun i let him lead me across the street id always been able to relax inside my home protected by two deadbolts and an ace security system not to mention that i lived on the tenth floor with chavez taking up too much space in my winter white living room i doubted id calm down anytime soon you want a drink i blurted his dark brows lifted and i wanted to take the question back this wasnt a social occasion i dont drink he said it was my turn to look surprised chavez definitely seemed the drinking type of course appearances were never reliable eric had seemed like a gentleman but hed taken off and left me in an alley with a gunwielding maniac guess he hadnt been the one after all you think asked my increasingly sarcastic inner critic my eyes scratchy from wearing contacts ached i only wore the lenses on datesin other words once in a blue moonpreferring my glasses for everyday use im going to the bathroom i announced pausing when he followed me i havent needed help since i was two tough i dont plan to let you disappear theres only one way out what about these he indicated the french doors that led to my balcony i had another set in the bedroom ten floors down spider woman im not he almost smiled caught himself and scowled ill be right here i just bet you will i muttered and slammed the bathroom door while i was at it i washed my face changed into my sweats then grabbed my glasses i might as well be comfortable and kidnapped when i stepped into the front room chavez contemplated me for several ticks of the clock i hated being stared at probably went back to those days in junior high when being stared at was never a good thing what i snapped you wear glasses im a short dumpy plain girl who reads books for a living of course i wear glasses he tilted his head you read books for a living of all the things he could have focused on in my statement he chose that one i rolled my eyes never mind you said youd answer my questions sure but first show me all the emails you got from this guy so you admit he was there im not nuts chavez slid his weapon into a holster tucked under one arm he was there id known that but i felt better having him say it i also felt better now that hed put away the gun it wasnt very nice of you to try and make me think i was crazy im not nice he flicked a finger at the computer in the corner of my dining room the emails hed kidnapped me to look at emails who was this guy and who was eric i started to concoct all kinds of conspiracy theories huh he said when hed read all of the messages nothing weird should there be considering what this guy is yeah is eric some sort of secret agent and if so what did he want with me besides the obvious agent of the devil chavez murmured still staring at the computer screen not much of a secret i frowned is that code for terrorist terrorist he glanced at me amusement in his eyes though nothing so lighthearted showed on his face you think im homeland security fbi cia youre something got that right considering his accent his appearance his innate foreignness maybe he was the terrorist except we hadnt been at wareven a cold onewith any hispanic countries for a long long time of course pretty much everyone hated us lately dea i blurted you think the guy was a drug dealer youve got quite an imagination but youre way off base get me on base then hes a demon and for some reason he wants you hes a what fallen angel spawn of satan minion of hell soulless evil creepy thing for the first time tonight i was speechless id started to believe that maybe chavez wasnt crazy maybe he was just a gungho member of one of the many law enforcement agencies in a country that had gone a little overboard on security after september eleventh who could blame us but demons if erics a demon i said slowly that makes you a rogue demon hunter i blinked lost in the buffyverse are we that show was a real pain in my ass he muttered i was not having this conversation except i was not sure what kind of demon he is chavez continued as if he hadnt just said something weirder than weird salt didnt work neither did a silver bullet maybe because theres no such thing as demons he turned a dark placid stare in my direction then what do you call your date a jerk but that doesnt mean hes the devil in disguise you didnt think he was such a jerk when you were letting him stick his tongue down your throat i stiffened even as my face flooded with heat you shouldnt have been watching if i hadnt youd be dead now he tilted his head you dont seem the kind of girl whod let a guy screw her against the wall of an alley gee thanks i think i took a deep breath and admitted the truth though im not sure why i dont know what got into me it was almost eric i ignored that i dont sleep with men on a first date i just felt what he leaned forward face intense i searched for the word to describe my bizarre lapse of character consumed i said i couldnt seem to stop what was happening i didnt want to chavez jumped to his feet and began to pace hes some kind of incubus which is he paused surprised youve never heard of an incubus of course im just a little rusty on my demonology havent had to use it in ohmy entire life a slight narrowing of his eyes was the only indication that he didnt find me half as funny as i found myself an incubus uses sex the way the rest of us use hamburger i got some bizarre images on that one and made a face i meant an incubus feeds on sex chavez muttered if he goes too long without it he dies so actually hes just like a regular guy ha ha an incubus can also compel people to do what they normally wouldnt hence your humping him in the alley i wasnt you were going to yeah i was that eric had been a demon capable of influencing me to have sex with him explained a lot if i could only get past the demon part but i couldnt i dont believe any of this youd rather believe you were so overcome with lust for a guy youd just met that you were not only going to bring him back to your apartment after an hour in his company but you were perfectly willing to do him in an alley with me watching when he put it like that i still didnt believe eric was an incubus why did you i blurted excuse me why did you think eric was a demon he seemed normal to me does he have a tail im not aware of thats a myth tails on demons some have them true but not all and not eric then why him he turned away trade secret i stared at his back as he studied my collection of books on ancient civilizations most guys took one look at them and headed for the door i hoped hed do the same but no such luck trade secret i repeated thats convincing shouldnt there be nice men in white coats searching for you somewhere he faced me again are you a librarian my back stiffened as if id been slapped on the butt what i wasnt even sure why i was insulted except that id spent the better part of my afternoon off getting ready for the date from hell literally according to chavez you said you read books for a living im an agent i sell books to publishers oh yeah i kind of felt that way about it too i dont suppose you have any books on demons what do you need a book for unless i know exactly whats necessary to kill a particular type of demon they wont die a convenient excuse to explain why his methods didnt produce results i recalled reading somewhere that the insane often constructed elaborate delusions with rules that actually made sense to the not so crazy youre the demon hunter why dont you have a book there are way too many demons to fit in a single book and i cant exactly carry twenty or thirty books with me everywhere i go nor memorize all the types and the methods what are the chances that the demon youre searching for would be listed in a book i might have good point you kidnapped me because you thought i was a librarian i kidnapped you because you had info from the demon now that youve seen it you can leave the book he gestured at the case i dont have anything on demons never studied them wasnt interested disappointment trickled over his face like water down a windowpane you cant help me then you need a different kind of help than i can give you you think im insane big time his smile was as sad as his eyes i hope you never have a reason to change your mind he left without any further attempt to convince me that there were demons in the world he also left without a goodbye going straight to the front door then closing it quietly behind him after that the night got boring i certainly couldnt sleep so i made myself some tea and settled down to work i had a stack of manuscripts with my name on them i always did reading was how i spent my free time and that wasnt so bad i loved books i just hated selling them id been an agent for two years and i was beginning to get the drift that i wasnt any good at it another depressing tidbit to add to a long list of them what was i going to do if i didnt do this id come to believe that selling books was like selling a sunset or a lake or the bluest blue sky how do you put a price on perfection whenever i found a really great story all i wanted to do was share it with the worldat any price which made me a shitty agent i was no good at my chosen profession i felt as if i were letting my mother down the only time i was happy was when i lost myself in another reality one of adventure and romance a life i craved but would never have i turned to the stack of manuscripts id brought home from work unfortunately the first one was more boring than peeling paint with my fingernails and did nothing to get my mind off chavez interesting that i found myself unable to stop thinking about him instead of eric tattooed homicidal maniacs are always more fascinating than slim blond surgeons i muttered and why was that i forced myself back to the book one good thing it made me sleepy just after midnight i gave up and went to bed all the excitement had revved me up and now i was crashing hard everything went black not more than an instant after my head hit the pillow i had a doozy of a dream the french doors opened a breeze fluttered the curtains the quilt waved like wind across water as it slithered off my bed the sheets soon followed my body was hot almost feverish i yanked off my sweat suit and lay naked to the night a shadow slid from the balcony and into my room like a spreading stain the gray darkness crept across the carpet up the side of the bed and spilled over me i was no longer hot but pleasantly cool the rapidly chilling sweat causing goose bumps to rise on my skin my sigh was arousal desperation need writhing i cried out and the shadow took the shape of a man no more than a shade really impossible to see who he was or even if he was the wind was a whisper all around me a language i didnt understand yet words that encouraged me nonetheless the air touched me everywhere a caress that i welcomed id been waiting for this all of my life did i mention that i was a virgin the featherlight stroke of lips to the pulse at my throat a tongue trailing over one breast then the other teeth grazing my nipple then my stomach then my thigh heated breath brushed the curls between my legs as a clever tongue did things that made me both limp and tense tantalized and tortured i came awake panting and gasping my dream orgasm still rocketing through my body i glanced around my room and stifled a scream the balcony doors were open and a man stood on the other side i fumbled for the phone knowing it was too late for but i had to try unfortunately at the first press of a button the first tiny beep the man on the balcony walked into my room i dropped the phone you chavez bent and picked up the bedspread from the floor then calmly flipped it around my shoulders and turned away i hadnt gone to bed naked but i was now how much of that dream had been real what are you doing here i thought weve been over this there arent any demons chavez go away i couldnt just let him come back and murder you i nearly dropped the bedspread murder me since when does he want to murder me what part of incubus didnt you understand the part where he kills me he feeds off of sex still not hearing death anywhere in that explanation after hes through with the women hes chosen they he paused stuck his fingers into his pockets and shrugged theyre sucked dry which means he has sex with them until they turn to dust chavez had an answer to everything i still wasnt buying any of it thanks for the info i said but you dont need to stay ill be extra careful besides ive got great locks and an even better security system i got in that stopped me how breaking and entering the demon will have an even easier time because they can teleport thats it i pointed to the door im sick of your fairy tales fairies arent my department out i shouted chavez was unimpressed with my theatrics his gaze wandered over the room over me i pulled the bedspread tighter across my breasts i wanted to watch for a while just in case he was nearby then i saw someone moving around in your apartment you mean someone like me his dark serious eyes met mine definitely not you despite my brave words i glanced toward the bedroom door chavez laid a hand on my arm i searched the place no ones here his touch in my bedroom in the night with me wearing nothing but a blanket should have been unnerving instead i found it comforting my reactions to men tonight were nothing short of bizarre no one except you i muttered the room was dark his figure shadowy i was reminded of the dream and my skin suddenly felt too small for my body i shifted and he stepped back quickly as if he didnt want to get too close to me almost as if he were afraid i glanced up and his eyes glittered in the small amount of light from the half moon that spilled through the open french doors what time was it how long had i been asleep i was so confusedgoing from unconscious to conscious from fear to safety from arousal toarousal all over again with chavez looming over me while i was still naked my body humming from an orgasm that had seemed pretty real my head spun i swayed and he grabbed me by the shoulders chica that voice trilled along my flesh like warm water in winter both familiar and foreign i could listen to him all night did you touch me while i was sleeping i hadnt meant to ask that but now that i had i wondered instead of an answer he kissed me and i forgot the question he was so tall my neck crackled as i leaned back so good at kissing i automatically went onto my tiptoes to get more his mouth was soft sweet now that i was closer i caught the tang of the cigarette hed no doubt been smoking on my balcony he must have chewed gum to get rid of the taste i shuddered as his tongue tested my lips opening i let him all the way in i wound my arms around his neck and the quilt slid to the floor id never been kissed the way chavez kissed me as if i were the only woman in the world the only woman hed ever wanted foolish i know but thats how he made me feel and i began to wonder in a far corner of my mind exactly who was the sexual demon even though my naked body was pressed against him he did nothing but kiss me he didnt slide those big hard hands over my skin no matter how much i might want him to in fact when i ran my fingers across his shoulders down his arms i discovered he was clasping those hands behind his back as if to keep them under control i dont know how long the embrace would have continued how far we would have gone i was certainly in no hurry to end it but chavez stepped back shook his head when i would have followed then snatched the blanket again and covered me lo siento he murmured i dont know why i he glanced away and the movement pulled the collar of his shirt in a different direction he did have a tattoo on his breastbone but i still couldnt see what it was my fingers touched my lips they felt swollen sensitive needy i craved the taste of his mouth was not having had sex ever turning me into a nymphomaniac although i had to say that what id felt while kissing chavez had been far and away better than what id felt with eric then id been out of control this time chavez had been i liked that he had been fighting the lust i was not the kind of girl who inspired it when we werent talking incubus demon anyway i shouldnt he continued youre a i stiffened a what a job my eyes narrowed but he still wasnt looking at me im supposed to take care of you not take you so why did you his glance snapped back to mine i didnt i wouldnt he sighed i cant cant chavezs lips twisted thats not true as you can easily see my gaze lowered to his jeans he definitely could i mean i cant and still live with myself youve been influenced by an incubus they mess with your mind all you want is sex that doesnt sound like me exactly the incubus hasnt influenced you what you kissed me why i couldnt help myself you were so small and lost he shrugged and those glassesall those books iwhat i never finished school i dont read that well i like women who do youre attracted to women who read yeah i shook my head this was all still insane and so was he maybe youre the one whose mind has been messed with i muttered he gave a short humorless bark of laughter i havent had sex in a very long time i kind of forgot how much i missed it forgot even i whod never had sex certainly didnt forget about it until i saw you on the bed with him i stiffened i wasnt with him that had been a dream hadnt it hes in your head now hell haunt you hell make you so insane with lust youll have no choice but to i dont believe this i interrupted i do he pulled a cigarette from his coat which hed laid on my unused exercise bike in the corner im going to he nodded toward the balcony he seemed so sad so defeated somehow even though i thought he was crazy i still wanted to soothe him chavez thought my glasses were sexy my dumpiness cute my penchant for reading on a friday night attractive no wonder i wanted to keep him around forever which only made me as nuts as he was but i was starting to wonder if that wasnt the case you want some coffee i blurted yeah he slipped out the doors and into the night quickly i threw on my sweats grabbed my glasses and hurried through the darkened apartment in the kitchen i reached for the light switch and someone grabbed my hand i drew a deep breath to shriek and another hand slapped over my mouth this was happening to me with far too much regularity lately did you think id let you go the voice wasnt erics come to think of it the guy was too tall to be eric his body was pressed to the length of mine and then some whoever he was he really really liked me i tried to speak but he tightened his hold pulling my neck backward until i thought he might break it i went silent i had no choice youre mine now i need what only you can give he kissed my neck scraped the throbbing vein with his teeth a weird lethargy came over me my blood seemed to thicken and slow my pulse beat in my ears as if id been running for miles or making love for a long time i was suddenly freeto scream to fight to escape i did none of those things instead i turned around and flicked on the lights as id suspected the man in my kitchen wasnt eric id never seen him before taller broader his hair was dark blond his eyes brown he shrugged out of his shirt the garment slid down his arms and spilled onto the floor his skin was glaring white like marble the muscles shifting and bunching as he moved i was seized with a sudden urge to lick every one of them as he rose above me came into me took me over and over until i i shook my head hard tempted to slam it against the countertop until i found myself again whwho are you i asked you know his fingers slid down his chest caressing himself lowering to the zipper that bulged over an erection my mouth went dry at the notion of seeing the sound of the zipper being opened made me start so violently my skin tingled youll die willingly in my arms he whispered they always do as if from a long way off i heard his words puzzled over them discarded any unease the sex would be amazing id come screaming id beg him to do me again and he would hed keep at it until i was chavez loomed behind him his presence brought me back to myself so when he snapped get down i did hitting the floor just as a sheet of flame streaked from his hand i cried out as the strange man in my kitchen the one id been willing to screw seven ways from sunday became a burning ball of fire my smoke detector went off the sprinklers rained water on us all the man whose name i didnt know stopped burning there wasnt a mark on him he stared at chavez you again me always the stranger turned to me we arent finished he said and then he disappeared you believe me now chavez asked as we dripped all over the carpet from the kitchen into the living room hed turned off the alarm which had shut down the sprinklers while i called security and lied i burned some toast no one asked why i was making toast at am one of the perks of living in a building like thismoney not only got you attention it got you left alone the guy disappeared my voice sounded as dazed as i felt poof chavez gave me a slight push and i collapsed onto the couch water darkened his hair ran down his cheekbones dotted his eyelashes towels hall closet he retrieved a stack divided them and sat in a chair as he began to dry his hair that wasnt eric i said no he also wasnt human no shapeshifter most likely i tried not to gape but failed like a werewolf in a way demons shift into different people werewolves change from a man or a woman into a wolf then back again you say that as if they exist he lifted a brow i lifted my hand i dont want to know chavez went silent for a moment then said slowly why did he come back im irresistible sure but he trailed off i was still stuck on sure was he being a smartass and why did i care why did my chest which had felt like a cow was sitting on it suddenly feel like butterflies were twirling merrily inside because of that damn kiss i couldnt stop thinking about it but i had to maybe he wasnt crazy anymore actually he never had been but that only meant he was a demon hunter he was so not for me hes an incubus chavez murmured thinking out loud i yanked my eyes and my mind from his mouth and listened he needs sex to live but there are a million plus women in this city why not get it somewhere else yeah why not his head tilted what did he say to you that we werent finished he needed something only i could give what got me i was new at the whole sexual demon gig if i can discover why hes obsessed with you i might be able to figure out exactly what kind of incubus he is theres more than one kind chavez nodded the heading incubus covers a wide range of sexfeeding demons each one of those has its own particular method of death terrific i muttered as soon as i know exactly what he is i can find out how to kill him his dark eyes met mine youll be safe as soon as i kill him funny i felt safe now an hour later wed cleaned up the apartment cleaned up ourselves i was dry and dressed unfortunately so was chavez id kind of enjoyed the short period when hed worn nothing but a towel around his waist and another looped around his neck as his clothes tumbled around the dryer with mine we sat in the living room lights blaring against the remnants of the night id made the promised coffee and we both sipped from the largest travel mugs i had in my cupboard i needed more sleep but since i wasnt going to get it id have more coffee what do we do now i asked he glanced up we we i said firmly i dont plan to sit around waiting to be demon raped his hands jerked sloshing hot liquid very near the rim he wont rape you hell make you want him make being the operative word even if i think i want him i really dont which means hes raping my mind as well as my body i set down the cup my hands had begun to shake at the thought of what was after me of my complete lack of control whenever it came near i want him dead i lifted my chin preferably last week okay chavez murmured staring at me with newfound respect i guess its we what do we do now i repeated you know where eric lives no and he wasnt supposed to know where i lived either thats the beauty of internet dating not exactly if you know what youre doing an address is pretty easy to find can i use the computer moments later we had eric leaventhalls address on the upper east side lets pay him a visit chavez glanced at the window the sun was just coming up weve got only so many hours of daylight what difference does daylight make dark spirits arise at sunset seems like theres too much evil in the world all day to have demons only available at night just because the demon is sleeping doesnt mean it isnt still whispering which actually explained quite a lot not too long afterward we paused on the sidewalk opposite erics building he had a doorman too now what i asked but chavez was already cutting across the street i hurried after him catching up as he slipped around the corner and headed for the service entrance chavez stopped and handed me a pair of plastic gloves after donning a pair himself he withdrew a long thin strip of wire from his pocket done this before i asked chavez didnt bother to answer as he jimmied the lock at erics door he used what appeared to be a pocket calculator and a squiggly power cord to disable the security system my feeling of safety was rapidly disintegrating where did you learn this stuff i asked rogue demon hunter school he shook his head and used the wire again popping the lock as if it were a toy on the streets like everyone else everyone chavez glanced over his shoulder and smiled his teeth were so white they blinded me or maybe i was dazzled by the excitement in his eyes he was having fun and at the moment so was i i couldnt recall the last time id felt this alive was it because i might be dead soon or was it because i was with him everyone i knew chavez answered in mexico city there were way too many people not enough houses or jobs mexico city explained the accent i doubt chavez would ever be able to completely explain his occupation how did one become a rogue demon hunter chavez pushed open the door motioned for me to stay in the hall i was about to argue but did i really want to be caught breaking and entering of course just being here was probably enough to get me arrested nevertheless i stayed behind for about thirty seconds when ricky ricardolike cursing erupted i trailed the sound to where chavez knelt next to erics dead body ohoh i muttered i was suddenly not having fun chavez glanced up he was dead when i got here the cops are not going to believe that which is why we wont tell them i blinked butbutwe have to chavez examined eric hands still covered in the plastic gloves where is that written in the code of common decency never read it why wasnt i surprised chavez went on with the examination pushing at erics skin turning him this way and that ruffling through his hair before leaning back theres no visible means of death what difference does that make could help to reveal what kind of demon this is for instance if the demon killed eric then inhabited the body hed want to kill him so as not to leave a mark okay but if he inhabited him then killed him when he was finished no reason not to cause graphic bloody death at my sharp glance he shrugged demons are evil they like to make a mess wait a second i was suddenly so dizzy i had to sit and i didnt want to do so next to the body with no convenient chair nearby i made do with leaning against the nearest wall are you saying i had a date with a dead guy i kissed a dead guy sorry not as sorry as i am i dragged the back of my hand across my mouth and got a good taste of plastic glove at least it made me stop tasting eric look at the bright side chavez said at least you didnt screw a dead guy hey there was a silver lining to every cloud if eric was dead on our date how could he seem so alive when demons animate a body the postmortem changes are frozen once the demon exits the decomposition begins he lifted erics arm or tried to eric was stiff as acorpse by the state of rigor mortis the demon has been gone less than eight hours why bother to exit at all hed found a perfectly good body several reasons oneid seen his face and he knew id be searching for it twodecomposition can only be stopped for a few days demon reanimation or not dead is dead chavez stood but continued to stare at eric thinking out loud a demon inhabiting the newly dead makes me think night wanderera rakshasas hindu i said his gaze flicked to mine how do you know that i have a degree in ancient civilizations why a question id often asked myself i was interested so am i what else do you know about rakshasas squat i remember the name but i didnt spend too much time on ancient religions i was more concerned with the rise and fall weapons and wars i wouldnt think that would be up your alley at all i shrugged i do recall that one thing most civilizations have in common is a belief in a greater good as well as a greater evil his gaze sharpened exactly demons by any name are still demons and god is still god if you search long enough you can find a similarity even in the most disparate societies too bad no one ever takes the time to look too bad i echoed now tell me about the rakshasas a hindu demon that reanimates corpses except the rakshasas isnt interested in sex unless its with the dead or maybe they eat the dead his lips tightened i cant remember either way fire is how you kill them and it didnt work on this one you didnt use fire on eric that was on the other guy i frowned whoever he was has to be the same demon inhabiting different men otherwise why did he come back for you why did he say we arent finished why did he know me i shrugged since i didnt have a clue why do demons inhabit people anyway why dont they just come to earth and do their thing demons in their natural form are so hideous humans can go mad from the sight their voices are so godawful eardrums rupture people can die from the shock before a demon ever gets its jollies as terrible as possession is the alternative is worse we went silent for several moments just contemplating it any other ideas on what kind of demon were dealing with i asked no every one that i know of would turn to dust at the touch of salt fire or silver which means chavez lifted his gaze to mine weve got a demon ive never heard about does that happen a lot he lit a cigarette and took a drag never never my voice rose so high he flinched here he held the cigarette to my lips i jerked back im not so hysterical that i need to start smoking but thanks anyway smoke keeps the demon from possessing you he glanced at the body i think this ones gone but it never hurts to be cautious he stuffed the unlit end between my lips with a little too much force the filter smashed against my teeth i shoved him away then took a drag i wanted to avoid demon possession as much as the next person there i let the smoke trail out through my nosehey id gone to college i thought this demon only inhabited dead people since i dont know for sure what type of demon this is it could do just about anything terrific i muttered mmm my curiosity was piqued by something else hed said possession really happens that isnt just in the movies his face went still his eyes hard demons inhabit anything and anyone they damn well please id been curious but suddenly i didnt want to know what hed seen what hed done what hed killed his eyes were haunted for a reason chavez stared at me for several seconds as if he planned to say something else then he took the cigarette pinched the lit end between his fingers in a macho display that i refused to acknowledge and placed the butt into one of his pockets without another word chavez trailed around the apartment picking through the mail then moving on to the phone messages not wanting to be left alone with dead erici had the nasty suspicion hed open his eyes and try to seduce me againi tagged along we need to find the other guy chavez murmured according to you hes already dead whats the rush maybe the demon is still inside him we could save the next poor sap on the dead dating parade i hadnt thought of that which was why he was the demon hunter and i was the one being hunted by the demon we left the apartment and chavez glanced at the security camera on the wall we may as well call the police i muttered theyll be calling me soon enough i checked it when we came in the lights not on whoever was here before us disabled the camera that was nice of him i think i doubt nice had anything to do with it chavez headed for the service entrance this demons a lot smarter than most are they usually stupid no but theyre not exactly savvy with the ways of the world kind of like a bull in a china shopflailing around obsessed with getting whatever it is they came here for they dont worry about security cameras police or demon hunters they think theyre invincible but they arent not invincible no but hard to kill only one maybe two methods will work and the trick is to figure out what before the thing kills you the trill of excitement returned life and death good versus evil the stuff of really great booksand chavez was living it too bad i might be dying from it you must be very good at your job i said im the best how did i get so lucky chavez checked the alley then motioned for me to follow him lucky how did you find me i paused actually i guess you found eric is there a demon hunter hotline no he didnt elaborate just stalked off so fast i had to move double time on my short legs to catch up his face when i reached him was stonelike unwelcoming wrong question i guess so i tried another are there a lot of demon hunters you have a club or something the look he shot my way would have scared me several hours ago now it intrigued me there was a whole world out here id never known about no one did rogue means i dont play well with others he said i dont like rules there are rules ive heard theres a society of monster hunters had a few approach me about a demonhunting unit i guess theyve got government funding the us government hard to believe isnt it after being kissed by a dead man dating not really funny how a little thing like that changes your whole perspective i wouldnt call it funny why didnt you throw in with the monster hunters even though getting paid would be nice he began you dont get paid chica he said with infinite patience who would pay me how do you live very carefully at my frown he lifted one hand i do odd jobs for cash cash are you an illegal alien yes oh i couldnt think of anything to say to that wouldnt it be easier to get paid for what youre already doing for free the money would be nice he repeated but the government would want to know where im from how i got here what ive been up to for half my life i dont want to tell them and i dont like being told what to do i ask no ones permission i never will i eliminate evil from this world no matter the cost sounds like a good policy to me i doubt youd think so if you were part of that cost i stopped and stared at him youd sacrifice an innocent person to eliminate a demon he kept walking but his answer drifted back on the early morning breeze id sacrifice anything and anyone so much for any dreams i might have had about chavez and me not that id been having any i wasnt that stupid but i had felt safe with him until hed admitted hed toss me over a cliff to rid the world of one more demon well he hadnt actually said that but i could read between the lines pretty well occupational hazard mind if i use the computer again chavez asked when we returned to my apartment the place smelled wet i opened a window lit a candle turned up the heat go ahead i yanked the newspaper out of my mail drop i want to find out who that second guy was i dont think you need to i turned the paper in his direction the face of the man chavez had lit on fire last night was all over the front page he appeared to be missing or at least his body was malcolm tanner i read stockbroker hasnt this demon ever heard of street guys their deaths and disappearances would be less noticeable would you date one i didnt date malcolm true you didnt even know him which might be the point you lost me if he picked people you knew sooner or later the police would be knocking on your door but random guys hard to connect why bother setting up a date in the first place malcolm just popped in here uninvited some demons need to be invited in first like a vampire now youre catching on but malcolm was the same demon as eric just a different body so since i invited eric malcolm could enter how do you know this stuff i asked is there a wwwdemonologycom no what ive learned is mostly by trial and error he lifted one shoulder a little halfassed but all ive got youve tried salt fire silver whats next holy water the hail mary the lords prayer sacramental wine the host im seeing a pattern christian symbols he sighed the problem is there are a lot of demons that arent christian in origin and some that predate christianity since id studied plenty of ancient civilizations i was aware of this still the idea that something could predate time as we marked it had always creeped me out probably an american phobia in countries that had been around for a few gazillion millennia people didnt get wiggy over a little prechristian demon or ten did they how can you kill something so ancient i wondered aloud it aint easy my gaze was drawn to his earring if christian symbols dont work then whats with that i didnt say they dont work they do more than most he fingered the cross in his earlobe every little bit helps what can i do any good at research actually yes research was what had brought me to my major i loved looking things up finding answers to questions only i cared about his gaze traveled from the tip of my overly curly hair past my blackrimmed glasses to the ample breasts and hips ensconced in an oversized sweatshirt and equally oversized jeans ive always had a thing for librarians he murmured theyre sohelpful considering his face that hair the body i just bet they were im not a librarian i said stiffly we could pretend i stared at him for several seconds was he trying to make a joke it was hard to tell when he never cracked a smile chavez turned away and the strange charged moment was gone im going for supplies before it gets dark what supplies holy water host where do you get stuff like that at the discount holy water and host shop a church they give it out because you ask because i ask yes my skepticism must have shown on my face because he continued priests believe in evil kit if they didnt they wouldnt have a job theyve seen amazing thingsgreat good and great bad and you do you ever see any good his eyes met mine not until just lately whatd i do you chased me out of the alley you wouldnt stop questioning me you werent afraid to stand up to the insane man you believed had shot your date you did shoot my date but i didnt kill him there is that i tilted my head curious what else you let me into your home at gunpoint i muttered not all the time you went breaking and entering with me no ones ever done that before no one he shook his head i got all warm and fuzzy so your interpretation of good is pretty damn broad basically i hadnt screamed called the police or kicked him out of my house give me the nobel prize youre courageous unselfish a risk taker chavez said that didnt sound like me at all it sounded more like the me i wanted to be and then theres that kiss i looked up and he smiled good i asked more like great hours passed the sun moved across the sky and began to descend i began to get nervous where was chavez if i were a demon id put my death on hold and go straight for the demon hunter the thought made me unable to sit still so i paced from the bedroom to the living room and back again im sure chavez has had demons come after him before i told myself hell that was probably what he wanted nevertheless i was close to frantic the first man who thought i kissed greator at least the first whod told me sojust my luck hed walk out of my life and never come back id just completed my fiftyfifth pass into the bedroom when a soft footfall from the living room caused me to freeze i bit my lip then glanced at the window the sun was still up though not for long nevertheless daylight was daylight and we still had it chavez i hurried into the front room and stopped dead at the sight of a strange young man with a huge pot of daffodils how did you get in the doorman he thought you were gone should i set this here he indicated the floor sure fine whatever i wanted him gone i cast a quick look over my shoulder down the hall heard the slight thud of the pot hitting the carpet and turned around the kid was right next to me freakishly fast i murmured in a not quite human way youre so pretty he whispered his eyes were hypnotic blue his hair golden curls way too young for me but i didnt care he was pretty and he thought i was too what more could a girl ask for a soul i took one step back and his arm snaked around my waist his full soft lips brushed mine souls are overrated i whispered you got that right his mouth moved down my neck his hands moved up my ribs my knees wobbled the desire pulsed in my blood with the beat of a thousand ancient drums i couldnt think straight a virgin he lowered his hands to the small of my back and ground us together the best time there is his words penetrated the haze how do you know im he pressed his nose to my neck and inhaled you smell all fresh and new never touched youve been waiting for me i hadnt been waiting for him id been waiting for true love i knew that of course i knew i wasnt a slut and look how that was working out virgins taste the best he licked my cheek and i didnt mind since i was a little howard hughes about germs another reason i was probably still a virgin that should have disturbed me i fought against the lustful lethargy and focused on what he was saying instead of what he was doing taste sex is food for me baby baby again wish i could find the will to care or to kick him where it counted only virgins can keep me alive so you want it against the wall on the bed the table the counter the floor im easy actually i was he fumbled with the zipper of my jeans ill consume you he whispered and no one will ever know i will at the sound of chavezs voice the lust id been unable to fight fled i managed to shove the flower boy away chavez tossed a vial of burgundy liquid into the young mans face i flinched half expecting him to shriek as his skin dissolved i should have known better sacramental wine laughing he shook himself like a dog coming out of a lake you have got to be kidding me ave maria chavez intoned gratia plena latin the boy shook his head that language is as dead as i am our father who art in heaven way after my time dude nothing will help you im gonna have her you can watch if you want chavez socked the kid in the mouth blood spurted dont touch her dont look at her dont come near her again shes mine his steadily fattening lip muffled his voice there arent a lot like her left in this city chavez glanced my way and the demon took the opportunity to escape poof why didnt he disappear as soon as he saw you did he want a fat lip teleporting is a tricky business sometimes they have to recharge before they can do it again that made sense in this weird new demony world i was living in why bother with flowers i indicated the pot with a flick of my finger you let him in no he was just here when i came out of the bedroom i knew something was weird but he said the doorman let him in probably didnt want you to scream and alert me before he could get into your head where have you been my fear made me shout how long does it take to get christian paraphernalia these days not that long ive been waiting for him to show himself you used me as bait chavez cast me a quick wary glance i wouldnt have let him hurt you kit i was right outside he didnt deny he was using me id known that yet it still hurt he was just herelike malcolm you couldnt have seen him i did chavez strode to my bookcases and removed a tiny camera from between two books no wonder hed been so damn interested in them he came out before dark he said which makes him a lot more powerful than i thought silence fell between us but my mind was full of questions thoughts disappointments when chavez spoke again i was glad for the distraction he said there werent very many like you in the city what did he mean i didnt want to tell him but i had to im a virgin his eyes widened you didnt think that was something you should tell me thats not something ive ever told anyone madre de dios hell never stop chasing you why because these days chica there arent that many virgins to be had spectacular i said try to save myself for marriage and end up demon bait the story of my life well not exactly my life had never been this exciting or weird or terrifying lucky me you were saving yourself for marriage i glanced at chavez to find him staring at me i suppose i was an oddityin this century as well as the last i shrugged or at least true love you should have been born in another age he murmured eerily echoing my thoughts today i wish i had been get your coat he ordered i gaped at the sudden change in subject zip your pants i blushed to realize the flower boy had started undressing me and i had barely noticed not only was i scared of the demon i was starting to be scared of myself i closed my pants with an annoyed snick where are we going i asked as we stepped onto the street once more to someone who can help us they couldnt help us before i only use this source when i have no other choice since when dont you have a choice this demon is more powerful than any ive ever faced i dont know what to do that chavez whose life had been devoted to ridding the earth of demons would admit he had no clue how to kill the one that wanted to kill me frightened me more than anything else ever had i stopped and was nearly run over by the usual suspectstourists street people localsthe throng of manhattan someone cursed and gave me a little shove theres no place like home chavez grabbed my arm and tugged me along ill take care of you you keep saying that yet im still not feeling all warm and cozy i ignored the dark warning glance he slid my way where are we going near the world trade center i slowed though i knew better than to stop there is no world trade center anymore thats why my friend is so dangerous i dont understand she lost her son there shes never gotten over it stories like those were far too commonplace so many people had lost so much has she tried a support group i asked shes got her own way of dealing which is she talks to him the night shot an icy trickle down my suddenly sweaty shoulders talks to him i repeated dumbly samantha is a psychic okay i said why not i thought the anger and grief changed her changed her how as we walked in the direction of the water the statue of liberty ellis island the crowd thinned she channeled her pain into power she wasnt psychic before is that why shes dangerous she isnt dangerous but sometimes what she brings out is brings out of where youll see what if i dont want to i muttered chavez just kept walking id only been to the world trade center site oncein broad sunny daylight the place had been cool gray haunted even then at night id rather have a root canal amazingly there was no one standing at the fence that encircled the great big empty maybe i wasnt the only one who found that hole in the middle of all the skyscrapers obscene we were searching for a demon i was of the opinion that several of them had knocked down these buildings one tuesday morning in september as we approached i heard a slight whisper half believing the dead spoke i hung back a woman stood at the fence staring into the crevice and murmuring her skirt was long billowy and black her sweater loose and pale gray had she been there the entire time and i hadnt seen her or had she just appeared it didnt matter she was here now and i knew without asking that she was the one wed come to see her hair flowed to her waist and shone stark white in the faint light of the moon the air around her seemed to hum chavez moved forward leaving me behind i didnt mind there was something about her that disturbed me almost as much as that hole samantha he murmured and the air stilled chavez she said without turning around you have a question for the spirits yes she faced us and i couldnt help but stare samantha didnt appear a day over forty she might be well preserved except for the hair premature electric white or had a terrible shock caused the change id heard such things could happen but hadnt believed them of course i hadnt believed in demons either until yesterday whos this she asked shes being hunted by a demon so its demon hunter to the rescue samanthas smile was a little bit sad you must be desperate if youve come to me i dont like to disturb you the only thing that disturbs me is people who need help but are too afraid to ask for it chavez went silent and her expression softened never mind i live only to help and ive never regretted my sacrifice i must have made a small sound a slight movement because she tilted her head and her eerily light blue eyes seemed to look straight at me then right through me chavez didnt tell you what to see the other side she had to sacrifice her earthly sight he murmured samantha was blind i lifted a hand and waved she didnt blink just continued to stare slightly to the right of my shoulder a minor price to pay to see my son again she said what else do you see i asked whatever you ask i glanced around at the deserted cement slab i cant believe there isnt a line of people waiting to do just that i see the truth and the truth is often unpleasant some actually most would rather not know after i saw enough horror word got around people stopped coming maybe if you werent chavez shot me a glare and i bit off the comment i had no business making but that didnt stop samantha from hearing it apparently here she asked you think if i spent my days in a park filled with children a candy store riding a merrygoround that then id see happiness you might truth is truth mara i jerked how did she know my real name chavez cast me a sideways glance and shrugged i was starting to see why he only consulted her when he had to the woman was spooky and she hadnt even called the spirits yet i come to this place because of what it is samantha spread one hand in an allencompassing gesture a graveyard the windcool and dampshrieked in off the water dirt flew up from below and swirled above our heads if you want to call the spirits samantha continued its best to go where there are a lot of them which must be why all those houses built on indian burial grounds have so many problems exactly the spirit energy is off the geiger counters samantha turned her attention to chavez what is it you want to know i thought the demon that is after kit was an incubus but i havent been able to kill it in any of the usual ways i discovered the beast is reanimating dead bodies so i considered rakshasas but fire didnt work either i see your problem samantha faced the fence again ready yes the wind lifted her hair fluttered her skirt but left us untouched a faint glow began all around her like a banked flame though no warmth flowed when she turned her eyes were even lighter than before nearly white are you a godly spirit chavez asked the voice that slithered from samanthas mouth was not her own no that cant be good i murmured samanthas weird gaze slid in my direction no longer blind whatever was inside her saw me and smiled that saying about your blood running cold it can happen no chavez waved his arms in front of her deal with me chavez the creepy white eyes flickered back to him its been too long the voice brought to mind a snakesomewhat sibilantbut so deep so sluggish it seemed to be coming from a tape recorder with severely low batteries not long enough chavez said what have you unleashed this time wouldnt you like to know if i ask you must tell the rules i hate them what have you done chavez repeated you should be thanking me if i didnt unleash them what would you do with your life answer chavez snapped ive made something new new chavez said since when can you create new demons i could always create them i had to have something to do while i whiled away several thousand millennia whats changed is that now i can set them free why now samantha began to laugha deep wicked sound that would have been comicallike the laughter that spewed from a plastic halloween skullif it hadnt been real didnt you get my hint hesheit swung out samanthas hands to encompass the gray silent crater the beginning of the end my time is coming mark of the beast sixsixsix four horsemen is any of this ringing a bell end of days i whispered now youre talking samantha said in a voice that i was starting to believe was satans anyone up for an apocalypse im jewish i said we dont do the apocalypse samanthas body swayed to the side and something very unsamantha peered back at me armageddon is nondenominational what falls on one falls on all besides youre not completely jewish you dont go to temple and you eat gyros thats lamb damn she smacked herself in the head with the heel of her hand i never could keep those clovenhoofed animals straight and you with such nice ones too i glanced at chavez does she always channel the prince of darkness smart girl said the sonorous voice too bad she has to die enough chavez snapped i want to know what youve sent and how i kill it hes satan the inventor of lies i said we cant trust him when he inhabits samantha he has to tell the truth fucking ouija board rules satan in a samantha suit muttered id never done the ouija board being easily freaked out but id heard stories the spirits who chose to answer were compelled to tell the truth however the truth could be told in many different and confusing ways what did you send chavez ground out from between clenched teeth theres no name samanthas head tilted this demon is very hard to kill hard to detect too no one cares these days about gratuitous sex promiscuous behavior on a first date has become the norm she peered at me and i ordered myself to stare right back i refused to feel guilty about what id done while id been under the influence of a demon a few things need to be tweaked samantha continued i combined an incubus with a rakshasas which requires a dead body but they dont last very long and all those dead bodies are going to pile up now if i could have the demon take the form of a human possession drives a human being insane chavez said you should know i looked toward chavez just as he flinched then his mouth tightened as did his fists i touched his arm slugging samantha would do us no good but youre right the deep slithery voice flowed from samanthas pretty mouth the longer i saw it the creepier it became too many stark raving crazy people would tip off the white hats as well what i need is for the demon to be able to look human but not actually be human that would work focus chavez clapped his hands in front of samanthas face how do i kill the one you already sent samantha smirked youre going to love this somehow i doubt it the demon feeds on sex with virgins been there know that in the good old days they sacrificed virgins to appease the beast man i miss those days chavez made a whirling motion with his index fingerget on with itbut i already knew what was coming all right all right to save her from a fate worse than death all you have to do is sacrifice her a rumbling began at first i thought there was a train coming maybe a tornado a tour bus but the sound was coming from chavezs chest pure fury get out he shouted leave this place too late samanthas eyes rolled back im already here he caught her as she tumbled but only a few seconds later she struggled upright im okay her voice was her own again so were her eyes i was so glad she couldnt see me i was shaking and no doubt as pale as the pavement i didnt want to scare her then again shed been the one speaking with the devils voice what did i do she asked we were both silent and she sighed the devil yeah chavez said i hate it when that happens she stuck her tongue out and made a face i can taste the brimstone for days im sorry i had to ask chavez murmured but i had to what did i say heard any whispers about the end of the world there are always whispers especially since this she jabbed her thumb in the direction of the empty space the spirits have been restless theres a lot of evil going on and it seems to be getting worse with every passing day chavez and i exchanged glances that would follow if there were new and old demons being released at an unknown rate he said the apocalypse is coming chavez murmured hes probably right samantha refused to let chavez and me take her home i have too much to do here we need to be prepared you really think the end is near he asked theyve been predicting that for centuries sooner or later theyve gotta be right when she wasnt speaking with satans voice samantha made a lot of sense could i talk to you privately chavez samantha tilted her head in my directionthough slightly to the left sure i said ill just bei glanced around the depressing cement walkwayover here i hadnt gone very far when samantha began to whisper furiously chavezs deep tones answered with equal fervor i couldnt hear what they were saying but not for lack of trying hello i jumped heart thrumming so loudly i could hardly hear the beat slowed at the sight of the tall slim beautiful blond woman near the fence i must have been too preoccupied with samantha and chavez to notice her hi i returned i didnt mean to disturb you you werent its lonely out here ill say this place had given me the willies even before satan showed up hell kill you i jumped again whwhat she indicated chavez hes a warrior he understands that sometimes one must be lost for the good of many my eyes narrowed who are you she smiled and the familiar low thrumming sexual need beganthe need that was brought on by a demon i dont do women i said you will she was probably right i opened my mouth to shout for chavez hes obsessed ever since the unfortunate incident my mouth snapped shut did i really want to know this uhhuh what incident possessed by a demon poor baby i glanced at chavez who was still speaking with samantha if he looked my way hed only see me talking to what appeared to be a harmless woman i remembered what chavez had said to satan possession drives humans insane exactly youre saying hes crazy she shrugged crazy is a relative term not in my book what happened he was possessed his mother did everything she could think of to drive the demon out she licked her lips and gave an mmm of pleasure i gritted my teeth against the response that tugged in my belly she was quite creative my eyes narrowed what the hell does that mean have you seen his tattoo she gave it to him herself when he was fifteen i frowned and then she whipped him starved him locked him in the basement the usual things people do to get rid of the devil sounds like the things people do who are the devil ignorance fear theyre my masters domain he had chavez possessed so his mother would hurt him thats what he does my fingers curled until the nails bit into my palms the pain eased both the anger and the infuriating sexual arousal how did they get the demon out exorcism those are still done she scowled every damn day i found that hard to believe but what did i know once chavez was clean he became the most feared of all the hunters he was young but he was thorough hell do anything to defeat one single demon he hates us news flasheveryone does not you when you arent messing with my head i do messing with heads is in my job description her gaze swept over me among other things he will kill you you know chavezs face was fierce as he listened to samantha he did seem capable of anything even murder and you wont i asked i didnt say that but youll die happy i promise i was tempted to run except where would i go no matter where i went if chavez didnt find me the demon would wouldnt it be better to die easy at the hands of a friend than horribly at the hands of evil chavez i shouted bring the salt i give him credit he came running but she was already gone that was a woman he said sex is sex a comment only made by someone whos never had any he went silent for a second a woman is a succubus thanks for the tip our demon is supposed to be part incubus i think this one is a lot of things true what did she say i hesitated if chavez had wanted me to know about his possession about the abuse at the hands of his mother about the exorcism hed have told me i wasnt going to bring it up i also wasnt going to bring up my imminent death from the look on his face he was upset enough already the usual i lied sex until i die never give up yadayada the powers of evil need a new tune he stared at me for a few seconds and i managed to stare right back amazing what a little armageddon can do for ones lying skills you ready to go he said at last i glanced at the fence the concrete the hole definitely chavez hailed a conveniently trolling cab then gave the driver my address silence fell between us what did we have to talk about his method my funeral damnation forgiveness i preferred the quiet the doorman already accustomed to chavezs presence nodded as we got on the elevator ohoh i didnt want chavez arrested for my murder hed be needed in the coming days to keep the demon horde down to a manageable level if not thwart the coming apocalypse i let us into the apartment moved into the living room as he locked up behind us not that locking up had done much good so far theres a service entrance i blurted do you know how to shortcircuit the security cameras what the hell are you talking about youll need to get out of the building unseen he crossed the room stopping so close i could feel the heat of him calling out to the sudden chill in me you think id hurt you hurt no kill yes he threw up his hands then stalked away that damn demon redundant i think i surprised a laugh out of him im not going to kill you kit you have to i understand although my voice faded as a thought took holdan insidious thought but a very tempting one id changed over the last few days probably because the whole world had or rather the world had always been far different than i realized id saved myself for marriage true love but i wasnt going to find either one in the next five minutes did i really want to die a virgin one request i blurted he sighed impatiently kit i am not going to make love to me chavez stared at me for several seconds then slowly shook his head my hopes died he crossed the room and i tensed knowing this was the end make it quick i said gently he reached out and slid my glasses from my nose folding them before setting them aside it will definitely not be quick querida he murmured then he kissed me the single kiss wed shared had come in the depths of the night as this did then id still believed in a world without pure evil then id believed i had a life ahead of me that i still had a shot at true love now i knew better that knowledge made the kiss no less mindbending maybe the knowledge made it more so if tonight was my last night i wanted to spend it like this with him i opened my mouth deepened the kiss he tasted of mintfresh cool new i licked his teeth and he moaned my fingers managed to pop several buttons of his shirt before fumbling in their haste and becoming unable to finish the job instead i latched on to the lapels and tugged he stumbled forward almost knocking me down lo siento i i kissed him again no talking if we talked too much i might lose my nerve if we waited too long he might lose his grabbing his hand i practically dragged him to the bedroom there i yanked my shirt over my head and tossed it into a corner my bra followed just as fast his dark gaze wandered over my breasts i might be short and i might be dumpy but my breasts were pretty darn good he kicked the door shut behind us his shirt hung open framing his chest the ripples and curves all that bronzed skini wanted to run my hands everywhere so i did my thumb skated over the tattoo on his breastbone very small without my glasses i had to get closer to make out the tiny cross inside of a circle i wondered what it meant then i wondered if id ever have time to ask i leaned forward and ran my tongue over one nipple then the other they tightened against my lips so i scored them with my teeth he grabbed my hair and i stilled ready to fight for the right to taste him but instead of pulling me away his palm cupped my head urging me on i suckled him the tiny bud of his nipple hard against the roof of my mouth his free hand smoothed over my back up my ribs then settled onto my breast where his thumb teased me into a similar state my knees wobbled so i let them collapse sliding my cheek down his stomach rubbing my mouth against the front of his pants id always wanted to open a guys zipper with my teeth it didnt work as well as id hoped my teeth ached the zipper stuck too much pressure from the other side impatience flared and he wrenched the thing open taking himself in his own hand and jerking his palm over the length just once i shoved him out of the way and took him in my mouth no time to be shy no time to learn all the nuances i wanted to experience everything and i only had one night his palm at my neck he showed me how it was done throwing his head back his hips flexing in an everincreasing rhythm when he pulled away i pulled him back but he lifted me to my feet and kissed me so roughly our teeth clashed he was hard and hot against my stomach wet from my mouth i gave an involuntary shimmy and the resulting slide made us both groan he tore his lips from mine and pressed our foreheads together where did you learn this stuff im making it up as i go along the soft breath of his laughter brushed my cheek i love a woman with an imagination after inching me backward several steps he put a hand to the center of my chest and shoved i tumbled onto the bed he stared at me with a strange expressionas if hed never seen me before what i asked youre so pretty i snorted dont bother chavez im a sure thing bother his head tilted his hair swung free of his shoulders and his earring winked in between the dark strands im not pretty never have been i never will be dont care or at least i didnt anymore what would be the point the realization was freeing i didnt care about my rounded belly my wide hips the stretch marks that resembled a road atlas across my butt none of that mattered anymore only this did him me together just once he shucked his pants then removed mine and joined me on the bed i lifted my arms he came into my embrace and brushed his lips across the slope of one breast i know where beauty lives he murmured his dark fingers drifted over my skin gentle and sure as he aroused me he learned what i liked as i did his clever mouth wandered his devilish tongue arrowed in on erogenous zones id never heard of as well as those everyone had his beard had lengthened past the rough stage and become almost soft the texture both tickled and tormented another sensation to add to so many he teased me to oblivion more than once and then he teased me to the precipice again i cant i gasped you will his body slid up and over me nearly into me i opened for him and he stopped ahhh i smacked his back with my fists and he choked on stifled laughter the sound rumbled all the way to my toes making me hum everywhere making me want to laugh too to be laughing now was both a wonder and a gifta downright miracle this might hurt a little he said what did i tell you about talking his smiled deepened and he kissed me the way i was starting to crave hot wet lots of tongue the man knew what he was doing while i was preoccupied with his talent at tickling my tonsils he drove forward burying himself inside it didnt hurt i feltfull a tiny bit uncomfortable maybe i shifted and something went ping that hurt a little but i forgot all about it when the very earth seemed to move i know that sounds so dumb but there you go warm and alive he filled me his body moved to an ancient rhythma rhythm echoed in the beat of my blood i rocked against him he rocked against me and for that moment there were only the two of us his face was fierce his eyes dark intense as they stared into mine id always thought sex an act better performed in the dark but wed left on all the lights enjoying every sight every sound i couldnt help but reach up and touch his cheek chavez i whispered he slowed staring down at me with such an intense searching expression warmth spread through my chest something had changed but i wasnt sure what my name is zac zac i repeated at the sound of his name on my lips he pulsed inside me the force of his release inciting my own the orgasm went on and onhim me usthere was nothing and no one else just the way the world ought to be when it was over we lay tangled together he stroked my hip i played with his hair i didnt want to let him go and that was a very dangerous thing to want did the world move i asked oh yeah he lifted his head kissed the tip of my nose i got that weird feeling againthe sock in the gut the warm gushy swirl my eyes burned whats the matter i glanced at the window still night but not for long you think we can do it again he rolled off me but grabbed my hand as he went tangling our fingers together then playing footsie too we can but not right this second i drew one finger over his tattoo what does this mean he stiffened you know what a crucifix is yes but the circle eternity your mother i bit off the word but he already knew it told you about my mother im sorry dont be she did her best hurting you was her best she didnt know any better i was possessed by a demon what was she supposed to do i wasnt sure what would i do if my son had a bit of satan inside of him i hoped i never had to find out he touched the tattoo with his fingernail she gave me the cross i did the circle myself i thought of the pain he must have enduredat his own hands and those of someone he trusted i wanted to take that pain away but it was too late and i didnt know how why did you do it i asked so id never forget what id sworn to do if it takes eternity i will kill every demon on this earth i shivered knowing that meant hed kill me too cold he pulled me closer ill keep you warm while we sleep ohoh said a tiny panicked voice in my head i was in serious trouble now id vowed not to have sex without love but what was i going to do now that id fallen in love because of the sex not love no i was just dazzled by the orgasm once he killed me everything would be different i pulled away i couldnt sleep in his arms and wake up to a gun a knife or whatever he planned to use getting out of bed i yanked the sheet along with me and wrapped it around my chest chavez didnt even try to cover up merely stared at me with wary confused eyes when are you going to do it i demanded you have to give the equipment a rest kit im not seventeen not it it when are you going to kill me his brows drew together his mouth turned down he sat up slowly and i took a step back at the violence in his expression what do you think i am a monster worse than the ones i hunt he climbed off the mattress and began to stalk me around the room you think id make love to you then murder you you have to zac dont call me that his voice broke anguish washed over his face you cant call me by that name and think id hurt you i let him get too close and he grabbed me then gave me a good shake i wouldnt kill you not for any reason you wont need to said a strange voice from the door i yelped and spun around no big shock to find another stranger in my house this guy was nondescriptnot too tall not too short average weight dishwater hair gray eyes but there was something strange about him that i couldnt quite put my finger on does a person have to be dead to find some peace around here i muttered of course being dead didnt seem to mean what it once had according to satan the dead would soon be dating all over the place chavez shoved me behind him facing the latest demon wearing nothing but a scowl what do you want to set the record straight i guess you didnt tell her chavezs shoulders tensed and i got a bad feeling tell me what i asked quietly average joe grinned theres more than one way to sacrifice a virgin i put my hand on chavezs shoulder and spun him around you knew that sacrificing the virginity would work as well as sacrificing the virgin no wonder hed been so insistent that he wasnt going to kill me hed known he wouldnt have to im not sure why the truth hadnt occurred to me before now just because id been told the sacrifice would be my life didnt make it true especially since id been told that by a demon dont listen to him chavez said he wants to put a wedge between us im just not sure why i wanted to believe he hadnt known really i did but there was that voice in my head that kept saying did you really think he wanted you look in the mirror then look at him but there was another voice that insisted chavez was different he knew about the ugliness that lived beneath the beauty he killed it every day hed said he liked women with glasses women who read of course that sounded like a bigger lie than any of the others what were you talking to samantha about all that time i asked anger flared in his eyes i couldnt believe chavez had the balls to be angry what did you think we were talking about where to bury my body i told you ive killed a lot of things but i dont kill people the demon snorted men theyll say anything wont they i didnt even glance his way instead holding chavezs eyes you should have shot me it might have hurt less he winced just because samantha suggested that removing the virginity the demon craved might be the answer doesnt mean i dont care about you the demon in the doorway began to laugh you shut up chavez snarled why is he still here i demanded you sacrificed the virgin shouldnt he be demon dust that isnt a demon i switched my attention to the now giggling stranger and i realized what was different i didnt want to jump him i only wanted to slug himand every other guy in the room the sexual obsession was gone youd think id be happier about it what is it i asked beelzebub i glanced at chavez again he seems to like me for a minute i sympathized imagine spending half your life chasing evil killing it and enjoying periodic visits from satan whenever things got really rough not much of a life but that still didnt excuse him chavez had betrayed me in the worst possible way a man could betray a woman hed pretended to want me but hed only been using me not for sex but to save my life and the lives of others i still wasnt going to thank him so the earth moved for you kit satan asked i could feel the blood drain from my face hed been watching i glanced at chavez who appeared as horrified as i was i hate to be the one to break it to you chavez but that wasnt a result of your prowess the demon was dying chavez ignored him reaching for me i stumbled back i didnt want him touching me not now or ever again pain flickered in his eyes turning quickly to fury when the devil snickered chavez spun toward him you did this you sent the demon you made it so id have to hurt her in one way or another whats your point satan asked cursing chavez snatched his pants from the floor and withdrew a vial of holy water the devil rolled his eyes that isnt going to kill me chavez tossed the contents into satans face steam the scent of cooking flesh the hiss of flames for an instant i saw the monster behind the mask i know it wont kill you chavez murmured but it sure does sting the devil writhed for several seconds i was hoping hed begin to cry im melting then do so instead he straightened and lowered his hands from his face i tensed expecting something ugly but he appeared exactly the same quit being childish he snapped i came to offer you a deal a deal with the devil hmm let me think chavez tapped his fingernail against his chin no dont be so hasty the end is here demons are pouring out of hell even as we speak youre the only chance the human race has got why me he asked as you saidi like you always have when i was inside you for that brief time i felt at home fuck you chavez snarled i cast you out and you arent getting back in he yanked a cigarette from his pants and hurriedly lit the end his hand shook causing the devil to smirk and me to take a single step closer i might want to stick a sharp implement repeatedly into chavezs eye but i wasnt going to let satan hurt him what is he talking about i asked i thought you were possessed by a demon hes the father of all demons in every one lies a little of him youre more like me than you want to believe satan whispered thats why youre so good at killing us you can smell evil a mile away cant you chavez took a deep drag and blew the smoke in the other mans face instead of coughing the devil inhaled it like ambrosia thats what i thought he murmured heres the deal if you can kill everything ive released before the end of the world ill call off the apocalypse itll be like a video game except real since when is he in charge of the apocalypse i asked neither one of them answered whens the end of the world chavez took another drag thats for me to know and you to find out now who was being childish what happens if i lose you know the devil began to laugh again then he disappeared i stared at the place where hed been for several seconds before i lifted my gaze to chavez what happens he gets my soul ask a stupid question chavez began to gather his clothes youre going you heard him i dont have much time or maybe you have plenty no one knows when the end of days actually is and what if he just decides to finish things when theres only one demon left to down it doesnt work like that how does it work there is an end of time except no ones been able to figure out the exact date there are a lot of theories the apocalypse is a christian belief and not all christians believe it not believing it doesnt make it any less real sixtyseven percent of the world isnt christian i pointed out where do you get all this information chavez asked i like trivia i like smart women i narrowed my eyes and he went on satan does come out of the christian legends but rememberall religions believe in good and evil just because he isnt called satan doesnt make him any less the leader of the underworld you saw him hes real which makes the apocalypse real even if hes lying it wont hurt to kill all the demons its winwin unless you lose someones got to do it quickly he dressed then it was time to say goodbye i didnt want to what id felt for chavez had been genuine even if what hed pretended had beenpretend you must have found my last requesti sighed and turned awayhysterical i found it flattering he inched in front of me and arousing as well as convenient kit you were going to seduce me i shrugged you didnt have to he took a breath as if to speak and i lifted my hand to stop him id had an epiphany they didnt happen often but when they did i listened it doesnt matter if you knew or you didnt you saved my life my anger had faded chavez did what he had to do for the greater good i didnt like what hed done to me that was a lie id liked it a lot i couldnt throw stones id slept with him when i thought he planned to kill me the ultimate onenight stand id sworn to hold out for true lovethen at the first sign of an apocalypse id thrown away my vow for a good time that id discovered i loved him later did not excuse me in the least i couldnt stay angry with him when hed only done what i askedand what was absolutely necessary do your job i said save the world his gaze softened my stomach flipflopped i couldnt believe i was giving him up but then i didnt have much choice either i knew you were special from the beginning he murmured can i have a kiss goodbye you can have two the kiss and the one that followed were everything id ever dreamed of in a farewell embracethe heat of lust the gentleness in caring my eyes stung and i fought not to let the tears fall he had to go and i had to let him chavez lifted his head if the world wasnt about to end i put my fingers over his lips but it is yeah he stepped back i clung just a little if the world doesnt end give me a call he never would a guy like him a girl like meheat of the moment and all that as soon as i was out of sight id be out of mind but it sounded goodas if i didnt care as if i werent dying inside hasta luego chica the tears were blinding me i wiped them away but he was already gone the snick of my apartment door closing echoed in the suddenly silent room i was alone again just me and my big fat boring life my life didnt get any better without chavez in itthere was nothing worth getting up for id never liked my job now i loathed it what good was trying to sell books to people who were only promoted for paying far less than what they were worth what good was any job when the world was about to end i drifted waiting for something to happen but i wasnt sure what three months later i was still waiting i fell asleep late one night while reading a manuscript just another saturday and i didnt have anybody because i didnt want anybody but him i dreamed of chavez all the time and in my dreams he was with me his touch gentle his eyes full of love definitely a fantasy but all i had kit wake up his voice sounded so close his fingers were so warm as he removed my glasses i fought against sleep and opened my eyes hey chica i closed them again squeezed tight and tried once more he was blurry but he was here i struggled upright and manuscript pages spilled from my lap cascading onto the floor i let them go is the world saved chavez shook his head he appeared tired drained defeated not the man whod left on a quest only three months ago why did you come he hesitated ii need you okay i tangled my fingers with his and started for the bedroom id take whatever i could get no he snatched his hand away thats not what i meant what did you mean iive seen some terrible things the world is a mess kit ive noticed through everything i remembered you youre what kept me going i wanted to believe him but i wanted to be sure and i wanted him to be too we had one night chavez manufactured intimacy in exchange for the death of evilor at least one little piece of it we had sex i know for me it was more my eyes widened my breath caught i couldnt speak he didnt seem to have that problem i was crazy for you from the first moment i saw you but i couldnt touch you i had to protect me i smiled and some of his tension eased you did im safe now because of you and im grateful i dont want you to be grateful he growled what do you want me to be he glanced away and muttered mine huh he took a deep breath and looked back i want you to be mine i want to have someone somewhere whos waiting for me im sick of being alone and lonely the only time i felt as if i belonged anywhere was when i was here with you what are you saying i love you i cant live without you i hope you feel the same way i hesitated and his shoulders sagged i know a girl like you and a guy like meyou probably forgot about me the instant i walked out that door i let a small laugh escape youre kind of unforgettable hope lit his eyes i didnt want that hope to die i love you too zac he smiled at my use of his name for him the gift of his name went deeper than the gift of his body my life without you isnt much of a life i hate it here when being here means im not with you i want to help you save the world chavez shook his head so hard his hair flew and his earring caught the lamplight and flashed bright sparks into my eyes i wont let you risk yourself but you can risk yourself i hunt demons thats what i do its all ive ever done seems to me that the last demon took both of us to kill without me youd still be flailing around with your salt and your holy water and your sacramental wine his brow lifted dont forget the silver bullets how could i when they worked so well his smile turned shy i was thinkinglove has always been stronger than anything i agree maybe it wasnt so much the sex that killed that demon as the love you could be right so the more love we make you dont need an excuse zac then together we fight together we win or we dont you cant fight chavez scoffed i meant in a pen is mightier than the sword kind of way research he said i reached under the coffee table and pulled out a stack of papers that id written without you here ive had a lot of time on my hands i offered them to him and his eyes wandered slowly over all that id learned then lifted to mine the excitement was back this is great kit i told you i was good at trivia this isnt trivial his hands clenched on the papers this is worldsaving my face heated at the praise and i ducked my head he inched in close put a finger to my chin and lifted itll be dangerous he said youll protect me i will his words were a promise one that he kept did the world end not yet
