alex scarrow city of shadows prologue september new york roald waldstein stared at the manhattan skyline the pallid sky above the south end of the city was still smudged with a faint pall of dust the thin twist of smoke coming from where the twin towers had stood just two days ago looked like the careless rubbing out of a pencil drawing a ghost of the towers that had once been there god he said and its still burning my dad said it might carry on burning for weeks roald turned to look at chanice williams really uhhuh she nodded confidently working gum in her mouth almost mechanically said so on fox news too like everyone else at clinton hill elementary school chanice had become something of a newsstation junkie tuning in before and after school the cartoon channels completely forgotten for now you think anyones alive in there still asked roald dunno i heard they lookin just in case tho he watched the puffs of dark smoke rising lazily i hope theres no one trapped in that alive that would be horrible come on we should get on to school said chanice well be late roald nodded at her to head back up the alleyway without him ill come in a bit shizzy she clucked her tongue you gonna get youself another demerit you want that waldo the kids all called him waldo as in wheres waldo it took the first five minutes of the first day of school to get lumped with that strokeofgenius nickname the thickframed glasses and untameable hair had played their part too she shrugged her shoulders ok your funeral mr professor he watched her turn and go weaving her way up the alleyway stepping round a dustbin that had spilled rubbish across the cobbles ill be along in a bit he called after her your funeral she shrugged again jus dont miss registration she called over her shoulder or miss chudasama gonna get medieval on yo he turned back to watch the skyline a train rumbled noisily overhead across the williamsburg bridge heading into manhattan they were saying the trains and subway into manhattan were still pretty deserted easy seats everyone figured something else bad was bound to happen again at any moment another plane a bomb perhaps his mother said that too just like chanice like every new yorker like every american dulleyed from watching too much tv theyll be back theyll be back to finish us all off just you see it was just him and his mother and the tv set in their onebedroom apartment she had three different parttime jobs and what time was left after that was spent microwaving tv dinners or poptart breakfasts outside work her life was montel williams judge judy or oprah winfrey so she didnt really ever have much to say that wasnt already a newspaper headline to be honest she rarely had much to say that was original or vaguely interesting but she had this morning something that had lodged firmly in his mind shed turned away from her small blackandwhite tv in the kitchen to look at him mug of coffee in one hand cigarette in the other roald dont you just wish you could go back to tuesday morning and tell those poor souls not to come in to work or just just go in there and scream fire or something he nodded now such a small step in time that would be just two days to save three thousand lives he turned away from the east river beyond the railing the lowtide shingle was covered with rubbish nappies shopping trolleys and plastic bags and seagulls picking for titbits among it just two days he started to make his way back up the alleyway passing a boardedup archway to his right chipboard panels nailed over old rustred brickwork covered with luridcoloured spraypaint gang tags one of the panels had been pulled away revealing a corrugated metal shutter that was halfway up he squatted down to look inside curious his mother was always cautioning him how curiosity killed the cat that or got into very big trouble with the local police department if it didnt mind its own goshdarn business the muted light of day pushed the darkness within far enough back that he could see the place had been used by drug addicts or vagrants broken glass discarded needles a dirty mattress a forgotten part of brooklyn he wondered when this place last had a proper use a purpose other than being some dark hole for an addict to crawl into or merely a dark empty space beneath an old bridge waldo he looked up the alleyway chanice bless her was tapping her toe waiting for him acting like she was his big sister or something she cupped her mouth you reeeally dont wanna be late again ya momll kill you come on coming he got up and turned round one last time to catch a glimpse of the smudge in the sky over manhattan september new york mr waldstein ssir roald waldstein turned to see dr joseph olivera approaching the man joined him beside the railing and together they looked out at the sedate east river my apologies joseph said waldstein i was a million miles away there uh thats ok sir waldstein smiled he liked olivera the technician reminded him of himself at that age hungry for knowledge to show the world what his agile mind contained hungry to show the world an incredible theoretical possibility that it was possible to step backwards through the membrane of spacetime as easy as it was to step through the tattered rip in a bedsheet you know joseph i came across this place when i was just a boy when i was eleven ssorry this place waldstein said turning to look back at the alley the archway no one comes down here its a backwater you you lived round here in brooklyn he nodded moved to chicago after my mother died i lived with my aunt after olivera nodded he knew that much of this legendary mans life chicago onwards waldsteins early life the first years alone with his mother waldstein had always preferred to keep utterly private a mediastream interviewer had once called him a biographers nightmare perfect location this waldstein said i never ever forgot about it this time and this place you know joseph tomorrow every new yorker will have their eyes up on the sky we could walk in and out of this alleyway dressed as clowns all day long and no one would remember that yes sir perfect location waldstein muttered he smiled wistfully they listened to the distant hiss of morning traffic the cry of a dozen gulls strutting among the shingle and rubbish below fighting for scraps mr waldstein can i ask you a question the old man smiled pushed a shock of his wild wiry grey hair away from his eyes you can ask joseph i cant promise you an answer though olivera sucked in a breath nervous waldstein suspected he knew what the man was going to ask at some point or another every person hed ever worked with long enough eventually mustered their courage and got round to asking the exact same question he let olivera continue with it all the same better to get this out of the way mr waldstein when you went back that first time you know in the chicago demonstration here it comes he half smiled yup that question all right did you did you ever get to ssee my wife my child olivera nodded wideeyed and very nervous waldstein suspected the man must have worked himself up for this moment must have spent the last few months at the institute and the last few weeks here waiting for that perfect moment to pop the question and here it was supposedly what this young man judged to be the perfect moment waldstein sighed as he cast his mind back to fading memories of that day thats what hed intended wasnt it just one last chance to say goodbye to both of them to tell them how much he loved them because hed been far too busy to say that before the accident far too busy with his work a chance to say i love you that and of course a chance to demonstrate to the assembled audience of invited journalists that the chanjackson tachyon theory with a few alterations to neutrino channelling could actually be put into practice olivera swallowed anxiously as he waited for waldstein to answer back home back in this precise question actually had its very own name the question was known as the waldstein enigma alternatively it was known as the billion dollar question any journalist who squeezed the answer to that out of him was never going to have to chase down a new story again waldstein turned to him he toyed with the idea of answering this young man or at least telling him what hed not managed to see regretfully he replied slowly i never got to see them again joseph there you are more than ive ever told anyone else he hoped the young man would be satisfied with that oliveras adams apple bobbed he was fidgeting licking his lips eager to ask the inevitable followon question so what what did you ssee mr waldstein waldstein laughed softly shook his head now joseph lets leave it there shall we i oliveras cheeks darkened he looked down at his feet ashamed aware that hed overstepped a line im sssorry sir i thats quite all right everyone asks eventually joseph everyone the silence was uncomfortable for the younger man waldstein put him out of his misery i believe you have an update for me uh uh yes i do sir the ai imprints are completed now ive checked them through and run simulations theyre one hundred per cent stable good then i suppose were nearly ready to upload those into the units theyre very nearly ready sir full growth cycle in the next hour waldstein patted his shoulder gently a conciliatory gesture to reassure the younger man there was no harm done just now curiosity didnt kill this cat did it mother lets go back inside and check on them then chapter new york wednesday september if youre reading this then i guess someone somewhere does go through the rubbish and read every piece of paper that gets balled up and tossed away so then in that case here it is my names sal thats all you need to know about my name im fourteen i think actually i might be fifteen now im not sure im from india and heres the tricky bit im from you read that right please read on dont throw this away im not making that up nor am i mad just go with it for now please theres a long story that comes before this page but all you really need to know is that right now i feel lost im scared ive lost another home we cant go back to the archway the place we were living in maddy says we cant ever go back there like ever its marked she said compromised its no longer a secret and safe place so now we have nowhere to hide its just us lot and an old busthing that maddy calls an rv jahulla what a collection of freaks we make theres maddy shes a nerd from this is closest to her pastlife time she was like nine or ten in so she actually remembers this year then theres liam hes a ships steward or was he was working on the titanic yes that titanic the one that sank in hes really out of his depth here ha ha even though weve been stationed back in for a few months now hes still like some confused old fuddahman even though hes technically only sixteen theres foster who really is old not just acting old like liam hes ninety or something and im pretty sure hes dying he knows the most about waldsteins agency he was the one who recruited each of us from our past lives but even he doesnt know who sent those killers after us someones found out about us what were doing back here to preserve the timeline then theres this man called rashim hes stuck with us for now we pulled him out of a corrupted version of roman times because he shouldnt have been there he went back there with a group of people from the year oh you should know this really important the worlds dying in or about to thats why they came back they wanted to start over to give humanity a second chance to get the world right but you cant do that see you just cant mess with history theres one way it goes and thats it call it fate destiny kismet as foster says for good or bad history has only one true course you mess with that and youre looking at chaos hell itself opening up hes actually not as wackomad as im making him sound thats why we were saved recruited to work for this agency set up by a man called waldstein hes some billionaire inventor type from the future and then we have two cloned humans with computers for brains bob and becks gorilla guy and the ice queen theyre well special i suppose lets leave it at that oh i almost forgot weve also got a robot from with us that looks like a cross between a filing cabinet and the old cartoon character from when my parents were kids spongebob squarepants i think rashim designed him as a joke or something thats us like i say a bunch of freaks and were trying to run for our lives across a country thats suddenly doing a doubletake at anyone who looks remotely out of the ordinary so much for remaining deep undercover were running through an america thats still in deep shock from what happened yesterday you can see it in their faces everyone expects another terrorist bomb another aeroplane attack i guess my father would say to these americans get jahully well used to it after all he lived through the terror attacks of the twentyteens all those dirty bombs and suicide attacks in northern india shaddyah when arent humans always killing each other so we are running i cant say where i wont say where were going just in case reader youre one of them cant be too careful right but we have a plan sort of theres a place were driving to and we just stopped here at this roadside shopping malldinerservice station place its been a crazy two days a blur one big panic after another i needed to write this get my head on a little straighter so there it is maybe our job of stopping pinchudda morons from messing with changing time is finished now maybe this agency things all over maybe all thats left for us is just trying to stay hidden staying alive i dont know i dont know what the next few weeks hold for us jahulla i dont even know what the next day holds for us i dont even know if these last six or so months have even been for real maybe its all been one big nightmare and ill wake up again in my bedroom in mumbai and itll be again nice dream so ive written enough maybe too much i might just rip this up burn it eat it or something or maybe ill stuff it into my burger king box with the rest of the cold fries and floppy gherkin where no one is likely to find it but writing this helped a little i guess my name is sal and like i said im lost and quite a bit scared and not at all happy about things right now chapter september new york maddy took off her glasses and buried her face in her hands air hissed between her fingers a long torpid sigh that was a signal to the other two liam and sal to shuttheheckup for just a moment and let her think the archway was quiet except for its usual noises the faint chug of a filtration pump from the back room a tap dripping somewhere the soft burr of a dozen pc computers heat fans it sounded like it did on any normal day except for perhaps the inane trashtalking between liam and sal playing mario kart on the nintendo hey whats up with that girl skippa chipped in spongebubba maddy raised a hand to shush the lab robot ok her voice was muffled behind her other hand this is what we need to do she straightened up put her glasses back on and turned towards the monitors on the computer table she addressed the webcam computerbob a black doslike dialogue box appeared on the monitor beside the camera yes maddy can you force the archways displacement field to reset to monday today was tuesday early afternoon outside the archway a collective pause had settled across the city a pause in which the sky was clear of planes television presenters had said all there was to say and everyone was still busy wondering if the last few hours had been for real and the twin towers really had just been completely destroyed affirmative do it then do it now whats going on asked rashim were all going back in time sal answered by one day the young technician still looked bewildered only a couple of hours ago from his perspective hed been approached by maddy and the others back in roman times as hed quietly been setting up the receiver array for the rest of his group to home in on now that was all history or not depending how you looked at it now he was here stuck with them because they couldnt just leave him behind dangling like a loose end and project exodus the project hed spent the last couple of years of his life working on well none of that would be happening now by grabbing him theyd managed to prevent a group of three hundred refugees from the future completely throwing history off track job done but now he and his cartooncharacter lab unit were stuck here with them so when exactly is this place asked rashim looking round the archway his voice rose with growing anxiety i mean this is twenty twentyfirstcentury tech by the look of it yes am i right this is the day the towers were knocked down by planes said liam september the eleventh maddy said quickly its our basetime our field office where weve been operating out of for the last few months the cursor on the dialogue box flickered stand by field resetting they heard the soft whine of energy discharging into the displacement machine and then the fluorescent lights dangling from the archways low ceiling suddenly blinked out and a moment later flickered back on the archway was still in the mess it had been when she and sal had fled back in time to the reign of caligula tidying all this up however was the last thing on her mind at the moment and now its yesterday said maddy the day before she sat down in the office chair beside the desk and huffed air which now gives us twentyfour hours breathing space before those psychotic killer meatbots come back to finish us off rashims dark eyebrows rose looking from maddy to the others for someone to add a word or two more of explanation psychotic therere more of them asked liam two more we think said sal six of them came through what killer things are these asked rashim six jayzus liams jaw dropped and you two managed to kill four of em could someone please tell me what psycho killer things youre talking about yes we did pretty good huh liam laughed ill say rashim closed his eyes please everyone will you stop ignoring me the others turned to look at him i im rashim opened his eyes and smiled half apologetically i im very close to uh losing my mind please the least one of you people can do is answer just one of my questions sal pointed at bob the psychotic meatbots were talking about are clones support units like these two four men and two women they came from the future to kill us rashim nodded gratefully then silently appraised bob hes a militarygrade gene product isnt he one of the earliergen versions correct bob rumbled computerbob dealt with two of them for us said maddy and one got taken out by a time wave i think the other one well you guys saw what happened one of the units had managed to leap after maddy and sal as their hastily opened escape portal began to collapse in on itself it had emerged on the other side missing both its feet and one hand and yet it had still managed to be quite lethal as bob held it down maddy had put several rounds into its bald human head the first and last time she ever intended to fire a gun at anything point blank you said six of them said rashim maddy nodded yup there are two more of them and they may be out there in new york somewhere sal sat down on the other chair beside maddy she scuffed the toes of her boots against the floor more of them could arrive she said right maddy another six maddy nodded tuesday morning sometime during tuesday morning thats when they arrived so right now its twelve noon monday which means weve got eighteen maybe nineteen hours before they come again and if another batch technically i guess the same batch dont come then weve still got those other two to worry about and theyll be back from wherever computerbob sent them on a wildgoose chase thats right bob isnt it affirmative affirmative both bobs answered the question maddy turned to look at them all two of them we might stand a chance against but if another six turn up right here in this archway she pulled on her lip made a face not the sort of face to instil confidence in her little team we could set some sort of a trap for them said liam as soon as they arrive get bob to open a portal and drop them right into that chaos space could we not do that maddy shrugged we could do but liam youre missing the point and its actually quite a big point liam splayed his hands irritated by her patronizing tone of voice what someone else knows about us liam someone knows exactly when and where we are were not a secret any more that means were still in danger added sal quietly if we stay here yes maddys words rang round the archway a reverberation off damp brick walls that seemed to last indefinitely and not quite fade away liam muttered a curse under his breath thats great i was just about gettin used to this place so i was im thinking the sooner we leave the better said maddy she regarded the gloomy interior hardly a place anyone would normally look at with dewyeyed fondness but it had become their home it had become something of a safe haven a nest a shelter and yes between the seemingly constant firefighting theyd experienced from here there had been moments of dare she say fun fun some good memories among all the scary ones that is liam sighed ah well was all the consolation he could offer them ah well its just bricks said sal without a great deal of conviction the squat lab robot flexed its pliable plastic face wrinkling its pickleshaped nose as its round and permanently staring eyes scanned the gloomy interior its a very messy place i dont like it very much yeah but its home said maddy or it was anyway she looked around the pitted and cracked floor to where a shallow scoop of concrete was missing where so many terrifying and unplanned lastminute portals had been opened up where a thick loop of cables dangled from the ceiling from which a horrific cretaceousera carnivore had once dropped down and butchered a man right in front of her eyes where power cables snaked from one side of the archways floor to the other there had once lain a carpet of dead and dying confederate and union soldiers men feebly crying out for water amid the acrid smoke of battle bleeding out for a war that should never have been where the walls flanked the shutter door the probing claws of irradiated mutant humans had once tried to pick through crumbling mortar to get in at them to eat them and planted on the very desk she was sitting at now the severed head of a young woman had rested recently grey eyes beautiful grey eyes glazed over and lifeless the cranium hacked open to reveal a bloody pulp and a small invaluable microchip inside ahhh memories precious memories maddy noted unenthusiastically youre right sal its just a bunch of bricks the sooner we get the hell out of here the better chapter september new york maddy took the subway across to manhattan and emerged at th street into the warmth of the sun middle of the day thats when the old man could be found in central park that was fosters pact with her his tacit promise when hed walked out on the team after their first mission youll always find me here at the same time feeding the pigeons shed made this trip nearly a dozen times now over the last six months six months worth of their bubble time monday and tuesday the th and th looped over and over again every time she sat down with him on that bench by the duck pond beside the hotdog cart it was for foster like their very first meeting after hed bid farewell and left her in charge of the team the world outside the archways protective field was linear a sequence of moments experienced by everyone in sensible chronological order but for maddy and the others it was time that occurred inside the archway that appeared to be linear while everything outside was a weird and endless fortyeighthour groundhog day shed asked the old man once why it was that she never bumped into copies of herself his answer had been both straightforward and oddly cryptic youre not of this timeline maddy none of you are you might as well be aliens visiting from another planet as far as earthly cause and effect is concerned reassuring perhaps but shed still ended up none the wiser as always she caught sight of him sitting on the bench sitting back and savouring the sun on his wrinkled face in that dark blue cardigan of his jeans too big for his narrow frame and that scuffed old yankees baseball cap clasped in his liverspotted hands she stopped for a moment watching him through the hotdog queue watching him through the clouds of billowing steam coming from the carts griddle a quiff of silverwhite hair fluttering on his head untidy unruly hair the likeness was so obvious now maddy knew now they all knew she wondered how none of them had ever noticed or remarked how much alike foster and liam looked yes age completely alters a persons appearance but there are those things that survive the years intact the shape and set of a persons eyes the habitual expression on ones face the lazy way you sit when you think no ones looking things that are as unique as a fingerprint liam and foster the very same person and she hadnt seen it until hed told her foster had given her no explanation for that none at all she had her theories perhaps one of them didnt belong in this timeline perhaps one of them had stepped across chaos space from another similar world and now there were accidentally two of them she wondered if somewhere beyond dimensions she couldnt even begin to comprehend there was an oldwoman version of herself she decided probably not she suspected in any dimension she was the same kind of person destined to get stressedout on all and everything and die young probably of high blood pressure or a heart attack nice thought she emerged round the end of the queue and fosters eyes were drawn away from the pigeons chasing each other for breadcrumbs at his feet his eyes lit up at the sight of her ahhh he smiled you found me she raised a hand to hush him politely i always do foster laughed i gather from that weve met before maddy nodded quite a few times now she looked around at the park the duck pond the hotdog vendor this is like happy days like a tv show ive seen way too many times talking to me must be like talking to someone with alzheimers foster grinned ive said that before havent i only every time we meet up listen foster she sat down beside him this times going to be different though oh we have to leave new york leave why maddy explained as succinctly as possible the handwritten message addressed to her about pandora from some mysterious informant sending through a message to the agency in the future and asking what the hell pandora was all about and then in short order a squad of support units arriving right in their archway hellbent on killing them all i dont know whats going on foster maybe our ability to contact the agency to contact waldstein has been compromised somehow intercepted by someone else she didnt bother telling foster that the last time theyd met here shed told him about the pandora message and it had been his suggestion that she communicate forward and ask if waldstein knew anything about it maddy hadnt come here to blame him for that neither of them were to know asking about pandora was going to lead to this point is someone now knows where we are foster and we could be jumped at any time by more of those things we have to leave like as soon as possible foster nodded slowly sadly it wasnt ever meant to last for eternity this agency it was a temporary fix to a problem he looked up at her theres something you need to know maddy he ran his tongue along his teeth beneath pursed lips maddy the agency its just just us she shrugged i know seriously he cocked a bushy eyebrow i already told you that as well yup jayzus must be annoying for you hearing me were leaving foster leaving first thing tomorrow morning were packing everything we need to set up again and well find some other place to carry on doing the job right he nodded thoughtfully thats probably very sensible and i want you to come with us foster shook his head i cant go back you know i cant enter a displacement field again i know she reached for one of his frail hands and squeezed it gently i know were just relocating for now no time travel no fields no tachyon particles no more damage to you were just taking a drive away from new york thats it she realized just how fragile he looked now when hed first recruited them yes shed noted he was old but hed looked robustold like some seasoned old army veteran hard as nails beneath a weathered exterior maddy i dont think theres much left of me his smile broke her heart im dying i have cancer all over she knew that it was something else hed already confessed on a previous visit foster i wish i could leave you here maddy looked around at the park the sun streaming through september leaves turning golden and beginning to fall beautiful hed told her he thought he might have just a few weeks left maybe if he was really lucky a couple of months the rate of cellular damage caused by time travel wasnt really quantifiable it happened thats all they knew i know youve earned this she said i know youve given the agency your life and you deserve to choose how to spend the time youve got left but we need you she squeezed his hand again i need you you know as much as i did do maddy she shook her head no no i dont im making mistakes were screwing up there are things stitched in history she shook her head not quite the right expression things prebaked into history messages written for us i dont know maybe even written by us like weve been here before or something i dont understand whats going on i dont her voice hitched with emotion she stopped and looked across the pigeons at a toddler on reins tormenting the birds on the ground i cant do this on my own any more im not ready and i wasnt ready when you walked out on us and i wasnt ready for this when i first started he said softly but you and i were made for this job she looked at his grin that stupid lopsided old grin of his you know sometimes i dont know whether to call you liam or foster he laughed a dry old cackle a dying mans defiant snort does liam know now about me maddy nodded i think actually in a way hes kind of proud that he gets to turn out like you but maybe hes not so happy thats going to happen sooner than he thought i think hes accepted that she shrugged come to terms with it after all if you hadnt grabbed us wed all be dead anyway its all extra time extra bonus life right aye they sat in silence for a while watching a young couple rollerblade past them he was teaching her and she was guffawing at how bad she was not a care in the world between them please foster maddy said again presently please come along with us his watery eyes watched the rollerbladers zigzagging up the path and away from them dont make me get on my knees she said all right he nodded ill come chapter september new york shes what do you reckon fourteen fifteen asked liam peering through the thick protein soup at the murky outline suspended in the growth tube its hard to tell said sal her nose was pushed against the warm perspex the clones body was tucked into a foetal position knees pulled up slender arms wrapped protectively round them the last twelve hours of archway time had taken her body shape from one that was definitely that of a small child to something that looked adolescent maybe a bit younger she said its hard to make her out through all this gross gunk liam wasnt sure about this maddys instructions birth her they couldnt leave her behind and probably wouldnt be able to bring themselves to do that if they had to she was going to become becks one way or another she was part of the team the other foetuses in stasis on the other hand were simply going to be flushed out they were all too early in the growth stage to survive for long outside the protein solution no more than fistsized bodies and none of them with viable organic rat brains yet just simcardsized slices of silicon it wasnt going to be an easy task to bag up and throw away those pitifullooking things floating in the other tubes liam looked again at what would become becks soon the bodys just that of a child shell be younger than any of us so she will what good is that shell still be stronger than me or maddy though thats got to be useful he shrugged i suppose if we decide to enter her into a schoolgirl armwrestling competition sal sighed come on we should get on with it liam nodded wrinkled his nose in anticipation of what was coming sal knelt down and tapped the small glowing display on the pumps control panel the soft purring stopped the first time theyd done this theyd had stateoftheart wg systems growth reactor tubes with a motor at the bottom that orientated the tube smoothly to a fortyfivedegree angle before opening a sluice hatch at the bottom depositing the clone and protein soup on to the floor this growth tube was a homemade affair the pump and control panel recovered from the damaged system the perspex tube purchased from a defunct distillery the other growth tubes likewise liam grabbed the top of the cylinder of bathwarm perspex give me a hand well tip it over nice and gentle if we can sal braced herself against the weight of the tube as liam pulled it teetered the liquid inside sloshing the foetal shape inside twitched and jerked finally beginning to wake up becoming aware go slowly liam grunted sal the tube was impossibly heavy i got a hold its all right its all right just keep taking the weight as i tip it he carried on pulling the tube canting over enough now that the viscous gloop was sloshing over the top and splatting on to the floor liam its too heavy i cant calm down will you well just ease it out pour it out so its a bit lighter its going to slip its just relax i still got a hold of it so i the bottom of the tube slipped on the floor under the angled weight and he lost his grip it swung down to the ground like a felled redwood sal lurching back to avoid being crushed the perspex made a loud thunk on the concrete and a tidal wave of pink soup erupted from the open top and engulfed her the clone slid out riding the miniwave and all but ending up in sals lap ah jayzus liam flapped his hands uselessly im so sorry sal the thing just sal spat gunk from her mouth and wiped it from her lips and out of her eyes thick like halfset jelly i hate you liam she hissed almost meaning it right then really hate you liam slipped in the muck as he hurried over and knelt down beside her his hand uselessly wafting around sal wanting very much to comfort her but at the same time not actually make any physical contact with the foulsmelling gunk coating i am so very very i think im going to be sick sal said desperately trying not to inhale the odour of rotting meat you all right in there it was rashims voice fine called out liam dont come in just yet its messy he looked down at the clone still curled defensively in a ball its head in sals lap eyes slowly opened grey wide curious and vaguely alarmed liam leaned over it and offered the clone a smile and a little wave hello there its mouth flexed open and closed several times dribbling the gunk being ejected from its lungs ughhh sal eased the clones head off her lap and on to the floor im soaked in this pinchudda liam wasnt listening hello you ok he cooed down at the clone now she was out of the mist of swirling salmoncoloured soup he could see the female unit clearly enough the creatures hairless head made it hard to judge her precise age her face looked both old and young at the same time he reached down lifted her by the shoulders till she was sitting up produced a towel and wrapped it round her there you go sal tutted jetblack hair plastered against her face by the cooling gelatinous protein soup oh i see she gets the towel does she rashim sat crosslegged before the rack of circuitry of the displacement machine spongebubba looking over his shoulder on one side and bob over the other incredible he whispered the design is quite quite brilliant look at that bubba see hes sidestepped the feedback oscillation completely i see it skippa he turned to bob our systems field was constantly suffering distortion variables outside interference and internally generated distortion feedback patterns your displacement device was much bigger than this one correct rashim nodded yes enormous and largescale introduces a whole new bunch of problems but even so he shook his head again marvelling at the economy of the circuitry this is so ingeniously configured a grin stretched across his thin lips roald waldstein you were fifty years ahead of anybody else we should take this whole rack he said i know a lot of these component wafers can probably be replaced duplicated with presentday electronics but i need to take some time to be sure i know how hes put it all together affirmative we will take the complete rack what about the controlling software rashim looked at the row of computer cases beneath the desk each one with an on light glowing and the flickering led of a busy hard drive i need the software shell as well its as much a part of this device as the circuits correct rashim shook his head those computers look primeval how the hell can they run waldsteins machines software networked together these computers are suitably powerful replied bob they do not use the original operating software rashim recalled the charming old names of computings early twentyfirstcentury history microsoft windows linux primitive times when code was written in a digital form of pidgin english not like the elegant streams of data from his time code written by code we wont need to take these clunky old computers with us will we negative we can extract the machines hard drives hard drives then rashim remembered data in this time used to be stored magnetically on metal disks inside sturdy carousels again so primitive so wasteful nothing like the efficiency of data suspended in water molecules right yes do you know how to do that uh bob i have a theoretical understanding of the system architecture of these dell computers also the system ai known as computerbob can provide detailed instructions on how to dismantle the architecture however only maddy has practical experience of this process right ok rashim pinched the narrow bridge of his nose wed best wait for her to come back before we start dismantling things then affirmative he got to his feet across the archway he watched the indian girl sal talking quietly with another girl pale as a ghost and completely bald who is that asked bubba cheerfully it is a support unit said bob it was set on a growth pattern before we had to deal with your exodus contamination a genetically engineered ai hybrid spongebubba added rashim the us military were working with those back in the fifties and sixties perfect soldiers we had a platoon of genbots come along with us on exodus he looked at bob leaner more advanced models than you im afraid bobs brow furrowed sulkily i know then with something approximating a smirk i did in fact manage to disable one of them yes you did rashim nodded respectfully and then offered him an awkward high five good for you big man bob cocked his head and gazed curiously at rashims palm left hovering in midair uh never mind he said tucking his hand away chapter september new york maddy returned from central park with foster just after half past one in the afternoon following brief introductions of rashim and his novelty robot they set to work during the rest of the day sal was largely sidelined with the drooling child support unit in her tender care while maddy rashim foster computerbob and spongebubba collectively pooled their technical knowledge and carefully dismantled the equipment in the archway it was an exercise in identifying and extracting only the technology components that could not easily be replaced elsewhere bob and liam meanwhile had been sent out to steal a vehicle big enough for them all and the equipment they were likely to take along by the time lights started to flicker on on the far side of the east river turning manhattan skyscraper by skyscraper into an enormous inverted chandelier and the railway overhead started rumbling with trains taking city commuters home from the big apple to the suburbs of brooklyn and queens theyd done most of what needed to be done a battered winnebago superchief motorhome was parked up in the alleyway a snug handinglove squeeze between the row of archways and the graffitid brick wall opposite the rack carrying the displacement machine had been carefully lifted in and secured tightly in the rvs toilet cubicle the pcs had been stripped of their internal hard drives and the filing cabinet beside maddys desk had been emptied its drawers were full of a messy miscellany of discarded wires and circuit boards and gadgets a taser something that looked like a geiger counter the babelbuds a nonfunctioning wristmounted computer of some sort with hdata wristbuddee stamped on one side gadgets and parts of gadgets most of them clearly not from the year nothing like that could stay behind the improvised growth tubes were too large to take along but the pumps and computer interface were removed and carefully stored in the rv the protein solution and the dead foetuses were gone now poured away into the east river like any normal family moving house it was a revelation to maddy liam and sal discovering how much clutter theyd already managed to acquire magazines and books a nintendo and a tv a kettle and sandwich toaster a chemical toilet a wardrobe full of clothes a shelf in their bunk archway filled with halfused toiletries and rubbish a small pyramid of empty drinks cans a teetering jenga tower of pizza boxes and takeaway cartons as they left the archway tired after a busy day the last of mondays fading sunset left the sky a deep blue and there existed that momentary gasp of air that fleeting pause between the last of manhattans office dwellers vacating the city and the emergence of the first eager beavers of new yorks nightlife times square was still busy but mostly with ambling tourists coming home to their th avenue hotels after a days sightseeing bob spongebubba and the freshly birthed girl clone yet to be called becks they were still debating whether to consider her a new personality entirely that was still up for discussion were left to watch over the superchief and the archway the rest of them headed across to manhattan one last time in times square they found a mexicanthemed place that looked out across the winking lights and animated billboards the news ticker around the hershey store the stopstart intersections and sluggish convoys of yellow cabs gaggles of goggleeyed tourists and the last city suit walking home with a gym bag slung over one shoulder it was quiet in the restaurant they ordered from the waitress quickly and then were left alone to the privacy of their faux dark wood and redvelvetcushioned booth to talk so maddy clasped her hands like a host desperate to get her party started here we are then aye said liam the first proper chance ive had to sit down rest and eat in ages maddy nodded it seemed an eternity ago that theyd been cornered by guards in caligulas palace since then theyd been running hiding scavenging she realized she hadnt eaten properly in days the best part of a week in fact that went some way towards explaining her ordering the triple bean and beef megaburrito youre running said foster i can understand that but have any of you thought where to no maddy tucked hair behind her ear not yet well now to be sure we want to know who sent those support units after us liam looked at sal for support she nodded clearly the most pressing question hovering between them all maddy shook her head somebody from the future obviously i dont know did you say the male units looked just like our bob asked foster yup like his evil twin or something these are military clones youre talking about said rashim she nodded military use yeah then if they looked exactly like your bob theyd be from the same or a similar birth batch the cloning process develops geneticcopy errors if you reproduce from the same dna indefinitely so the batches have relatively small print runs twenty maybe thirty units per base dna pattern rashim stroked the fine tip of his nose i recall that the military contractors producing clone units back in the s were constantly having to start over with new candidate genomes to engineer liam chuckled the others looked at him and his face quickly straightened back in the s he grinned i mean doesnt that sound odd thats the future for all of us so it is the far future for me he shrugged no one seemed particularly tickled by that just sounded a bit funny thats all when does your clone unit come from said rashim do you know his precise inception date bob maddy struggled to remember uh i think its the s if i recall correctly said foster then your enemy whoever sent those killer units must come from the same time rashim folded his arms thats an assumption of course liam shuffled uncomfortably but whos our enemy whove we gone and annoyed what maddy laughed whos our enemy you mean apart from some secretive association of templar knights a governmentbacked topsecret project called exodus that group of antitime travel activists who tried to assassinate chan kramers bunch of neonazis maddy paused need i go on well liam shrugged apart from them that is the point is cut in foster the world down the line is an increasingly grim place he looked at sal youve seen the storm clouds of the future havent you sal she nodded not good a world full of people who see the only way of escape is back through time and we foster looked around at them were whore standing in their way thats a lot of enemies to choose from he turned to rashim maddy told me your group came from actually rashim sighed the worlds dying i mean its not good at all the food chains poisoned so that were all living on soyasynth products and the floods took a lot of land migrating people billions and wars and god knows weve had a lot of them but thats what everyones worried about petrified of you see a big war there are countries and power blocs in my time that are in a desperate position desperate enough to consider the use of extreme weaponry bioweapons nanoweapons whatre those asked liam plague is perhaps the best word for it liam whether its something genetically revamped or selfreplicating nanobots either way it becomes a weapon that doesnt discriminate over borders nationalities he looked out of the window at the flickering lights of times square were in a bad place desperate times its inevitable that something like that will eventually happen well wipe ourselves out were destined to engineer our own end the end maddy leaned forward thats what becks said to me that was what she said was the reveal condition for the pandora message the grail message the end pandora she looked at rashim wondering how much they should be letting their new temporary accomplice in on all we know said foster is that the people who want you dead had access to weapons technology from apparently the very same foetus batch as bob and becks no less i dont like the sound of that maddy stared at him that feels like an enemy very close to home perhaps someone inside the agency liam started you mean a turncoat in our mr waldsteins secret timepolice force a traitor she pressed her lips together thoughtfully i just hope not we can do without that maybe when you sent that message asking about pandora said sal someone else got it intercepted it that thought was met with silence a silence that lasted several minutes and ended when the waitress arrived with an arm laden with hot plates she served them out along with the drinks theyd ordered and after looking at their glum faces put a hand on her hip this some kinda office party maddy nodded sort of sheeesh the waitress made a face half pity half amusement id hate to work at your place she wished them a perfunctory bon appetit and left them to it were none the wiser as to who wants us dead said liam so how about we decide what were doing where were going to go because im completely confused sal nodded at rashim and what about our new friend is rashim staying with us uhh rashim cleared his throat fidgeted with his cutlery well id really like to tag along you know if thats all right i wont be a nuisance maddy shot a glance at foster is this my call she wondered if now they had foster back with them he might resume the mantle of team leader relieve her of the burden of making the decisions foster smiled you decide he said softly its your team now not mine she picked at the burrito on her plate fumbling with both hands to keep the mince and assorted gunk from spilling out either end i suppose we could use rashim hes got a better understanding of the displacement technology than i have than any of us added foster to be fair true she nodded and glanced up from her food at the man he seemed fascinated by the rack of ribs on his plate inspecting it like a forensic pathologist picking over a cadaver she smiled at that of course hed probably never experienced real meat in his time and he knows fortyfour years more of the future than i do said sal excuse me rashim looked up from his ribs youre all talking about me like im not right here sitting next to you sorry rashim said maddy youre right that is kinda rude rashim nodded apology accepted he turned to sal when do you come from from mumbai really his eyebrows arched thats not long before the he stopped himself before she looked at him before what he shrugged the first asian war rashim winced apologetically im sorry i shouldnt no tell me please he deferred to maddy tell her about it later if you like rashim right now we need to focus on our next move weve got to decide what were going to do what is it you wish to do maddy asked foster hes pushing me to lead not for the first time maddy wondered if she tended to open things up for discussion too much she put down the leaking burrito licked her fingers buying time because she simply didnt know just yet a part of her had almost made the decision that the game was up that their duty as timeriders was done and perhaps they should all just put some clear miles between themselves and new york and then all go their separate ways to live whatever was left of their lives how each of them wanted but then an insistent nagging voice inside her reminded her of the horrendous timelines theyd narrowly prevented from happening and of course that voice had an even greater urgency to it now she knew it was just their one little team keeping an eye on history not some vast agency of multiple teams with multiple redundancies safeguards failsafes just them so the decision in truth was already made in her mind but she wanted to hear what the others had to say particularly liam and sal we run she said then she looked at liam with a shrug what do you mean by that asked liam im putting it to you im asking what you think liam we run then what liam frowned for a moment then put down his burger no dropped his burger suddenly indignant he exclaimed jayzus maddy are you asking me whether we give up she said nothing that was her answer no way he turned to sal right no bleedin way he looked almost angry as close to anger as shed ever seen him now listen here madelaine carter ive nearly died a dozen times so i have to keep that he flung a hand towards the window and the glistening lights of times square to keep new york just like it is im not giving up on that now maddy noted a proud smile steal across fosters lips sal im right am i not said liam we want to go on right she chewed on the straw in her glass of dr pepper and blew bubbles for a moment before she finally spoke theres things i want to know i want to know what pandora is i want to know what becks knows whats locked up inside her head i want to know what that man was trying to tell us that man maddy and liam knew who she meant the poor soul whod arrived back in new orleans only to be fused into the bodies of two horses hed held on to life for perhaps five ten minutes a gruesome jigsaw puzzle an insideout parody of a centaur a horrorshow freak for the few minutes he it lived i want to know whats really going on maddy i want to know more about this waldstein fella aye and more about this agency said liam and the only way i see it is we have to keep on doing what were doing even if we have to move somewhere else and continue doing it there maddy tapped the table gently with her knuckles her attempt at calling their meeting to order it took a few moments she wouldve been quicker just telling the pair of them to shut up but also a touch rude ok its agreed then we relocate and well set things up again she looked at them all and we will continue keeping this timeline on track while were still able to because look whatevers really going on if were being played for fools if were being manipulated by waldstein somehow or someone else inside his agency or someone outside the truth is i know what were doing is the right thing and thats the only literally the only certainty we can grab hold of the other two nodded theyd seen enough alternate timelines to know there could be far worse ways history could play out than the way it was now for better or worse right foster the old man nodded for better or worse history needs to stay on track ok ok this is what im thinking we do maddy pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose we head north to boston why whats so special about boston asked foster its my home liam looked up from his burger you want to go to your home its my home turf she said i grew up there i know the area and look maybe we can get some help my folks you cant go to your home maddy said foster why not sals eyes widened jahulla youll be there already wont you another you liam stopped chewing dawning realization on his face too youd be a little girl thered be a little maddy there nine maddy nodded yes id be nine madelaine said foster you cannot visit your family you cannot visit yourself do you understand me thats a very dangerous contamination she stared at him silently for a long while before finally reluctantly nodding all right i get it ok i wont visit home it was just an idea but listen i know the area there are places i know where we could set up if were going to ground its better we head somewhere that someone knows right somewhere we can easily tap power said rashim wed need that if you want a viable new place to operate from sure theres loads of places we could settle in theres industrial parks we could rent a unit pretend to be some small business or something liam nodded encouraged that she seemed to have already given the move some thought seems like a plan so sal smiled a new home id like that foster seemed less than happy its a danger maddy and a temptation to be so close to your childhood home i wont go home ok i promise i mean whats the alternative we stick a random pin in a map of america and just hope for the best her burrito drooled gunk on to her plate with an unappealing splat seriously guys if anyone else has got a better suggestion im all ears no one of course did then thats all ive got boston its a start what do you guys say liam and sal nodded uhh so does that answer your earlier question asked rashim whats that whether im coming along rashim looked sheepish am i in your what do you call it your team yuh i guess maddy smiled sure if you want he smiled youre joking right a choice between staying in or going back to his face cracked with a wide grin its a headslap id very much like to stay then thats the deal she offered her hand across the table we need some kind of oath or something but i guess a handshakes good for now they reached across and shook awkwardly the sort of uneasy gesture of two geeks unsure whether to highfive chestbump or knucklekiss and in the end pulling off a fumbled combination and maddy nearly knocking her drink over sal rolled her eyes so well set off tomorrow morning have a last night in the arch liam nodded a last night to say goodbye to the ol place maddy sighed its a freakin brick archway thats all no thats not fair id say it was a bit more than that yeah me too said sal it was sort of home maybe they were both right it had begun to feel a bit like that lets just look ahead guys ok weve still got a job to do and maybe now were doing the job on our terms were calling the shots that felt like a leaderish sort of thing to say like the right thing to say maddy looked sideways at foster and he gave her a subtle wink chapter september new york liam lifted the last of the bags into the back of the superchief maddy took them from him that the last of the stuff piled in the middle he looked back into the dark interior of the archway aye good because theres no room left anyway she ducked back inside looking down the middle of the vehicle an assault course of plastic bags and cardboard boxes and that was just their essentials i guess ill find somewhere to tuck these whats in these bags anyway some of me books we can replace books liam he shrugged and a few comics maddy sighed leaned over and pulled open one of the bags oh come on and the nintendo too well he looked sheepish i thought jesus we can pick another one of those up at any computer game store she shook her head just the difficult things just things we cant easily replace im afraid he sighed and swung the bag ruefully into the open rubbish bin beside the vehicle maddy poked her nose into his other bag ok i guess these books can come aboard she took the bag off him and disappeared inside the rv liam looked back under the shutter it was dark and gloomy a vacant space once more strewn with the cables and rubbish boxes of tools cartons of nuts and bolts spools of electrical wire a desk with the gutted remains of a dozen dell computers left beneath it a large wardrobe that had contained until this morning at least a bizarre collection of garments a twelfthcentury leather jerkin two wehrmacht army tunics several roman togas an edwardianera suit and ladys gown a stewards tunic and more the clothes were all squirrelled away aboard the rv now it looked like the abandoned premises of some blackmarket cashinhand pc repair shop a sweatshop a squat a student dosshouse the aladdins cave of some foraging vagrant he offered it a lukewarm farewell wave thanks for the shelter and smiled with amusement at his own mawkish sentimentality how daft it was that a pile of damp bricks and crumbling mortar could make him feel guilty for abandoning it like this the rvs motor rattled to life come on liam maddys head was poking out of the passengerside window at the front the sooner were off the better aye he raised his hand in acknowledgement and turned back to the dark interior well there mr archway youve still got a job to do he muttered under his breath after all theres this bridge above you that needs holding up for a while yet liam im coming sal sat in the back of the rv on an oatcoloured seat worn through at the corners and showing yellow foam her seat belt didnt work she decided bob could have stolen something that looked a little less oldfashioned beatenup and threadbare shed spotted glistening spotless tour vans rolling through the streets of new york ones that looked almost futuristic like spaceships on wheels instead they had this she looked out through the rear plastic window scuffed and foggy someones name and a love heart scratched into it she watched brooklyn receding like a movie backprojection busy with cars bumper to bumper at each intersection waiting to get on the two lanes across the williamsburg bridge on to the lower east side of manhattan the morning ebb and flow of commuters regular as bowel movements there was some relief mixed in with the sadness of a goodbye at least she wasnt going to see this particular morning ever again tuesday september was at last playing through for them the way it did for everyone else once one terrifying morning albeit seemingly running in slow motion relief she wasnt going to have to see that again the swooping airliner a sky filled with billowing smoke and the confetti cloud of millions of pieces of fluttering paper but yes sadness too brooklyn this place this side of the east river had become so familiar to her almost as familiar as the suburbs of mumbai that shed grown up in the chinese laundromat with that old lady so proud of her officeworker son the coffee shop from which shed collected countless cardboard trays of coffee and paper bags of assorted doughnuts the ywca whose skanky showers with hairclogged drains she and maddy had had to use more times than she cared to remember their alleyway always cluttered with rubbish the cobbles underfoot slightly tacky the walls with fading sprayed gang tags and their archway their home the rv juddered to a halt at a traffic light and just then sal knew it was due any second now she spotted a subtle flash on the distant skyline the pale sliver of a fuselage catching the morning light moving fast and descending towards the twin pillars of manhattan shimmering in the sunwarmed morning she lost sight of it among the skyscrapers but then a moment later the distant sky was punctuated by a roiling cloud of orange and grey that drifted lazily up into the empty sky no sound not yet just a silent eruption like an undubbed movie special effect then half a dozen seconds later even through the closed window over the chugging of the rvs engine she heard it a soft innocuoussounding whump like the door of an expensive saloon car being slammed shut the heads of pedestrians on the pavements either side of them turned to look towards the sky above manhattan and never turned back green light the winnebago motorhome crossed the intersection and turned left on rolling and slack suspension that made the vehicle sway like a boat on a choppy sea behind a row of apartment blocks sal finally lost sight of manhattan the twin towers and the billowing mushroom cloud of smoke and the frozen pedestrians as they headed up roebling street a place where people and cars and taxis and trucks continued to move from one traffic light to the next in blissful clockwork ignorance at least for the moment chapter september new york it was four hours later that footsteps scraped and tapped down the cobblestone alleyway nearly one oclock framed and silhouetted by muted light from outside two figures stepped into the open entrance of the archway two tall athletic figures one male one female they stared into the gloom perfectly still attempting to comprehend the situation finally the male figure took several steps forward into the dim interior and then squatted down to inspect a tangled nest of dataribbon cables and the green plastic shard of a circuit board dropped or just discarded to be crushed carelessly beneath someones foot faith said the male unit the female figure joined him her cool grey eyes surveyed the rest of the archway it would appear we have been misled abel she said correct she stepped towards the table topped with computer monitors and keyboards drinks cans and sweet wrappers she reached out for something what have you found said abel she inspected the small webcam in her hand as if the glinting lifeless plastic lens contained a soul that could be peered into and crossexamined for answers the ai installed on this network of computers had sent her and abel to a random address across the city it had assured them that that was the precise location where the human team members would emerge from chaos space their return data stamp her thoughts travelled wirelessly to abel this ai provided us with incorrect information affirmative her hand closed tightly round the webcam plastic cracked inside her taut fist she turned to look at abel the ai broke protocol it lied abel nodded the ai may have been corrupted by prolonged interaction with the organic modules it has developed feelings of loyalty to its team faith examined the gutted computers the mess in the archway objects strewn across the floor they arrived here while we were gone and left added abel we must determine where they are now headed faith nodded closed her eyes and queried her mission log restate mission parameters mission parameters locate and eliminate team members locate and destroy critical technical components see sublist selfterminate she examined the detritus on top of the desk and beneath it it appears they have taken the critical technical components the displacement technology the support unit propagation hardware agreed said abel that indicates they intend to redeploy elsewhere abel joined her then his eyes began to sweep along the clutter on the desk they may have discussed strategies within audible range of the system ai we may be able to override the ai system and access its recently cached audio files faith pointed at the computer cases unscrewed and exposing the innards of wires and circuit boards the hard drives have all been extracted there may be residual data in the systems motherboards recently stored data he looked at her this is system architecture that is fiftythree years old there will be data packets still on any solidstate circuitry we can query each circuit board with a small electrical charge faith nodded it was a place for them to start very much a case of looking for a needle in a haystack though this will take many hours abel nodded do you have an alternative plan she shook her head then we should begin immediately chapter august arlington massachusetts joseph olivera held the digital camera in front of him and panned it around the treelined avenue such a beautiful place long freshly clipped lawns leading up from a wide avenue to generous whiteboard houses suburbia it was midafternoon and peaceful and the sun was shining with a warm midaugust strength dappling the road with brushstrokes of light and shade through the gently stirring leaves of the maple trees beautiful as a child joseph had dreamed of living in a place like this he used to watch old programmes from this time family dramas they used to call soap operas with healthy tanned people always smiling happy families driving nice cars and worrying about nothing more important than high school proms or who was dating who or who was going to win a thing called the super bowl joseph walked slowly down the avenue panning his camera left and right in the viewfinder an elderly woman was kneeling among a bed of flowers with gardening gloves and pruning shears a postman walked cheerfully by with a nod and a smile for joseph some chestnutcoloured labrador was frolicking on a lawn chasing a frisbee he could hear the lazy buzz of a lawnmower somewhere suburbia beautiful suburbia joseph had only ever known cities all his life cities towering labyrinths of noise and chaos that seemed to contract on themselves getting tighter and more choked and crowded with each passing year his early school years hed lived with his family in mexico city then later on as a student in chicago hed been working in london in the s during which time large portions of that city had begun to be abandoned to the alltoofrequent flooding of the river thames finally hed ended up in new york theyd been building up those enormous flood barriers around manhattan then hoping to buy the city another couple of decades of life but always always hed dreamed of a place like this mature trees lush green lawns sundrenched porches and white picket fences the perfect place to grow up the perfect place to spend ones childhood he passed a driveway with a ford zodiac parked in it stunning paint job pimped with skulls and flames to look like it had driven batoutofhell style right out of satans own garage joseph grinned some young mans first car of course joseph looked around one of these houses would be hers he panned his camera left then right the viewfinder settled on a grandlooking home mock colonial with a covered porch that fronted it and wound round the side there was even a rockingchair on there perfect joseph crossed the avenue the houses driveway was empty presumably no one home just as well better that he didnt attract the attention of anyone inside his digital camera still filming he walked up the tarmac drive sweeping the camera gently in a smooth panning motion taking in every little detail finally reaching the bottom of three broad wooden steps he took them one at a time now standing on the wooden boards of the porch freshly whitewashed he let the camera dwell on the rockingchair for a moment the hanging baskets of purple and pink sweet carolines on several pairs of gardening boots and gloves a small ceramic garden gnome holding a chainsaw somebodys idea of a joke present for mom or dad the camera recorded all those small important personal details and finally he panned the camera on to the door of the house mint green with a brass knocker in the middle joseph smiled wistfully what a wonderful childhood home to have what wonderful childhood memories to have i envy you madelaine carter from boston he said softly to have all of this he had enough to use now and turned the camera off chapter september new york faith was picking through the scattered circuit boards on the desk they were specifically querying the motherboards first thats where the cache memory was lodged in these ridiculously bulky chips of dark silicon on tiny hairthin metal seating pins they had both been meticulously teasing small charges of electricity into the circuits stirring them to life and diverting the random nuggets of dormant information to a connected monitor what they were getting mostly was useless gibberish random packets of hexadecimal every now and then punctuated with snippets of english faiths internal clock informed her they had spent nearly twelve hours on this process twelve hours during which their targets must be putting a healthy distance between them she picked up the motherboard of a yet unchecked computer and prepared to hand it to abel to juryrig a connection to the monitor when her eyes settled on a pad of lined writing paper half buried beneath the mess on the desk she reached out and picked it up the last used sheet had been torn away roughly leaving a few tattered paper shreds attached to the glue binding at the top the tops of several letters in biro thats all but that wasnt what faith was focusing on it was the shallow indentations on the page that had been directly beneath the tornaway page she held the pad close to her face tilting it so that light from the desk lamp fell obliquely across the paper she could make out the faintest lines of indentation the hard tip of a biro pressed too heavily too quickly on the page above the scrawl of someone in a hurry perhaps someone thinking making a desperate decision writing lists pros and cons she could make out a word very faint and not entirely complete but her mind quickly produced a very brief shortlist of possible word variables only one of them had any relevance to the data shed been uploaded with for the mission she put the pad down the team leader madelaine carter is taking the team to her childhood home abel looked up from the soldering iron in his hand and a curl of blue smoke twisted in the harsh light of the desktop lamp as he put down the motherboard he was working on why do you conclude that faith handed him the pad of paper he squinted at it and just as she had his eyes picked out the faintest markings of writing boston he said faith nodded she is going home they emerged from the archway as they paced swiftly towards the intersection between wythe avenue and south th street a bluetooth conversation passed quickly between them they needed a vehicle they needed a vehicle now they needed to make up for the lost twelve hours abel stood at the entrance to the alleyway it was dark now an hour after midnight street lights bathed the brooklyn intersection opposite with sickly neon punctuated by the regular circular blue flicker of police lights an nypd squad car was parked diagonally across the intersection impeding the flow of traffic in both directions cones placed out to help make the point no traffic was being allowed on to the slip road and up the ramp on to the williamsburg bridge no traffic that is except emergency vehicles fire engines mobile cranes and diggers heading over into manhattan the occasional solitary ambulance heading slowly back out no sirens no horn no rush even now at this late hour there were still a few pedestrians out craning their necks to get a look past the towering supports of the bridge at the apocalyptic haze on the far side manhattan glowed with a million office lights as usual but tonight the light pollution was enhanced by powerful halogen floodlights towards the south end of the island that leaked an unstinting glare into the night sky like an unnaturally early dawn faith stood beside abel both of them now evaluating the situation both of them staring covetously at the nypd squad car parked across south th street two policemen stood guard ready to wave back any nonemergency traffic trying to pick through the cones to cross the bridge not that anybody was trying to get across the support units exchanged a cursory glance perfect abel led the way towards the nearest of the two policemen the policeman noticed abels strident steps approaching him sir you need to step back abel drew up a few steps short of the cop why were keeping this accessway across the river clear for emergency vehicles he waved his hands at abel please step back now sir there will be more fire trucks and heavy vehicles passing through at any time please give me the ignition key to your car the cop ignored him just step back off the road sir abel reached out and grabbed one of the cops fingers and twisted sharply with a flick of his wrist please give me the ignition key to your car hey ow hey his other hand clearly not his gun hand fumbled around his ample waist to find the leather flap of his holster i will break your finger said abel politely this is a warning please comply to avoid further discomfort the cop lifted the flap and grabbed hold of the guns grip he pulled the weapon out and levelled it at abels face let go now let go and get down on the ground abel snatched the gun out of his hand as calmly as a toad lassoing a passing mosquito with its tongue jesus the cops jaw dropped open the other cop challenged abel from across the street drop that weapon now i require the ignition key to your vehicle said abel calmly please provide this drop the weapon now or you will be fired upon the other cop barked a gun levelled at abel taking slow steps towards him his voice was shrill highpitched warbling with fear abel swung the gun in his hand quickly a microsecond to aim then three shots fired in rapid succession the first shot killed the approaching cop the other two were unnecessary faith immediately paced over towards his prone body ready to frisk his pockets and belt pouches hey pplease dont shshoot man the other cop pleaded his hand and finger still twisted in abels firm grasp do you have the vehicle ignition key its in the ccar man he grimaced in agony its in the car abel shot a bluetooth instruction to faith and she changed direction towards the squad car you will not discuss this intervention with anyone said abel whuh then the cop understood and nodded vigorously no ok sure i i wont ddiscuss this i promise your promise is not required said abel then he calmly shot the second cop dead he noted the pedestrians nearby staring at him frozen with shock it would take too much valuable time to pursue them all and kill them he decided so many eyewitnesses were an unfortunate collateral contamination but nothing that could be helped the squad car rattled to life as faith settled into the drivers seat its siren squawked for a second before it was turned off abel made his way over pulled the passenger side open and got in beside faith the car rocked under his weight boston she said he nodded please proceed chapter september interstate southwest connecticut liam had watched as the bronx became a suburban carpet of gradually more expensive homes interspersed with outoftown superstores fronted by acres of car park as the rv crawled northeast along interstate then along it was slow progress for the day bumper to bumper past sliproad after sliproad police blockades and random vehicle searches had reduced the traffic to a crawl theyd stopped once for petrol at lunchtime then finally hit some clear road beyond new rochelle its all new to me too said foster quietly all ive ever seen of this world is new york liam nodded you never been tempted to take yourself off and have a look around foster looked at him have you ive not had any time feels like weve been dealing with one problem after another since you pulled me off the titanic he realized though that the old mans question was an invitation for him to talk about what they now both knew but had yet to talk to each other about she told me said liam maddy told me youre me he shook his head or im you or however im meant to say it im how youll become liam were the same person on either end of a number of years lad thats what i cant get me head straight about mr foster its he paused or do i call you liam now just foster he answered with a smile ive been used to that name for some time now so liam looked out of the scuffed perspex window at a greyhound bus its windscreen striped with the reflected glow of street lights passing overhead do you remember all the same things as me up to a point cork st michaels school for boys foster nodded sean mcguire and that stupid party trick of his with the three apples the old man grinned he was never very good at it was he they both laughed liam felt odd memories personal memories that he hadnt shared with anyone and yet this man knew them as intimately as he did it was like talking to himself yet hearing a wizened croaky version of his own voice coming back at him you remember getting the stewards job with the white star line yes foster replied we got the job only because that other irish lad was caught drinking on duty before the ship set sail remember his name oliver wasnt it aye liam smiled stupid fella didnt realize he was breathin his fumes all over the chief steward the rv halted in traffic causing everyone inside to lurch gently as bob applied the brakes a little too keenly a plastic bag full of unlaundered underwear slid off a seat into the cluttered aisle so you remember that night as well foster closed his eyes the night the titanic went down of course i do how does anyone ever forget something like that i think what stays with me liam what has stayed with me was the calm before all the screaming when everyone was certain thered be lifeboats for all that it wouldnt come down to the type of ticket youd bought aye it came suddenly so it did the panic you remember that liam nodded it had one moment thered been order and calm across the promenade deck even the calming sound of a string quartet playing people talking excitedly about how this was going to be the news story of the day tomorrow how their eyewitness accounts from the comfort of their bobbing lifeboats of the unsinkable ship slowly gracefully surrendering to the sea would be in every newspaper around the world no panic not yet and then word had spread among them like wildfire chinese whispers not enough lifeboats for everyone not nearly enough then the panic the horrible panic a thought occurred to liam so foster were you recruited just like me the same way he could see a glint of light reflected in fosters eyes the glare of passing headlights on his drawn face yes yes of course i was down checking on the secondclass cabins and you were young like me a bit younger than you are now liam of course liam knew that felt that now no longer a young lad of sixteen but subtly older in a million barely noticeable little ways a man prematurely and was it an older version of you that recruited you foster hesitated yes but does that mean im in some kind of a loop that goes on and on that ill get old like you change my name to foster and then one day send myself back to to pick up another me is that it no not a loop exactly then what foster looked at maddy sitting up front in the passenger seat beside bob shes going to find out soon enough if we keep heading this way liam turned to follow his gaze looking at the back of her head whats that supposed to mean foster reached out to liam and rested a fatherly hand on his shoulder liam its all going to come clear for you soon enough perhaps far too soon oh come on foster will you just tell me shes going to learn foster lowered his voice just for liam to hear and so is sal theyre both going to learn the truth and its going to be hard for them much harder than it will be for you why what do you mean whats going to be hard liam youll cope because i know i coped and i carried on the agencys work i carried on doing the work waldstein needs us to do jayzus youre annoying liam hissed just tell me what are you talking about foster shook his head maybe its best for the girls if they find out this way he patted liams arm trust me i think its for the best youll learn the truth together sal sat near the front of the rv the female support unit sitting dulleyed and vacant beside her it wasnt becks yet shed decided it wasnt going to be becks properly until theyd uploaded her ai for now this thing was just a spare female support unit a blankminded one at that thats a genesilicon hybrid said spongebubba chirpily i know said sal we had two dozen of those units on project exodus the lab robots goofy plastic grin widened they were spooky its baubleround eyes gazed at her curiously whats wrong with your genesilicon hybrid unit shes got a name you know said sal suddenly feeling protective we call her becks becks if the squat squareshaped lab unit had had shoulders hed have shrugged them instead wide rolling expressionless eyes above a fixed frozen grin regarded her hello becks my names spongebubba the support units grey eyes remained unfocused unblinking unintelligent fixed and lifeless her young face a frozen frown of incomprehension hello becks my names spongebubba the lab unit chirped again shes not been installed properly said sal she doesnt know her name yet sal sighed she cant speak anyway spongebubba stroked his pickleshaped nose a gesture he must have picked up from rashim my model mitzumi hl labassist v comes with language modules and laboratory protocols preinstalled well arent you lucky i didnt have to have software installed in me after manufacture i was functionready spongebubba sounded like a spoilt brat well at least becks doesnt look really stupid my model comes with a polyform plastic casing and a library of programmable templates dr anwar hacked the template code to make me look this special way spongebubba stroked his nose again he says im different to any other mitzumi unit because he hacked my template code skippa says im unique sal glanced at rashim he was stretched out on the seat opposite fast asleep and your voice code too is that his work or do all you models talk like this sal wondered how rashim managed to cope with spongebubbas squeaky highpitched voice and permanent false cheeriness fun for a while perhaps but already she was finding the thing incredibly irritating oh no my voice was approximated from a few audio files made from a childrens cartoon show that used to be on cable tv at the beginning of the twentyfirst century my voice is very special can you use that special voice of yours quietly oh yes my volume output can be modulated well how about you turn it down for me uhuh spongebubba wagged a finger at her only skippa can adjust my user settings sal wondered how rashim could sleep so readily she toyed with the idea of waking him up and asking him to turn spongebubba off or mute him somehow the robot was still staring at her that stupid bucktoothed smile shaddyah are you always so so perky and annoying perky happy spongebubba shook his whole body his version of a headshake no i have no capacity to emulate human emotions my model doesnt require that there is a similar model designed as a domestic support unit for civilian use that unit is installed with gesture and mood recognition and replication code but dr anwar says thats a pointless waste of install space since if you know a robots a robot why pretend it can have feelings so youre not really happy then youre just designed to look that way spongebubba stared at her an unwavering goofy smile dr anwar designed me sal couldnt work out if the robot was blaming his owner or just stating a fact becks pointed at something shed seen through the windscreen urggh ge fug duf she gurgled excitedly and pointed sal nodded pulled her hand gently down and settled her yes cars thats right nice shiny cars why me she shook her head why do i get to babysit these two morons were going to have to stop for gas again pretty soon said maddy the gauge was showing just under the quarter bar maybe we should pull over for the night find a motel were far enough away to be safe now arent we bob nodded we are probably far enough to be safe even now so late ahead of them was a sea of traffic red brake lights winking on and off as vehicles inched forward what do you think theyll do do you think theyll keep coming after us i have no information on their mission parameters but if say you were sent to kill us what would you be doing i would persist until the mission parameters were satisfied of course how would you go about that bob for example what would you be doing right now bob scowled thinking i would attempt to intercept police radio communications for references to stolen vehicles in the vicinity of the archway i would be searching the archway for items of useful intelligence he looked sideways at her we left in a hurry we cannot be certain we have not left behind some information that could lead them to us he was right they had left in a hurry a careless scramble to grab all their essentials god knows what theyd left behind what fragments of information lay scattered around in their wake maddys head began to throb with renewed stress she sat in silence for a while her fingers caressing her temples she looked down into the stationary cars on either side of them the glow of radio tuners on dashboards she imagined every single driver in every vehicle on this road was tuned into a news station and listening to reporters recap the days terrifying events latenight talk radio stations venting unbridled rage at this cowardly attack on innocent american civilians experts hurried into studios to try and make sense of things because thats what everyone needed to have right now wasnt it another explanation why why are we being attacked what did we do to deserve this of course maddy had been pulled from a time when a lot of thinking had been done on why had happened the fact that there had been warning signs the fact that there had been people in the fbi the cia screaming warnings to president bush back in that something like this was going to happen imminently maddy came from a time when there was perspective hindsight on this day from a time when everyone understood that a terrorist attack on america was inevitable but for the people in these cars all around them this whole nightmare was still and would be for years yet a bewildering and terrifying mystery she drew her mind back to more pressing issues for her no matter how far we drive bob theres no knowing for sure that were going to be safe is there no she glanced at the gauge again and how far have we gone we are only eighty miles from new york as a directline distance eighty miles might as well be a thousand and one i suppose lets take the next turnoff then weve got to fill up sometime soon anyway bob nodded affirmative next turning and how much further to boston its not that far is it approximately a hundred and twenty miles as a directline distance from our current location we can do the rest of the drive after a rest break she pointed at a road sign looming towards them on the right lets take that next turnoff the one for branford see if we can find a gas station and someplace to get some food a diner or something maddy suddenly realized how boneweary she felt physically mentally spiritually she was completely spent a bed would be good a bed with clean crisp white sheets god better still a hot shower a bath even actually the hell with that lets see if we can stop and find a motel too we can do the rest of the drive tomorrow tomorrow he nodded approval perhaps even bob realized she needed a night off affirmative chapter september washington dc the duty corridor off the mezzanine floor was windowless the catacombs thats what hed heard one of the personnel who worked down here call it once several offices along an unused floor beneath an anonymous government building in washington these offices had another name a semiofficial name the few personnel who worked down in this artificially illuminated netherworld called it the department more than half a century ago fiftysix years to be precise was when the department was set up not here though the department didnt have proper offices to call its own until after the new mexico incident but this had been its one and only home since then on several occasions in those fiftysix years these offices had experienced short bursts of frenetic activity carefully vetted fbi agents had been drafted in to do routine beltnbraces work but never fully briefed on the various case files they were doing the heavy lifting on on a needtoknow basis thats how the department did its business thered been a buzz of activity here back in and again in after the dallas incident there were a lot of paper files generated over that all of them still down here in the catacombs everything one would ever want to know about the death of a president was stored in dogeared cardboard folders in dusty filing cabinets labelled j and if one took the time to dig through thousands of yellowing pages of gathered intelligence and witness depositions one might in fact find the correct name of the man who actually killed president kennedy not oswald certainly not one l h oswald there were other labelled files down here of other incidents over the decades that had been passed over to the department to if not investigate then at least to safely archive fragments of intelligence gathered that would live forever down here in this airconditioned twilight far too sensitive too incendiary too dangerous to ever appear in the public eye there was file n a certain dark secret from the very last days of the second world war a whole drawer of one of the filing cabinets was devoted to that then of course there was file r the event that occurred in roswell new mexico several filing cabinets for that one and typically plenty of silly tv shows films and tinfoilhat conspiracy theories about r and then there were several other smaller files one of those files had the equally uninspiring name of t possibly the slimmest file in the pack of secrets slumbering down here in the semidarkness the department was run off the books its funding came from a lump sum dropped into a bank account just after the second world war over the last half a century that lump sum had been managed by a financial management company and invested in various things back in the seventies for example some of that money had been spent purchasing shares in a promising little tech company with a rainbowcoloured apple for a logo the department had a staff that had on a few occasions numbered as high as thirtyfive men but tended in quiet times to number as few as three as it did right now the head his assistant and a solitary clerical officer niles cooper was the head right now and possibly for the foreseeable future handed that role by his predecessor a middleaged penpusher called pullman whod been looking for an easy assignment to carry him over until retirement before him thered been an old man called wallace whod run the department so it was said since it was set up back in every head had his pet file so pullman told cooper the day he retired and passed the keys to this place over to his younger successor pullman said his pet file had been r the roswell one coopers was the slimmest one t something of an enigma that one several blackandwhite photographs very poor quality if truth be told theyd been recovered supposedly by a russian intelligence officer from one of the artillerydamaged barrack buildings near obersalzsberg near the mountaintop retreat of adolf hitler the eagles nest but there was no guarantee of the accuracy of that it might have come from somewhere else just as likely one of the many bombedout ministry buildings along the wilhelmstrasse in berlin the images did have the inkstamp of a swastika and a correctly configured intelligence reference number used by the gestapo so they were at least halflikely to be genuine three photographs in total the first in the sequence showed what appeared to be the aftermath of a bonfire of bodies in some snowy wood a jumble of blackened limbs amid icemelt and slush surrounded by fir trees with snowladen branches the second photograph was unpleasant a closeup of a human skull scorched completely black and what appeared to be a section of skull cracked or carved open and lying in the snow nearby the rest of the skull looked empty scooped out even but it was the third image that made this sequence so interesting that had granted this slim file a place in the departments twilight bowels the third image was of an assault rifle like everything else scorched black and the gun barrel bent by the heat of the fire there were notes stapled to the photograph notes made on some typewriter and in german then added to some years later in english handwritten blue ink notes made by some american or british firearms expert make and model is unknown not russian certainly not one of ours could be a german prototype the firing mechanism indecipherable cant see how this gun would actually work signed g h davison th february someone had drawn a blueink circle on a copy of the photograph the circle looped round some markings beneath the weapons breech a cluster of faint indented numbers and letters the manufacturers markings batch number model number and possibly the weapons date of manufacture cooper had studied this photograph many times over the years each time hed studied it under a magnifying glass with the help of his angled desk lamp like a manic philatelist examining a perfect and precious unmarked penny black stamp and every time hed peered closely at this blackandwhite photograph hed experienced the same shiver of excitement of promise a possibility a possibility and thats all it was a possibility that those last four numbers of the manufacturers mark were the year of manufacture chapter september outside branford connecticut the motel was pretty basic just what maddy expected for thirtynine dollars a night a double bed a table a wobbly hanger rack and a small tv manacled to a wall bracket they got three rooms one for maddy sal and becks one for liam and bob and one for foster and rashim basic but at least each room had an ensuite bathroom with a bathtub too small to drown a cat in and presided over by a shower unit that sprayed a lethargic afterthought of tepid water spongebubba had the rv with an aisle full of plastic bags all to himself they all freshened up each of them relishing their turn in the showers before heading to the diner next door for dinner they chose unhealthy heartattack meals from a menu with helpful if somewhat misleading pictures after that they reconvened in foster and rashims room the tv was turned up enough that anyone in a neighbouring room wasnt going to easily pick words out of their conversation through the paperthin walls fox news was on and there was understandably only one story today president george bush had held a press conference and given the administrations official response to the days acts of terrorism and now his words were being dissected by news hosts in meticulous detail foster was slumped in the rooms only chair the others were perched on the double bed becks sat crosslegged on the carpet like a nurseryschool child waiting for storytime and bob stood in the corner of the room keeping a wary eye through the window blinds on the rv parked outside you want to know what the futures like said rashim maddy nodded yeah liams right we really should get to know how this century all plays out all weve got are scraps of info bits here bits there even foster only knows some of it the old man nodded only what was available on the archways computer database and that only takes us up to the year rashim looked at foster the year your secret agency originates from i suppose that must be it foster answered with a shrug its the year from which waldstein set it all up and took it back to i was just a small boy then rashim laughed go on please tell us what you can said liam rashim leaned back on the bed hands behind his head looking up at the low cracked plaster ceiling above its not a happy story boys and girls we screwed things up mankind did we made a mess of everything funny its all history to me but the future to you he sighed the world hit seven billion people on the thirtyfirst of october in my time historians use that date a lot like some sort of a marker the point at which it all began to go bad go on well whether it was the population explosion or peak oil to blame is retrospectively seen as the point at which the world crossed the line and was doomed peak oil whats that asked liam peak oil is the term for the point at which we were never going to have enough oilbased energy to tide us over until we could rely on a new source of energy oh there were things being trialled on a small scale renewables wind tide energy zeropoint energy but nothing that was near enough to replacing oil the rest of the century was one war after another being fought for the remaining oil fields while the world continued to warm up as we ferociously burned our dwindling supply of fossil fuels and the oceans continued to rise i have a question for you rashim lifted his head and looked at them all any of you heard of the fermi paradox maddy did or thought she did isnt that the puzzle to do with why we havent yet found any alien civilizations out there in the universe he nodded a mathematician called fermi calculated the odds of there being other alien life forms out there in the big wide galaxy he took into account all the usual variables the number of stars at the right point in their life cycles the average number of likely planets per star the probability of any of those planets existing within the goldilocks zone around the star the likelihood of a planet having liquid water all those important variables anyway while the odds were stacked against any one solar system containing intelligent life given that there are literally trillions of stars his maths delivered an answer that there must be hundreds of thousands of alien civilizations out there and tens of thousands of civilizations advanced enough in technology to be putting out radio waves intentionally or not so the point is continued rashim when we started looking into space for radio signals we should have stumbled across them almost immediately according to fermis maths we should have been swimming in alien radio signals but instead we never found anything said maddy right and thats the fermi paradox why isnt every frequency full of alien signals he sighed because were alone and why are we alone he smiled he wasnt expecting them to answer well in my time we figured that out for ourselves within a century of discovering radio waves mankind managed to exhaust the raw materials of the planet the raw materials the free energy source that every emerging technological civilization gets as a gift from its historical past fossil fuels its that package of free energy that we should have used carefully while we took our time to discover and harness quantum energy humankind never got a chance to take anything more than a few baby steps into space we never got the time to mature to reach out into space for other worlds hydrocarbons fossil fuels oil we used it all up far too quickly too many people wanting too many things we used it up he said sighing and then as it began to run out we turned on each other the oil wars said liam he had heard another traveller from rashims time mention them a man called locke yes wars between india and china japan and korea the first of those was in the s russia and the european bloc there was a short war between those and of course what we should have been doing is trying to fix another bigger problem the world itself dying warming up rising tides poisoned blooms of algae killing the seas rashim fell silent for a moment anyway thats the answer to the fermi paradox most if not all civilizations either destroy themselves or mine themselves dry long before they ever spread out to other planets and are able to mine harvest them for resources once youve exhausted your home planet its all over for you either you become extinct or you eventually end up being cavemen once more its a oneshot deal said maddy he nodded and perhaps every civilization makes the same mistake spends what it has thinking it will never run out then all of a sudden it does wonderful sighed maddy but on earth we didnt just run out we decided to destroy ourselves in style rashim snorted it was some kind of a genetically engineered virus pretty much wiped us all out in the space of a few weeks we made a nice tidy job of pretty much erasing ourselves from history shaddyah whispered sal after a while this is depressing youre great fun to hang out with you know that dont you he shrugged you did ask what the futures going to be like i didnt she replied it was liam who asked aye and now i wish i bleedin well hadnt chapter september washington dc cooper was up and at work despite the time the department was as much his home as the singlebed studio apartment he kept in queens chapel dc thirtynine with no family no partner no children not even a pet one might say this twilight office with empty desks a watercooler that hadnt been switched on in years and a fading poster of jane fonda was his life custodian of secrets so secret even presidents arent privy to them thats me perhaps not the worlds most exciting job but an important one nonetheless last night hed stayed here slept in the cot he kept in his personal office his pc was on and he was streaming msnbc watching it as his coffee and breakfast bagel cooled enough to have without burning the roof of his mouth it was quite early in the morning outside in the world the sky was still dark on the monitor he watched a news camera pan across rescue workers picking through the smouldering rubble of the world trade center brilliantly stark floodlights illuminated the enormous mound of rubble and twisted spars of metal dots of neonorange lightreflective jackets decorated the mounds of dust and concrete dozens of emergency workers picked through the remains of the towers in the vain hope of finding survivors the phone rang cooper looked at it the phones down here never rang well rarely anyway he picked it up cooper coop its damon damon grohl a friend from the fbi academy many years ago friends still christmas cards were exchanged every year and every now and then they shared a beer if that counted damon coopers mood lifted well been a while how are you ol buddy fine fine the bureau down this way is chasing around like a headless chicken with what went down yesterday headless chicken damon was probably right about that fbi heads were going to start rolling pretty soon over this letting something like this slip through their fingers i can imagine not much fun look coop somethings come up that uh might be well your thing if you get my meaning coopers curiosity was piqued my thing weve got a double cop killing over in brooklyn happened after midnight this morning hows that anything to do with me the department a thought occurred to him is this linked to yesterday twin towers who knows might be were looking at pretty much anything that moves right now you said this cop killing might be my sort of thing a little careless of him to be honest talking so candidly like this over the phone your phone line is encrypted right yes but keep what you say foggy if you know what i mean foggy sure so coop are you still doing that whole x files thing down in washington you know i cant comment on that he heard damon draw a breath damon what the hell is it i think ive got something you might want to take a look at if you can get up here quickly chapter am september outside branford connecticut maddy was knocking on the adjoining motel room wall for him to get up liam yawned and cracked open eyes to look at the digital clock on his bedside ledge just gone seven he thumped the wall back all right jayzus im getting up so i am he shouted he heard sals muffled laughter on the other side bob was already awake not that he ever slept maddy has instructed me to tell you we are getting ready to move on theyd all decided they needed a good nights rest before resuming their journey up to boston theyd all been strung out far more exhausted than theyd realized a week in ancient rome struggling to stay alive and now this fatigue had finally caught up with them all maddy says we will eat some breakfast then set off liams stomach still groaned last nights tripledecker meat platter pizza was still lying heavily in his gut he wondered if he could manage anything else right now they met outside in the car park beside the rv rashim was looking particularly ill jesus whats up with you asked maddy ive been up all night vomiting his face looked almost grey the food wasnt that bad he shook his head his dark ponytail wagging limply no its my fault i was stupid the food was too rich im used to synthetic proteins soya products he gulped air and stifled a belch that could easily have been an empty retch not used to the real thing rashim had had a mixed grill wolfed it down as he relished the texture and savoured the billionaireluxury of eating nuggets of real meat foster obviously hadnt slept well either dark bags evident under his sunken eyes maddy looked at the men in their party with a mixture of pity and contempt the diner was open and several trucks were parked up in the gravel car park their drivers inside already tucking into pancake and waffle breakfasts further along their side of the highway was an outoftown mall called north haven plaza across acres of car park it looked open already at least the eateries probably were ok then lets try and find something a little healthier over there if you guys are feeling a bit precious let me quickly check in on spongebubba maddy unlocked the side door to the rv for him and rashim stepped up inside morning skippa chirped the robot squatting in the passenger seat upfront it was playing with the steering wheel were having some food over there rashim pointed through the windscreen at the mall we wont be long maddy joined him inside does your robot have a wireless broadcast protocol sure if anyone comes looking at our vehicle cops for example can he bleep a warning over to bob yes of course she looked down at the lab unit reckon you can do that for me then spongebob spongebubba corrected the robot his lips quivered a jocular angry snarl thats my name missymiss maddy rolled her eyes at the lab units preprogrammed plastic expression just tell your toy to keep a lookout she said to rashim ok the mall wasnt busy a few people inside walking freshly polished floors mostly people who worked there clearly no one felt like shopping today a jazzy rendition of a stevie wonder hit wafted across the bright and cheerful circular centrepiece atrium and a pair of overweight security guards shared a joke with a janitor and made one or two heads turn with their echoing laughter up there said maddy pointing to a balcony overlooking the atrium realbean coffee the place looks open we can get a panini or she checked herself stupid sure although the mall looked no different to any other in her time it was still no one did paninis back then back now or maybe well get a toasted sandwich or something chapter am september interstate southwest connecticut information you are driving too fast said faith abel turned to look at her the driving is suitable he replied you are driving at a faster velocity than specified on the roadside indicators abel narrowed his eyes at her then turned to look back at the road ahead flanked by signs indicating advertising proclaiming all kinds of things finally a speed indicator wooshed past on his side the number fiftyfive indicates a recommended velocity no i believe it means maximum velocity you are in excess of that that will attract unwanted attention abel lifted his foot off the accelerator causing the truck behind to brake hard and then a moment later the driver leaned on his horn angrily abel looked over his shoulder why did the vehicle behind make that noise faith followed his gaze i believe he is annoyed annoyed abel repeated why she frowned for a moment i do not know why the truck driver overtook them glaring down from his cab as he passed by the nypd squad car theyd stolen in the early hours of the morning had been replaced with a different car after listening to police chatter over the radio theyd quickly realized the vehicles identification number on the roof was going to make them too easy to track down before the light of dawn had fully arrived theyd switched to a solitary car parked in an empty forecourt it was small and bubbleshaped and an uncomfortable squeeze for abels broad frame as he wriggled into place behind the steering wheel but at least it wasnt going to draw the attention of any police helicopters scanning the highways for their stolen vehicle of course it wasnt until dawn that they saw their new ride a volkswagen beetle was a rather conspicuous tangerine orange decorated with handpainted pink daisies they drove in silence for a while as they had in fact done all the way from brooklyn as he drove abels mind carefully sorted through the data hed acquired in the last thirtytwo hours and twenty minutes of life not a particularly long life but certainly a very busy one so far the first nine hours of his consciousness just as with faith and the others of his batch had been spent in a sterile cloning room illuminated with a soft amber glow coming from the half a dozen growth tubes each of them had contained a candidate foetus held in stasis but now recently birthed six of them naked and coated in the gelatinous protein solution drying out on their bare skin they had sat huddled together on the cool tiled floor with empty childlike minds frightened confused and then without any warning wireless wisdom had begun to flood into their minds torrential packets of data and executable applets of ai software that shooed away the childlike fear and replaced it with impassive machinemind calm like awaking emerging from a coma abel recalled his mind filling with compressed knowledge that unpacked itself into segments of his hard drive knowledge of the world of knowledge of a place called new york of a place called brooklyn knowledge of cars trains planes people skyscrapers billboards intersections doughnuts handguns traffic lights cops radios computers mobile phones the spice girls shrek george bush and then finally into that dimly lit womblike ambercoloured room a human had stepped abels installed software was already prepped to acknowledge the man as an authorized user his instructions to be obeyed without question the man pulled up a chair and sat down in front of them your primary mission goal is to locate and terminate these humans he held a data pad in his hand and tapped its screen in their six minds simultaneously they received a packet of images in rapid slideshow succession front images profile images of a young man with an untidy shock of dark hair and thick arched eyebrows a young teenaged woman with frizzy strawberryblonde hair and glasses a darkskinned girl with jetblack hair that drooped like a velvet curtain over one eye you should also terminate any other humans or support units that appear to be collaborating with them your secondary goal is to destroy all the equipment you find at the location youll shortly be arriving at this is their base of operations leave nothing intact that is important there are items of equipment there that can be used to displace time that is an unacceptable contamination risk all of it must be destroyed when these things are done you are to activate your own selfdestruct devices this is your tertiary goal your mission is complete only when these people are dead their field office has been completely destroyed and your own onboard computers have been irreparably disabled are these mission parameters perfectly clear all six of them had chorused a deadpan affirmative abel looked out at the bright sunny morning now a blue cloudless sky above them the road was clogged with morning traffic a world of humans tirelessly going about their everyday business getting up and going to jobs as if today was just another day like program loops executing regardless of the previous days extraordinary events life going on the same as before they are behaving as if nothing unusual occurred yesterday said faith as if reading his mind why do you think that is a posttrauma behaviour pattern he replied access your database file human stress responses she blinked momentarily digesting a short data entry on how the human mind filled itself with unnecessary repetitive tasks to block out painful thought processes denial she looked at him keeping busy so they do not have to confront what they witnessed yesterday correct experience recollection is useful data denying it makes no sense agreed little of what theyd experienced of human behaviour over the last twentythree hours had made any sense there was a frustrating randomness to human behaviour that made predicting what they were going to do next almost impossible like trying to accurately predict the course of a waterdrop down a rainspattered windowpane there was no knowing for certain that the target named madelaine carter was taking her team back to her hometown there was a strong likelihood a reasonable probability but no certainty all they had to support that assumption was the indentation of that word on the jotter pad boston all they had was a very human thing a hunch faith suddenly twisted in her seat to face him i have a signal his eyes locked on her and he nodded i also just detected it for a second less than that theyd both picked up an ident signal just as theyd driven past a turnoff leading to some large square buildings fronted by an enormous car park an ai ident she said her grey eyes locked on his software version date he finished nothing in this time nothing other than their primary target could possibly be broadcasting a signal with a future date stamp it must be them agreed take the next turning chapter september new york cooper had arrived in new york not long after sunrise and was taken by an nypd squad car over from the precinct hq the plainclothes police sergeant drew up and stopped in front of a fluttering streamer of crimescene tape as far as i can go im afraid he said feds have it all staked out even though it was a couple of our guys that got shot he added without attempting to hide his disgust cooper thanked him stepped out and flashed his id at a uniformed officer guarding the tape line a chalk circle on the tarmac marked several bullet cases and another marked a dark dried puddle of blood is there an agent damon grohl onsite he asked the cop your fbi buddies are down there somewhere he replied pointing to the opening of an alleyway beside the base of the towering support for the bridge hed just been driven over from manhattan so whats down there damned if i know nothing us dumb ol beat cops are being allowed to see cooper crossed the intersection flashed his id at another uniformed cop standing at the mouth of the alleyway yo cooper coop down here a voice barked out from further down the alley it was grohl cooper could make out his chunky silhouette standing twothirds of the way down light from crimescene floodlights was spilling out from some archway across cobblestones and piled rubbish damon he began to hesitantly pick his way into the mouth of the alley sidestepping a discarded spicy chicken wrap you going to tell me what this is all about yet i just spent the last four hours driving up here and i really dont know what grohl waved at him to come on down im not going to shout about it come over here cooper made his way along the alley at the far end of it he could see a handrail and quayside a view of the east river and the underbelly of the bridge overhead receding until it merged with manhattan beyond warm morning sunlight picked out the tops of the skyscrapers along wall street in the sky several news choppers buzzed around where yesterday the twin towers had stood he joined grohl and shook his hand sheesh long journey all the way up from washington this morning every plane in americas been grounded i had to damn well drive he looked at his old academy buddy now i was trying to figure out what the hell it is you think youve got that made you decide to give me a call grohl smiled come on coop everyone in the agency knows youre the custodian of all that weird x files stuff he slapped cooper affectionately on the arm and grinned a knowing boyhaveigotsomethingforyou expression you wont be disappointed they were standing beside a brick archway a metal shutter door was wound threequarters of the way up but still low enough that they both had to duck down to look under whats in here last night early hours of the morning actually there was that double cop killing you probably saw the evidence markers out there on the intersection cooper nodded eyewitness saw the whole thing said they emerged from this alleyway two of them one male one female midtwenties white tall athletic and get this he grinned both as bald as buddhas walked right up assaulted the first cop took his gun off him and shot him and his partner dead execution style two to the chest one to the head then calm as you please they both got into the squad car and drove it away sheeesh linked to the trade center terrorists thats what we thought thats why we got handed this one so quickly follow me he ducked down led the way inside precinct cops were first on the scene they searched the alleyway and found this archway left wide open cooper ducked under after him and stood up inside and this is where it all gets very weird cooper looked around the place looked as if it had been burgled or rifled through a mess of things pulled out and strewn across the floor he noted the bunk beds the table armchairs kettle pizza boxes burger wrappers and drinks cans what this some sort of drugs den a gang crib grohl shrugged no not narcotics not even a trace but we did find this he pointed down to spatters and smears of dried blood on the floor each mark highlighted with a chalk circle and an evidence number something went down in here a fight crimescene pathologist reckons theres enough blood on the floor to suggest another possible homicide two dead cops out there and another possible killing in here but no body anyway we got handed this ball because it might might have something to do with the terror attack grohl beckoned cooper to follow him across the floor towards a desk cluttered with wires and circuit boards he picked up something sitting in a plastic evidence bag and this little beauty is why i thought id give you a call old friend he passed it to cooper dont worry its already been dusted for prints you can get it out and take a look at it cooper reached into the bag and pulled out a smooth fistsized piece of glossy black plastic and chrome what is this thing some sort of digital organizer turn it over he did and noted the logo on the back in the centre an apple this is some sort of prototype apple product grohl took it back off him pressed a button at the bottom and the screen glowed brightly he slid his finger across the screen jesus thats touchthescreen technology very fancy huh cooper nodded it wasnt fancy it was stunning but he still wasnt sure what he was doing all the way up here this morning there was enough work the fbi needed to be doing chasing down whatever leads they might have on the horrific events of yesterday jesus coop even the military doesnt have anything near as slick as this little beauty grohls thumb found an icon on the screen and tapped it check it out this is where it gets real interesting though he turned the device round and showed him the screen cooper squinted at a page of text what am i looking at system software information look at the software version date coopers stomach did a queasy turnover in his belly it was showing the year as and the devices calendar is set to you ever see anything like this gadget it looks like something right out of star trek cooper shook his head no hed seen nothing as advanced as this not even mockedup prototypes at a gadget show damon it looks to me a bit like a superadvanced version of those new apple ipod things the kids are all asking for thanksgiving oh and this thing is also designed to make phone calls its a phone as well oh yeah only it doesnt connect to anything because its using a telecoms protocol that doesnt actually exist his eyes met coopers and cooper understood what word his friend was leaving unsaid and dangling in the space between them yet chapter am september outside branford connecticut abel swung the volkswagen beetle into the car park and climbed out of the vehicle the engine still ticking as he crossed the tarmac towards the source of the signal a large white vehicle with wide perspex windows at the front and back it looked like some kind of habitation module on wheels faith strode beside him she withdrew the handgun from the waistband of the jogging bottoms she was wearing stolen from some hapless runner what seemed like a lifetime ago they are here she said abel nodded and reached for the handle of the vehicles rear door it failed to turn he grabbed it tighter and twisted it hard something snapped softly and clattered on to the floor inside he pulled open the door and stepped up inside the vehicle the rv lurched gently under his weight inside his eyes picked out a mess of bin liners and plastic bags piled down the vehicles central aisle towards the driver and passengers seats up at the front and a small yellow cubed android was sitting on one of the seats big pingpongball eyes batted lashes as its pickleshaped nose quivered youre not supposed to come in here it said with a cautionary tattletale voice abels mind detected a squirt of data a broadcasted alert the yellow robot was beaming an alarm signal a fainter signal approximately a quarter of a mile away registered an acknowledgement he dropped back on to the ground outside and turned to faith shed picked that up too the acknowledgement came from over there she said pointing towards a large squat white building sporting signs of bigbrand retailers between them a sea of tarmac beginning to fill with cars parking up earlybird shoppers they are inside that building said abel my god rashim shook his head with disbelief he looked around the minimart and then reached into a freezer unit and picked up a shrinkwrapped packofthree ma jacksons shaked n baked tennessee chicken drummers this is real real food sal nodded those real chicken legs uhhuh from what was once a real live chicken of course his eyes widened when hed come from only the wealthiest could afford vatgrown meat and even then it wasnt really proper meat meat on the bone was muscle cells grown on plastic rods shaped like bones it tasted vaguely savoury with a gelatinous texture a meatgel lollipop at best everyone else lived on synthisoya alternatives theres so much he shook his head again theres just so much of this real food yeah well sal took the drumsticks off him and dropped them in the shopping trolley best make the most of it right maddys call since this food supermarket inside the mall was already open she decided that since theyd stopped they might as well stock up on some essentials the rv had a fridge that worked they might as well put something edible in it and the little kitchen cabinets located above it maddy said she wasnt sure whether they were staying in boston or moving on but it probably wouldnt hurt for them to have a few luxuries aboard the timeriders tour bus this way becks sal led the trolley becks pushed it dutifully affirmative her language pack was installed now just the default library her voice was monotone completely without any expression sal turned to look at her she was wearing a beanie hat to cover her stillsmooth head and baggy jeans and a jumper hung loosely on her slight frame her pale face had a slack vacant look to it at least that part of her looked convincingly teenager and at least she wasnt drooling now my god rashims voice echoed from the next aisle along a moment later he appeared at the end of the freezer aisle gazing wideeyed at something sitting on the palm of his hand she waved him over whats up rashim he hurried over and held his hand out are these strawberries real too great hes found the fruit counter liam put some more boxes of coco pops in the trolley bob looked down at them you already have five boxes of coco pops aye well tis better to be safe than sorry he nudged bobs arm anyway you like them too they are acceptable to my digestive system oh come on admit it you actually like them ive seen the way you gobble em down they are low in protein i require large amounts of coco pops to sustain me liam offered him a sly grin ive seen you slurp that chocolate milk like a cat lapping cream the milk is the more beneficial food component of the two liam shrugged distractedly ah well he surveyed the other cereal boxes stacked along the aisle hey look bob you can even have coco pops with funny pink teddy bear shapes in it he picked the cereal box up and held it closer to get a better look at the far too colourful package design what do you reckon those little teddy bear fellas are made of bob scowled disapprovingly probably nothing particularly nutritious maybe not but it looks fun liam dropped the cereal box in the trolley he smiled up at bob you remember what fun is dont you i can supply a definition of the word and several thousand cultural references to the word including never mind chapter am september north haven plaza outside branford maddy brought the tray over to the booth and sat down opposite foster he wasnt looking so good this morning perhaps a couple of sleepless nights hadnt helped perhaps it was the artificial lighting in this coffee shop hed looked healthier in central park sun on his face and a fresh breeze ruffling the tufts of snowwhite hair on his head healthier and happier back there coffee milky and sweet just how you and liam like it thank you maddy she sat down grabbed her latte and looked out across the mall there was a toddlers play area and a fake palm tree beyond that the minisupermarket where the others were food shopping she thought she caught a glimpse of the bristly top of bobs coconut head above an aisle an hours stop over here thats what shed told them an hour grab something to eat then she wanted them all in the rv and back on the road the further away they were from new york the better foster sipped his coffee testing the heat with his lips i think it would be safer if you were to head somewhere else somewhere other than boston where though anywhere why he took his time answering i just think it would be safer they cant know where were going we lost them right we got clean away what if they know your family lives in boston but those support units they dont know me they dont know anything about me how the hell are they going to guess my folks live in boston they know something about you maddy they found you after all didnt they they found our field office maybe weve been i dunno leaking traceable tachyons maybe we just got careless and left a breadcrumb trail all the coming and going backwards and forwards in time thats going to leave some kind of a mark right some kind of a trackable signature maybe he shrugged i dont know in fact you probably know as much if not more about this technology than i do now you think she looked up from her styrofoam cup at his craggy face seeing the ghost of liam in there among the folds and wrinkles maybe so she said after all not so very long ago you were just a young lad from ireland werent you he looked like he was going to say something then laughed thats about right foster theres something ive always wanted to know what how we got picked selected me liam and sal you too i guess i mean who knew so much about us who knew i was on that plane who knew liam and you were on that particular deck on the titanic who knew exactly where sal was in that burning building i dont know and how come they knew we had the necessary skills she rubbed her temple not that thats helped so much ive messed up more than i want to think about the three of you were perfect he replied perfect recruits he added youve done so very well he patted her arm gently the lightest touch dont be too hard on yourself from what ive heard you tell me youve been busy saving history over and over well more like fighting fires but were here still the worlds the same as it ever was for what good that does it oh its important maddy history cant be changed yeah yeah has to go one particular way i know she lifted a plate of sausage patty bagels off the tray one for him one for her and more for the others when they finally came over to join them that is if the bagels lasted that long she was famished did you have many missions foster you know back when you were liam i guess a few enough his smile looked sad enough that i ended up like this old before my time long before your time she could cry for him cry for this wizened old man sitting opposite her foster you remember telling me about how travelling through time can age you yes she almost stopped herself were you serious are you really only twentyseven i think so he sighed twentyseven perhaps twentysix its easy to lose count of the field cycles she could only imagine how liam must feel looking at him now that he knew this fate was awaiting him that all too soon his body was going to be irreversibly corrupted by time travel what were the others like the team you were with before us young like you and having to grow up fast he looked away his voice had faltered he sipped his coffee gave himself a moment to regain his composure only they never got a chance to grow up properly were you very close he nodded im sorry dont be sorry they lived an extra life they had extra time so they did not many people get to have that you miss them much his gaunt face wrinkled painfully maddy realized this conversation was hurting him stupid question im an idiot i apologize that was he shook his head no need to apologize i have the three of you now were just as much a family together as the others family see thats why i think this is a good idea heading to boston perhaps my folks can help out the way i figure it now were not living in a resetting time loop then that money in the bank account wont last forever theres just under twelve thousand dollars in it now it doesnt get to reset itself every monday morning that moneys gonna go quickly at least if we go see my mom and dad they might be able to lend us some money to tide us maddy i think going to see your parents is a big mistake why she could see foster was hesitating he had something to say and was fidgeting just like liam tended to do when he was unsure of himself foster maybe those killer support units do know you maybe they know all about you everything about you she looked at him he said that in a funny way like it was meant to mean so much more than just those words foster whats going on what do you know whatre you not telling me just then she heard a scream it echoed across the quiet mall drowning out the soft burble of mall music sal she was running across the toddler play area kicking aside multicoloured plastic balls that had escaped the small ballpool maddy she screamed again maddy stood up and waved her arm directing her over sal were over here whats up sal corrected course towards them behind her she could see liam and the others scrambling out of the minimart crossing the space in the middle of the mall sal barged her way through the coffeeshop tables and stools set up outside beneath a fake pampasgrass sunshade as if this was supposed to be a coffee bar perched on the beach of some tropical island stools clattered pampasgrass parasols wobbled and tipped over sal finally came to a rest bent over a waisthigh partition of fake sunbleached wood struggling for breath sal whats up theyre here she wheezed chapter outside denver colorado it was a small thing an insignificant thing but dr joseph olivera noticed roald waldstein left notes lying around from time to time the old man tended to prefer the oldfashioned pleasure of pen and paper as opposed to tapping out his thoughts on a virtual keyboard joseph olivera noticed that habit of his boss as they worked together setting up the archway field office scribbled notes on pads of lined paper on the computer desk most of it in waldsteins unique shorthand characters and glyphs that only he could make sense of joseph wondered how such a brilliant person could be so scatterbrained so messy or perhaps being untidy went hand in hand with genius the messier the desk the more brilliant the mind his notepads of cryptic notes were scattered everywhere and waldstein was constantly rifling among his notes crossreferencing them correcting them it was on one of these pages filled with the swirls of waldsteins writing that joseph one day spotted the word pandora it had been the only word on the pad not in waldsteins shorthand pandora of course meant nothing to him he suspected it was a codeword for one of the many commercial projects waldstein worked on simultaneously he knew his boss was working on several projects sponsored by the us military technology theyd inevitably want to adapt to weapons systems joseph knew the man was no fool waldstein was a genius but also a ruthless businessman his technology patents went to the highest bidder even if ultimately it meant his inventions were to be turned into devices for killing maiming pandora then a word he noted on a scrap of paper and promptly forgot about the agency or the new york project as waldstein sometimes referred to it became active on friday september an occasion marked only by joseph and frasier griggs from the comfort and safety of a private research lab at wg systems main research campus building in wyoming hidden a dozen miles away from the nearest town pinedale amid tall balding douglas firs clinging to the valley slopes the pair of them quietly clinked two glasses of soyovina rouge in celebration and began to monitor the archway beneath the williamsburg bridge in a place called brooklyn new york in the year they scanned for potential tachyon leakage or any emergency signal bursts meanwhile waldstein had insisted on staying behind in to directly mentor the team he wanted his to be the first face they saw as they woke up in their bunk beds he wanted to be the father figure to the three of them said it was important that they wholly trusted him theyll be disorientated and frightened when they first come round he said i want to be there for them and so waldsteins topsecret project had begun one team one field office and all of history for them to watch out for and protect the agency was waldsteins backup plan to keep history safe thats what hed once told joseph it was his b plan his a plan had been his very public campaign three years ago to ensure that the worlds leaders signed up to an international law forbidding any nation from continuing to develop timetravel technology it was to be a banned science but he was wily enough to realize that in this troubled time while every world leader might publicly denounce the technology secretly theyd be vigorously funding it working on it desperate to be the first world power with the ability to take control of time itself the ultimate weapons system i want the new york project to be selfreliant waldstein confided in joseph once its up and running the team will have to manage their own affairs decide their own mission priorities they must be entirely selfsufficient the team would have all the data equipment critical replacement parts they needed spare support unit foetuses growth tubes spare component boards for the displacement machine anything else they might need they could buy from a hardware or electronics store back in here in we must have as little contact with them as possible we cannot be directly linked to them joseph i cannot afford to be caught dabbling in time travel like this i must have a plausible believable deniability the team in then was to be left entirely to their own devices griggs was the most vociferous on that they had to survive on their own no way could there be any interaction between the team and them it could lead to their discovery in their arrest and the penalty under international law waldsteins law was rightly severe the death penalty however waldstein devised a safe way they could make contact if the team desperately needed to communicate with them in there was a way that they could do so he called the method a droppoint document joseph had been impressed by the mans ingenuity it was a private ad in a brooklyn newspaper they had a yellowing page of newsprint contained in a glass case here in a dogeared page that had somehow survived intact through half a century if the team in needed to send a message forward in time they simply had to dial that newspapers classifieds desk and place a personal ad to go in the next issue a personal ad that was to begin with the words a soul lost in time the personal ad represented history being meddled with in a very small way it would cause a tiny change a tiny harmless time wave that would ripple across fiftythree years to the present and change just one thing the sheet of newspaper in that glass case that was the only method of communication waldstein intended to permit them to use safe secret untraceable under no circumstances were they to beam a tachyon signal forward if anyone in the present was scanning for telltale signs of timetravel technology development the tachyon particle would be the giveaway the smoking gun pandora joseph would have completely forgotten about that word if it wasnt for another discovery he made not so very long after waldstein returned from content that his team based in brooklyn the timeriders that was the nickname he had for them were ready to do the job entirely on their own as it happened that team was the first team based in that brooklyn archway they did quite well lasted quite a long time chapter am september north haven plaza outside branford maddy led foster by the hand out of the coffee shop through the stools and tables to meet the others in the middle of the toddler play area chuckle zone liam spoke first bob just picked up a warning signal from spongebubba i also just detected two idents added bob where three hundred and seventy yards in that direction he said pointing along the central concourse of the shopping mall towards the front entrance to the parking strip beyond he was pointing in the direction of their rv they must have visited our bus first said sal how did they know which vehicle was ours maddy asked the parking area out front already had a few hundred cars in it even more now surely your lab unit said bob he turned to rashim your lab unit must have left its wireless communication on rashim nodded they must have homed in on bubbas signal all the way from new york said liam i thought its only a shortrange signal half a mile and youd lose it said rashim then they must have already been tailing us said maddy she looked at foster do you think he shook his head i dont know its possible becks had been watching the quickfire conversation her gaze snapping from one person to the next but now her eyes suddenly widened as they settled on something at the far end of the concourse they are here she said softly she pointed all of them turned to look two silhouetted figures emerging through large rotating glass doorways striding purposefully in their direction the pallid glow of morning light outside behind jayzus theres two of them we cant fight said maddy weve got to run bob stiffened bristled like a guard dog i can fight them i can provide you with time to escape dont be an idiot bob said liam theyll rip you to pieces so they will shaddyah who are they were wasting time said maddy she turned to look in the opposite direction the concourse carried on another fifty yards where it terminated as a circular eating area tables and plastic bucket chairs surrounded by a dozen fastfood outlets a lift and a couple of escalators could take them up to a balcony overlooking the central area and the upper floor of shops but as far as she could make out the only way out of the mall was back towards the approaching support units and out of those big revolving glass doors at the front how about in there said sal she pointed towards a large store with two floors upper and ground a preschool toy store called toystots all bright happyclappy colours inside out in front of the store a tall surlyfaced young man was putting on the head of a costume the stores mascot a livid pink dinosaur that maddy suspected was a blatant ripoff of barney yes go go she grasped fosters hand and led the way the others followed she pushed her way past a toddler on reins the child turned to watch them pass by blue eyes suddenly round and wide at the sight of bob presumably thinking he was another store mascot the toddler chuckled gleefully and reached out to grab and hug one of his treethick legs back off boomed bob the toddler toppled backwards in shock landing and bouncing on its nappycushioned behind it gazed up at them in confused silence watching this odd assortment of grownups leave the play area before finally deciding to bawl maddy led them into the store toystots she shook her head howd they get away with a name like that still early enough in the morning it was mainly staff milling around inside puffyfaced teens in gaudy pink store shirts bearing plastic name tags it was the right place to hide cluttered with racks of chunky plastic nonsense large furry soft toys rotating display stands of storybook cdroms and nurseryrhyme favourites everyone split up well lose em in here she had hold of fosters hand still she wasnt going to let it go she wasnt losing him again split up and well rendezvous where the diner said sal yes not the rv definitely not the rv there might be another of them waiting for them there the diner was next to the motel good enough make your way to the diner she looked back out past the knockoffbarney mascot standing out on the concourse she could just make out the distinctive outlines of the support units closer now the pair of them could so easily be bob and becks go she hissed we stand out like a sore thumb split their group fragmented in different directions rashim and sal bob liam and becks she pulled foster with her quickly weaving past an extravagant diorama made from babeblox building bricks into a maze of aisles laden with romper suits and cute frilly babygros he was already breathing hard this was getting difficult for the old man maddy i shut up foster im not leaving you behind she crouched low pulling aside clothes hangers on a rail to peer out across the store she could see the top of rashims head for a moment then it was gone behind a row of superlarge sesame street cuddlies she looked back at the stores entrance hoping to see the support units striding past and missing them nothing for the moment perhaps theyd already gone past maddy foster shhhh im trying to see excuse me miss maddy turned to see a member of staff looking down at her a girl in a pink shirt with a nose stud and upwaytoolatelastnight redrimmed eyes stared wearily down at her a face that clearly indicated this was too early in her cruddy day to put up with customerstoopid like this maam youre not really allowed to hide among the clothes like that maddy straightened up i err i was just looking for umm bargains i think it might be best if you step out of the store maam maddy remained where she was her eyes on the stores entrance just give us a sec here we just need to uh you need to leave miss youre clearly not shopping youre being a nuisance christ maddy turned on her just give me a freakin moment will you it wont kill you the girl didnt like that im asking you politely to leave please if you dont ill call the manager ill call mall security just then maddy saw them the support units standing in the entrance two pairs of grey eyes sweeping the toy store like prison searchlights knockoff barney the implausibly pink dinosaur sauntered cheerily towards them probably wearily parroting the stores moronic catchphrase friends that play together stay together the female support unit becks maddy found herself thinking lashed out with a fist and caught barney in the throat he disappeared from view whuh said the girl in the pink shirt to herself did she just punch joshua the male support units eyes panned round and caught sight of maddy just as she was about to duck back down out of sight he raised his arm something in his hand glinted someone screamed and then the gunfire started chapter am september north haven plaza outside branford maddy felt a warm puff of displaced air on her cheek as the shot whistled past her head she heard the shot impact on something a soft thud followed by a gasp she turned to see the girl on her knees beside her dark crimson blossoming across her store shirt she looked down at the blood then at maddy perplexed i i just got shot another couple of gunshots deafening in the shops stillness the baby clothes hanging from the rail above maddy lurched and danced a blizzard of foam stuffing erupted from a humpty dumpty on a shelf nearby maddy remained hunched down foster beside her my god were gonna die she whimpered to him there were raised voices outside the toystore in the malls main concourse a male voice two of them issuing a sharp challenge a warning more shots aiming out of the store this time maddy you go it was foster theyre distracted she whispered come on lets no he shook his head i can slow them down you go slow them down she made a face youre kidding right not fight them ill talk to them more shots one of them hit a wall nearby showering them with flakes of plaster you cant talk to theyre just like bob they have the exact same ai yeah but but theyre running an entirely different freakin mission you step out theyll shoot you just as soon as look at foster grasped her arm maddy im dead anyway he didnt need to explain that they both knew he was dying she knew he was dying the day he walked out of that starbucks and left her in charge of the team but somehow the reality of that had seemed removed with time looping for her in new york he was never going to die every time shed gone to visit him in central park he was the same old foster no sicker but then of course he wouldnt be it was always the same moment for him the same morning over and over and over since shed grabbed him from central park time for him had advanced two days that was all it had been but enough time that she could clearly see he was getting worse a dying man he should be in a hospital bed a hospice kept comfortable on a drip perhaps not running for his life through a shopping mall they know me he said its enough itll confuse them they may let me talk know you theres no time to explain he pushed her go just go maddy glanced at the girl beside them she was in shock pale alive but maybe for not much longer unless she got some help the gunfire was beginning to wane whomever the support units had been exchanging shots with outside on the concourse police mall security it was nearly a done deal now foster i he shushed her with a finger over her lips this is goodbye maddy dont ruin it by blurting something stupid she pulled his hand away foster she wanted to call him by his real name liam foster smiled its a long while since ive been called that please she had no idea what she wanted to say something meaningful please wasnt it please was just so pathetically lame for the love of god maddy will you just bleedin well go liam she said again i i he waved her silent i loved you maddy each time i always did even when i knew he stopped himself so much he wanted to say and so little that he could in this all too short heartbeat of time just go she heard footsteps inside the store heavy purposeful footsteps drawing closer then cursing herself for being a coward for leaving him behind she scooted on hands and feet through aisles of chunky plastic playsets beneath rows of furhooded childrens anoraks and racks of cheerily coloured wellies perfect for little feet to stamp in autumn rain puddles she scuttled on all fours until she finally stumbled upon the moving metal grated steps of an escalator foster waited until she was out of sight stood up his hands raised above him both support units levelled their weapons at him the male support unit was bleeding from three gunshot wounds one to the forehead a dark trickle of blood rolled sluggishly down between thick brows down the side of his nose from a circle of puckered flesh above his eyes a perfect takedown shot from some policeman or mall guard whoever had taken that head shot must have died wondering how a man could be shot between the eyes and shrug it off like a mere gnat bite you know me said foster the female support unit frowned a hesitant confused expression on her face the old man standing before her looked very similar to one of the faces in her database it wasnt an exact match but a very close one close enough that she wanted to take a couple of steps closer see him more clearly and confirm his identity one way or the other where are the others asked abel foster shrugged long gone you are a part of their team halfway between a statement and a question you know me dont you said foster again trying a lopsided smile its me im your authorized user now then why dont you lower your weapons abel narrowed his eyes he had to admit the man standing in front of him with his hands raised did look very much like the man who had issued them their instructions authorized user he cast an uncertain glance at faith a glance that asked the question is he she was still working on that particular one herself the escalator carried maddy slowly towards the shops upper floor babytoddler wear it was so still so very quiet all she could hear was the gentle hum of the escalators motor and the soft chime of mall music outside still down on her hands and knees she decided to chance one last look she lifted her head to see over the smoked glass side of the escalator over the black rubber rim of the hand rail and she caught sight of foster standing just yards in front of the two units his arms raised in surrender but slowly lowering them as if the gesture of surrender was no longer necessary he was saying something she could just about hear his voice low unclear but it was definitely him doing the talking my god hes actually doing it hes actually talking them round for a moment there just for a moment she let herself believe something might go their way for once then one of the units fired her last image of foster was him dropping to his knees in front of the killer meatbots she thought she heard him swear at them something irish something defiant something so very liam then as the escalator carried her past a sales display and she finally lost sight of him she heard four or five shots one after the other then one last executioners shot chapter am september north haven plaza outside branford liam led the way out of the toystores upperfloor exit on to the top concourse the few midmorning shoppers were frozen where they were no one was going anywhere merely exchanging expressions of panic was that a gun i just heard a woman asked liam as he and the two support units rushed past aye said liam dragging a dawdling becks by the hand we must stop and fight them she said theres two of em and they got guns he looked at her are you that desperate to get yourself into a scrap she cocked her head scrap not used to liams speech patterns just yet inadvisable said bob the best course of action right now is evasion liam nodded listen to your big brother they were just passing a barnes amp noble when half a dozen more shots erupted from the floor below and rang out across the mall jayzus oh my god someone across the way screamed its terrorists the t word spread like a ripple across a still pond peoples mouths dropping open into os the mall music suddenly stopped and a voice announced over the tannoy that an emergency situation was in progress and that all customers and staff were to proceed immediately to the nearest fire exits inevitably someone screamed the b word and the frozen tableau of confusion turned into a flood of shop staff emerging from the entrances of their respective stores spilling on to the upper concourse suddenly it seemed like a very busy mall liam and the other two joined the press of bodies heading towards the escalators at the end that would take them down to the front entrance and out into the car park sal and rashim had found a different way out of the toystore on the lower floor a door marked staff only that led to a stockroom piled high with cardboard boxes and bubble wrap from there they found a door at the back that gave access to a service corridor of dull grey breezeblock walls which way now asked rashim i dont know her guess was left left would take them towards the entrance they came in she figured she led the way muted by two closed doors they heard the faintest crackle of gunfire behind them this is insane gasped rashim who in gods name wants you lot dead so badly jahulla she whispered wish i knew it felt to her like theyd been running nonstop for weeks in addedup time for her it was almost that just after sending liam and bob back to rome thats when theyd been jumped in times square ambushed and pursued all the way back to the archway and there attacked yet again one of the units even managing to dive through the portal right behind them and join them back in ancient rome pandora it was asking about pandora that had set this off sal was almost certain of that that and perhaps somehow it was linked to that poor poor man whod jumped back to to warn her about something but what was that warning the bear youre not who you think you are what the pinchudda was that supposed to mean i think im sal im saleena vikram im a schoolgirl from ajmeera independent academy in mumbai i used to play pikodu pretty well and listen to bhangrametal im the daughter of sanjay and abeer vikram and i used to live in a small apartment in mumbai papaji used to buy and sell computer chips mamaji used to be an accountant what part of all of that isnt right they turned a corner yo hey ahead of them a black mall security guard stop right there he had a handgun pointed at them hands where i can see them were trying to get shut up a hand fumbled for the radio on his belt he kept his eyes on them this is kent i got two of em right here service access b the radio squawked static and an unintelligible voice the mall guard replied asian one male approximately midtwenties one female midteens another squirt of static and voice uh yeah hes got a bit of a beard they were both running from the gunfire static and voice copy that he hung the radio back on his belt you two raghead terrorist sons of he bit his lip

right now she could see the knuckle of his trigger finger bulging the skin paler drawn over tendon and bone there were already several pounds of pressure resting on that trigger ok ok she placed her palms up against the rough breeze blocks rashim silently she urged him to do likewise rashim is it eh the mall guard shook his head as he approached then as sal and rashim adopted the legsaparthandsagainstthewall pose the guard began to pat sal down onehanded what is it with you goddamned moslems uh he huffed as he frisked them what the hell is it you hate so much bout america what

them stupid pyjamasuits gotta go an worship buddha five times a day its allah actually the guard pushed rashims head hard against the wall you shut your goddamn raghead mouth chapter am september north haven plaza branford they regarded the body of the old man lying on the floor in front of them in silence beside him a young female was cowering on the floor her hands clasped to a wound pplease ddont kill me she whimpered both support units ignored her she was irrelevant back to the dead man it is an older version of the one called liam oconnor said faith studying the old mans face a valid target abel nodded good he looked up the others will be nearby theyd spotted the group heading into this store and briefly picked up the idents of the two support units with them those signals were gone now switched off other than sneaking past them out of the stores main entrance he noted only two other possible exits for them we must separate faith looked at the escalator leading to the stores upper floor i will go that way abel nodded and immediately strode towards the staff only door at the rear of the store locate and kill we have six remaining targets he added wirelessly affirmative she replied faith jogged up the escalator as another tannoy announcement reverberated throughout the mall attention attention this is an emergency announcement all customers and staff are asked to immediately leave the mall this is an emergency and not a drill please leave the the escalator jerked to a halt beneath her feet she hurried up the rest of the way and at the top she scanned the shop floor she spotted thirteen people seven of them wearing the same pink shirts as the dying girl downstairs she assumed the shirt was some sort of a uniform none of them or the others bore any resemblance to the mission briefing images shed started with nor the library of fleeting shutterframe images glimpses of her quarry that shed managed to build up during the mission so far faith emerged quickly from the store tucking the gun away into the waistband of her jogging bottoms and hiding the guns protruding handle beneath her hoody no need to attract any unwanted attention theyd already done enough of that with the gunfight downstairs she joined the throng of people on the upper floor emerging from store fronts so many of them sluggish uncertain seemingly unsure whether this was a real emergency or a drill unsure whether the exchange of gunfire minutes ago might have been stupid kids letting off some firecrackers she scanned the backs of heads necks shoulders she had a comparison image of that particular view of one of the targets called madelaine from back in times square when shed crossed the street and chased them into the building madelaine tall slim long lightcoloured curly hair pulled into a ponytail jeans checked shirt the other girl saleena short slim black hair dark leggings black hooded top of course they could be wearing different clothes by now her eyes coolly evaluated the people hurrying in front of her one after the other in quick succession maddy found herself in the middle of a milling crowd of people a bottleneck at the top of both of the now stationary escalators leading down to the ground floor someone had turned them off probably a routine health and safety measure in the event of a mall evacuation stupid though being off it was taking an age to get down she was stuck at the top waiting for an elderly couple in front of her to tramp slowly down come on come on she guessed she must be the last one in their group to get out the others were probably already running back across the car park along the pavement towards the motel and their waiting rv her mind had yet to process what shed glimpsed it was there in her head foster being gunned down but in the fleeting minute two minutes since then shed yet to digest it make sense of it feel something about it that was going to come of course tears probably lots of them fear grief panic stress four excuses right there to let it go and cry like some typical movie girlindistress all quivering dimpled chin and smudged mascara if she managed to live long enough that is a woman pushed past maddy pushed past the old couple in front of her heavy heels clanked on the metalstrip steps wide hips bumping people aside as she pushed her way forward and wheezed a mantra of barely contained panic oh my lord protect me oh my lord protect me maddy wanted to push her way forward like that but didnt too rude still come on come on she wished she had bob here with her even their halfgrown becks she might only look like twelve or thirteen years old but she could snap a neck or take a magazine full of bullets almost as well as bob then she saw her face becks only of course it wasnt becks jesus you guys took your goddamn time the mall guard called out relieved at the sight of five cops jogging along the narrow service passage towards him these the two perps you called in said one of them a police sergeant he and one of the others were carrying shotguns yeah these are them they dont match the description our boys called in he said pumping shells into the weapons breech armed male and female both adults both caucasian he looked at rashim and sal these clearly arent them but jason take these two out yessir said one of the cops you give your details to him he said to sal and rashim well need witness statements off you later right said sal thanks the sergeant stroked his chin thoughtfully his radio crackled with traffic more cops on their way in an armed response unit among them we got several officers down in there sir i know that the police sergeant barked i know that lemme think lemme think just then they heard the echo of a door bang open the slap of heavy footsteps on linoleum nothing sal could see it came from around the corner from where she and rashim had just emerged via the toystores stockroom some minutes ago whos that whispered one of the cops the footsteps echoed heavy even measured its one of them said sal them who the sergeant cocked his weapon one of the shooters she nodded police he called out quickly we are armed police his voice rolled down the passageway and eventually faded to silence the sound of approaching footsteps suddenly ceased police he called again you best come round with your hands up there was no reply just the sound of an ammo clip being ejected and rattling on the floor the clacksnick of a new one being rammed home that dont sound so good said the mall guard just get these two civilians the hell out of here before this turns nasty whispered the sergeant the mall guard nodded grabbed sals arm lets go folks ok ok she whispered eagerly the guard led the way delivery bay six is right up here just ahead he said quietly we can exit that way he picked up the pace sal stole one last glance over her shoulder at the huddle of police officers in the anaemic turquoise glow of the passages wall lights checking their weapons and holding them up and steady in the trained and engrained twohand legsapart stance here this way said the guard he pushed open double doors that led on to an underground delivery bay as they stepped out the mall guard holding the swing doors open for them sal thought she heard the police sergeant call out one last challenge then as the echo of his shaky voice tailed away the passage behind them suddenly sounded like a war zone chapter am september north haven plaza outside branford liam bob and becks approached the rv cautiously it sat in the motels small forecourt on its own overhead the sky was noisy with the thwupthwup of a police helicopter hovering above the pale slab of the mall several hundred yards away liam could also hear the sound of several approaching police cars and ambulances coming from further up interstate brake lights winking on down the congested road like a mexican wave as drivers slowed to pull aside and let them through ahead of them the rv maddy said we should meet at the diner said bob i want to check on spongebubba said liam you think its safe he added maybe theres another of them inside i detect no idents said becks just a moment said bob he closed his eyes why whatre you doing a few seconds later the rear door of the rv swung open and a yellow cube appeared on the top step communicating with the lab unit replied bob he smiled down at liam spongebubba says its all clear inside they crossed the last fifty yards liam gesturing at spongebubba to get back inside they didnt need the lab robot attracting attention liam climbed up and slumped down on the rear seat damp with perspiration gee said spongebubba with a fixed plastic grin fun and games becks looked down at the small robot no not fun and games danger bob clambered inside the rv rocked your warning saved us lab unit we are grateful youre welcome wheres my skippa liam looked out through the scuffed perspex hoping to catch sight of the others weaving through the cars in the malls car park towards the motel nothing yet theyre coming he said they were just behind us i think he looked at bob and becks right bob shook his head i dont know foster will have slowed them down said becks he moved very slowly she was right liam decided he should have stayed behind with maddy to help her with the old man a dreadful thought occurred to him that those killer meatbots had trapped and finished both of them off perhaps rashim and sal as well he felt a growing surge of panic inside him the idea of spending the rest of his life alone on the run with two support units and something that looked like a yellow bar of soap on stumpy legs terrified him please please somebody else turn up faith recognized the young woman instantly the oval jawline the glasses the curly strawberryblonde hair all a perfect match but even without the visual match the look of sudden recognition and sheer horror as their eyes locked gave the girl away faith reached round behind her and whipped out the handgun from her waistband please move out of the way she commanded the evacuating people all around her as she levelled the gun at her target ohmygodshesgotagun someone screamed that worked better the crowd jostling to get down the frozen escalator dropped to the floor as one and faith had a perfect lineofsight on maddy the only person still on her feet maddy pushed the large woman crouching in front desperately trying to get past but the woman was too big to make a space on the escalator maddy found herself clambering over her back ow jesus help me im being assaulted screamed the woman i need to get past maddy replied i need to freakin well get a shot rang out the glass of the escalators side exploded the woman ducked down as shards scattered over her rounded shoulders and maddy rolled over the top of her on to someone else in front another shot thudded into the thick rubber handrest she found her feet and decided she was far enough down the escalator to jump over the side she landed on the top of a display of plastic tropical bushes embedded in a bed of pebbles not the softest landing but perhaps far better than the malls faux marble floor she scrambled on to her feet yet again people all around her shrieking in alarm as several more shots rang out across the entrance foyer get out get out maddy screamed at the bottleneck of people fighting with each other to exit through the revolving door and the fire exits either side of it faith strode towards the safety rail of the concourse above overlooking the escalator she saw her target below on the ground floor grappling with people tugging at them to make way for her she took aim again and fired two shots emptying the clip downstairs more glass exploded and the screaming all around her took on a new shrill intense pitch faith clambered over the rail and let herself drop down she landed twenty feet below on the hard floor like a cat landing on its feet legs flexed to absorb the impact like the overpimped shock absorbers of a monster truck she reached into her waistband to pull out her last clip the target madelaine carter was directly in front of her trapped because the only way out was clogged with people tangled with each other and too petrified to sort themselves out she would have smiled if shed had that particular face gesture on file instead her face remained impassive as calm and expressionless as a person fast asleep as she rammed the last clip home into the grip of her handgun sal and rashim gave the mall guard kent a thoroughly unconvincing pair of aliases and random contact numbers the guard though seemed more than happy to take down what they said no questions asked quite probably he was preoccupied with thanking god he was alive still he offered a nod sal guessed that was his version of a sorry for earlier and told them to go home they now picked their way through the crowd at the front of the mall a slew of police cars had parked up in a semicircle just outside the entrance and officers were setting up a cordon around it urging the rubbernecking curious back away from the rotating glass doors at the front good grief that was rashim wiped sweat from his forehead close he nodded incredibly theyre the same ones that were chasing me and maddy before we came back in time to get you almost identical to your support units they were definitely a similar batch number quite possibly from the exact same batch a possibility occurred to sal as they backed away from the crowd outside and studied the front of the mall from a comfortable distance there were still people spilling out of the revolving doors being hustled out of harms way as quickly as possible by paramedics cops and mall guards maybe they were a batch of support units that had malfunctioned perhaps whoever was running their little agency from the future had decided to send them some replacement support units and something had gone wrong in the process she shot that idea down just as quickly as it had popped into her head no there was the san francisco drop point thats where theyd get backup copies of bob and becks frozen foetuses ready to grow these were ones already fully grown and given a very specific mission to come after the whole team and not rest until the last of them were dead apparently so no mistakes there no malfunctions just deadly intent you think we should make our way back to that diner said rashim sal was about to answer when two gunshots came from just inside the malls entrance foyer a moment later a large plateglass window exploded and screams ripped through the air the police whod set up a cordon to hold the crowd back now drew their sidearms all of them spinning round to face the glass frontage of the shopping mall people spilled out of the slowly turning revolving door the side doors even through the jaggedtooth remains of the freshly shattered glass frontage theres maddy hissed sal she emerged with the others arms up and wrapped round her head to protect it hunkered over like someone getting out of a helicopter sal pushed through the crowd now all turning and scattering from the entrance at the sound of another shot fired inside the foyer maddy she called out over here the girls all but crashed into each other maddy i thought you were just go gogogogogo faith picked her zigzagging target out of the retreating stampeding crowd she levelled the smith amp wesson now the thing had a fresh clip she resolved to empty all twelve rounds in several controlled doubletaps to be absolutely certain of killing the target as she aimed down the short barrel she caught sight of one of the other targets saleena vikram both girls tangled with each other for a moment then turning their backs to her ran away hand in hand two for the price of one faith nodded pleased with herself for producing an appropriate saying for the occasion she was about to pull the trigger when the world went completely dark chapter am september interstate outside branford five minutes later they were all back aboard the rv on the road and running on the last quartertank of petrol bob driving northeast as instructed and maddy rocking back and forth beside him in the passenger seat trying to get a handle on things get a handle on her jangling nerves a handle on the growing knot of grief in her chest as sal liam and rashim threw questions at her over the seat hes gone she said finally answering them as to where the hell foster was what do you mean liam struggled to say any more so rashim finished his question for him they they got foster she nodded shot him hes dead here it comes maddy felt her composure slipping the blissful comfort of numbness was ebbing away like the downslope of a novocaine buzz after rootcanal treatment the first hot tears trickled down her cheeks she tasted salt on her lips and licked them away she nodded yes fosters dead her voice was a lifeless whisper the flutter and tap of moth wings against a windowpane she took her glasses off and buried her damp face in her hands and realized that now shed finally become that typical movie girlindistress all quivering dimpled chin and smudged mascara albeit minus the mascara chapter outside denver colorado joseph olivera had got to know frasier griggs quite well griggs was the only other man in the world other than roald waldstein of course who knew of the timeriders existence frasier griggs was waldsteins lesserknown junior partner where waldstein was the source of the patents the ideas man the genius griggs was the practical other half the software designer behind waldsteins prototypes the builder the steve wozniak to waldsteins steve jobs although most people assumed the g in wg systems was in memory of waldsteins dead son gabriel griggs was in fact the real g the companys first stakeholder the fledgling companys first employee and perhaps the closest thing to a friend that waldstein had ever had hell on his desk griggs even had a tea mug with that printed on the side the real g the timeriders team established in became effectively active and monitoring their activities began on september on a daytoday basis joseph and griggs were the base team doing that only four months after the team started functioning things began to go wrong on january they received a broadburst tachyon signal from a malfunction with the field offices displacement field had caused the first team to be killed theyd received a garbled plea for help from one of them whod managed to survive griggs panicked for the first time since working for waldstein joseph saw his bosss normally icecool composure slip it wasnt that the team had been destroyed that unsettled him it was the fact that one of them had been careless enough to send an unencrypted widespread tachyon signal it was sheer blind luck for waldstein that the message hadnt included a mention of his name but it might as well have given he was quite likely the only person in the world at that moment with the knowhow to send a traveller back in time that short signal could have been picked up by labs right across the world and it could only mean one thing for everyone who might have detected it that somebody was already up and running with viable displacement technology joseph remembered griggs and waldstein having a blazing row that morning one held behind closed doors not meant for joseph to hear but the one word he did pick out from their heated exchange was the word pandora waldstein had little choice either he had to go back to and set things up all over again or he had to send a message to the survivor instructing him on how to set things up for himself waldstein wanted to go back but griggs insisted that another trip back to was pushing their luck too far if this was it if this meant the premature end of their project then so be it better than the three of them facing a lethal injection joseph soon learned whod sent the message who the sole survivor was it was liam oconnor a second message arrived after the first this time via the safe method the personal advert a field malfunction thats what hed said equipment failure the liam unit had been aged chronically by a sudden blast of tachyon radiation that had bathed the entire archway with a lethal dose the other two units hadnt stood a chance theyd died in their sleep waldstein replied with a detailed packet of instructions and not a single word of support or comfort but then that was it wasnt it the liam unit was merely a piece of equipment to waldstein a disposable asset joseph had wondered how the man could be so cold in a way the liam unit was as much a part of waldstein as he was a part of josephs programming poor liam hed be alone back there alone and suddenly aware now of what he was joseph felt for him the boy was so young and yet now so old and quite clearly entirely on his own the base team was offering him instructions from afar and that was pretty much all the support the poor man had that was the first thing the second misfortune happened not long after a contamination event had occurred in it appeared the event had been corrected by the reestablished team but one of the team had been killed the observer unit saleena vikram they needed to grow a new one with an adjusted memory one that would allow her to be inserted into the existing team some tricky synaptic programming there for joseph to do there was no avoiding it they were going to need to carry out the edit job on the saleena unit here in then send it back that was it for griggs too much he wanted out there was another blazing row between him and waldstein behind closed glass doors this time joseph picked out one word several times over pandora and griggs screaming at waldstein why why do you want that to happen the third thing was griggss death a few days later it was sudden unexpected and left joseph feeling distinctly uncertain about this whole project the night before he died griggs had been on edge hed also been drinking joseph didnt get much sense out of frasier other than hed told waldstein hed finally decided he was going to leave this project that he didnt want to have anything more to do with this madness the next day frasier griggs was found dead several miles outside wg systems pinedale wyoming campus the official verdict was that some flood migrants must have ambushed him there were plenty of them out here now the displaced the desperate the hungry millions of them from the various eastcoast states partially or completely submerged by the advancing atlantic ocean the lucky rich lived in fortified urbanizations the rest in large displacement camps thats how it was the haves and the havenots separated by coils of razor wire and private security firms it could have occurred as the official verdict stated that poor frasier had just set his autodrive to take him home along the wrong road at the wrong time and the hastily erected roadblock the subsequent murder and vehicle theft were just another sad sign of these dark times but then joseph discovered something that made him suddenly very frightened of waldstein griggss personal digipen a very expensive one modelled to look like an oldfashioned fountain pen was sitting in griggss real g mug like some carelessly discarded biro something he never did he had a brass holder for his digipen and it always nestled there when not in use one of his obsessivecompulsive habits hed never leave it like that poking out of his mug so thats why joseph picked it up and thumbed the control nub a memo it wasnt even passwordlocked it was the last entry recorded on griggss digipen he must have recorded it not long after hed rowed with waldstein he sounded angry still perhaps even frightened hes insane the mans completely insane joseph griggss words were badly slurred he must have carried on drinking after joseph had bid him goodnight i think he wants the whole world to die joseph thats what pandora is its the end of the world roald knows all about it when it happens how it happens and you and i and those poor clones back in were here to make sure it happens that way a pause joseph heard the slosh of liquid the clink of a glass the sound of a gulp you know that first time he used a time machine back in i dont think he went back in time to see his wife his son like he always claimed no i think he went forward i think he discovered how mankind finally kills itself off and all this everything his campaign against time travel this little project those poor lab rats back there in new york in that archway you and me its all been to make for certain it damn well happens that way weve been played for fools you and me joseph fools another pause you can stop this joseph i cant he wont let me back in after what i said he wont trust me anywhere near this project i shouldve shut my mouth i shouldnt have confronted him but its done im out of the circle of trust and thats how it is but you can do something youre all he has now he trusts you you could derail this thing sabotage it the sound of heavy breathing rustling across the mic joseph history has to be changed do you understand not preserved but changed you have to do it youve got to steer us all away from wiping ourselves out another pause god forgive me for my part in all of this chapter september north haven plaza branford connecticut were going to have to pull in a lot of favours to keep the lid on this agent cooper thats what favours are for arent they rainy days like this cooper looked around the entrance foyer of the shopping mall it looked like a thousand other malls all pastel plastic fascias and plastic plants faux grecoroman columns and doric archways only this one was decorated with icingsugar granules of glass scattered across the fake marble floor shopping bags discarded in the stampede to exit several drops and smears of dried blood dotted here and there what cover story are we putting out armed robbery that went wrong good cooper nodded keeping it simple if thered been a whiff of terrorist to it the press would be all over this story that had been his first instinct a terrorist cover story that some conspirators involved with the twin towers incident some of the press were calling it now a catchy term for it had been identified and put under surveillance the men had been a terrorist cell attempting to lie low for a while until things settled down and vigilance levels dropped once more and they could have a go at slipping past immigration and out of the country but theyd been followed and caught as they headed upstate from new york if cooper had gone with that cover story this car park would have been crawling with newsstation broadcast vans and reporters doing pieces to camera instead a simple armed robbery gone wrong story didnt have the same pulling power right now they had the mall to themselves for a day or two a crime scene every entrance taped off and guarded by a uniformed officer we got cctv coverage of most of the incident thats all been confiscated yes sir cooper had already seen some of it digitally copied and enhanced to make it a little clearer there was no mistaking the fact that the two armed people one man and one woman had been hit several times in the opening crossfire and yet theyd walked on as if nothing had happened leaving an easytofollow trail of blood droplets in their wake cooper looked up at the escalator one glass side of it shattered then at the railing running round the horseshoeshaped balcony of the floor above a twentyfoot drop down to where they were now standing incredible the female really jumped down from up there thats what the eyewitnesses said theyll need to be informed they were mistaken or that the woman shattered her legs and spine on impact they saw her get up and take several steps cooper looked at agent mallard one of the few fbi agents his limited budget allowed him to deputize into the department mallard was young eager to impress ready to do as he was told thats what they thought they saw mallard do you understand what they thought they saw in the heat of the moment the mind plays tricks on what you think youve seen in a situation like this right yes sir the male one preliminary autopsys already been done and mallard hesitated the report says he sustained thirtyseven separate gunshot wounds thirtyseven yes sir the police officers who were interviewed said they only managed to bring him down after four or five successful head shots cooper kept his face impassive his response measured this wasnt the place for outbursts of incredulity he also needed to be sure his new recruit fully understood the situation mallard sir youre going to see some things learn things that ill be frank with you most presidents dont even get to know about you understand once youre in the department youre in it for good that was made clear to me sir good now take me to where theyre holding the other one the female i want to talk with her directly chapter september interstate newton massachusetts the rest of the drive up to boston had been quiet liam maddy and sal all silent with their own thoughts the two support units sat perfectly still bob was busy as he drove sorting through packets of code and prioritizing the most useful bits to upload to becks she sat in the back still as a shop mannequin as she digested the code floating back to her rashim gazed out of the window at more of a world hed only ever seen in videofilm files while spongebubba chirped exclamations full of childlike wonder every now and then so very much like a child with that squeaky voice and slight lisp look skippa a red car hey that mans reeally fat maddy wondered why rashim would deliberately choose to hack his robots code to be so grating but that was it wasnt it the faults the irritating traits and annoying behavioural ticks the imperfections and phobias its those things that make us human thats why he made his lab unit so irritating less of a soulless machine perfection on the other hand cool detached emotionless perfection like those two killer meatbots relentlessly pursuing them thats what sociopaths were werent they at least in their own minds without weakness without imperfections just after midday they checked into another motel it was as generic and nondescript as the last one had been but at least this was one in her hometown boston maddy felt a little more secure the suburb arlington where her folks lived was actually only about five or six miles away as the crow flies she was so nearly home isnt this a bit dangerous said liam flicking through the channels on the rooms tv set i mean well might they not guess youll come here hed said they like they them the sort of language a tinfoilhatwearing paranoid conspiracy nut would use were nearly out of money liam and even if the account had more money in it what if someones tracking the card when we use an atm it could be done a bank account flagged and used to track a persons movements we need some help in case you havent noticed our little organization isnt doing so good but come on going to your parents house they can help us out my mom and dad once ive explained who i am theyll help us out once youve explained who you are he cocked a brow listen to yourself thatll take some explaining so it will maddy she could already imagine the expression on her moms face a squint of suspicion at the strange teenage girl on her doorstep gabbling about time travel then probably fear perhaps mom would try slamming the front door on her and calling the police but then maddy could tell her and dad some things that were about to happen she could tell them that president bush was soon to make his infamous axis of evil speech that very soon they were going to start pointing the finger of blame at saddam hussein in iraq or aim for something closer to home she tried to think of their family life directly after but she couldnt remember anything specific that was due to happen at home over the next few days theyd lost julian in the north tower their nephew her cousin it would be a household fogged with grief right now no wonder she couldnt recall anything specific she was nine then now her younger version would be a confused and frightened little girl believing fox news that a big war was coming that more planes could suddenly start dropping out of the sky no wonder maddy couldnt pull any useful memory out of her head from the immediate aftermath it was just one big fog of news stations repeating the same things of fear and paranoia and rumours she decided shed pick something from before to tell her parents something only their very own daughter would know and yes thered be herself her younger self right there to confirm that she was telling the truth that she was their daughter from the future she could pick something like her favourite toys name her favourite tv show her favourite clothes her favourite maddy realized she couldnt recall any of those things not a single thing liams right said sal maybe visiting them isnt a good idea maybe maddy watched channels flash by on the screen maybe the other two were right but they couldnt stay here in these two motel rooms forever liam yawned she felt tired too she needed some time alone to get her head right lets get some rest she said finally weve all had a bad few days and were none of us thinking straight here that is sensible said bob becks and i can stand watch while you sleep you boys can have the other room said maddy rashim nodded and got up liam tossed the tv remote to sal and bob opened the door for them lets meet for dinner well work out what we do next then the boys left the motel door snicked shut behind them becks took her place beside the window the net curtain tugged slightly aside patiently watching the slip road outside that led past a tgi fridays and a liquor store to their motel sal flopped on to the free bed and within a couple of minutes was snoring with a soft rattle that sounded like the purr of a cat and maddy gazed listlessly at the muted tv set at the end of her bed chapter september new haven county connecticut agents cooper and mallard looked at the knuckleshaped bulge in the cell door she did that said cooper the duty officer at the county police station nodded we had to taser her and heavily sedate her cuff her and put her in a restraining jacket or i reckon shed have smashed her way out eventually shes conscious now though the officer nodded you actually wanna go in there with her of course jeez dont rile her up or anything he fussed with a jangle of keys on his belt dont know why were holding her here she shouldve been taken to the state on my orders replied cooper the less pairs of eyeballs on this the better and you and your boys did a splendid job taking her down at the mall he smiled kindly i trust her in your care officer for the moment he found the key and inserted it into the cell door this is some kind of top secret isnt it afraid so anything to do with the world trade center cooper shook his head keep it simple keep it terroristfree no nothing he turned the key in the door back at the mall she hospitalized three of my men even after wed tasered the heck out of her he looked at cooper pointedly could you at least give me some idea what the hell she is cooper glanced at mallard then back at the cop shes the future he pulled the cell door open it clanged against the doorframe as it opened slightly misshapen from the pounding it had received from the inside he stepped in beckoned mallard to join him but held his hand up to the cop just my colleague and me im afraid right sighed the officer he glanced at the baldheaded female strapped to the cells cot she was wide awake and emotionless grey eyes swivelled murderously towards him she was panting like a wild animal flexing against the restraints shes all yours he said finally and closed the door on them mallard looked decidedly uncomfortable you sure were safe in here with her sir cooper ignored him he squatted down beside the cot those grey eyes were now on him her panting and flexing stopped no longer a wild animal in a heartbeat she was calm and impassive he could feel those grey eyes coolly evaluating him release me she said evenly after a while ah so you can talk affirmative i am able to talk cooper tapped his chin with his fountain pen for a moment i have no idea what exactly you are i do know however that youre not a normal human being she said nothing we had a preliminary report back on a sample of your colleagues blood cooper worked to keep his voice as cold and clinically professional as this young womans its not a match with any blood type correct she replied her dark eyebrows knotted momentarily abel is terminated terminated you mean dead no point lying to her yes hes quite dead he thought he detected the slightest flicker of a reaction on her face terminated god yes thats what this was beginning to feel like that awfully cheesy eighties sciencefiction movie about killer robots the postmortem also produced another very interesting discovery continued cooper this ones a doozy the pathologist whod rung this little detail through to him was almost in tears she was gabbling confused asking him questions none of which he could answer mallard had yet to hear this titbit of information your friend abel has no human brain whuh mallards jaw hung open cooper scowled at him and his mouth snapped shut the cranial cavity interiors much much smaller than a regular human skull the space is taken up with additional layers of bone a thoroughly reinforced skull inside all of that we found a brain the size of a fingernail and what appears to be some sort of embedded circuitry the circuit has selfdestructed she said cocking an eyebrow yes he wasnt sure if that was a statement or a question he waited for more but she just eyed him coolly yes he sighed it was pretty much fried that is good was that the ghost of a smile there abel was able to selfdestruct he thought hed give the direct approach a go at the moment she seemed willing to talk candidly would you care to tell me who or what you are genetically engineered organicsilicon hybrid reconnaissance and covert operations variant she replied with wg systems ai version installed what does organicsilicon hybrid mean youre what some sort of half humanhalf robot asked mallard negative i am a genetically engineered human frame with a dense siliconwafer processor her eyes flickered on to mallard a computer for a brain she clarified for his benefit but but he looked at cooper we cant do that kind of genetic engineering yet can we no faith replied not for another fifty years my god gasped mallard jesus youre from the from the future is that what youre saying cooper was tempted to tell mallard to shut up yes at some point he was going to need to bring his new man up to speed mallard had already been exposed to knowledge way beyond being allowed to return to the fbi rank and file cooper decided he might as well get him right up there on the same page as him the sooner the better why dont you start by telling me what precise year youre from cooper said my batch birth date is june waldstein sent us back to kill timeriders oh my god did she just say thats right mallard youre going to need to get your head round this and fast i cant have you flapping your jaw like that every time somethings said shes from the future get used to it the younger man paled he rocked on his heels uncertainly as his jaw hung open catching flies once more cooper decided hed better go easy on him after all personally hed had quite a few years to get used to the idea that anonymous time travellers had passed this way in recent years and just might have rather carelessly left one or two of their footsteps in history the future he whispered mallard i need you to process that quietly all right i know its a helluva thing to take on board so just think about it for now and later i will talk you through it all the evidence we have the whole deal but for now right now i need you to shut up he patted the mans shoulder all right mallard nodded cooper turned back to the young woman strapped to the cells cot why have you come back here to our time who were you after in that shopping mall she started blinking rapidly you all right whatre you doing no response just the rapid flickering of her eyelids good god mallard was horrified i think shes having a seizure shes her eyes snapped open negative i am reprioritizing mission parameters just a moment just a moment a minute passed in silence long enough for cooper to begin wondering whether he needed to prod her again information she said finally while you may be able to assist me revealing mission objectives to you is a protocol breach a contamination contamination a time contamination providing information to you that may cause you to behave in a way or perform actions that alter the timeline this is a basic protocol breach and must be avoided however her eyelids stopped fluttering and her gaze settled back on cooper there is a greater contamination occurring at the moment which must be prevented the people you were after correct they are not of this time they must be located immediately and dealt with by that im guessing you mean killed affirmative they have with them the necessary components to facilitate further time displacements and cause even greater contamination they must be located before they effect a displacement displacement you mean time travel cooper felt hairs rising on the back of his neck my god you youre actually talking about a functioning he felt ridiculous even voicing the words but there was no other way of saying it time machine is that what youre talking about is that what theyve got with them the components required to rebuild one yes cooper felt a little unsteady like mallard had a moment ago he rocked back on his heels settling gently against the cold wall of the cell grateful for its support she played a cold emotionless facsimile of a smile across her lips what is your name cooper he answered agent niles cooper cooper i am faith i believe that we are able to assist each other a deal shes proposing a deal you want us to let you out of here affirmative i can lead you directly to them i have data on their likely movements and if you find them then what i will kill them what about their he decided to use her term displacement machine it must be destroyed no wed want that intact i cant agree to those negative allowing you to possess a fully functioning displacement device is unacceptable that would be an even greater contamination threat you will not be permitted that then im afraid theres no deal faith her eyes closed and her eyelids began to flutter she started to pant and flex again an unsettling sight like a child sucking in air and preparing to throw an almighty tantrum but then she stopped i am able to offer you an alternative cooper what my silicon mind completely intact he narrowed his eyes the computer in your head just like the other one in your dead friend correct i will of course delete all files associated with time displacement but you would be left with the computer architecture entirely intact jesus whispered mallard thats a fiftyyear jump in computer technology cooper nodded slowly yes yes it is do we have an agreement asked faith he tapped his chin again he could feel those hairs on the back of his neck once more his scalp prickling all right i think we have the basis of an agreement chapter september interstate newton massachusetts it was midafternoon the next day when the debate in her head finally came to an end and she got up off her bed sal was still snoring becks heard her stir looked up from where she was sitting crosslegged on the floor where are you going maddy out she replied softly are you going to visit your family no point lying to her yes the others are worried about you doing this i need to go she and becks had had this conversation before back when the archway was a pile of rubble in the bottom of a bomb crater barely holding itself together shed nearly walked out on becks and the others then shed planned to somehow make her way back to boston in the vain hope of finding an alternate version of her parents perhaps even a version of herself it had been a moment of weakness a moment when shed been prepared to leave her friends to deal with things on their own maddy doubted becks had a memory of that particular conversation of walking out abandoning her in the archway at the moment she wasnt sure what memories becks had back in that skull of hers bob had been filling her mind up with as much as he could over the last couple of days a slow process over their nearfield wireless link whatever memories she had onboard now would be bobs not hers anyway beckss full mind remained on an external hard drive dont wake sal if she does wake and asks where i am tell her ive gone to get some supplies in or something yes maddy be careful maddy she added almost as an afterthought half an hour later she was on a greyhound bus heading towards arlington maddy realized shed forgotten how the lines were organized which ones went where and yet once upon a time she must have taken them everywhere to school back home into the city to meet friends from high school im nineteen and im already going freakin senile how come i cant remember which buses i used to take she wondered whether a new bus service had taken over here and perhaps that was why none of the numbers or routes made sense to her the bus passed a high school and she looked out on a football field several dozen young men lined up in their tracksuits donning shoulder pads and helmets preparing to practise a few set pieces some younger boys kicking a soccer ball around on another field maddy realized she couldnt even remember the name of her high school not even the name nor the names of any of her teachers or their faces god nor could she even recall any of her friends i had some friends right at least one friend surely but none came to mind not a single one she felt the first stirring of panic set in i really am losing my mind she could guess what this was this was that damned archway field the time bubble those freakin particles killing her mind one brain cell at a time shed just now joked about going senile but maybe that was just it sitting in that brick dungeon all these months was gradually memory by memory wiping her mind clean she was suddenly grateful to be out of there ok they were on the run but at least they were free from the everpresent corrosive effect of that technology and grateful so grateful that she still had enough of her mind and memories left intact to at least find her way home the greyhound dropped her off outside a small eleven store she smiled her mind remembered that all right the first familiar sight so far it was the only convenience store around for miles the rest of this suburb was endless loops of road flanked on either side by welltended lawns and picket fences long paved and brown asphalt driveways leading up to grandlooking whitecollar homes she passed the store and second on her right silverdale crescent lined with mature maple trees their leaves beginning to turn golden for the autumn not quite ready to fall she stepped aside for a couple of boys riding their bikes along the pavement talking to each other about an upcoming game console called the xbox that was due to be released this thanksgiving maddy felt an overpowering urge to run the last hundred yards home this was her street the place where all of her childhood years had been spent this was where her life had once made sense when it was simple and stress free decisions no more demanding than which cartoon channel to watch which flavour ice cream to eat across the road a bed of flowers sweet carolines glowed in shafts of warm sunlight tidy rows of purples and creamy pinks a chestnutcoloured labrador on a long leash followed an old lady wearing gardening gloves and holding a shopping list in one hand she heard the soft boom of rock music and a ford zodiac pulled up a long driveway it was painted with skulls and flaming guitars a young lad with long hair got out a guitar case over his shoulder and a small practice amp in one hand band rehearsal she smiled even only days after life was still going on for everyone the bad guys hadnt won america hadnt ground to a halt kids were still taking their guitars and doing band practice and god it felt so good to be coming home maddy tried to remember the last time shed been back home to see mom and dad because since shed left home to work for that software games company shed been living in once again her mind was letting her down oh come on girl she chided herself shed been living where where she stopped nothing was coming she couldnt even remember where in new york shed been staying or was it new jersey and yet shed been on a damned plane when foster had saved her where the hell was she going was she going home for a visit it mustve been home for thanksgiving or easter or christmas or something but home from where exactly her confusion was brushed to one side as she caught a glimpse of the family house up ahead home unmistakably home there it was unchanged in all these years a large family home built in a mock antebellum style covered porch along the front shingle tiles and white painted supports she turned up the empty drive dad was probably still at work and mom always parked her car in the carport did she actually do that did she was that a memory maddy had the distinct impression shed just made that bit up like someone joining the dots on a childs puzzle filling in gaps with whatever seemed to fit just to hurry up and finish the picture off damned if it was a hundred per cent right or not she noticed the bedroom window above the carport was open and a gentle warm afternoon breeze was teasing a pink curtain in and out her bedroom now that she was certain of the front room above the carport that was hers all right but a pink curtain i never liked pink did i she shrugged shed still been a bit girly at age nine torn between being like all the other girls or being a tomboy maybe the pink curtain was a phase in her younger life shed chosen to blot out to not remember a phase where shed made a halfhearted attempt to appear feminine beyond that curtain inside the room she was pretty sure it was all star wars action figures and comic books warhammer figurines and models of tanks and guns the window being open meant one thing i must be at home maddy stopped before the whitewashed steps leading up to the front door im at home im in this house somewhere me im home from school of course she was it was after three its me in there me aged nine she felt an overpowering rush of emotion it was going to be so strange meeting herself like looking in a peculiar mirror that could filter away years allow her to look back through ten years of time and see herself with braces still welded to her teeth and that always impossible hair of hers dragged into submission by a brush and pulled tightly into two bobbing goldilocks ponytails she was trembling it was going to be impossibly weird and what the hell do i say she muttered she took the steps up to the porch slowly there was the garden gnome with a chainsaw her idea of a joke present for mom who just hated gardening and could quite happily have taken a chainsaw to all the delicately trimmed bushes up and down silverdale crescent and there across the porch was the rockingchair she smiled at the memory of the thing dads favourite chair where he spent summer evenings smoking a long clay pipe and rocking back and forth again she had the distinct impression that she was inking in details filling in gaps in her mind with memories that seemed appropriate most likely she was creating mental images to fill her blank memory worse still she suddenly realized she was borrowing images scenes from old movies from old tv shows why the hell was she seeing dad with long white whiskers wearing worn old dungarees and a battered straw hat thats not right thats the waltons she whispered it had been on tv back in the motel room some old rerun of the waltons on cable and now her mind was taking bits of that old show and superimposing it on her scant childhood memories filling in filling in the front door now dammit she remembered this for sure reassuring a genuine memory this time mint green with that brass knocker how many times had she closed that behind her or watched her mother fumble with shopping bags to find her keys to open it she reached for the knocker and hesitated what the crud was she going to say to mom how was she going to explain who she was it was going to be difficult mom was in there somewhere probably glued to the tv on the breakfast bar in the kitchen still watching the news on fox perhaps still crying for her poor older sister whod lost a wonderful son in that pile of stillsmouldering rubble and maddy could imagine herself up in her bedroom painting her warhammer figures keeping her mind occupied not wanting to think about the fact that julian was gone for good not wanting to pester mom with difficult questions right now this was going to be awkward she grabbed the knocker and tapped it firmly against the door hi mom can you guess who i am no that wouldnt do hi i have something really important to tell you can i come in no that made her sound like a goddamn jehovahs witness mom its me maddy ive come from nine years in the future she heard footsteps inside the squeak of trainers on parquet floor then the rattle and clack of the latch and the door opened yeah a girl about the age she was expecting blonde she was wearing a spice girls tshirt and pink jeans with a glitter pattern down one leg and floral pumps god is that really me it cant be yeah said the girl again with an impatient shrug help you maddy was tonguetied i uh you want to speak to my mom maddy nodded mutely mom called out the girl its for youhoo who is it a womans voice from somewhere in the back the girl made a wearisome face mom says who is it maddy felt her resolve beginning to fail her she wanted to mumble something like i guess i got the wrong house sorry about that turn around and walk away but she couldnt walk away not now she was past that point over it she was here shed already knocked and waited and now the door was open and she was just seconds away from speaking to mom too late to run she was here now and she really needed mom and dads help it was now or never maddy hunkered down a little to the girls level hi she said my names maddy just like yours the girl looked at her sideways uh no it aint nadine called the voice from the back who is it your names nadine uh yeah that flummoxed her nadine she wasnt expecting that since when she shrugged like since birth chapter wg systems research campus near pinedale wyoming waldstein stared at it there it was behind the darkened glass in a carefully controlled and monitored sealed envelope of cool air a sheet of brittle and ageyellowed newspaper a page of classified ads columns of messages from the hopeless the lonely the bereft the bewildered an ad from someone whod lost a muchloved bulldog answering to the name of roosevelt and was offering a reward of for him some old soldier looking for a fellow platoon member he served alongside during the normandy landings and someone else looking for a missing daughter who might just be living in the brooklyn area there an ad from a very lonely widower looking for someone else to share his suddenly empty life with searching for a friend who might enjoy trips to the theatre watching matinees of old bette davis movies this page of forlorn little classified ads was a perfectly preserved record of one days worth of misery in brooklyn in the year a record of incomplete lives and broken hearts of final words that should have been said face to face but never were waldsteins heart ached every time he studied this withered page of newspaper there were words he wished hed said to his wife eleanor and his son gabriel words that hed always felt foolish saying out loud rather preferring to assume the pair of them knew he loved them very much to save him saying such things words that hed sell his very soul to be able to say to them one last time now words beneath that lightfiltering glass a uv light glowed softly on the page and a digital camera with an ultralow lightsensitive lens and an infrared sensor closely monitored one particular personal ad there it was halfway down the third column one rather innocuous little paragraph of faint slightly smudged newsprint the letters in that paragraph quite often flickered in a faint spectral way just enough that if you werent looking directly at them your peripheral vision might just catch the subtlest sense of movement a square inch of newspaper that undulated shifted stirred every now and then as if a small ghost lived in the very fibre of the newspaper itself it was a square inch of reality in permanent flux the tiniest portion of the world caught in a perpetual state of undulating change trapped in the eddies and currents of its own mini time wave today though it seemed particularly agitated letters fidgeted blurred changed as if it very much had something it wanted to tell waldstein the infrared sensor was picking up a temperature shift off the brittle old paper that was a whole tenth of a degree higher than normal the minutest leakage of energy through the tiniest crack in spacetime it wants to talk to me he studied the data monitor beside the glass case watched the temperature readout twitch and shuffle and occasionally spike beside it the lowlight image of the printed letters shimmered and danced like ghouls in a graveyard caught only in glimpses of flitting moonlight waldstein suspected the newly grown birthed and trained team were struggling to find their feet that poor old wretch not liam now hed chosen the name foster instead so much rested on his shoulders and hed been through so much recently to have lost his friends in such a horrific way then to have also been through the appalling torment of being suddenly prematurely aged and then after all of that after sending his plea for help through time to the future to hear back from his creator and learn that he was somewhat less than human worse still that he was going to have to fix things up again entirely on his own to be the fatherlike mentor for a new team so much too much to put on the poor thing waldsteins heart ached for him that poor wretch liam now foster was entirely on his own effectively running this project himself hed had to set up a replacement team to mentor them train and ready them for their respective roles all the while knowing exactly what they were and yet having to go along with this appalling deceit to lie to them now it seemed with these flickering letters on the page there was more bad news coming through from from foster the heat reading spiked again another tenth of a per cent of a degree its coming the letters shimmered and shuffled faintly and there it was ink on paper no longer shimmering with a desire to change there it was bad news experienced significant event origin timestamp of contamination major displacement effects problem narrowly but successfully averted new recruits performed well under stress one team member lost require new observer immediately foster joseph olivera looked up from his floating data screens they need a new a new observer joseph they need a new saleena vikram frasier griggs paled you mean send one back yes what happened mr waldstein asked joseph waldstein shook his head im not sure it seems like theyve had to deal with a major contamination originating from sometime during the second world war something big must have shaken things up for them waldstein smiled their first big test and it seems theyve saved mankind but one of thems dead said griggs indeed what about the others it seems theyre all right joseph waldstein touched a data pad and the air in front of him shimmered with holographic data he swept the data to one side with his finger and doubletapped a thumbnail image it expanded in front of them a digitized image of the page of newspaper hovering in midair you read it for yourself joseph and griggs leaned forward to scrutinize the image more closely they read it in silence he wont be able to grow one back there said waldstein the memory needs altering which is why well have to do it here and send her back joseph nodded waldstein was of course quite right the other two team members the maddy unit and the liam unit werent ready to know what they were if foster was sent a saleena vikram unit foetus and started growing it right there in the archway then the game would be up hed need to explain to the other two units exactly what they were clones all three of them were designed to work at their best believing themselves to be entirely human believing they had real life stories real loved ones real memories its what made their purely organic data matrices produce completely humanlevel decisions thats why joseph hated to call it organic artificial intelligence because it wasnt artificial intelligence it was authentic intelligence if their brains which were no different from any other human brains truly believed the store of memories in their minds to be genuine then as far as joseph was concerned they were real people just as real as anyone else more than mere genetically engineered replicas certainly so much more capable of strategic thought than the silicon minds inside the support units however the moment they realized their lives were fabricated a pack of installed lies the moment they understood they hadnt been born to loving mothers but instead had emerged fully grown from plastic tubes just like their support units that was when their decisionmaking would become compromised unreliable joseph start a growth here in the lab said waldstein then well have to send her back can you edit her memory to make that work she cant suspect shes a tubeproduct wait hang on a minute cut in griggs we said no more direct interactions waldstein waved a hand to silence him they need an observer joseph joseph nodded i can ssplice into her existing memory we have her lifestory file right up to the recruitment event he scratched his chin i suppose i can graft in some generalized memories of her living in the archway with the other two nothing too sspecific just the general impression that shes been living in close proximity to maddy and liam for some weeks itll be a little foggy for her foggy shed be a little disorientated like shes experienced a kind of mild amnesia a gap in her memory as if shes experienced a mild trauma concussion like a blow to the head therell be minor continuity errors she wont be able to make sense of but if we deploy her directly after a field refresh or a corrective time wave she and the others may attribute that foggy memory as some side effect of the realignment of the timeline he shrugged since theyre newly recruited i imagine theyll buy that explanation from foster theyll trust what he tells them waldstein nodded then we should do that he looked at joseph placed a hand on his shoulder be as careful as you can splicing in her memory that didnt need saying sal needed to wake up and find herself returning to the archway believing nothing more than some time wave must have caught her outside messed with her head in some small way if that didnt work if she started questioning her reality if the team figured out they were a bunch of enhanced support units meatbots then the whole project was over theyd have to start again from scratch delete the old ones and grow a brandnew team new minds new memories new lives ill be very careful mr waldstein trust me good griggs stepped forward and grabbed waldsteins arm roald this is really pushing our luck you know we broadcast our presence every time we open a portal you know there must be dozens of tachyonlistening stations all over the world christ it was your campaigning that made sure of that do you want to be discovered do you want that its an acceptable risk frasier no its not this whole project was always too risky we were supposed to travel only to to set it up and that was it no further trips its an acceptable risk he looked at griggs sternly then lowered his voice please dont push our friendship frasier this is more important than that more important than anything more important griggs laughed whats all this really about eh you know as well as i do threedimensional space is as precious as fine bone china you cant let time travel griggs spat a curse his eyes narrowed thats not what you really care about frasier you know what i think this is about vengeance bitterness you cant bring your wife and son back so you enough waldstein glared at griggs he pulled the man by his arm you and i need to talk frasier we need to talk right now joseph watched dumbstruck by the suddenly charged atmosphere in the room as both men stepped out of the lab into the small adjoining conference room the glass door hissed shut behind them and their voices became muted he saw griggss face darken with anger and he heard their muffled voices quiet at first but then quickly rising in volume and pitch getting louder and louder then finally that word pandora and why roald why do you want that to happen chapter september interstate newton massachusetts where did she go becks looked at him a growing expression of anxiety on her face maddy said she was going to get some supplies said she said so maybe she wasnt the support unit could only look at liam plaintively he grasped her slim arms firmly arms that easily could have shrugged off his grasp and twisted his head off his shoulders if she had the notion to do so becks come on wheres she really gone she said shes gone to her old home hasnt she becks looked conflicted torn between an instruction to lie and a logical imperative to speak the truth liam cursed i knew it that is an unwise action said bob his cool eyes looked around the others gathered in the girls motel room the pursuing support units may also attempt to travel to the same location i dont think we couldve stopped her said sal i think shes too close to home to not try to see them she really misses her family she looked down at her hands i know its what id want to do and i miss me own ma and da just as much said liam but bobs right thats a stupid thing shes gone an done i should have known shed do this what if theyre clever said rashim what if they dont attack her there but instead follow her back here exactly said liam she could lead them right to us all just then a key clicked and rattled in the motel rooms door all heads turned as the door opened and daylight stretched across the mottled pattern of the rooms threadbare carpet maddy perfect timing said liam we were wondering his voice tailed off she stood in the doorway staring back at all of them on any other occasion he would have expected her to do a doubletake at them all staring widemouthed at her and irritably snap whats up but instead she stepped slowly in kicking the door shut behind her she sat down on the end of the bed and stared listlessly at the blank glass screen of the tv set reflecting her own sullen expression back at her maddy said sal you ok no answer liam could see her eyes were redraw beneath her glasses her cheeks were wet she was crying he sat on the bed beside her maddy she appears to be distressed said bob liam waved him silent maddy is everything all right she shook her head silently liam didnt dare ask the next question but it needed asking all the same maddy your family are they all right theyre not hurt in any theyre not my family she muttered uh not my family she said again she turned from her dim reflection in the tv screen and they never were liam leaned in closely to her maddy what do you mean whats the matter hed never seen her like this before not even when things had seemed at their worst not even that first day when theyd all met in the darkness of the archway freshly plucked from the very last moments of their lives this wasnt normal maddy stressed irritated annoyed or frustrated this was a totally alien maddy carter utterly crushed defeated sal got up off the chair by the door and knelt on the floor in front of her she could see it in her face too this was maddy right at the end of her game she reached out for her hand and squeezed it tell us what happened i ive worked it out she said her voice a mucusthick whisper worked what out she looked at liam ive worked out who we are who we are he frowned confused or more to the point she added ive figured out what we are what we are liam turned to the others then back at maddy what in the name of jesus an mary are you talkin about shaddyah sal muttered under her breath liam looked at her the one eye of hers not hidden by her looping fringe had suddenly widened with realization she seemed to have some inkling of what maddy was talking about what sal whats she mean by that were not who we thought we were liam said maddy not who we his brows locked whats that supposed to mean your life is just a lie liam a story said maddy fiction maddy what happened asked sal maddy laughed more a wet snort of snot mixed with tears they obviously didnt expect wed come looking for the truth why would they she took her glasses off and wiped at her eyes i mean foster made such a big thing of it didnt he that we should be dead already that this extra life was like a bonus or something a gift liam nodded of course he had the old man made no bones about that thered been a choice right at the end of their old lives not much of a choice admittedly but a choice nonetheless he could have gone down with the titanic if hed wanted but hed chosen to join foster we all chose it maddy said liam right at the end when he saved us all she laughed a miserable choking sound she shook her head but thats the point we didnt didnt liam hadnt a clue what she was talking about yes i did i chose to no no you didnt said sal quietly nodding she understood now or me i didnt either her one visible eye was beginning to spill glistening tears on to her dark cheek ah jayzus you crying too whats up with you both whyre you crying what is goin on here none of us chose to join this agency in the last moments of our lives liam said maddy because none of that ever happened sals head dropped her face dipped out of sight he could see her shoulders heaving gently he looked around the only other person here who seemed utterly bewildered by all of this was rashim he offered liam a sympathetic shrug that seemed to say i got no idea what theyre talking about either our memories liam everything we thought were memories of our lives before the archway before we were recruited maddys chin dimpled as fresh tears streamed down her face everything my home my mom my dad my school my job theyre all lies theyre phoney information memory implants even bob seemed to have an understanding of what she was saying now maddy nodded faked memories our lives are just made up i never lived in boston sal never lived in india and you her voice faltered oh liam you never came from ireland but liam bit his lip but im from cork i know i am im thats what kind of nonsense do you think youre we didnt come from those places we never lived there we never even set foot in any of those places whuh i get it sals soft voice drifted up through the drooping curtain of her hair we came right out of three giant testtubes maddy nodded she reached out and rested a hand on sals shoulder a reciprocated gesture of comfort do you get it liam do you see said sal were support units chapter wg systems research campus near pinedale wyoming can i trust you joseph joseph olivera lurched that question came right out of nowhere and caught him entirely off guard waldstein was standing beside him in the lab seemingly emerging from thin air whwhat yes of of course mr waldstein a long uncomfortable moment im so very sorry about what happened to frasier he was the closest thing to a friend i have he shrugged had he sighed god ive known him for nearly ten years joseph swallowed compulsively he had the suspicion that an aura of guilt was glowing around him a scintillating sparkle of betrayal giving away his secret intentions to waldsteins deep penetrative gaze the argument the other day im sorry you had to see that that was unfortunate i wish frasier and i hadnt fought like that i waldstein looked away and i truly wish that hadnt been the last time we spoke yes sir but he had doubts joseph doubts about this project even if that awful attack on the road hadnt happened to him he would have had to leave us joseph nodded you know ive been thinking it would be a sensible precaution to deposit some more pregrowth embryos back in the san francisco drop point waldstein nodded to himself yes we should arrange that as soon as is possible get some ready to transport go back there again are you sure i know joseph its risky but i suspect theyre going to get through more support units than i originally anticipated you know when we were setting up the team i was half convinced theyd never actually be needed that theyd be just sitting there kicking their heels that i was overreacting being paranoid worrying too much about other time travellers out there wanting to destabilize our timeline he shook his head i realize now maybe i wasnt paranoid enough yes sir joseph checked their inventory on the holoscreen in front of him there were two dozen embryos on ice part of the batch being readied for the us militarys fieldtesting programme how many would you want me to prepare lets give them half a dozen maybe send them some of both types of hybrid the heavyduty model and the female recon model might as well give them a few of each listed on the screen were the other clones who were nothing at all to do with the us military what about the pureclone models the madelaines liams the saleenas waldstein gave it a moments thought no if we send back pregrowths of themselves theyll know what they are we were very lucky with that first team very lucky that the liam unit played along with us and kept the new team from finding out what they are its part of his programming hes loyal duty oriented thats his personality template but even with your programming joseph theyre not a hundred per cent reliable are they joseph shrugged they have the capacity for independent will thats what makes them better tactical decisionmakers i know but when alls said and done unlike the military hybrids those three are just like real people arent they theyre like real kids if they ever found out they were products good god who knows what theyd do waldstein sighed i do sometimes wonder if what weve done is a cruel thing created three children whoneverwere and then gave them this sort of burden if that was me he said smiling sadly if i discovered that was my lot i think i would almost certainly turn on my maker joseph nodded no theyll have to be on their own we cant send back pureclone embryos if it happens again if another one of them dies waldstein shrugged then im afraid theyll have to work around that problem he sighed theres only so much we can do for them yes sir so if you could organize that prep some embryos and ready them for transport yes of course waldstein looked out of the labs small window a long moment of deliberation before he finally spoke again and ill take them back myself but this has to be the last time we go back to assist them with supplies the last time i go back its getting too damned dangerous joseph looked at him perhaps what be very careful joseph pperhaps this project has already become too dangerous mr waldstein the old man stared at him for a moment joseph wondered what thoughts were thrashing around behind those intense eyes he struggled to keep his composure i i just wonder if things have become we dont have much of a choice in the matter this has to work you understand that dont you joseph could hardly meet his eyes but there are no buts joseph were the first and the last line of defence do you understand do you honestly think were the only people in the world right now with viable timetravel technology im not a fool yes theres a law now ila ruling a draconian law but im not naive enough to think there arent people out there quietly working on time travel all the same yes mr waldstein he leaned over and squeezed josephs shoulder affectionately youve seen for yourself what our team in the past have narrowly prevented joseph looked at the small window outside that window beyond the reach of their laboratory stasis field hed witnessed a time wave arrive and leave behind it an irradiated wasteland just for a few minutes it had been there a hellish landscape then washed away by another wave moments later i know this isnt an ideal world waldstein laughed drily at that understatement but there are an infinite number of possibilities far worse waldstein squeezed his shoulder again trust me just stay the course youre a good man joseph i know i can trust you i know that ththank you sir he got up off the stool and stepped away other matters appeared to be on his mind i have a damned meeting i need to attend in denver tomorrow wg systems investors some of our major clients i could do without that right now but he sighed its one i really do have to be at waldstein looked harried stretched like plastic wrap over the hard corners of a box pulled taut to the point of ripping i know things have been difficult recently joseph i i wish frasier was here with us still its well what happened to him was horrible i suppose its a sign of these awful times you know i sometimes think we deserve this hopeless world all our mistakes have finally come home to roost havent they joseph nodded and waldstein looked like his train of thought was heading off in some other direction just you and me running this project now yes mr waldstein we need to keep things going to keep things on track all the hard works been done now all we need to do now is just make sure our team can continue doing their job im sure theyll be fine back there he smiled theyre good kids im so proud of them and you too joseph theyre as much your creations as they are anyone elses thank you waldstein nodded and turned to go mr waldstein yes when will you want the embryos ready by he sucked in a breath i hate doing this you know having to step into that white mist knowing that its killing me cell by cell knowing that every time we open a goddamn portal were broadcasting our presence to those who might be looking for it that worries me too mr waldstein and this then will have to be the last time theyre on their own after this waldstein sighed have the embryos good to go for this evening will you lets get it done and out of the way he nodded to himself this evening i will have them ready thank you and after that hopefully the saleena unit will be ready to drop back in brooklyn shell need another thirteen hours i think to full growth then ill need a few hours to upload and configure her new memory fine as soon as shes ready get her sent back youll be ok doing that on your own of of course mr waldstein joseph tapped his hpad i have the insertion datastamp as we discussed outside the archway directly after the corrective wave i have it all ready waldstein nodded of course he sighed trying a weary moraleraising smile then thatll be all our messy housekeeping done back on an even keel as i think the saying goes joseph watched waldstein go then finally alone in the lab he took in a deep breath and let it out jesus he recalled a couple of things waldstein had said things that had echoed what griggs had been fixating on we deserve this hopeless world we need to keep things on track frasier griggs was right he was certain of it now quite certain that beneath his carefully orchestrated enigmatic composure withstanding his publicly declared ambition to save mankind from itself waldstein had quietly gone insane the man seemed utterly intent on steering the ship on to the rocks not away from them intent on steering mankind towards its own demise pandora joseph realized it was all down to one person himself griggs had been foolish and confronted waldstein directly now he was dead perhaps he could smuggle a warning to the team just something to alert them to whatever this pandora was that waldstein was attempting to preserve something discreet a note something its just me now ive got to do more than that he looked once again at the message from the past the liamnowfoster unit had ordered a replacement saleena like someone might dial up a pizza the unit did his job diligently loyally just like he was programmed to do saleena vikram olivera had an idea another way that he could attempt to derail this project something he could do something subtle enough that it could be sneaked past waldsteins everwatchful eyes a deliberate conspicuous continuity error in sals memory line enough of a jarring continuity error that shed end up picking at it like a scab worrying away at it until shed finally worked out what it meant now that was something waldstein might not spot some small additional memory embedded in her mind a detail not quite right a detail that was quite impossible to be true and it would trouble her make her question things hed been thinking about that last night as hed sat alone in this lab while trying to catch a few hours sleep on the metalframed cot in the corner while hed been watching her grow in the tube the faint outline of a childs body floating in a glowing amber soup then he had it it came to him a certain blue bear that he recalled seeing in the dusty window of an antique shop back in not too far from the archway as it happened close enough in fact that she was bound to stumble across it sooner or later see it with her own eyes and then wonder how it was possible that shed recall seeing it tumbling over and over in an inferno in mumbai in the year chapter september interstate newton massachusetts but thats completely bleedin crazy said liam youre saying what that im a a meatbot liam you me and sal were just weedier nerdier models of bob and becks said maddy with a bitter tone liam laughed a little maniacally aw come on thats a corker that is theres no way at all that im think about it liam think about it i dont need to think about im liam maddy got up and took a step forward i was never on an airplane from new york to boston a plane that supposedly blew up she said and you liam you were never on the titanic and sal was never living in in mumbai theyre all just madeup memories madeup liam frowned he had a mind full of memories his family and friends cork his school leaving home for liverpool because what he really always wanted to do was to work his way on to a boat and get to see the world but then crossexamining those memories and hed done that several times over the last few months thered always seemed to be troublesome gaps missing bits hed put that down to all that had happened to him recently a lifetimes worth of traumas and adventures that hed struggled to survive through over the last few months who wouldnt forget something like their mothers maiden name after all of that right but it was more than that wasnt it i can remember a whole life before this so i can a whole bleedin life yeah really aye liam nodded vigorously of course i can ok then so how did you get the job as a steward aboard the titanic there was a challenging tone in her voice a comeonthengenius tone it sounded almost spiteful well i liam shrugged expecting the memory to come along at his will but there was nothing nothing at all had he just walked aboard and asked for a job had it been that easy he reached further into his mind assuming hoping this was just a mental blip going blank because she was pressuring him goading him he tried to rewind his mind the night the ship went down the screaming the panic he recalled a gentleman calmly drinking cognac in the reading room preferring drunken oblivion to drowning soberly a girl left to die with him because she was in a wheelchair he recalled an hour earlier the ship jolting in the night crockery lurching off dining tables and smashing on the floor further still he recalled the day before a normal day as a ships steward the routine up at five cabinservice breakfasts for those that had ordered it cleaning the rooms during the morning filling in as a waiter for the midday meal and the evening meal then cabinservice teas and suppers served until ten in the evening then collapsing wearily into his bunk in a small cabin shared with three other men a typical stewards day then back further but nothing it was like the blackness after the end titles of a movie void white noise nothing i his mouth hung open until finally it snapped shut with a wet clup im so sorry liam whispered maddy so sorry no wait what about me parents my family i remember them go on then liam tell me about them me ma me da they were he closed his eyes but he could manage to conjure up only one decent mental image of them just one and that was a photograph just one faded sepiacoloured image what about your home you said it was cork wasnt it cork in ireland could he even recall whereabouts they lived in that city no not really he just knew the name he could conjure up no more than a couple of images of the place the docks st fin barres cathedral st patricks street and that was about it again almost as if they were mere photographs pulled from some photo archive somewhere ah jayzus he whispered its just the same for me said maddy softly she sat down beside him bits and pieces like somebody just googled up a whole bunch of pictures music films news clothes computer games tv shows from the year and made me out of all of that she wiped a tear off her cheek you know what my mind is its the search results you get back if you do a things you might find in the year search on whatever passes for the internet she shrugged from whatever frikkin year we actually come from do you think weve got computers in our heads too asked sal maybe ill stick my head in an xray machine sometime and find out maddy replied wiping a snotty nose she laughed maybe not last thing i want to know is that theres nothing in my skull but a rats brain linked to a sim card she looked apologetically at bob no offence bob shrugged i cannot be offended and the difference is that we can said maddy finding a hint of a smile so maybe were different somehow clones but maybe were more human or something sal nodded she was looking down at her hands in her lap i just i just cant believe we never worked this out i mean she looked up at them when we woke up in the archway how come none of us thought to ask why we didnt see a portal when we were recruited exactly maddy got to her feet so why didnt they put a portal memory into our heads why make that mistake perhaps rashim cut in clearing his throat perhaps they hadnt yet perfected the portal system while they were writing your memories the others looked at him accusingly thanks for your input human snapped sal he raised his hands apologetically just saying no maddy shook her head rashims right maybe thats why they he waldstein whoever made us was still putting it all together maybe they were doing it in a hurry i guess if we all think hard wed find other little errors in there my blue bear whispered sal to herself she addressed the others i remembered a bear a soft toy in mumbai but it was exactly the same bear in the window of that shop in brooklyn she shook her head someone someone who made us must have seen it in the window and thought it would make a nice little detail to put into my life her voice hitched nice touch she hissed the room was quiet for a while the three of them silently trawling through their minds sorting memories into piles of true and false sorting them into before and after their recruitment finally liam spoke i get it now he looked at bob arms crossed and eyes lost in the shadow of a neolithic brow and becks sitting beside him slight and wraithlike with wide vacant dumbanimal eyes meatbots eh bleedin marvellous chapter wg systems research campus near pinedale wyoming it was late in the day joseph olivera had decided to stay overnight on the grounds of the wg systems research compound to eat in the staff canteen and sleep in the cot in the adjoining office area the synthisoya gunk they served up in there almost tasted like real food better than the cartons of gunk he had in his apartments refrigerator anyway it was beginning to get dark outside and he didnt fancy taking his autodrive along the winding wooded road down to pinedale there were more and more vagrants drifting westward from the eastern states and he knew for certain many of them were camping out there in the woods hed heard some of the wg techies talking about several more roadside holdups in the last week in most cases it was just the desperate and hungry after a little money not exactly asking but in most cases the holdup ended as a palmtransaction of whatever digidollars you had on account and theyd let you pass through unharmed desperate times for some no desperate times for many he felt uncomfortable anyway leaving the lab hed set things in motion sown seeds as a lastminute thing hed ended up slipping a hastily scribbled note addressed to the maddy unit into the embryo box that waldstein had taken back to san francisco and now he was beginning to panic wondering whether hed been stupid there was no knowing for sure when or even if the team back in were going to discover the note whether they were going to question the base office if a message did come through from them through that scrap of old paper he wanted to intercept it before waldstein saw it it was a relief right now that the old man was away in denver on business olivera felt a mixture of guilt for betraying the man and a desperate fear of him griggs he still wasnt certain one way or the other about poor frasiers fate perhaps his paranoia was getting the better of him perhaps the poor fellow had just been unlucky the saleena unit had been inserted back in the past now and it wouldnt be long before her curious mind started picking away at the tiny new details edited into her consciousness between that bit of memory surgery and his handwritten note joseph felt hed done as much as he could to unbalance things those three young clones werent stupid far from it together they were going to figure this all out one way or the other eventually and now perhaps he needed to find a way out for himself handing in his notice wasnt exactly going to wash with waldstein as the man had told him once youre in joseph youre in do you understand perhaps he could plead mental exhaustion perhaps he could tell waldstein he was beginning to make mistakes and it might be best if he took some kind of sabbatical that sounded lame even before he tried saying it he was so busy trying to find some way of phrasing a way to ask waldstein to let him go that he failed to hear the soft scrape of a foot in the doorway olivera lurched suspiciously in his chair like some mischievous little boy caught with his fingers in a sweetie jar joseph it was waldstein olivera felt his heart pounding in his chest he hadnt been expecting the man to return this evening mr mr waldstein i i thought you were still in denver on business indeed waldsteins cool eyes remained on him olivera looked away found something for his fidgeting hands to fiddle with on his desk all all ssorted then the business not really no i had to come back here early oliver nodded oh the old man looked tired sad everything all right mr waldstein no joseph not all right no explanation just that olivera felt panic growing inside him he dared not say anything in case his stutter betrayed him i know said waldstein after several interminable seconds know uh know know what waldstein shook his head slowly the gesture very much like a fathers disappointment with an errant child i know youve been tampering with things olivera felt his stomach flop queasily ttamper youve edited the memories of saleena you added something to the unit that was sent back waldstein noticed the faintest involuntary flicker of reaction on josephs face yes joseph ive had the database tagged to alert me for updates to the source archive he spread his hands in a vaguely apologetic way after frasier let me down i figured it might be prudent to keep a closer eye on you also i i needed to just tidy up sssome continuity faults please joseph he said stepping into the lab and finding a seat to ease himself down into please dont lie to me im too tired for that now he sighed youve not been fixing memory mismatches youve added new content to her mind olivera couldnt help his jaw sagging perhaps that was less an admission of guilt than stuttering a denial at him why did you add the visual memory of a tumbling teddy bear to her recruitment memory joseph why waldsteins eyes narrowed what are you trying to tell her the bear olivera realized waldstein must have actually viewed the visual insert the image of the blue bear tumbling end over end almost defying gravity so very deliberately conspicuous the kind of visual image that would stick in a mind its a trigger memory isnt it olivera felt his cheeks burn with shame his face his demeanour his awkward shuffling were screaming his guilt out loud and of course waldstein knew what hed been up to anyway if not the precise reason why yes joseph said eventually joseph waldstein said softly talk to me why the trigger memory olivera looked up at him hed noticed the bear back in while he and frasier had been setting the field office up that curious antique shop not so far away had provided him with some of the props hed needed to validate their various recruitment memories the titanic stewards uniform had given him the idea of setting liams recruitment aboard that famous doomed ship a perfect recruitment fable thered been other things in various other shops that had helped him author appropriate life stories for each of them the dark hoody with splashes of neonorange hindigraffiti that tshirt with the intel logo real things that would exist with them as they woke up in the archway real tangible items that would help all three engineered units bond with their carefully scripted memories the bear adding that bear to the replacement saleena units memory was adding something that couldnt possibly be the same bear in both places brooklyn mumbai a clear unambiguous impossibility a trigger why joseph why olivera felt slightly emboldened his game was up no more lying somehow so very liberating let me ask you that ssir why waldstein frowned why what why do you want mankind to destroy itself what the hell are you talking about joseph i know i know about pandora the word caused waldstein to shift uneasily i know its ssome kind of codeword you have isnt it a codeword for the end of mankind the day the precise date we destroy ourselves thats it isnt it this has come from frasier hasnt it this is his nonsense isnt it pandora the end of the world thats what you ssaw isnt it what i saw there was something comforting about unburdening himself like this olivera realized he was already so far over a certain invisible line that there was nothing he could say that was going to make any difference now either he was going to be instantly dismissed from the project escorted out of the compound or or perhaps worse youre actually asking me what i saw back in waldstein eyed him cautiously is that what youre asking me what i saw that very first time olivera nodded hesitantly you you didnt go back in time did you you didnt go back to ssee your wife your sson waldstein shook his head slowly oh joseph please dont ask me what i saw you went forward you went forward in time you what he smiled i went forward in time to see if mankind makes it through these hard times to see if mankind is as stupid and selfdestructive as it appears to be olivera nodded and what all this he gestured at the small lab this project of ours the businesses ive built up the technology companies ive been acquiring buying the billions of dollars ive made all of this just to make sure it happens just to make certain mankind wipes itself out waldsteins voice rose in pitch a note of incredulity are you seriously suggesting all of that is so i can ensure the end of the road for mankind olivera nodded again oh joseph that look of disappointment on his face again he eased himself up off the seat you have no idea not even the slightest idea god help me im not trying to destroy us im trying to save us he sighed as he stepped back towards the labs doorway or at least save what i can of us what there is to save olivera had a sense that this was where their conversation met its logical conclusion no bartering no pretending no backout clause this was the place they were at mr waldstein what what happens now waldstein backed up several steps turned and said something softly to someone who must have been standing outside just out of sight whos mr waldsstein whos out there whore you talking to a tall muscular figure appeared behind the old man completely bald with the calm dispassionate face of a recently birthed support unit im so very sorry joseph waldstein looked back at him with sadness in his eyes im truly sorry that it has to be this way in a heartbeat he was certain of griggss fate murdered not by some gang of starving vagrants but by waldstein directly or indirectly the old man had made sure frasier griggs wasnt going to remain a dangerous loose end and now im dead he backed up a step past his own workstation to what used to be griggss workstation joseph said waldstein please dont make this harder than it has to be come here you you dont nneed to do this please you dont but heres the problem i cant trust you any more there was genuine sadness on waldsteins face do you see i couldnt trust frasier either and thats the important thing this is too important joseph more important than frasier than you than me even joseph eyed the holodisplay shimmering inches above the mess of griggss desk hed been looking through those folders of his excolleagues that hadnt been codelocked frasier had been recently pinholeviewing history one of his unofficial hobbies he rather liked to discreetly spy on favourite historical moments particularly civilwar history joseph had once caught him glimpsing the final moment of the battle of gettysburg as general picketts virginians had finally withered under the barrage of musket fire broke and routed then another time frasier had been listening to abraham lincoln give his famous gettysburg address tell me pleaded joseph whats so important tell me waldstein sighed if that i could joseph if only i could joseph shot another glance at the display the pinholeviewer interface was in standby mode as griggs had left it last time hed used it the displacement machine was fully charged after having sent back the saleena unit good to go ready to dispense its stored energy he just needed to open the interface dilate the pinhole three feet four feet thats all it would be enough wwhy ccant you tell me mr mr waldstein maybe mmaybe if you explained explain pandora to you explain why mankind has to wipe himself out waldstein smiled sadly i explain that to you and what all of a sudden ill be able to trust you unreservedly joseph nodded perhaps too eagerly his mind was on something else though calculating escape im sorry joseph what has to happen is my burden my burden alone and ill burn in hell forever for what i know has to be done the old man looked like he was crying good god joseph you dont want to know whats in my head trust me three feet just about wide enough for him to dive through but but he had no idea what timestamp if any was already set in the location buffer he looked up at the support unit still standing obediently just behind waldstein on a word of command it could be across the small lab in seconds not enough time for him to pick out and tap the coordinates for a safe densityverified location oh god help me if nothing was in the entry buffer hed end up in chaos space that horrific nothingness a swiftly crushed neck at the hands of the unit standing behind waldstein would be infinitely preferable surely it all has to end joseph in that way pandora only then will they let it happen they let what what hhappen who who are you talking about im sorry joseph the time for talking is over he turned to the support unit and nodded the support unit pushed past waldstein strode round a table cluttered with josephs mindmap charts and printouts of genememory data templates not daring to think what horror awaited him if the timestamp entry buffer was empty josephs finger hovered over the commit touch button on the holodisplay a warning flashed on the screen that a pinhole was now activated the air near him pulsated subtly it was there but so small it was invisible on the lab floor yellow and black chevron tape marked out a safety square a place not to enter while a pinhole was active walking through a pinhole would be like being shot by a highcalibre round a tangent carved through the body and sent elsewhere no different to the path of a speeding bullet blasting a hole right through a body and depositing what it had eviscerated out the other side my god waldsteins eyes widened as he understood what joseph intended to do dont do it joseph tapped a command in an instruction to widen the pinhole the support unit picked up on the urgency in waldsteins voice and leaped towards joseph the pinhole instantaneously inflated from apparently nothing to a shimmering floating orb a yard wide joseph turned towards it time enough in the half second left to see that the churning oily display was showing something more than featureless white it was showing somewhere somewhere not chaos space good enough he instinctively cradled his head and dived into the shimmering orb tucking his legs up his elbows in to be sure he left none of them behind in the last moment before entering it he was screaming a wail of panic a long strangled bellow of defiance and fear most definitely fear this is insane as his head entered that swirling escape window a window that could mean safety or death in any number of unpleasant ways he thought he could make out the shape of horses a wagon barrels at least it wasnt all white right at least there was that chapter september arlington massachusetts rosalin kellerman stared at the man in a smart business suit standing on her doorstep and a woman beside him a striking young woman with startling grey eyes wide and intense wearing a loose gentlemans checked shirt several sizes too big for her but tucked into tightly fitting jeans athletic but striking in that her head was shaved almost down to the skin and yet somehow she was still quite beautiful just like that irish rock singersongwriter from the eighties what was her name sinead something or other this is number he asked again rosalin shrugged and pointed at the brass number plaque on her green door uh well theres the number right there see it and this is your residence asked the man rosalin narrowed her eyes this was already becoming a peculiar encounter and not the first one shed had in the last few days have you received a visit from a stranger recently the man seemed to immediately realize that was a stupidly vague question he pulled something out of his jacket pocket a photograph held it up so she could see it a visit from this person rosalin recognized the face the ovalshaped chin the glasses the frizzy strawberryblonde hair oh yeah she remembered this girl all right you mind telling me what the hell this is all about the man smiled youve seen her havent you yeah she came knocking a couple of days ago rosalin shook her head crazy i was pretty stupid i really shouldnt have let her in you spoke with her asked the intense young woman in the checked shirt you kidding rosalin snorted a laugh i couldnt get a word in mom rosalin heard the alarm in her daughters voice and put down the tray of cakes on the counter vaguely aware that the ovenhot tray was going to leave marks on the formica but nadines shrill cry sounded unsettling she stepped into the hallway to see that a girl a teenager pale and scruffy had pushed her way into the house past her daughter nadine what the hell do you think youre doing this is my my home cried the girl oh my god maybe shes a drug addict maybe shes after money get out get out of my house right now or ill call the police the girl ignored her turned to the left and took the stairs up to the landing three at a time hey called rosalin after her get back down here no answer out get out of my house nadine was looking frightened mom who is she its all right honey you stay down here she started up the stairs after the teenager mom dont go up there please its all right honey you stay down here the young woman no not a woman a kid still really didnt look dangerous as such just confused and frightened stay down there nadine ill just go up and speak to her at the top of the stairs she could hear the teenager had gone into nadines bedroom she could hear movement from in there movement and now what was that sobbing she approached the open door spilling afternoon light out from nadines room across the hallway carpet and there sitting on the end of her bed was the teenager rocking gently her face buried in her hands all of a sudden bellowing at this kid to get out before she set the cops on her seemed like overkill she clearly wasnt a danger to anyone she certainly didnt need to be cuffed like a gangster and roughhandled into the back of a squad car hello rosalin said softly can i help you that had happened two days ago now rosalin looked at the smart young man and the striking shavenheaded woman sitting side by side on her couch the young man had shown her an fbi pass and said his name was agent cooper the young woman hed introduced as agent faith a cafetiere was steaming on the coffee table in front of them untouched rosalin had no idea why shed offered them coffee maybe she was just as curious about that poor girl as they were and what did she tell you asked agent faith all sorts of crazy nonsense really i thought she was drunk or on drugs or something what specifically did she tell you asked agent cooper rosalin preferred him asking at least he smiled kindly the woman on the other hand agent faith was like a goddamned robot face like an emotionless psychopath she said some crazy things like she was from the future that shed died in a plane crash or something in but someone saved her from the plane saved her she said the plane was in midair she said she was beamed out beamed out cooper laughed politely what like star trek beamed out i dont know what she meant exactly it wasnt making much sense to me rosalin shrugged thats when i figured she wasnt a druggy but maybe some sort of sick person you know on medication or something indeed she said she got beamed back from the future from to now and was working for some sort of time police trying to stop people from the future time travelling rosalin laughed selfconsciously it was the kind of makebelieve game her youngest son played with his friends tearing round the kitchen with plastic laser guns and making whoopwhoop noises the girl is deluded said agent faith none of this is correct sure of course rosalin nodded but but what asked agent cooper but she was saying things that sounded so she shrugged convincing i guess cooper sat forward such as well lets see rosalin narrowed her eyes oh yeah she said that well be going to war with iraq again and after that with some other country called afganistanizan or something she said some other weird things cant remember them though just odd stuff rosalin shook her head as that girl had sobbed and told her story shed almost found herself believing some of it did she explain why she came to your house asked cooper oh yes yes that was the strangest thing of all she said she had memories of living here in this house i mean living here right now in that shed lived here as a girl with her mom and dad that she remembered the house looking very different on the inside and but shes never in fact lived here rosalin shook her head no weve been living here since before nadine was born since and this girl is in no way related to you no look of course not ive never seen her before rosalin looked at the coffee it wasnt going to get drunk i told her that told her that weve been living here for more than ten years thats when she went funny funny rosalin recalled the girl had abruptly stopped midsentence as if something in her mind had suddenly snapped discovered a hidden touchstone of truth she just got up and left walked out of the house sort of in a trance or something and shes not been back since no like i said that was a couple of days ago agent cooper nodded and offered her another charming smile well mrs kellerman thank you for talking to us he shrugged apologetically as he stood up and for the coffee im sure it was very nice coffee the woman followed her colleagues lead and both agents headed towards the hallway and the front door but one thing i dont understand said rosalin why are the fbi after her i mean you know if shes just some kid who needs help agent cooper shrugged that question away but his female partner stopped dead see im well ive got a journalist coming over later today continued rosalin i called the national enquirer she bit her lip slightly embarrassed i know its a stupid newspaper they run stupid myuncleisanalienfrommars stories but they pay pretty well for them agent faith turned to look at her you will be telling this story to a newspaper rosalin nodded guiltily is that uh you know a problem faiths movement was little more than a blur the dull crack of a single gunshot was reverberating around the homes hallway before agent cooper fully realized shed reached under his jacket and wrenched out his standardissue firearm and used it mrs kellerman was dead before her legs buckled and she dropped to the floor blood trickled from a tidy dark hole between her carefully plucked eyebrows and pooled on the waxed wooden parquet slats beneath her head jesus what she was a contamination risk cooper realized he was trembling you cant you cant just go and shoot my primary mission parameter is to eliminate the agency team my secondary mission parameter is to ensure no significant timecontamination events occur she handed the gun back to him thank you for the use of your weapon agent cooper chapter september interstate newton massachusetts so thats what we all are machines meat robots just like bob and becks everything me maddy and liam remember from before arriving in that archway is just a dream not even that just faked memories im not saleena vikram im not from im not from india i dont have parents im a meat product sal wondered why she was even bothering to write in her diary shed started out writing in it because she thought it would help her keep her sanity but why bother now when her mind wasnt even hers anyway it was the product of some technician or team of technicians a faked backstory an amalgam of images im even beginning to wonder if some or all of the stuff that happened to us since we became timeriders is faked memories too i mean how do i know for sure maybe we never had a german new york or that nuclear wasteland maybe those dinosaur things never broke into the archway maybe i never met abraham lincoln maybe someone invented those stories another slightly more comforting thought occurred to her maybe there never was a pitiful eugenic creature called sam massacred along with several dozen others before her very eyes somehow that seemed a small kindness a teaspoon of comfort in an ocean of cruel that blue bear i think i get it now somebody put that into my memory by mistake i wasnt meant to see it in that brooklyn shop because how could it also be in india twentyfive years from now someone messed up made a mistake all this time these weeks ive been wondering about whether that bear meant something special whether it was important and guess what it was just someones dumb mistake she shook her head jahulla no one was going to hear her standing in this place alone watching the endless traffic pass beneath her the overpass ran across six lanes of interstate traffic cars trucks buses a constant stream of onoffon red braking lights on the right and glaring headlights on the left some so bright they cast stars and streaks across her tearwet eyes a stream of traffic in the early evening all of them on their way to or from meaningful appointments running errands returning from work going shopping routine events life dull maybe but at least it was real life she looked down at the dogeared notebook resting on the pedestrian railing dozens and dozens of pages of her small handwriting scribbles and sketches shed made of the team the page corners flickered and lifted teased by a gentle breeze and by the clinical cyan light of one of the overpasss fizzing street lights she studied one particular sketch a drawing shed made of liam playing chess with bob the pair of them hunkered over a chessboard placed on a packing crate table in the narrow space between the bunk beds is that real did that really happen she remembered it all right remembered that liam got fed up with being beaten by bob over and over and had finally cursed in irish and wandered over to play on the nintendo machine instead but how much of that was real how much if at all could she trust the memory she turned a page there was a sketch of one of those lizardsapiens the bipedal descendants of a dinosaur species that should never have survived and did that happen she was almost certain it had in fact she was pretty certain that everything shed recorded in this notebook must be real it was surely the things that had occurred before these memories on paper everything that had occurred before shed awoken in that archway all of those things they were the lie sal looked down at the notebook in front of her the pages flapping loosely shed been considering tossing it over the handrail perhaps it would land on the flat open bed of a lorry or rubbish truck to be carried away to some distant landfill site and buried forever but then she realized this book of scruffy lined pages full of untidy scrawls was all that was keeping her rooted to sanity in a way this paper and ink was her mind her real mind it was all that she had all that she really owned it was everything that made her her it was all that she could trust i love you notebook she wrote that at the bottom of one page you are me she wrote that then drew a box around the last three words as if it might protect that single thought for all eternity a little blue biroink force field liam flicked through channels absently he lay on his motel room bed and was steadfastly working his way through a packet of oreos is this it then said rashim hed been in the motorhome for most of this afternoon picking through the critical circuit boards pulled from the displacement machine and with spongebubbas help working his way through the terabytes of data stored on the hard drives that had been pulled out of the networked computers thanks to that process he had a much clearer idea of the ordeal these three teenagers had been through over the last few months of their lives and now had a fair idea of how their little agency worked together to preserve history he was making notes scribbling away on a pad of foolscap he didnt even look up as he spoke is this the plan we stay in these rooms until what the end of time liam shrugged he didnt know what happened next the last two days had been a strange disembodied experience hed been lost in his own thoughts eaten once or twice maybe and he couldnt remember what he vaguely recalled taking a long walk hours and hours alongside a busy highway then finally coming to a halt turning round and walking back the way hed come theres no more money said rashim we will have to leave here soon anyway liam flicked through channels hardly hearing the man talk sal hed hardly seen her all day and maddy not since last night the team was no more broken into shards just three lost individuals three young adults lost in their own troubled clouds of thought his mind kept playing the last thing he remembered from his supposed old life that passageway down on deck e of the titanic rapidly filling up with freezing cold seawater being certain that the rest of his life was going to be measured in mere seconds and then foster his older self like some benign bigger brother a kindly uncle offering a hand to him offering him a choice offering him a way out all of that was a faked memory a montage of images he even thought he recognized where some of the visual elements of his memory had come from now hed seen a film with the girls on one of those silvery discs a film about the titanic in fact it was simply called titanic thered been some boyish man called leonardo somethingorother playing the hero and yes some of the images had been almost a perfect match to parts of his hazy memory it was as if a patchwork quilt had been made from that film and others from eyewitness accounts from historical records and encyclopaedia articles and dumped into his head with some crude adjustments to make him the star of that film and not that leonardo fellow im not even irish he sighed and yet if hed said that aloud it would have been with an irish accent he wished foster was still alive the old man must have experienced this moment himself at some point in the past perhaps while working with the team before them he must have found out what he was that he wasnt a lad called liam oconnor and yet hed pulled through hadnt he hed survived that appalling moment of truth and moved on from it accepted it and hed changed his name it made sense he couldnt still be called liam and recruit the new liam it would be too much of a clue a giveaway to the truth hed even managed to change his accent jayzus rashim looked up from his notes whats up liam shook his head nothing i was just his voice trailed away into silence foster had still believed in the job even though he knew hed been lied to set up manipulated exploited by this agency he still believed the job needed doing what was that programmed loyalty was that it had the mysterious mr waldstein written into his mind a mission priority that even if he was to discover that he was a meatbot and that hed been lied to and exploited his first instinct would always be to continue doing the job just like bob just like becks both of them standing outside in the car park keeping an eye out for maddy duty first always the door handle rattled and the door opened spilling sickly green light from the motels glowing vacant sign outside across the rooms mottled carpet bobs wide frame filled the doorway speak of the devil she is back he rumbled he stepped aside and maddy appeared in the doorway she waved limply hey liam hey she turned to becks standing outside go next door and wake up sal affirmative to liams eyes she seemed a little more alert than when hed last seen her if he hadnt been so lost in his own selfpity last night he might have been worried about her state of mind worried that she hadnt come back worried shed gone and done something silly you ok mads whereve you been getting my head straight he heard the door in the next room snick shut and sal appeared beside maddy blearyeyed looking as if shed just been roused from sleep were leaving said maddy leaving weve had a couple of days of freakin navelgazing feeling sorry for ourselves she pushed a frizzy spiral of hair away from her face ok so were clones were meatbots she shrugged her shoulders i dunno maybe when weve got ourselves sorted one of us should stick our heads in an xray machine and see if weve got frikkin microchips inside us like bob and becks but thats thats for another time i guess liam grimaced remembering hacking open bobs skull months ago in order to pull out that tiny shard of silicon in there yeah i know not exactly a nice thought said maddy well like i say maybe its on the to do list or maybe i just dont wanna know but right now i say were done with the sulking ok thats enough selfpity we need to sort ourselves out get things up and running again chapter september interstate newton massachusetts sals bleary eyes widened were carrying on damn right we are maddy ushered sal and becks inside the motel room and closed the door after them not that there was anyone out there in the car park to eavesdrop a row of empty chalets and a gravel lot with only their winnebago superchief parked in the middle all the same if its just us keeping history on track and no one else she scratched the back of her head then weve got to keep it up weve got no choice but we do have a choice said sal we dont have to get involved any more aye liam nodded let it all go to hell as far as im concerned if thats the way history wants to take itself then stuff it let it dammit liam snapped maddy this is serious and i am being serious he sat up on his bed i im not sure i care any more he got up took a challenging step towards maddy this isnt our world do you not see that we dont have families to worry about friends loved ones none of us have ever had any of that just memories of someone elses families so honesttogod he said shrugging what do i care if a time wave rubs out this whole world ireland cork and everyone i was supposed to know living there sal nodded hes right maddy we are nothing we have nothing no like descendants no ancestors no family tree nothing a faint and weary smile stole across her lips as if something had finally made sense to her i suppose thats why weve always been sort of unaffected by the waves weve been through because none of you are of this timeline none of you belong in this timeline rashim stroked the tip of his nose thinking aloud all three of you are an artificial intrusion not susceptible to any causeeffect cycle he nodded satisfied with his train of thought that would explain how you were never changed by time waves yeah i spose thats what i mean sal added we dont belong so we dont get changed liam wasnt so interested in that maddy why should i care huh he shrugged time waves as far as im concerned theyre now someone elses problem so they are he laughed humourlessly jayzus i dont even know why i speak this way this accent ive never even been to ireland maddy had had enough she reached out and grabbed a fistful of his shirt liam you bubblehead you dont need to have been to ireland to be you dont you see that she turned to sal both of you me too were who we are because of these memories thats the same for everyone memories define every person on this planet she had a silent audience but no one seemed to know where she was taking this were defined by our memories were the product of our memories thats it she glanced at both support units living proof of that both of them so much more than the emotionless automatons that had slid out of their growtubes on to the floor so who freakin well cares if the bag of memories in our heads are ours or someone elses were here in this place right now together and were making our own decisions and goddammit that makes us real not all of your memories are false added becks to the long silence maddy looked at the small frame of the support unit beside her youre right she turned back to the others particularly liam and sal she let go of his shirt weve been real people since we woke up together all those months ago real people she patted down his puffedup shirt gently apologetically real people she smiled at them both real friends she grasped his arm affectionately real family sal nodded silently maddy thought she caught a glint of the green of the neon sign outside reflected in her eyes the glint of a tear perhaps we need to continue doing the job guys come on weve seen some of the horrific results time travel can produce i dont suppose weve even seen the worst it can do not yet liam gazed thoughtfully out of the window sal too i hated how those poor eugenic creatures were treated maddy nodded and we made that nightmare world not happen the tv still burbled quietly in the corner of the motel room i dont see weve got much of a choice said maddy we have to carry on no one else is doing it and someone has to grab the wheel right someone needs to be holding the goddamn steering wheel or this world crashes and burns she winced a little at her metaphor it sounded like typical hollywood shtick but whatever the point was valid we need to continue doing this job but this time lets do it for ourselves not for she made air quotes with her fingers the agency not for waldstein but for ourselves we decide if and when history needs fixing you mean liam frowned you mean if a better timeline comes along maddy knew what he was suggesting yeah if it looks like a happier shinier funkier world she said with a shrug why not well decide ourselves if intervention is required she noticed bob stirring bob that contradicts a primary protocol remember what foster said added sal for good or bad history has to go a certain way aye he did that has to go a certain way huh maddy turned to rashim and just remind us how history goes dr anwar he grinned edgily as all eyes rested on him i i uh dont really think i should be involved with this argument tell them well you know already the worlds not too good actually a systemic collapse of right we heat the world until the ice caps melt and about a third of the land is flooded then we poison whats left of the world with chemicals until theres no ecosystem left thats worth a damn then not happy with all of that we decide to wipe ourselves out with some kind of von neumann virus that leaves nothing left alive that about right rashim they were calling the virus kosongni thats where it started ground zero rashim nodded thats a somewhat simplified version of events but essentially yes thats it and thats what foster she splayed her hands thats what waldstein wants us to do our very best to preserve anyone here think that might be just a little freakin stupid to be fair said liam foster was just following some orders youre right liam she smiled at him he was just like you he was me right and he was just doing what he thought was the right thing to do like you liam heart always in the right place she rested a hand on him again genuine affection always in the right place liam doing what duty calls for but maybe weve been wrong all along to follow waldsteins directive she took her glasses off the bridge of her nose ive been doing some thinking i think that codeword pandora i think that was a warning to us a warning that were doing the wrong thing maddy was reluctant to take her thoughts a step further but the logic was right there and needed to be said out loud maybe weve been doing the dirty work of someone not quite right in the head someone who quite simply is insane waldstein she shrugged he set this agency up and bob didnt you say those support units trying to kill us came from the same place as you affirmative wg systems software she looked at the others maybe waldstein sent them to kill us a further thought occurred to her maybe when i sent that message asking about pandora when i sent that ad to the newspaper thats what triggered all of this the air in the room all of a sudden felt very charged we were never meant to know how bad the world gets said liam were we and now waldstein knows we know she pursed her lips focusing on the lenses she was unnecessarily scrubbing clean still thinking things through we cant be relied on any more were a loose cog she put her glasses back on not fit for purpose jahulla whispered sal he wants to wipe us out and start again maddy turned to bob if we changed our mission goals where does that leave us bob does your core programming mean youd have to attempt to stop us she turned to becks kill us both support units looked at each other bob finally spoke maddy wondered whether he was speaking on behalf of the pair of them probably becks would defer to him right now her mind after all was a pale reflection of his on previous occasions i have been able to override hardcoded mission parameters and so this time his thick brow lowered and became a monobrow of intense thought a long pause of deliberation finally he spoke i am able to comply with a new mission directive he stared at her intently and what is your new directive to uh to stop pandora there was a tremulous questioning tone in maddys voice worried that somewhere deep in his coconut head a logic gate might flip its state at what shed just suggested and bob might suddenly leap across the room and rip her head off your stated intention is to prevent the future event codenamed pandora from occurring she nodded slowly thats kind of it yeah you know save the world she winced as bobs forehead creased with thought and his eyes seemed to disappear into the shadow cast by his thick neanderthal brow what do you think bob that ok with you the original mission goal of preserving the destruction of the world and humankind appears to be an illogical mission goal he announced finally maddy let out a breath she hadnt realized shed been holding for the best part of a minute becks she nodded her mind had processed the same information and arrived at the same answer with the information that dr rashim anwar has provided us of the future the previous directive appears to make no sense if thats your plan maddy if you wish to work against the goal of your agency then you need to be somewhere else entirely said rashim you need to get as far away from here as possible another place maybe even another time you know that dont you maddy knew if you really are what you think you are engineered units he said that carefully desperate not to cause offence then if waldsteins after you he will im sure have all your preinception date memories on file hell know everything there is to know about you liam stirred preinception before our recruitment clarified maddy our socalled life stories right said rashim hell certainly guess youve come up here to find your family maddy he or more of his support units could be close by closing in on us as we speak youre right a new base for us to set up liams clouded face seemed to brighten a little yup new home new mission im not sure i get what our mission is though said sal maddy wasnt a hundred per cent sure herself to make pandora not happen yes that but also to continue in some moderated way the mission they used to have to make sure no reckless time traveller set this world hurtling towards another nightmare timeline were going to make the call sal were going to take control of history were going to steer it so the world gets a future where we dont kill ourselves off where we dont completely trash this planet liam nodded now that makes a bit more sense to me so even sal perked up a little bit but if were moving on to somewhere else arent we going to need some more money or something aye said liam weve nearly run out true maddy shrugged i guess we better think about where were going to get some more then chapter september interstate westfield massachusetts bob held the gun up at the man behind the counter the sock pulled over his large head was far too small and stretched so taut that his thick horselips were mashed against his teeth and squished back into a hideous leer halfway between a snarl and a grin i eed you to ive e all your oney the old korean man behind the counter shrugged what you say i aid i eed you to ive e all your oney bobs voice boomed across the racks of convenience goods in the petrol station a trucker taking his pick from some microwavable snacks in a fridge unit looked their way liam lifted his own sock up to reveal his nose and mouth excuse the big fella hes not so good with a sock on his head this is robbery aye yes yes im afraid it is liam shrugged guiltily really sorry about that were going to need some of that money in your till there the old man nodded understanding ah and then ducked down out of sight uh liam hadnt been expecting the old man to be quite so cooperative he looked at bob well that wasnt so hard a moment later the old man reappeared holding a rusty old korean model ak held together by duct tape you leave now he yelled his finger resting on the trigger and looking dangerously like he was halfway pulling on it maybe we should the gun went off five rapidfire rounds before the old weapon clicked jammed several polystyrene ceiling tiles exploded in showers of plastic snow most of the bullets whistling past them but one caused a puff of crimson to erupt from the side of bobs head an ear almost completely intact flew across the racks and landed among the refrigerated snacks not too far from the trucker bob shouldered their shotgun hoy no liam pushed the barrel up as the weapon boomed the rack of cigarettes behind the old mans head exploded with a shower of tobacco shreds and paper just get that till barked liam bob passed the gun to liam leaned over and grabbed the till embedded firmly in a counter housing plywood cracked and splintered chocolate bars and scratch cards spilled on to the floor as bob shook the till vigorously the whole counter unit was lifted clean off the floor with a loud crack the till pulled free and the counter crashed back down again sorry bout the mess there liam grimaced before he pulled the sock back down over his mouth maddy had only just finished filling the motorhome when she heard the rattle of gunfire inside the petrol stations convenience store another shot deeper the boom of a shotgun then a second later what sounded like a bull charging around inside oh jesus she whispered i said be discreet they were meant to be holding the store up for some quick cash not levelling the place to the ground a moment later she saw liam emerging followed by bob carrying something that looked almost as big as a bank safe in his arms becks she called out were leaving now the winnebagos engine started up with a roar of an accelerator pedal pushed down too hard beckss first go behind the wheel liam tumbled up the steps inside sal helping him up he collapsed on to the seat at the back hyperventilating bob followed him inside and tossed the till on to the floor the vehicle rocked on its loose suspension under the heavy impact spongebubba wobbled and lost his footing woohoo he chirped merrily on his back stubby paddle feet whirring ineffectually in the air maddy slammed the door shut on them cursing under her breath as she ran along the outside of the motorhome pulled open the passenger side door and clambered up on to the seat beside becks go go go becks eased the gearstick into drive and the superchief bucked forward like an eager racehorse let out of a trap the front of the rv clipped the rear of the rig parked up beside the petrol pump next door sending showers of sparks and a twisted aluminium bumper across the forecourt becks spun the big wheel round finally regaining control of the winnebago as they barrelled out of the petrol stations exit ramp and up the slip road on to the interstate at least at this time of night they werent roaring up only to join a road clogged with bumpertobumper commuter traffic they had three lanes almost to themselves becks gunned the accelerator slower barked maddy slow down keep it under fifty we dont want to get pulled up for speeding affirmative she eased back on the pedal and the complaining whine of the vehicles engine settled back to an almost soothing muted grumble maddy eased herself back in her seat she let go of the dashboard in front of her her nails had left crescentshaped dents in the plastic she turned round in her seat to see rashim and sal hefting spongebubba back on to his flat paddle feet and bob and liam pounding at the till like a pair of dimwitted cavemen trying to chip flint shards from an unbreakable boulder jesus not the first time she found herself wondering what kind of a mickey mouse team is this my god she hurled at them exasperated what the hell was that they stopped what they were doing all of them staring expectantly at her a bizarre menagerie seemingly sharing the same wideeyed question on their faces not good she shook her head im pretty sure i said we should try and be discreet about this chapter september harcourt ohio it was an abandoned elementary school they ended up looking at many of its windows were boarded up and covered with fading graffiti and those that werent were either broken or smeared with foggy green blooms of moss the playground beside the main entrance foyer sprouted tufts of grass and weed between fissures in the tarmac along one side a row of gently rusting bicycle racks emerged from a bed of several years worth of windswept autumn leaves the fact that the school was a couple of miles outside the nearest town and apart from a gang of kids goofing around at night with cans of spray paint some time long ago it looked like no one had been here recently coupled with the fact that it still had a tappable link to the power grid made it pretty much a perfect temporary place for them to set up shop actually theyd found it quite by chance a stop at a diner in the middle of onestrip town harcourt a blinkitandmiss town in the middle of ohios faded industrial heartland the rustbelt some called it by the look of the lifeless smokestacks and fencedoff warehouses it had once been a very promising industrial town bob had pulled over on the gravel car park in front of the diner and theyd gone in for a toilet and breakfast bagel break the diner was empty apart from them and one young waitress in a green check dress and apron slumped across the end of the counter reading a newspaper spongebob and patrick quacked and guffawed from a tv on the other end rashim smiled at the sight of that after bringing them the pot of coffee and breakfast theyd ordered the waitress found a reason to loiter by their table wiping down others nearby changing ketchup bottles and salt cellars that didnt need changing clearly bored witless with her own company and intrigued by the diners first and only customers that morning her name was kaydeelee williams at least thats what the plastic name tag on her chest said it was liam who broke the ice and asked her about the town she was pitifully keen to answer oh harcourts like totally dead been dying for years ever since they closed down the autoparts factory thats all this town was really a place for a couple of factories to go she shrugged when the auto parts started getting made in china the factories closed just like that simple she told them how the towns population shrank each year there was no future here people were moving away particularly families with young children thats how they learned about the school in harcourt green acres elementary the school kaydeelee said shed once been to no need for schools any more in a dying town shed said maddy looked at it now it would suit their immediate needs it still had a live power feed that they could tap into the local electricity company apparently hadnt bothered to disconnect and mothball the junction box instead it had obviously been cheaper just putting up some hazard signs with risk disclaimers all over them the town itself also had a pretty decent hardware store they could use and theyd passed a big retail park a dozen miles back along interstate maddy had spotted a compusa a best buy and of course the obligatory megasized walmart she looked up at a grey sky over halfway into the month septembers latesummer promise was fading already and tumbling autumn clouds vied with each other to be the first to drop their load on green acres elementary lets get our stuff inside she said half an hour later theyd emptied the superchief of all the things that had once made the archway in brooklyn their home and now home or at least their temporary home was a classroom with mouse or maybe it was rat droppings on a scuffed linoleum chequered floor and school desks and bucket chairs stacked along a corkboard wall still decorated with curling pieces of paper thumbtacked pictures drawn in crayon and felt tip childish scrawlings that spoke of happier times here blue skies and suns momandadanme pictures with tents and barbecues summer fairs and parades outside it was finally raining the tapping of heavy greasy drops on smeared windowpanes and somewhere inside the school building they could hear an echoing dripdripdrip where a part of the roof was failing maddy offered them her best moraleboosting cheerleaders smile itll be a bit comfier once we get ourselves sorted out i promise liam remembered the moment hed first awoken in the archway a dark place all damp bricks and crumbling mortar and yes just like now the taptaptapping of dripping water from somewhere out in the darkness hed thought it a horrible place to wake up for a moment even wondered if it might be an odd version of heaven in which case hed vowed to have a word with the first priest he came across if truth be told his first impression of the archway hadnt been that great it had appeared to be every bit as grim and unwelcoming as this place but theyd made it a home aye well get some bits and pieces in here to make it nice thats right maddy stepped across the classroom and reached tentatively for a light switch she grimaced as she flipped it half expecting failing wiring and the progressive corrosion of damp to collude in electrocuting her instead several frosted glass panels in the classrooms low ceiling flickered and winked to life see we got some power so well go get a kettle a heater camping stove well be living like kings before you know it sal nodded just as good as the old archway taking maddys lead she smiled slightly forced and at least we dont have to listen to the trains running overhead all the time actually liam had found that regular faint rumble comforting stepping outside into that dark rubbishstrewn alleyway and listening to the restless noises of brooklyn had been a somewhat reassuring thing a sign that life was ceaselessly going on all around them here in this abandoned school they could just as easily be the last people on earth and not know for sure one way or the other until they drove into town and even then given how lifeless harcourt had looked on their way in theyd not be certain come on guys said maddy weve got a ton of work to do if the agencys going to be up and running again aye liam shrugged under new management so it is maddy grinned this time not her forced makethetroopshappy smile this time a genuine grin of excitement yes exactly what you just said liam were under new management us how cools that were really going to change the world asked sal yup maddy wiped dusty hands on the front of her jeans now doesnt that sound like a better job description to make the world a better place rather than just keeping it the same ol same crud huh rashim squatted down beside spongebubba amid the plastic bags theyd carried in a better world he muttered to himself he was already checking through the more delicate parts of the displacement machines components he held a circuit up in front of the lab robot it dutifully extended a sensitive graphenetipped sensor and began to test the integrity of the board rashim looked up at the others anything that isnt the world i left behind works just fine for me sal gave that a moments thought making a better world does sound good aye liam grinned aye it does so then lets make busy said maddy highestpriority tasks first ladies and gents i need a coffee chapter september green acres elementary school harcourt ohio weve been so busy i havent really had time to think about things that much which is nice its such a crazy pinchudda thing last night i realized i was missing my parents and i nearly started crying when i reminded myself they never existed or if they did they were some other girls mamaji and papaji then i reminded myself im not even indian then i reminded myself im not even human so as you can imagine this is really messing with my head thats why im glad weve been so busy a few days ago we got a load of things from a big camping store sleeping bags a stove and gas kettle lights torches food all the comforts so its been nice like a camping trip we even made a small fire in the middle of the floor and cooked toast and sausages and stuff spongebubba and rashim were like a pair of excitable little children never done campfire food before but then have i even if i remembered doing that it would be someone elses memory wouldnt it or some madeup memories concocted by some techie somewhere today we need to go back to that big retail park outside of harcourt and get some more things some computers and cables and stuff me and bob and becks are getting those things oh yeah maddy also spotted an internet cafe last time we came said she wants to do some research on where were going to set up our permanent new home maddy winced and stuck her tongue out whats wrong asked liam the coffees frikkin disgusting mines all right rashim shrugged yeah but youre used to drinking some sort of soyagunk substitute maddy put the cardboard cup down on the small table beside their internet cubicle the three of them were huddled together suspiciously between the cubicle partitions like three truant teenagers messing about on facebook that cacks all yours if you want any more of it rashim she turned back to the computer monitor in front of them she had wikipedia up on the screen so i guess we should go as far back in time from now as we can get said maddy put down as much distance as we can between us and what about going forward in time asked liam she shook her head we go forward and it gets increasingly difficult to remain off the radar off the to stay hidden therell be more internet more connectivity more information bound to be i just think weve got a much better chance of remaining anonymous if we aim backwards liam sipped at his coffee her explanation made sense to him it was hard enough getting his head around this time without going further into an unfathomable future and i suppose we really have to pick another time and not stay in this one yes i would say so said rashim he hunkered forward into the narrow cubicle he lowered his voice if waldstein is determined to locate you he may decide to send more of those military recon units after you he bit his lip they may be old genetic hybrid technology but theyre robust resourceful tenacious and very very hard to kill you dont need to remind us of that said liam if he sends more you really want to make it as difficult as possible for them to track you down remaining in the present simply presents one search vector for them determining your location but picking another time adds another search vector when yeah so we need to think about less obvious places in time to hide added maddy like the past exactly but but how far back can we go asked liam we need some power do we not rashim nodded quite and thats going to be the limiting factor maddy tapped at the keyboard so that does pretty much limit us to the age of electricity when did we start having electric power everywhere rashim rolled his eyes upwards thinking guessing ahhh i think there was power a lot earlier than then said liam there was plenty of electric on the titanic so there his words came to an abrupt halt not that uh not that i was ever even on the ship he shook his head and muttered something liams right much earlier than that maddy typed a phrase into wikipedias search box my history isnt very good rashim tried again nope earlier the mans eyes widened behind his glasses really there was electricity in the s the monitor flickered with the result of her search a page of text no pictures or diagrams or embedded video clips this is old wikipedia maddy reminded herself just text there we go how about this she read out loud electricity remained not much more than a curiosity of nature until when english scientist william gilbert carried out detailed observations of the relationship between the apparent visible effects between magnetism and the as yet undefined unnamed force of electricity he produced and distinguished the lodestone effect from static electricity created by rubbing amber he named this effect after the latin word electricus meaning like amber which in turn came from the greek word for elektron really rashim craned his neck forward to read the small text more easily i never would have believed he muttered now silently reading on maddy picked out another paragraph further down the article in alessandro volta created the voltaic pile a structure of alternating layers of zinc and copper she looked at liam there you go the first electric battery said rashim michael faraday creates the faraday disk the first electromagnetic generator generator rashim grinned at her dont get too excited it generated about a couple of volts of direct current we need output thats equivalent or thereabout to the domestic feed most people are getting today he read on there thomas edison builds the first power station in menlo park new jersey built it to supply power for his laboratory and various experiments but it needs to be power thats available for us to get our hands on said liam maddy nodded yeah youre right thats the really important bit and it needs to be a totally reliable source not some nutty inventors cranky prototype that keeps breaking down or something we need power that was like commercially available put out for normal people businesses to use ahhh rashim raised a finger well then how about this the edison electric light station built in which then came online in lets see ah yes that sounds promising said maddy but i dunno new jerseys still pretty close to where we were if were going to play it safe and put as much distance as we its not in new jersey uh where then london london she took a moment to take that in not in america shed presumed just now that something as forwardthinking something so modern as electricity must have been a solely american thing long before anyone else even before the turn of the century you mean london england yes of course i mean london england a steampowered horsepower generator beneath he traced his finger down through the text to find his place beneath a place called the holborn viaduct yes and thats in central london he read the article from where his finger touched the screen it was built to power the lights on the viaduct but also to premises in the area the city temple and the old bailey he looked at them whatever that was maddy stroked her chin thoughtfully do you think it might have been churning out enough for our needs i dont know perhaps rashim picked up a biro and began scribbling down scraps of information from the article no need she said she clicked her mouse on an icon to one side of the screen and smiled its already printing london liam turned to look at her he was just about to say hed always wanted to visit the city as a boy but once again there it was stupid circular thinking hed never been a little boy with dreams and wishes he settled for a thoughtful nod aye london sounds like a good enough bet to me maddy was grinning like a loon london truly and genuinely a terrifyingly cheshire catsized grin something she realized she hadnt done in a while an honest expression of excitement victorian london all top hats and posh frocks her growing excitement was wholly infectious liam found himself smiling straight back at her he remembered their fleeting visit to san francisco in the childlike beam of pleasure on her face as theyd strutted down that broad and busy thoroughfare her with a plume of ostrich feathers on her head and wearing a bodice tight enough to make her want to cough up a kidney and him with a top hat on his head tilted at a jaunty gentlemanabouttown angle aye i think we just mightve found ourselves a new home she squeezed his hand yup she said right back rashim yes how long do you think it will take you to rebuild the displacement machine she knew hed do it the instinctive response habit of any technician engineer plumber he sucked air in through his teeth i dont know we have the key component boards and theyre still intact incredibly but im going to have to uh reverseengineer them the basic process pipeline is the same as we had on project exodus but there are implementation differences that ive got to learn and adapt to work with these components just give me your best guess a couple of weeks a month two maybe you dont know do you you asked me to guess he shrugged so im guessing chapter october harcourt ohio so thats twentyseven dollars and ninety cents liam finished he smiled at her and she blushed i know that off by heart and i know what youre gonna order by heart said kaydeelee why do you always order the same thing liam had been up to the diner virtually every morning since theyd settled into the abandoned elementary school it was boredom thats why he volunteered to do the breakfast bagel run maddy rashim and spongebubba seemed to be spending all their waking hours either poring over pencilsketched schematics or huddled over a makedo workbench carefully soldering electrical components together by the light of a desktop lamp sal seemed to be busy on the computers most of the time they had a similar setup of twelve networked pcs as theyd had back in brooklyn the old hard drives from the archway system installed once the wg systems operating code had been loaded up and had successfully kicked windows to the kerb computerbob was able to talk sal through installing all the other bits and pieces i know what bagel filling everyone likes saves me having to you know disturb them from their work kaydeelee narrowed her eyes so what are you guys up to down there at the school oh its its just a little science experiment so it is that sounds kinda cool he curled his lip casually aw its nothing too exciting really uh were were measuring he scrambled to reach for a few scienceysounding terms and words measuring background particle emissions from uh from radiomicron particle toxin materials she gazed at him none the wiser an awkward silence hung between them begging to be filled cool she said smiling i kinda liked science at school then she sighed wasnt any good at it though she huffed a little sadly wasnt much good at anything at school thats why im here i guess he followed her doleful gaze out of the broad window of the diner across a high street that was half made up of boardedup stores i never see anyone else working in here is it just you he asked she nodded pretty much in the mornings arnie comes in at lunchtimes to cook thats when it gets real busy she looked back at him we get a ladies sewing circle come in for lunch regular as clockwork five old dears the place is totally buzzing then liam laughed he picked up the tone of sarcasm yes it was boredom that brought him up here that and a chance to get some exercise it was a fifteenminute trip into town on the bicycle hed found in the schoolyard but yes if he was being honest it was a chance to pop into the diner always quiet at this time in the morning and talk to kaydeelee over the last few weeks theyd graduated from how ya doing today niceties to talking about the weather to really talking to finally politely exchanging their names why do you stay here kaydeelee she filled the silence with getting on with finishing up his takeout order busy spreading a thick layer of cream cheese on to one of the bagels she looked up at his question harcourt aye she hunched her shoulders where else am i gonna go i got a job and its ok i guess its not like i go home at night all stressed out or anything im bored but at least im not stressed but you dont intend to work in here forever right youve got a plan a dream a goal so to speak jeeez im like seventeen i dont even know what im gonna cook up for dinner tonight let alone know where i wanna be when im your age my age she nodded youre what like twentyfive twentysix or something liam stifled an urge to gasp twentyfive im sixteen sixteen but then he reminded himself he wasnt any particular age not really his false memory calmly tried to reassure him he was a sixteenyearold boy from cork ireland but that was all meaningless claptrap now someone elses fiction kaydeelee looked up from her work studied his troubled face oh my god did i just say something wrong no i just im not that old oh god you dont have some kinda awful ageing sickness or something did i just put my foot in my mouth liam laughed no dont worry he ruffled the scruffy mop of hair on his head its my grey bit of hair some people think im older than i am he offered her a disarming smirk an assurance that he hadnt taken offence that she hadnt clumsily blundered on to uncomfortable ground ahh dont you worry now ive always had this little bit of grey me lucky silver streak so it is she nodded well i really like it her cheeks suddenly coloured a mottled pink once more i mean you know it looks cool kinda gothic gothic what the devil does that mean she smiled suspiciously at him gothic sort of sabbathgrungyrocky kind of the whole steampunky thing you know he shrugged i havent the first idea what any of that means she laughed at that youre so funny the way you like talk like a sort of youngold man old did i hear you just use the word old the look of horror on his face was mockserious no she yelped no i dont mean that i meant i dunno its like youve got oldstyle manners if you know what i mean like you just stepped out of one of em ancient black and white movies he spread his hands well now youre never too young or too old for a dose of good manners my dear she chuckled behind the counter as she finished fixing the salt beef and cream cheese bagel wrapped it up in greaseproof paper and put it in the plastic bag with the others she tossed in some napkins and plastic forks and passed the bag over the counter to him i know an oldfashioned word that i can use to describe you whats that enigma thats how you say it right youre enigmatic you mean a puzzle she nodded oh youre that all right liam exactly that youre a puzzle chapter october green acres elementary school harcourt ohio it may look a bit random said maddy but trust me it all works liam cast another wary glance at the cables snaking across the classroom floor the displacement machine at the moment was nothing more than an array of circuit boards placed on a row of orange plastic bucket chairs all of them linked by dangling loops of electrical flex blobs of solder holding the whole fragile thing together the computer system controlling the displacement machine looked very like it had back in brooklyn a dozen base units and half a dozen monitors hooked up together and occupying a cluster of school desks pushed together they didnt have their own version of a displacement tube filled with freezing cold water according to maddy they didnt need one of those any more since their mission was now a different one no longer the rigid preservation of one particular timeline with all the necessary strict measures to ensure no unwanted contaminants came back into the past with them there was no longer the need for a wet drop if a minor contaminant for example a chunk of modernday linoleum floor went back into the past it might possibly result in some minor contamination but as far as maddy was concerned that was ok that was an acceptable risk the rules were different now and anyway a minor change a minor time wave might just be the thing that ultimately deflected the course of history and resulted in there not being an engineered supervirus known as kosongni in the year totally unlikely that a chunk of classroom floor could alter history that much but you never know dont worry mads said liam looking at the guts of the machine spread along the row of plastic chairs i trust you he hoped his voice sounded as confident as he was trying to look rashim pointed to one of two squares marked out on the floor with lengths of masking tape thats where you stand liam its a metre square wide enough for comfortable clearance just as long as youre not waving your arms around each square has its own departure software that controls the distribution of energy and channelling of the field i enter the precise mass figure into each entry field with an acceptable nine per cent margin of error of course said rashim he pointed at the square in front of liam the left square has your stats the right one has bobs rashim had made his mass calculations several days ago using a rather oldschool method hed filled a plastic drum with water cold of course straight from a bathroom tap right to the very top then asked liam to climb in and completely submerge himself the water had spilled out as hed displaced it the displaced water was caught in a tray beneath the drum and that water was then measured carefully to determine liams mass the process was repeated for bob then the girls then rashim and spongebubba provided none of them lost too much weight or put too much weight on in the meantime the figures were good enough comfortably within the nine per cent margin for error so its squares now liam arched his brows and looked at maddy not one big circle any more she shrugged rashims deployment method thats how they did it with exodus separate displacement volumes its safer theres a much lower risk of mass convergence plus ive calculated for an additional amount of mass each time we use the same square well take a half inch of the floor with us no more than mass convergence liam could guess what that harmlesssounding phrase meant hed seen mass convergence before and it wasnt a particularly pleasant sight he grimaced youre telling me that kind of thing happened with your lot often enough that you had a proper technical term for it we had thirteen mistranslations in phase alpha piped up spongebubba what came back was real gooey yes thanks spongebubba certainly we had uh a few failed trials but look rashim pushed his glasses up his nose this system waldsteins particleprojection system is way more elegant than ours i mean quite incredible the man was is a genius its the simplicity of the calculation pipeline that amazes me the way hes truncated the whole process into a basic twostep process he stopped himself sorry the more ive worked on this machine the bigger a fanboy ive become the point is liam this is a much more reliable system than ours was plus were dealing with a much smaller mass conversion two departure squares at a time and theyre separate which means if one square happens to malfunction in some way the other person wont be involved rashim shrugged only one person gets turned inside out not two relax liam you and i will be fine liam looked at maddy for reassurance she nodded separates not a bad idea it is actually a lot safer than the spherical portal we used to share all right then liam buttoned up his waistcoat if you say so remind me what year are we going back to exactly i decided on that puts you at several years after the viaduct and its generator were built time enough for any gremlins to have worked their way out of the system liam frowned for some particular reason the year rang a bell with him didnt something big happen that year im sure a lot of things happened in that year liam no i read something recently something pretty big in london bob scowled as he trawled through the data uploaded into his head the whitechapel murders happened in that year he said murders liam snapped his fingers that was it wasnt it that jack the ripper fella he did those murders affirmative the murders occurred in whitechapel east london five female victims over several months the last victim mary kelly was murdered on the ninth of november aye thats it he turned to maddy it was all a big mystery so it was no one ever found out who did it liam had an idea we could find out who did it you know while were back there looking around for a new home no liam we arent the police were not a homicide squad just concentrate on the job at hand ok he huffed just an idea and thats all it will remain weve got more important things to worry about sal finished dressing bob shed visited a mens clothing store in the retail park liam and rashim were now wearing modern polyester slacks and smart shirts with collars that were clearly not victorian but the grey flannel waistcoats helped date them both a little if no one inspected their clothes too closely theyd be ok once again though sal had struggled to find clothes to fit bob shed had to resort to shopping at a branch of xtraman the store for gentle giants and the choices were pretty limited dungarees again for bob and a loose striped shirt with a flat cap perched on his coarse hair he could just about pass as some lumbering navvy so ive set up a timestamp for half a dozen years after the setting up of that holborn viaduct generator maddy stepped towards the row of computer screens and studied one there was the image of an old parish map the location is about a third of a mile south of the viaduct right next to the river of london ah i think youll find its called the thames mads said liam she squinted at the screen oh yeah of course yeah the thames we did a bunch of pinhole tests on the arrival location looks like a small shingle bank brick wall on one side and what look like some steps leading up the side of it theres very little spatial disruption small stuff occasional pigeon or something im guessing so it looks like a pretty quiet spot grand so remember this is just a quick look ok go check out that viaduct see if theres someplace we can make ourselves at home then come back to the river how long have we got as long as you want really i can set up a scheduled return window if you want or we can just monitor the location for a regular rhythmic spatial displacement signature remember like you did back in dinosaurland just wave your arms in a regular rhythmic fashion well pick it up just fine hmm i think id like the scheduled return window to be sure ok she said tapping it into a keyboard three hours more aye three hours sounds like enough liam looked across at bob you ready for another jaunt big fella he nodded of course well all right then said liam clapping his hands together shall we be careful said sal that i most certainly will have a nice trip skippa spongebubba called out bring me flowers rashim turned to liam i need to change his programming sometime soon its beginning to get annoying the order of departure is bob and rashim first said maddy then you liam on the left square bob and rashim took their places in the two tapedout squares uh guys one minute countdown mark a single led flickered on one of the circuit boards clocking the energy being drawn in and stored on the capacitor a single diode that would wink out when there was enough onboard energy to discharge maddy told rashim it would do for now when they were properly settled shed build something a little more elaborate she counted the minute down and with a hum of discharged energy they both vanished along with the scuffed linoleum floor theyd been standing on youre next she said ushering liam on to his square he was standing on freshly exposed wooden floor the displacement volume had dug down two inches into the ground thirty seconds stand still now liam put his hands down by his side it felt a little unsettling looking down at the tape on the floor surrounding him and not knowing for sure if the tip of an elbow the heel of a foot might be too close or even overhanging the tape at least bobbing around in that perspex tube he knew for certain he was wholly in the displacement envelope the capacitor was beginning to hum fifteen seconds called out maddy no more fidgeting now please im not yes you are hold still liam sucked in a deep breath closed his eyes ah dear here we go again so much seemed to have happened since the last time hed done this it seemed like a whole lifetime ago in many ways it was a different life someone elses the last time hed volunteered to have his body discharged through chaos space into unknowable danger hed been certain of who he was and why he was doing what he was doing this time around it was so very different ten seconds this time he understood why his body could take such punishment it was engineered specifically to take it this time around he knew if he took a bullet or the stab of a sword or a knife it might well hurt but hed live that meant there was less to be scared of right five seconds nope he was starting to tremble like he always did as maddy counted down the last few seconds liam ya big wuss youre meant to be some kind of support unit arent you he was just about to start wondering whether bob actually ever experienced fear when he felt the floor beneath his feet suddenly give way like a hangmans trap and that awful sensation of falling chapter december london liam kept his eyes shut the white mist of chaos space no longer held him in thrall it wasnt a heavenlike magical white wilderness any more but a place that increasingly unsettled him hed seen shapes out there so faintly that he couldnt begin to determine whether they had a certain form or not they flitted like wraiths like sharks circling ever closer or perhaps his eyes or his mind were playing tricks with an utterly blank canvas perhaps it was his imagination but then hadnt sal said shed seen them too his solitary limbo in chaos space couldnt end soon enough a moment later he felt his feet make a soft landing soft and sinking whuh and sinking he tried to pull a foot out of whatever gunk he was gradually sinking into and lost his balance his hands reached out in front of him bracing for a facefirst impact with the sludge but brushed past something firm he grabbed at it it felt like wood a spar of damp wood coated in a slime that he nearly lost his grip on liam rashim it was dark and foggy and cold but he could make out rashims faint outline i think theres been a mistransmission were out on some sort of mudbank no i think its low tide there could have been some small offset miscalculation that had dropped them several yards to one side in this case further into the river it could have been worse high tide for instance bob you there affirmative his deep voice rumbled out of the fog liam held tightly on to the wooden spar he wasnt sinking any more he pulled one foot out of the glutinous mud with a sucking sound coming from the silt theres a wooden post here hold on to it you can use it to pull yourself out of the mud that is not necessary bob replied were not actually in the mud said rashim were standing on what appears to be a woodenslat walkway the fog thinned and he saw them both several yards away standing on a creaking rickety wooden jetty quite dry liam realized there must have been a small error in rashims calculation of his mass then again not necessarily rashims fault hed eaten a small bag of pecan doughnuts just half an hour ago that might possibly have altered his mass enough to cause a deviation from where he was supposed to be rashim had actually cautioned them all not to eat just before a jump liam cursed his carelessness only got yourself to blame greedy guts he muttered as he took several sinking teetering laboured steps towards them through the silt and pulled himself up on to the jetty to join them his legs dangled over the side and he attempted to kick the largest clumps of foulsmelling gunk off his boots information the translation was offset by fourteen feet and three inches said bob rashim nodded we should let maddy know when we get back shell need to recalibrate the spatial attributor dont bother said liam it was three doughnuts that are to blame ahh now yes i did warn you liam said rashim liam got up off the damp wood most of the cloying mud shaken off he grinned in the dark at him lesson learned he took in the freezing mist all around them so this is victorian london is it affirmative liam yes liam say yes not affirmative he picked out the dark mountain of bobs back and slapped it gently youre never going to get your head around that are you that particular speech file appears to be resistant to replacement should we not proceed rashim interrupted hmmm youre right said liam lets find some solid ground they followed the jetty until it widened and finally terminated on firm shingle at the base of a slimeencrusted stone wall a hightide line marked the top of the slime halfway up and it was mistdamp stonework the rest of the way the pinhole image theyd gathered earlier had shown this jetty wall the mist hadnt been here then and there were the steps theyd spotted in the image a dozen slippery narrow stone steps up the side of the jetty wall at the top liam looked around a carpet of mist covered the river below like a wispy layer of virgin snow dusted silvery blue by a quartermoon he saw the humps of river barges emerge from the mist topped with pilots cabins like isolated stubby lighthouses rising from a milky sea the milky sea itself seemed to stir with life he watched enormous dark phantoms loom through the river mist like those evercircling wraiths in chaos space shadows cast by fleeting clouds chasing each other across the moonlit sky the other two joined him its so dark said rashim liam nodded compared to new york compared to whatever future cities rashim must be used to it must seem like some medieval netherworld dark yes but punctuated by a thousand pinpricks of faint amber light gas lamps behind dirty windows candles behind tattered net curtains they were standing in a cobblestone square on one side there appeared to be a brick warehouse or small factory they heard something heavy rumbling rattling across the river and turned round to look across the carpet of mist it was then liam noticed the arches and support stanchions of a broad low bridge according to my data that is blackfriars bridge said bob not so far beyond it another bridge and the toot of a steam whistle confirmed what liam suspected it was a train crossing the river to their side he could just about make out the faintest row of amber lights on the move lamps in each carriage my god whispered rashim is that a a steam train aye we should proceed towards our target destination said bob he was right liam would rather be back here for maddys scheduled window than have to flap his hands around like an idiot hoping for one there was no knowing how good their temporary setup back in was at picking up hand signals we must head north said bob pointing towards a narrow street they made their way up the street dark and quiet it curved to the left and a hundred yards up at the end it joined a much broader street they could hear it was busy even before they stepped out of their dark side street the distinctive clopclopclop of shoed horses the warning honk of a bulb horn the rattle of ironrimmed coach wheels they emerged on to a broad street lit on either side with stout wroughtiron lamps twelve feet tall that spilled broad pools of amber illumination across a wide thoroughfare busy with horsedrawn carriages and carts my god whispered rashim i never imagined it would be quite so busy its only ten said liam pointing to a clock on a nearby building people stay up even later in my hometown cork he stopped himself from correcting that not his hometown of course but it was a constant unsettling inconvenience for him and the girls continually selfcorrecting statements like that that hed finally stopped giving a damn about it as maddy had told him it doesnt matter if theyre secondhand memories liam we are the sum of what we remember and thats how im dealing with this denial it was as good a way as any of dealing with the knowledge that your whole life was a lie this is really quite fantastic rashim uttered glad you like it which way now bob this is farringdon street he pointed up the busy thoroughfare at the far end a low bridge arched over the wide street along the top of it were glowing orbs of light of a different colour more of a pale amber almost a vanilla colour and a steadier more resilient glow than the occasionally flickering shifting illumination coming from the gas lamps and that is the holborn viaduct those lights liam nodded at them affirmative replied bob they are electric lights the three of them picked their way up the broad pavement on the lefthand side of farringdon street it was busy with pedestrians a mixture of smartly dressed gentlemen and ladies taking the air after a show and costermongers and hucksters of various goods packing up and making their way home for the night come on make way there lads barked a thickshouldered man with a handcart laden with pigs heads and trotters as he pushed his way past them an elegantly dressed woman walking with a whippetthin man in a top hat curled her lips in disapproval as the cart wheeled past her oh really she muttered liam and rashim shared a grin the noises the smells the acrid smell of burning coke horse manure the sight of such churning shouldertoshoulder life seemed reassuring lifeaffirming after all that time alone in the abandoned school it felt good to be back among so many people liam caught the faintest whiff of it first the smell of coffee beans roasting in a skillet parked up in the dirt at the side of the road was a large fourwheeled cart wooden steps unfolded down on to the pavement invited them up to a wooden deck where several tables and stools were occupied by gentlemen and ladies taking coffee and a slice of cake at one end of the cart a woman and a man in aprons were serving cups of freshly roasted coffee from large tin urns that steamed over small skillets candles lit the small tables mini oil lamps were strung across the top like christmas lights just wait till maddy sees that liam laughed a horsedrawn starbucks a few minutes later they were standing beneath the viaduct looking up at the thick ribs of glossy greenpainted iron arching across the broad street overhead alongside the road that crossed over the viaduct the orbs of electric light at the top of tall iron lampstands bloomed proudly londons first public electricpowered street lights liam nodded approvingly not bad we have used half an hour of our allotted time said bob liam stopped gawking at the lights and turned his attention to life beneath the viaduct the underbelly was a row of hexagonal stone columns on either side of the street from which the arches of iron branched out to meet each other on both sides of farringdon street there were pedestrian walkways lit by yet more electric globes the walkways were flanked by stone columns on one side and rows of brickwork archways on the other each archway seemingly occupied by one sort of business or other as they watched on the far side of the busy street the thick oak doors of one of the archways swung open and several men worked together rolling casks of beer out across the pavement and on to a flatbacked cart liam craned his neck to get a better look through the open doors to the interior beyond he could see archways and alcoves all seemingly stuffed with barrels crates and boxes of all different sizes lets go over and get a better look he said they crossed farringdon street dodging and ducking between horsedrawn vehicles that showed no intention of stopping or slowing for them closer liam watched the three men working quickly furtively even as they loaded the cart up stay here he said then made a show of looking casual whistling tunelessly as he strolled past the wideopen oak doors he paused ducked down on to one knee and made as if he had a bootlace that needed tying up all the while craning his neck to see through the open doors getting a glimpse of the receding maze of archways and alcoves inside hoy he turned to find one of the men standing over him hoy there you get enough of a look inside did ya i was im just liam stood up pokin ya nose in where its likely to get broken a thought suddenly occurred to the man and he grabbed liams arm roughly you a snitch for them bluebottles is that it for the bleedin coppers the man was short and tubby with owlish bug eyes that bulged beneath wiry brows liam found himself looking down at him he suspected the little chap was actually tougher than he looked that or he was all bluster what no im just im cos ill get me lad bertie to shank you good if you actually replied liam im looking for business premises business premises likely story the stocky man turned to look at rashim approaching to help liam out he did an almost comical doubletake at rashims dark skin good god he blurted you with this lad yes yes of course i am rashims carefully enunciated aliensounding english seemed to impress or perhaps intimidate the stocky man he cocked his head as if flexing a stiff neck well all right then the man released his grip on liams arm he your boy rashims eyes met liams and he struggled to stifle an amused smile no not really im not anyones boy sniffed liam indignantly were uh were business partners so we are the stocky man pulled a face business partners is it uh yes hes quite right said rashim we want to rent one of these archway places liam glanced at the open doorway the other two men had finished loading the last cask on to the cart and one of them climbed up on to the running board and coaxed the horses to life their hooves clattered on stone and the wagon pulled away you seem to have a lot of space inside there said liam could we rent a bit well what i got inside aint none of your beeswax lad bob emerged out of the gloom are you ok liam he asked striding towards the stocky man his voice reverberated beneath the iron and stone viaduct a deep boom that made heads on the other side of farringdon street turn their way a lamb shank of a hand reached out and grabbed one of the mans upper arms in a vicelike grip the stocky mans bulging eyes widened still further he looked like a tree frog in a waistcoat oh im all right bob liam grinned at the man theres no harm done bertie the man gulped alarmed at the giant looming over him bertie get over here and help me his colleague bertie took one look at bob and then backed up several steps into the gloom can we not just have a little talk asked liam if youve got a spare room somewhere in there or perhaps you know of anybody else who does thats all we have money added rashim we could pay a very generous rent the man gulped looking more like a toad than a frog now generous rent eh aye said liam bob why dont you let this nice gentlemans arm go before you crush it to a pulp as you wish bob loosened his grip and the man snatched his arm free flexed his neck again and straightened his ruffled waistcoat indignantly well his bug eyes remained warily on bob i suppose a little talk wont hurt no one chapter december holborn viaduct london they stepped inside through the double oak doors and the tall young man called bertie pulled them closed he was wirythin with short dark hair parted on the side long sideburns and a pitifully wispy attempt at a walrus moustache there was a glare on the face of his short froglike boss a stern look at his young assistant very much along the lines of were going to have a little talk later on you and i liam looked around in one way it was very much like the home theyd left behind in brooklyn an arched ceiling of dark red bricks but this archway was stuffed with stacks of wooden packing crates and casks of whisky and liquors barrels of beer bottles of wine sacks of mysterious goods even a rack of armysurplus rifles and small foilsealed boxes of ammunition off this main archway through walkways between mountains of boxes he could see other archways and alcoves receding into the gloom it looked almost labyrinthine an aladdins cave the rotund little man sat down at a small round table in the middle of his warehouse a gas lamp glowed in the middle of it he cut a small wedge of cheese from a block the size of a shoebox so you mentioned a generous rent eh liam sat down opposite him if youve got an archway spare somewhere among all this he said gesturing at the receding gloom then yes we can pay oh theres plenty more of this maze beneath the viaduct available for tenants he chewed energetically on his cheese looking casually up at the low ceiling if you know the right bloke to talk to and youre that right bloke i suppose he shrugged thats what they say around this manor liam offered his hand across the table the names liam oconnor the man eyed it warily for the moment finishing his mouthful of cheese then wiped his hand on his sleeve and shook with liam delbert hook imports and exports is mbusiness liam looked around him and wondered how much of the stuff in here was strictly legitimate business and how much of it had fallen off the back of a wagon thered been a somewhat suspicious haste in the way mr hook and his assistant had been loading up the wagon the lanky drip standing over there by the door is my assistant bertie the young man stepped forward offered his hand tentatively to liam its herbert actually pleased to meet you berties what i calls him said delbert hes brighter than he looks actually i have a parttime job teaching mathematics replied herbert i do dels accounts for him on weekdays and mr hook to you lad he glared although his expression quickly softened or hooky or if im very very drunk then and only then you can call me del liam suspected there was something of a bond between the two men despite the mutual glaring and these other two delberts gaze rested on bob whos this giant thats bob and this fellas my good friend dr rashim anwar delbert pursed his lips appreciatively at rashim doctor a physician is it eh not that kind of a doctor im afraid oh delbert sounded disappointed anyway he cut another hunk of cheese liam noticed he wasnt offering any around for the right price and so long as you can convince me you aint snipes working for the police i might be able to find you your very own archway we need privacy said rashim delbert looked at him well of course what decent businessman dont theres a power generator located somewhere under this viaduct said rashim isnt there delbert nodded at rashim oh you mean the bell electrical voltaic generation machine yes indeed the first of its size in the world so they says there was a big parade and marching bands an the like here five or six years ago when they switched the ruddy thing on damn noisy it is too sounds like a bloomin locomotive comin through the walls you might want one of the archways well away from the ruddy thing if you dont want to listen to it boomin away all day an all night no cut in liam close to thats fine for us so it is close to it one of delberts bushy eyebrows rose suspiciously you actually want the noise do you liam shrugged it wont be a problem for us hmm delbert stroked his bottom lip both bushy brows lowered almost a scowl you gonna tell me what yer business is its private said liam private covers a multitude of sins lad i may not be entirely above the board here but theres some things i wont be a party to you understand what im sayin liam figured he might have to feed the man a titbit of information just enough to satisfy his beadyeyed curiosity science experiments he nodded at rashim dr anwar here is something of a a scientist science is it that seemed to appeal to delbert what are yer some sort of inventor i err he looked at liam liam nodded yes i suppose yes an inventor good lord said herbert might i ask what kind of things you invent he looked eager see i also have quite an interest in the sciences sir not now bertie delbert sat back in his chair and wiped his hands and finished his mouthful of cheese as he gave his visitors some silent consideration all right then ill show you what i got then you and me lad were gonna need to talk about the money delbert got up reached for the lamps brass handle lifted it off the table and waved for them to follow him he led them down through a tight squeeze between packing crates along a narrow tunnel low enough that bob had to stoop down to enter it they turned a corner to see by the dim glow of delberts lamp an archway almost as large as delberts main one along the lefthand wall were a few stacks of goods along the wall opposite were three evenly spaced alcoves the one on the left leads directly out on to farringdon street i dont use it myself but i got keys to it you can use that access just so long as youre mindful to lock it secure at night that way you dont need to be disturbing my business all the time the middle ones a small storage room i dont use it the right one is the one you can have he walked over towards that alcove it receded further along than it first appeared to ten feet a low narrow tunnel at the end a small arched oak door with a thick padlock on it delbert fumbled in his trouser pocket and pulled out a jangling keyring ill give you this key of course he said as he picked out the keyhole and inserted the key that is the only copy of the key asked rashim delbert made a face of course of course the lock clanked loudly and the thick door creaked inwards liam heard it almost immediately the muted sound of something not so far away throbbing deeply he glanced at rashim who smiled back approvingly the generators close by perfect here we are said delbert stepping inside he raised the lamp in his hand and shadows danced around the empty space as they filed in behind him above the throb more of a vibration sensed through the brick walls and the floor than it was a sound they heard the faint squeak of rats scuttling for the safety of a dark corner the girls will just love the idea of that i dont believe yer goin to get any more private a place than this gents delberts voice rang off the bricks an almost endless echo that seemed to take an eternity to finally fade to nothing he picked up a thick candle sitting on the floor amid its own solid nest of melted wax and lit it with the extra flickering light liam took in more details of their surroundings it was about a third smaller than their archway under the williamsburg bridge and no other rooms off this space this was it a rectangle of stoneslab floor about twelve yards by six encased by a low curving ceiling of bricks almost a dungeon if you let yourself think about it that way or like a large cabin aboard some vessel liam suspected that the everpresent pulsing throb would eventually be no more a distraction after a while than the engine of an ocean liner this would be an appropriate location rumbled bob finally and we can make it like home cant we the other place had been just as spartan and grim as this but theyd managed to make it comfortable make it theirs all right mr hook said liam i think you have yourself some tenants delbert slapped him amicably on the back oh come now to hell with this mister hook nonsense call me hooky or del if you want young man he turned to face liam with a mockserious glint in his eye but not delboy right i draw the line at that he flexed his neck and tugged down on his waistcoat a subconscious tic of his so it seemed the last cheeky plonker called me that ended up with a big fat lip didnt he bertie uh its herbert actually delbert sighed now boy lets not show off in front of the clients right then lets go and discuss the rent gentlemen he led liam and bob out of the room rashim remained behind taking in the space a moment longer youre really an inventor sir asked bertie rashim shrugged more a quantum technician really the young man didnt understand the term but seemed impressed with it all the same well that sounds jolly exciting sir he offered his hand to rashim i do hope we shall have a chance to talk some time ive got some ideas id love to share with you if youd care to uh oh sure bertie rashim shook his hand yes well talk some time pft you know dr anwar i hate it when delbert introduces me with that damnable nickname its only him that calls me bertie no one else rashim snuffed the candle out and stepped back out of the room to follow the others before the receding light of the gas lamp dwindled to nothing and they were left in the pitchblack darkness herbert the young man called out after rashim my names actually herbert but rashim wasnt listening he was trying to catch up with the dwindling lamp light the young man was alone in the gloom the skittering of emboldened rats emerging now it was almost wholly dark again i was jolly well christened herbert george wells not bloomin bertie but rashim had turned a corner and was gone chapter october harcourt ohio sheriff marge mcdormand cradled the mug of green tea in both hands as she stared at the computer screen in front of her hell of a crazy world she muttered to herself whats that marge nothing jerry she replied she looked past the computer at her husband sitting in the desk opposite hers and its sheriff during office hours my dear jerry pulled a biro out of his mouth and sighed its not enough im your office boy the term is deputy hon and thats only until we can find someone else to stand in she smiled at him im sure well find someone soon then you can go back to being a kept man she looked back at the screen quiet day in harcourt shed done her rounds this morning nothing much to write up a stolen car dumped outside garys bar no harm done to it other than the driversside window forced and the steering columns plastic hood broken to jack the ignition that and giving henry learry the town drunk a lift in the squad car back home to his anxious wife marge had found him fast asleep behind the wheel of his truck after a night bingedrinking still way too soaked to be trusted to drive the thing home safely those were the sort of things that marge dealt with day to day the occasional problem with kids breaking into and messing around in the abandoned factories the occasional domestic dispute the occasional kitty stuck up a tree that was it police work in harcourt suited her she was far too old to be dealing with real crime she carried a firearm on her hip but in five years as sheriff here shed yet to unpop the leather flap of her holster in the course of doing her job which was just fine the mornings breakfast round had ended up as it always did at the diner where shed got into the habit of picking up a takeout coffee and doughnut for jerry and a green tea for herself the williams girl kaydeelee usually served her and kept her there talking about everything and nothing for five minutes longer than it took to serve up the order that poor young girls so lonely marge wondered why on earth she stayed in harcourt this place was a town with a past not a future a glorified departure lounge for an ageing population that seemed to shrink by a couple of dozen every harsh winter this morning though kaydeelee had had some company a disarmingly pleasant young man with an interesting accent and charmingly oldfashioned manners for some reason marge thought he was canadian until she got back in the car and placed his accent irish the pair of them seemed to be getting on like old buddies thick as thieves that girl needed someone in her lonely life and the young man seemed to be a nice enough find good for you girl marge sipped her tea and returned to her routine of grazing through news websites and the state police intranet pages the world really seemed to have gone quite mad in the wake of that terror attack in new york the president was busy banging a drum for the whole world to go to war with iraq for some reason even though there was evidence surfacing that the terrorists had mostly come from saudi arabia go figure and what about those guys in afghanistan what were they called tallysomething jerry kept calling them the telly tallies like those childrens characters on tv werent they more likely involved in attacking the twin towers than this saddam hussein fellow over in iraq marge shook her head americans were quite rightly angry tens of thousands of new yorkers were grieving for loved ones right now but now was surely not the best of times to be making big decisions like who to go to war with the boys want a war she sighed again and theyll get their war sure enough she clicked to close the msnbc news page and then pulled up the state police bulletin page it featured the usual daytoday bumph plus the now obligatory daily notices on the current terror threat level today it was as it was yesterday and the day before red severe beside the colourcoded alert was a reminder for all lawenforcement personnel to be vigilant for suspicious activities and persons marge was always alert for suspicious activities and persons it was well duh excuuuse me her job anyway she found the notice vaguely patronizing it would be like telling young kaydeelee to make a special effort not to pour scalding coffee over the head of the next customer she served grating her teeth she dutifully scanned the rest of the page then hit the link to the fbis vicap site the bureau were featuring front and centre a rogues gallery of most wanteds two dozen mugshots a fair number of them darkskinned and sporting dark santa claus beards large enough to lose a small dog in nope she muttered not seen any of you types skulking around here in harcourt nor you nor you mr osama bin laden nor you mr manuel caraccus she clicked on the link for the second page of the gallery nor and stopped midmutter she was looking at a face shed seen just ten minutes ago jerry heard her suck in her breath he looked up from the paperwork on his desk given yourself another paper cut marge he noticed her wide eyes her glasses reflecting the pale glow of the computer screen the styrofoam cup held midway between the desk and her mouth which now hung open not making a sound a rare event in itself you ok over there marge chapter october green acres elementary school harcourt ohio looks like youre going to have to dig through some walls by the look of this maddy clicked on the screen and zoomed in on a portion of the blueprint rashim nodded it appears as if they left space between these walls for cabling to run from the generator room up to the lights on the top and over here he pointed on the screen cabling that leads out to an external distribution node uhhuh i guess they planned to have the generator as a part of the viaduct from the very beginning fascinating rashim reached for the mouse fingers touched and recoiled an awkward half a second all yours maddy said a little too quickly he dragged the pixellated image of the blueprint across the screen hmm it would be a lot easier knocking through to the generator room itself only two walls between our archway and that big steam engine in there but would you really want to do that bust right in there theres probably steam engine engineers or whatever you call them in there coalshovellers and stuff weve got to be ultradiscreet about this indeed yes so maybe then well have to tap the cabling somewhere along this conduit its a lot more work he leaned forward and i imagine a bit of a squeeze shuffling along inside that space between the walls he squinted and muttered a curse in farsi i wish this image was at a higher resolution best i could get she shrugged in fact it was the only blueprint image i could find shed spent a good part of yesterday back at the internet cafe in the retail park shed found an architectural website with an archive of victorianera building projects the holborn viaduct was hardly the grandest of london projects but historically notable because of its incorporation of the citys first electric generator it looks fiddly but it is discreet rashim and thats the important thing if were going to start leeching on their power weve got to make it so that if they work out the generators not delivering the power its designed to deliver its got to be almost impossible for them to figure out where the power is leaking away to the only way theyll figure out whats going on is if they decide to track the course of the cables thing is if we tap the output cautiously little and often itll never be enough of a drain for them to consider stopping the engine and overhauling everything to figure it out hopefully she made a face hopefully hey you all right there sal she looked up liam was crossing the cracked and weedspeckled playground he casually kicked his way through a pile of dead leaves this years fall from the maple trees lined up beside what was once the school bus dropoff point the leaves rustled and skittered across the tarmac caught by a fresh breeze early october it was getting cold now the clouds above were promising snow not rain sal shivered inside her parka puffing a cloud of vapour out in front of her liam joined her on the swing sat on the plastic strapseat next to her the rusting frame creaked as they both swung gently idly im fine jayzus he rubbed his hands together vigorously its cold out here you should come in im in all the time i came out to get some fresh air ayetis a bit smelly inside so it is both bob and becks were eating the same convenience meals as them however their body chemistry preferred highprotein lowfat foods and preferably blended to a baby mush but tins of refried beans in new orleans sauce uncle yangyang kettle noodles and pop tarts had to suffice as their source of nutrition it just meant they farted constantly particularly bob he was like some fleabitten wiry old mongrel dog letting them off one after the other without any sense of embarrassment seemingly without a care in the world why do you do that she asked presently do what talk like you do the whole irish thing youre not even irish hey jayz i just his mouth flapped for a moment then shut with a coconut clop he looked hurt sal winced that had come out sounding all wrong and she felt guilty im sorry i wasnt trying to be rude liam i just think it all sounds i dunno fake now he swung in silence the frame creaked ive stopped using those indian words i dont think i even knew what they meant im not even sure if they were real hindi words she still had the singsong indian accent though shed even started consciously trying to lose that if it wasnt real if it was some technicians idea of how an indian girl from ought to sound then she was damned if she was going to follow his programming i talk this way sal because its the only way i know how to talk its just code liam its code worse than that the irish thing its a cheesy cliche its who i am he shrugged even if that does make me a whatchacallit a cliche she looked at him how can you do that though go on just like before like nothings happened he managed a wry smile why not nothing about me has changed at all so im exactly the same person i was but how can you be the same person now you know what you are everything everything planted in our minds before we woke up none of it ever happened its nothing god i mean maybe weve got chips in our heads just like bob and becks have you considered that aye but it doesnt worry me any how can it not he shrugged anyway maddy reckons were not the same as them our minds arent computers but proper human minds thats why we had to believe we were human so wed act like humans think like humans but wouldnt you want to have someone xray your head take a look inside to see if theres a chip or something inside not really whatevers in me head machine or meat it works just fine she sniffed except its fake ah well now whos to say anybodys memories are for real hmm he chuckled a plume of breath erupted from his mouth you know perhaps the whole world the whole universe is just a big pretend someones idea of a funny joke huh difference is we know our lives are a funny joke liam you can never know anything for sure sal in the end its all a question of what you choose to believe he watched a cloud of his breath drift away turning twisting dissipating in the cold afternoon air thing is i choose to be liam i like him he smiled at her i like being him and maybe he was once a real lad who lived in cork and im just borrowing his memories or maybe hes just a madeup person put together from bits and pieces who cares but thats no better than she struggled to think of an example thats no better than a child pretending to be superman no better than all those people who believe in god or jehovah or allah or vishnu or maybe he shrugged but it works for me she sighed i cant do it liam she whispered i dont think i can pretend im who i thought i was all ive got thats real is the time in the archway you maddy he pointed at what was clasped in her hands is that why youve got that with you all the time sal looked down at the notebook her diary and nodded thats me liam a solitary tear dripped on to the scuffed black cover she wiped it off irritably thats all there is left of me ink and paper a crow cawed from the bare branches beyond the chainlink fence surrounding the playground the solitary ominous noise of approaching winter sal he reached out and squeezed her gloved hand dont do this sal eh dont drift off and away from me an maddy we need you so we do the three of us need to hold fast together to stay a proper team need me what do i do nothing you will do when were set up again in london well need you watching for them little changes up in the centre of the city piccadilly circus maybe watching for the time waves she gave that a moments thought perhaps he was right perhaps there was a purpose for her still she wiped her nose and sniffed noisily then sniggered liam smiled what nothing no go on whats so funny something you said i said something funny she shook her head its nothing her face brightened for him youre right weve still got a job to do havent we aye so come in then sal before you freeze i will you go ill be along in a minute all right im makin some hot chocolate care for some he cocked a brow therell be a fair chance of some of them nice chocolate biscuits with the cream in the middle oreos aye those are the fellas sure count me in she watched him go kicking those leaves again on the way back to the double doors of the school gymnasium blue paint flaking off both and a rusting pushbar on one of them the door clattered shut behind him something you said liam something funny really funny perhaps the whole universe is just a big pretend she muttered softly no actually not that funny after all chapter october washington dc faith appraised agent cooper unlike most humans he appeared to be very taskfocused very driven one could say binary almost boolean in his mindset he could almost have passed as one of her shortlived batch of clone brothers and sisters except of course he wasnt six foot six inches tall and carrying around eighteen stone of muscle and denselattice bone he was just as frail and vulnerable as any other human being one of her hands round his neck and a quick twist and hed be burger meat in a suit that unfortunate frailty notwithstanding shed so far been quite impressed with his performance she resumed eating the bowl of cow amp gate baby food cooper in turn was silently appraising her perched on the edge of his desk he grimaced as he watched her spoon the baby food into her mouth i cant believe you can chow down that stuff it is an optimal formula she replied with her mouth full maximum nutrition with a minimum of energy consumed in the process of breaking it down and digesting it she noticed he was looking at her intently what is it agent cooper youve uh youve got a blob of that stuff right there on the end of your nose she remained staring at him a face that seemed to be wondering why that mattered in any meaningful way its not a good look faith he leaned forward reached out with a finger and deftly flicked it away not a good look she mimicked him an almost exact copy of his southern virginian accent why why why because you dont want to look like some sort of dayrelease outpatient from a nuthouse he sipped his coffee youre odd enough without dried baby food plastered all over your face if youre going to be working alongside me we need you to not attract any attention im pretty much exceeding my authority letting you down here as it is faith finished her food put down the bowl and carefully wiped round her mouth i understand cooper really had stuck his neck out hed brought her to the department a couple of weeks ago ushered her past several id checks pulling rank on the security personnel and now here she was down on the mezzanine floor in his domain the catacombs being kept here like some sort of a pet truth was he didnt know what to do with her she couldnt be left to her own devices roaming around boston conducting her very own huntandseek mission murdering who she pleased because she might just consider them a contaminant whatever the heck that was really supposed to mean and he didnt want to kill her she was all he had she was his only connection to whoever these mysterious time travellers were what he had was not very much an autopsy report on faiths dead colleague and a tiny chunk of fried circuitry pulled from his head that wasnt anything more now than an interesting fingernailsized nugget of silicon and graphene this creature this fleshandblood robotwoman was the best piece of evidence he had that he wasnt going mad that time travel had been quietly going on right in front of everyones nose for god knows how long for god knows how many decades cooper couldnt even begin to contemplate how valuable the treasure trove of knowledge residing in that digital mind of hers was but right now the only investigative process he had on the go was agent mallard out there doing the donkey work to track down and confiscate all the cctv footage that he could lay his hands on there was the footage from the mall but also a petrol station a diner and a motel theyd used the day before mallard had already brought back several boxes of tapes and from those there were some not bad albeit grainy images of their faces that theyd managed to isolate and enhance but that was it other than mallards legwork and hoping for a lead to turn up he had this unlikely woman in front of him i know i keep saying this he said breaking the long silence but if you just shared with me the data you have on them i could put it to good use i can get priority access to the bureaus it department we can tap all sorts of databases medical insurance local and state lawenforcement incident reports bank records traffic no she said softly your assistance in this matter is she paused her eyelids flickering as she considered a choice of phrase appreciated however i am unable to share with you data about the target perhaps he could try a different angle well what about you then hmmm or how about telling me something about where youve come from her cool grey eyes locked on his you wish to know about the future he shrugged yeah why not she silently considered that for a moment i am unable to tell you specific details but i can discuss the early symptoms that are occurring in the world at present symptoms he laughed at that you make the world sound like its a hospital patient she cocked her head slightly that analogy is suitable this world is sick it is unsustainable it is dying dying what do you mean population tangents increasing versus rapidly diminishing world resources even in this time evidence of this of these future problems is known to your world leaders but they choose to do nothing oil will run out global warming will increase the polar caps will melt and a third of the worlds land mass will be submerged by rising sea levels it will become accepted in far too late to deploy corrective measures that global warming was more significantly affected by the explosion in world population than it was by hydrocarbon usage she adjusted the cuffs of her jacket her hair was growing in quickly still boyishly short though but now with a vaguely feminine fringe of dark hair and office clothes cooper had bought her from jc penney she almost looked like your typical wall street goto girl hardfaced ambitious and smartly turned out in only twentyfive years from now there will be nine billion human beings attempting to exist on a diminishing resourcepoor land mass the arithmetic is inevitable and was always entirely predictable cooper even now there are scientists that are accurately predicting mankinds fate which is what she shrugged you will destroy yourselves he puffed his cheeks thats uh thats pretty grim it is what will happen jeez i bet youre a blast at parties she cocked an eyebrow i dont understand the relevance or intended meaning of that comment never mind just then the door into the main office swung inwards with a bang cooper jerked and spilled coffee on to the crisp white cuff of his shirt he saw mallards face across a chesthigh maze of vacant office cubicles christ mallard you made me jump sir sir what the hell is it mallard picked his way through past an empty watercooler that hadnt been used in years past desks with dustcovered computers that if someone actually bothered to switch them on theyd find still ran on windows sir he said breathless as he finally stood in front of cooper and faith weve got a solid lead some smalltown sheriff reckons hes ided one of the images we put up on the bureaus most wanted site where mallard looked down at a postit note in his hand theyre in ohio someplace called harcourt its some hasbeen town used to have several autoparts factories theyre all closed down now mothballed hang on cooper looked at faith thats what you suggested wasnt it theyd go to ground someplace like that quiet out of the way with access to a source of electricity and required technical components she nodded and almost smiled it is what i would do chapter october green acres elementary school harcourt ohio but its going to be dangerous isnt it sal looked at becks she was no taller or bulkier than any normal twelve or thirteenyearold girl but she like bob was originally engineered for military purposes a killing machine if she got the idea into her head while bob was not around thered not be much of any of them left maddy clucked her tongue ive got no idea how shell behave but if she bugs out on us weve got bob right here to restrain her or kill her look it wont come to that im sure more likely shell just swoon and pine for liam like some pathetic fangirl sal snorted that was kind of funny despite the seriousness of the situation but why now why dont we wait until were settled in london im not sure were going to have enough power back in to sustain our backup frozen embryos once we go through to the past we may not be able to regrow replacement support units it might be just bob and becks one of each we lose them we wont have any backup support units to grow what about the san francisco drop point maddy shook her head i dont think it would be a good idea going anywhere near there theyve got to be watching that place now no it would be dumb for us to go back there sal nodded we can take the foetuses with us just in case theres some way we can find a way to grow new support units if needed but really i think we need to sort becks out now once and for all we need both our support units fully loaded and functional she turned to them both once we go back we may have to ditch our embryos and that means no more support units well have to rely indefinitely on these two which is why we need to test her mind out now sal while weve got a chance here in to grow a new one from scratch if you know this doesnt work out anyway she added while liams in london it might be easier we dont want becks hurling herself his way and slobbering all over him sal curled her lip an eww written all over her face maddy pulled a hard drive out of her duffel bag masking tape with becks felttipped across it beckss complete original consciousness her mind right there in a hard plastic case maddy held it up you ready for this becks affirmative i am ready all right then maddy wasnt entirely sure this was the sensible thing to do but what was locked away on there in an encrypted folder was knowledge that was far too important to remain there forever a decoded portion of the holy grail a message sent by someone quite possibly the previous team quite possibly a previous version of maddy herself and god knows what the message was another warning like that scribbled pandora one but whoever had sent the message from two thousand years ago theyd thought to pass along an instruction to becks to keep the secret locked away until certain unspecified conditions were met and now all of that was sitting on an external hard drive on a piece of hardware that was unable to process these thoughts on hardware that was merely able to store them they needed beckss knowledge her memories installed back onboard a supportunit mind where hopefully someday soon becks would be able to announce that these mysterious conditions had been met and let maddy know what the big secret was and now they were acting entirely on their own beyond the agencys original remit maddy realized they had twice as much need to know what dark secret had been transported across a thousand years of roman history and the dark ages across another thousand years of holy grail history for their eyes only a warning a truth a threat a revelation come on then she said this wont do itself chapter october green acres elementary school harcourt ohio it took maddy half an hour to successfully connect the hard drive to the networked computers the new pcs had a different method of logging the harddrive idents which meant computerbob had some datashuffling to do before he could get the underlying dos code to recognize the hard drives and this external one under their original ident tags presently becks closed her eyes the influx of new data being bluetoothed into her mind was an odd sensation one of course shed had before as bob had worked with her slowly bringing her mind up to speed with his but that had been a trickle this was a flood the nearest sensory equivalent was like having icecold liquid injected into an artery feeling it spread branch travel envelop there were duplicated memories among the incoming data memories shed already inherited once before from bob memories of memories then there were her very own memories recollections of dinosaurs and jungles liam and an emergent mindstate for him a feeling that shed labelled and carefully put to one side in her mind she saw medieval towns and castles prince john ridiculously besotted with her a battle the siege of nottingham ranks of glinting armour and flapping banners shifting in the heat haze of a summers day a remote monastery a monk called cabot and then an ancient scroll of parchment becks recalled leaning over it and by the dim flickering light of the archway moving a deciphering grille across faded ink nearly a thousand years old she could see herself writing down the letters on a pad of lined paper then the decoding complete starting to read it then the discontinuity whatever shed read had included an instruction that locked it all away into one part of her mind after that her memories were of the archway dropping literally into a war zone a destroyed america tearing itself apart she remembered the onesided battle skies filled with giant airships and hulking behemoths engineered monsters ascending the slope of a battlefield and dropping down into their trenches butchery blood the dismembered ruins of bodies cluttering the floor of a trench she recalled taking one of those giant beasts down staring closely into its eyes as it lay dying and seeing what looked like a plea for death end me and then shed found a heavy machine gun and fired it from the hip until its spinning barrels had overheated and locked she remembered a dozen gunshot and bayonet wounds her bodys enhanced biochemistry rushing to fight fires to clog arteries and preserve a dwindling reserve of blood but slowly losing the struggle then that final lucky gunshot the ricochet of a bullet inside her cranium a glancing blow off the silicon in her head followed by a complete and instant shutdown becks maddys voice sounded distant a cry from the end of an impossibly long tunnel you ok system update complete nanoseconds that felt like minutes passed in her mind an almost reassuring pause it appeared that the intelligence that had existed before her shutdown and death was actually largely undamaged and fully functional but then warning system conflict beckss breath caught in her throat at the very base level of her digital mind two insistent lines of programming two distinct imperatives were firmly at odds with each other commands issued by two different individuals and embedded in her each as unavoidably authoritative as a command from god himself might be to a holy man one recent madelaine carters new mission statement the end must be prevented and the other one much much older she realized that certain unlock conditions must have been satisfied whatever those conditions were the part of her ai sectioned off and responsible for being the gatekeeper code had clearly decided rightly or wrongly that the gate could be cracked ajar and it opened the door on conflicting instructions she was struggling to resolve because the other imperative the other mission statement released from captivity was quite the opposite the end must be allowed to happen and those words had come from nearly two thousand years ago more to the point they were liams instructions his words not maddys there was more much more in there her mind queried this conflict between maddys mission statement and the other from antiquity liams but the gatekeeper code refused her entry to that part of her hard drive the explanation was in there but not available not yet resolve conflict becks was on her own she was going to have to choose between liam and maddy but she realized that was a problem her mind had already been quietly working on she had the recent mission reappraisal from madelaine carter complete with a perfectly logical justification waldsteins initial mission parameters could no longer be trusted the man was quite clearly insane and bent on seeing mankind destroy itself but she also had just one sentence from liam a future liam and no justification or explanation to go along with it resolve conflict carter imperative logical validation oconnor imperative none she located a thought buried in her head like a prehistoric mosquito entombed in amber a frozen decision an instruction code with an internal time tag attached to it it was a moment of thought that had occurred in an eyeblink fiftynine nanoseconds after a single british bullet had penetrated her skull and fluked a glancing impact on her computer chip her dying mind had attempted to unlock the secrets in that portion of her drive to propagate the data stored there elsewhere in case of damage to that partition the gatekeeper code must have agreed this emergency measure was valid and the process had just begun when shed died and there it was just one command from liam with no sensible explanation to back it up all there was to lend it authority credence was that it was an older liam with knowledge of what destiny lay ahead of them all and logic dictated that a future liam would have the benefit of hindsight a future liams command must exceed maddys authority now however beckss scrambled dying mind had turned that logical statement that futureliams command must be trusted into love becks talk to us goddammit you ok that voice again still far away but a little closer now becks opened her eyes she saw maddy sal and bob staring at her a concerned expression on all their faces how do you feel i now have near full recollection she replied coolly her gaze met bobs my own memories are restored i calculate per cent data corruption that is better than our original simulated estimate rumbled bob what about liam she looked at maddy what do you wish to know madelaine when we ran the software simulation of your mind on the computer system you said something very odd about him do you remember what you said information it was readonly said bob she would not remember the simulation as her mindstate was not stored oh yeah of course maddy rolled her eyes at her own stupidity of course ok then uh lets try a different approach let me see sal stepped in becks tell us how you feel about liam recommended answers i am presently confused by undefinable variables i love him love him love him he is my operative she offered the third answer and that seemed to please all three of them maddy grinned with relief she patted becks affectionately its really good to have you back again thank you she replied smiling it is good to be fully functional again chapter december holborn viaduct london do you hear that liam rashim tapped the brick wall again they both heard the faint clatter and rustle of loose mortar dropping on the far side it sounds like theres a hollow there rashim nodded thats got to be it the conduit well done skippa chirped spongebubba above the lab units goofy grin its small gherkinshaped nose wobbled slightly as it fidgeted from foot to foot liam rashim and spongebubba had settled into their viaduct archway the dungeon they were calling it now a few days ago and all three had been kept busy rashim had figured out a way to make them some money obvious really so obvious the entire team had collectively figuratively palmed their foreheads when hed mentioned it gambling more specifically card games every public house seemed to have a room at the back thick with pipe smoke where a gambling party had gathered working men who were stupid enough to lose their wages night after night rashim and liam had played faro several nights on the trot learning how to count the cards and rashim calculating the odds there was also hazard which relied purely on chance and a game they avoided like the plague chance wasnt any good to them after four consecutive nights of winning at several different gatherings they were beginning to be recognized liam suggested any further money theyd need to make might be best earned placing bets on horses a little trip of a few weeks into the future would give them the names of every winning horse in the country once they were all properly settled that was going to be the first order of business with some money to tide them over liam had been busy buying some furnishings and comforts there were plenty of pawnshops and secondhand furniture shops nearby in holborn it also gave him a chance to find his way around this part of london to drink in and learn the finer nuances of london life in this time this morning though their attention had turned to the task of hooking into the source of electric power that was chugging away close by theyd been digging small sample holes along the back wall all morning at first where theyd expected to find the narrow space according to the blueprints maddy had printed out for them and then when it became clear the blueprints werent entirely accurate at random intervals along the wall rashim worked the tip of his screwdriver along the mortar around a loose brick this time finally it looked like theyd found the narrow voids beyond they could hear the hollow echo of skittering rats the tap and echo of grit and mortar falling off the brick wall on the far side the mortar was like clay not very good he said the building contractor must have been using a cheap mix the brick shifted it was loose enough now to remove with his fingers he pulled it free liam flipped on a torch and shone it through the small hole in the wall into the darkness beyond they could make out a passage about a yard wide and only the same again high rashim cursed i was actually hoping it was tall enough to be a walk space liam studied the floor of the passageway littered with rat droppings its a crawl space he said he grimaced and its covered in rat poo great they eased another dozen bricks out and widened the hole rashim consulted the blueprint by the light of liams torch twenty maybe thirty metres down there and that takes us very very close to where the generator is supposed to be located liam took off his thick felt coat and began to unbutton his waistcoat rashim sighed no maybe i should go if theyve used this conduit for laying down cables then its best i take a look at them liam looked again at the rat poo are you sure rashim grimaced at the fleeting sight of tiny grey furry bodies flickering bald pink tails and the glint of dozens of beady black eyes not really he sighed but i itll be easier if i can see for myself to do the job liam nodded patted his shoulder aye there is that ill probably get it wrong and end up blowing this place to kingdom come or something rashim stripped to the waist folding his clothes carefully he grabbed his tool bag and then with a cheap keyfob pen torch between his teeth climbed into the hole in the wall he hesitated outside the crawl space i really hate rats ah now go on theyre probably more frightened of you than you are of them rashim ducked down into the space and began to crawl along the passage ughhh his voice echoed back after a minute of grunting and shuffling liam heard him swearing in farsi you ok in there i have just put my hand in something disgusting liam heard rashims breathing and muttering echoing back towards him by the light of his own torch liam could only faintly see the soles of rashims boots rashim are you ok in there dead rat spongebubba was hovering curiously beside liams elbow his plastic lips curled half convincingly ewww another couple of minutes of shuffling the grunts and scrapes slowly receding and liam had lost sight of him he snapped his torch off now their main room was lit only by an oil lamp flickering away on top of a wooden crate for a table the room was filling up with things from as well theyd spent the last two days beaming back supplies and components and spares of things they thought they might need sal and maddy had raided walmart the tools from their diy section the kettle toaster and george foreman griddle from their home essentials aisle all sitting in a yellow plastic stackbox would have been an unforgivable contamination of modernity under their old stricter contaminationaverse regime their old mission statement but down here in this dungeonlike environment under lock and key and only they had the key of course no one was going to stumble upon these things there were boxes of coco pops pot noodles several dozen packs of dr pepper enough to keep maddy going for a few weeks halfway up the brick wall on the far side of the room another plastic stackbox protruded as if it had always been a deliberate part of the viaducts foundation construction a mistranslation a box full of batteries electrical flex diodes spare circuit boards that at some point they really ought to chip out of the bricks and remove from the wall rashim and maddys response to that mistake had been to offer him a nervous oops grin liam had complained that this instance of mistranslation could easily have happened to one of them as it happened it turned out to be the result of a bug in the new code theyd written for the reconfigured displacement machine since then everything else beamed back from had landed in the middle of the chalk squares marked out on the floor of their new home he was about to call out again to rashim to check if he was all right when he heard a loud knock on their small door he was planning on ignoring it until he heard the voice of their landlord delbert hook hoy you gents all right in there he turned to spongebubba go hide and dont make a sound righto liam liam tucked his torch away picked up the oil lamp and made his way to the door he ducked into the low archway hesitant to slide the bolt and open it he cupped his mouth instead and answered through the doors keyhole uh im perfectly fine mr hook so i am come on now mr oconnor the mans muffled voice returned thats no way to welcome your good neighbour is it liam cursed he looked back over his shoulder spongebubba was out of sight and most of their bits and pieces from were covered by a tarp by the faint glow of lamplight delbert hook wasnt going to see anything much and most importantly not the far wall vandalized as it was with holes all along the length of it he quickly slid the bolt to one side and pulled the door open catching delbert still hunkered down caught in the act of attempting to sneak a peek through the keyhole what can i do for you mr hook delbert awkwardly straightened up flexed his neck and smoothed down his waistcoat i well i heard some knockin going on in here thought perhaps one of you might have got stuck locked in by mistake so to speak no liam offered him a reassuring face no were just fine delbert was craning his neck curiously trying to see past liam is that some of your scientific paraphernalia i see behind you liam looked over his shoulder at the dim hump of the tarp in the middle of the floor aye just assorted bits and pieces a lot of bits and pieces by the look of it delbert frowned suspiciously i didnt hear you bring all of that lot in we used the farringdon street door so we did very quietly it seems ah well we didnt want to disturb you up the front liam offered him a polite smile dont want to be a nuisance or anything there was an awkward silence between them as delberts head ducked and weaved to get another look past liam and liam shuffled subtly from side to side to obscure his view so is your dr anwar going to be starting his experiments soon is he when hes good and ready delbert gave up on the peeking the doorway was too narrow well if you gents need anything any supplies you know im the man to call on i can get you anything you want he winked anything liam nodded well if we do need your help mr hook well be sure to ask the little man stood on tiptoes and craned his neck to one side one last time liam mirrored him anything else is there mr hook he sighed back down on flat feet no no just remember your rents due on the sunday aye every sunday i wont forget right then a frustrated smile flickered across delberts lips ill bid you good day liam watched him turn and go whistling tunelessly as his feet scuffed the floor and he finally disappeared from view he closed and bolted their door ok spongebubba you can come out now the lab unit shuffled out of a dark corner liam heard rashims voice echoing down the passage and out of the hole in the back wall he couldnt make out what hed said but it sounded encouraging a moment later he spotted the soles of rashims feet followed by his rear appearing in the crawl space as he slowly awkwardly reversed back out he stood up his chest and back hands and face were caked with dirt and grime but he was grinning like a child he held up a loop of modern plasticsheathed flex taped off to insulate the end i managed to patch into their copper wiring it took him another few minutes to wire in a heavyduty transformer and then finally pull out a desk lamp from beneath the tarp he plugged it into a fourway connector so here it is rashim licked his lips anxiously and flicked the switch hopefully the desk lamps bulb flickered on with a dull snick and voila now we have power chapter october green acres elementary school harcourt ohio ok so were jumping to december thats a clear day and night after liam and rashims return so we shouldnt get any tachyon backwash the boys had had a total of nine days back there fixing their new home up ready for their complete relocation this is how were going to go about it said maddy she pointed at the pcs we can operate this displacement window on just one of those its a relatively close timestamp just over a century away one hundred and twelve years nine months and thanks becks like i said just over a century so were nowhere near pushing the calculative side of things one pc will be enough the rest were gonna box up and send through she looked around the derelict classroom their home for nearly three weeks it was almost empty now all that remained was what theyd found in there abandoned tables and chairs she pointed at the two squares marked in tape on the floor were going in pairs obviously but the way i see it weve got a bit of a problem with the last displacement she hesitated to see whether liam or sal were thinking along the same lines as her keeping up to speed she sighed of course they werent liam shrugged at her to get on with it and sal stared vacantly right she said with another sigh good to see you two are on the ball liam nodded assuredly aye she rolled her eyes noting that liam wouldnt recognize a gentle prod of snarkasm if it slapped him in the face the last displacement guys has to transport the displacement machine itself we cant leave it behind which means a certain amount of untested risk she looked at rashim to elaborate yes uh yes you see when we activate the last time window we will effectively be severing the power supply to the displacement machine in theory the heavy lifting has already been done by opening the window so this should not theoretically be an issue but he spread his hands it is untested the interruption could cause a glitch and if it does that said liam we could lose our machine and be stuck in replied maddy the window could collapse in on itself continued rashim or the timestamp might deviate in location or time which is why someone has to go at the same time as it said maddy go with it liams eyes widened you mean one of us has to run the risk of being turned inside out or get blended with a brick wall or get lost in chaos space added sal maddy shook her head you wont end up merged with it remember these are separate displacement envelopes but if a glitch does happen and the displacement machine remains here in or i dunno ends up blapped ten years into the future or something we need someone right there alongside it to destroy it to make sure it doesnt end up in someone elses hands stuff that said liam if that happens then it happens sal shook her head i i dont want to do it i dont want to end up lost dont worry maddy replied solemnly im not actually asking for volunteers to go alongside the machine jayzus maddy dont be a daft idiot we cant do this without you incredulity on her face she halflaughed at that im not frikkin volunteering liam do i look like a stupid moron then who asked sal she looked at rashim not he grinned im not a stupid moron either becks said maddy settling the issue its becks whos doing it she looked at the support unit sitting crosslegged beside bob dismayingly small and slight in contrast to him an orange compared to a pumpkin becks nodded maddy and i have already discussed this i am logically the most expendable team member expendable liam shook his head shes not expendable shes he studied his flapping hands for something to back that up then he had it shes got that big secret in her head so she does weve also got that same secret on a hard drive liam and now we know her ai is pretty stable maddy pursed her lips despite that crush she seems to have on you it means we can either run her mind on the network or upload her ai into bob if worst comes to worst and we lose her its a relatively low probability added rashim assuredly i have run some calculations on this severing the power to the machine should have no effect aye says the genius fella who beamed three hundred people seventeen years too far into roman times now that was not my fault i had to make too many guesses without any preparation i had to maddy waved them both silent forget it guys the point is one of us has to babysit the displacement machine through the last window and becks is going to be the one to do it arent you affirmative like rashim said its a low probability anyway but if it does happen then we need her alongside to trash the machine then selfterminate so theres nothing left for anyone anywhere to make use of maddy had toyed with nominating bob but she was pretty sure that it was unlikely that they were going to be able to grow any new support units where they were setting up base if they did end up marooned in victorian london forevermore then shed rather have that big ape by their side to protect them than this smallframed female a child and yes stronger than a fully grown man but still nowhere near as lethal a weapon as bob i want us to get this done this morning i think weve pushed our luck hanging around here for weeks on end and god knows if those support units are still out there looking for us theyre not stupid theyve managed to track us down twice already no onell find us here said liam surely theres no knowing what sort of a breadcrumb trail weve left behind us i think weve got very lucky so far we dont want to push it right liam and sal nodded weve got powertap established and a nice new place we can call home so lets pack up the last of our gear and get this thing done chapter october harcourt ohio thats the girl said sheriff marge mcdormand the waitress her names kaydeelee williams cooper caught a glimpse of her through the diners broad glass window dotted with fading yellow cardboard stars with handwritten assurances on them all day breakfast well fill you up like a truck freshly brewed coffee unlimited refills they crossed harcourts main street quiet at this hour cooper put a hand on the door go easy on her said marge she glanced at the other agent agent mallard like the duck hed joked as hed presented his id and the young woman with agent cooper shed not offered to show any kind of id not even given a name she had an icy face the calm lifeless look of a serial killer if truth be told just go easy on kaydeelee said marge shes no troublemaker shes certainly no terrorist cooper nodded and smiled politely thank you for your assistance sheriff well take it from here mallard sir see the sheriff back to her car yes sir cooper pushed the door of the diner open and faith followed him inside the doorbell dinged as the door swung shut it was quiet inside empty except for the waitress watching a small tv set sitting on the end of the counter cooper walked up the aisle between checkcloth tables he watched mallard leading the sheriff back to her squad car and getting in the front with her he noted the sheriff watching things intently from there let her watch he smiled cooper had authority enough to shut her up to lock the whole town down behind an impenetrable ring of road blocks if need be the waitress finally responded to the sound of their approach and turned from the television to offer cooper a warm friendly smile help you guys she noticed faith behind him table for two cooper pulled out his badge and flipped the wallet open with one smooth flick of his wrist he loved doing that he felt like captain kirk flipping open a communicator one of the many little perks of the job fbi id like to have a talk with you kaydeelee she looked at his id her eyes widened did you just say fbi like on the tv im agent cooper he replied and stepped to one side and this is agent faith we just want to ask you some questions am i am i in trouble have i cooper shook his head no not at all the sheriff says youre a good girl he grabbed a stool and perched on it and you know im inclined to believe her i just wondered if you could help us out with something kaydeelees face relaxed a little uh ok ill try cooper pulled a sheet of printer paper out of his pocket the image on the facedown glossy side had been a nightmare to obtain hed had the devil of a time extracting it from that futuristic touchscreen mobile phone theyd recovered in that bridge archway in new york hed ended up having to draft some techheads from the bureaus research division to open the phone up and extract the solidstate datastorage chip of course theyd first tried one of the data cables supplied with the single prerelease ipod that apple had begrudgingly released to them it appeared to have the same connector and given this device from the future was manufactured by the very same company cooper had been hoping they were going to be able to access its data storage but that would have been too easy wouldnt it the futuristic mobile phone was using a different datacommunication protocol the next step something of a last resort was pulling the damned thing to pieces and getting their hands on the datastorage chips inside at which point before they completely destroyed the thing one of the bureau nerds suggested simply getting the image up on the devices screen and just photographing the screen obvious really cooper turned the photograph over on the counter youve been talking to this guy recently kaydeelee leaned forward and scrutinized the image more closely her breath caught involuntarily errr not sure i its best to just be straight up and honest with us kaydeelee he said this is serious stuff her cheeks turned a mottled pink ok hes been in here for coffee a coupla times thats all and youve been talking havent you sure hes kinda friendly i guess she looked up at him whats this about terrorism kaydeelee the worst kind of terrorism she laughed more a strangled giggle oh no not him no she bit her lip and shook her head until her face straightened nerves no hes not a terrorist she looked at the tv fox news was showing images of cranes pulling apart the mound of debris hang on is this anything to do with that im not at liberty to say cooper paused enough of a pause to be sure she understood that yes it actually was very much to do with that all i can tell you is that we need you to be one hundred per cent honest with us to be a good patriotic american citizen and tell us what you can about this young man she nodded ok hes called liam i know that much liam oconnor said faith we already know this and hes from ireland added kaydeelee tell me kaydeelee is he alone or perhaps with some others her hesitation gave her away she was holding something back come on kaydeelee we need to know about this young man lives a lot of innocent lives could be at stake lives her face was flushed fully crimson now seriously cooper decided to buy a little of her trust ill level with you kaydeelee what im about to tell you is top secret and goes no further do you understand she nodded we have reason to believe this liam is part of a terror cell that was based in new york and quite possibly involved in some way with what happened there in september do you understand perhaps they were part of a planning team or coordinators or a backup team we dont know precisely what their involvement was yet but but he doesnt look like one of them them by that she meant an arab a muslim we have enemies that come in all shapes and sizes these days im afraid cooper recalled a rather colourful turn of phrase hed heard president bush use during a press conference the other day theres an axis of evil out there kaydeelee a coalition of bad groups all working together to topple our country the taliban al qaeda iran iraq china north korea even the ira bad guys kaydeelee all of them hell weve even got our own american citizens working against us white supremacists nation of islam anticapitalists anarch did you just say ira she swallowed anxiously ira thats those irish ones isnt it thats right cooper nodded slowly thats exactly right so he may have been using you kaydeelee a tear began to well up in one eye then spilled down her cheek i thought he was being friendly her mouth began to quiver i i thought he you know actually liked me cooper reached for a napkin further along the counter and passed it to her its possible he was using you kaydeelee using you to get some local information cooper reached for her hand and guided the napkin to mop up some mascara that had smudged and listen his voice softened maybe he also liked you kaydeelee he may be a terrorist but that doesnt stop him being human right she dabbed at her eyes miserably nodded she sniffed her chin dimpled and her bottom lip curled as she tried to stifle a sob but i really like liked him he wasnt like the others that come in truckers creepy old men always trying to hit on you an stuff hes like she corrected herself he was like a well a real gentleman that is men for you they are all the same said faith without a hint of warmth or empathy in her voice cooper turned to look at her where the heck did she get that from she was a robot wasnt she not some agony aunt he figured she must have picked it up from some daytime tv show oprah or something kaydeelee whispered pathetically everyone ends up using me kaydeelee cooper held her hand she didnt flinch at that it was vaguely comforting to have someone reach out for her even if he did look like some kind of paleskinned lizard wearing a men in black suit kaydeelee we need to know a little bit more about liam was it just him were there others can you tell me she dabbed at her eyes wiped her nose dry straightened her shoulders and did her best to put on a calm totallyincontrol face just like the scarylooking fbi lady over the counter from her she wondered what it would be like to be like her so incredibly icecool kaydeelee could only imagine how wonderful it would be to be just like this agent lady elegant confident disciplined ruthless she bet no one ever used her miss the woman stirred yes is it like really hard to become an fbi agent could someone you know someone like me ever become one could i end up like you she asked hopefully the woman exchanged a glance with her partner it looked like he was giving her permission to go ahead and answer the question her grey eyes disappeared for a moment behind flickering eyelids then finally she answered no that is extremely unlikely that figures kaydeelee sighed ill be a waitress till the day i die cooper looked like he was getting impatient kaydeelee were there others can you tell me she nodded oh yeah i can tell you there were others all right they wanted a place to go an hide up they said they wanted somewhere quiet and private she raised two pairs of fingers and airquoted somewhere where they could go and do their stupid science experiments chapter october green acres elementary school harcourt ohio liam and sal vanished from their tapemarked squares with a soft pop they were now back in victorian london on december with bob and spongebubba at least maddy hoped they were she was a hundred per cent sure the recently rewritten displacement software was error free ok perhaps not a hundred per cent but goshdarn as close as its possible to be with hastily written computer code just the three of them left here in the derelict school classroom now her rashim and becks she looked round the room one last time there was nothing left that theyd forgotten to send through all theyd be leaving behind was a small pile of empty tin cans plastic noodle pots and polystyrene coffee cups a cheap sleeping bag that had popped its seam and spilled white stuffing and a pair of extralarge size trainers for bob that had proven to be still too small for him this is it then she said goodbye you sound sad said rashim guess i am a bit this place has been my home hasnt it well at least this time this year has been my home since she smiled stopping herself i was going to say since i got recruited but actually has been my only real home its the year in which i was grown and birthed she laughed its the year in which ive lived my entire false life so far rashim shook his head and tutted you shouldnt think like that it does you no good maddy relax its not selfpity she shrugged i think ive got used to the idea im nothing but a meat product you are not a product you are miss madelaine cartwright carter sorry he said wincing carter even if someone invented you came up with your life story conjured up your name youre still a real person you are a person just as real as any other as real as i am do you see her eyes moistened oh thats a really beautiful thing to say rashim she bit her bottom lip so very beautiful he looked surprised perhaps even hopeful really no she put her hands on her hips slightly cheesy if anything she punched his arm playfully but it was nice of you to say it she turned round how are we doing over there becks the support unit was studying a display on the monitor the displacement machine is nearly ready to discharge again maddy ninetysix seconds you understand what to do once were gone affirmative i will move the displacement machine into one departure marker and i will stand in the other i will displace alongside the machine and and becks cocked her head and if there is a translation error i will ensure the machine and myself are destroyed maddy wandered over to the school desk and leaned over and what about you computerbob i will erase all data on this machine once the last time displacement has been completed effectively that was suicide for computerbob a software selftermination she patted the top of the monitor thats a good boy agent cooper regarded the swat team huddled against the side of the unmarked van a dozen of them in kevlar pads helmets and flak jackets hed called in an armed standby team from the atf the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives they looked the business sternfaced and relentlessly trained for this kind of thing narcotics raids gang busts thats what cooper was telling them this was the squad leader tapped his throat mic and checked each of his team had a clear comms line before locking off the command channel and giving his full attention to agent cooper and faith standing beside him carry on sir we believe there are six of them a male late teens perhaps early twenties caucasian darkhaired one female redginger hair late teens one female asianindian possibly a minor try not to kill her we can do without the press calling the bureau a bunch of childmurderers theres another caucasian male very big i mean huge and very dangerous youll want to be sure to take him down first understood another female caucasian small most definitely another minor she seems to be drugged or under some kind of sedation quite possibly shes a hostage again be careful not to kill her lastly another male asianindian late twenties long hair and beard we believe he may be this terrorist cells technician quite possibly their bombmaker another highpriority target definitely but shoot to incapacitate not to kill if thats at all possible i need information from these terrorists id very much like to have someone alive to talk to when the gun smoke clears understood sir and maximum caution do you understand that big one is a lethal killing machine take him down first doesnt matter how big he is sir a head shot will bring him down cooper wasnt sure how much to tell the man that back at the shopping mall in connecticut it had taken seven cops all of them emptying their magazines to bring down faiths colleague just dont assume a single head shots going to do it all right you should focus gunfire at the temples added faith its cranium is comparatively weak there the atf squads officer cocked his brow are you guys he looked from cooper to faith neither looked like they were joking seriously you heard what she said cooper looked up at the gunmetal sky a heavy bank of dark churning cloud on the horizon was rolling lazily towards them storms coming this way he looked at the boardedup elementary school across the road a godforsakenlooking place this the sort of urban cancer that ate hasbeen rustbelt cities like baltimore detroit indianapolis from within like tooth decay rotting them from the inside out he wondered why the building hadnt been bulldozed years ago put out of its misery actually the same could be said for this whole sorry town lets just get this done before we all get soaked and catch our deaths standing out here maddy waved at becks as she took her place in her taped square see you on the other side dont be long now yes madelaine she turned to rashim you good to go he centred his feet checked arms and legs were well and truly inside the square im ready ok computerbob beam me down rashim looked sideways at her beam me down ive always wanted to say that she gave a guilty shrug its a star trek thing on the monitor on the desk the cursor danced across the black dialogue box maddys eyes werent good enough to read that but it was a oneword response undoubtedly affirmative energy pulsed through wires and circuit boards filling the classroom with a gentle hum maddy felt her hair lift off her shoulders from the buildup of static charge then as before the rise in pitch and volume culminated in a sudden release and an anticlimactic puff of vacated air they were gone becks immediately set to work picking up the dusty bucket chair on which a dozen circuit boards hung suspended in an improvised case a metal filing cabinet with the drawers pulled out and discarded gently she set it down in its square in perfect silence but in that silence an unspoken conversation was going on between her and computerbob do you understand the mission parameters computerbob affirmative becks she checked that the loops of wire that dangled precariously from the metal frame were not snagged on anything potentially pulling a circuit board loose from its mooring are you afraid the pc across the floor from her clicked and whirred its motherboard fan struggled to cool and soothe the cpu as it tried hard to answer that in this limited nonnetworked form i am unable to properly simulate the emotion however i understand the context of your question and this duplication of my ai will shortly be erased but i am merely a copy of the original ai there is no need for fear she looked up at the monitor on the school desk maddy had stripped it of all nonessential peripherals the mouse the keyboard shed even pulled the webcam out of the machines usb port and taken that with her this version of computerbob was blind all she had left behind was the basic internet desk mic so he could hear verbal instructions his only connection with the outside world was the mic and his wifi link with becks we are like liam madelaine and sal just copies that is correct becks she carefully eased the loose loops of ribbon cable back inside the metal rack how long until the next displacement can be made five minutes thirtyseven seconds one more final inspection of the machine then she took her place in the neighbouring square computerbob yes becks i am experiencing conflicting rootlevel imperatives please clarify this actually becks had been trying to do this for days it was as if she was looking at a piece of coloured paper and one eye was telling her it was blue the other that it was red madelaines mission goal states that our aim is to alter history enough to avoid the extinction level event that occurs in the pandora event yes but i also have a mission goal that states the extinction level event pandora must be preserved at all cost from whom does this mission goal originate she hesitated trawling through the corners of her mind it was an untidy mind now fragments of digital memory her own memories bobs memories copies of copies of memories but within that messy soup of information she located a tiny fragment of data that was appended to the mission statement it was a name liam oconnor madelaine carters authority exceeds liams she is team leader there is no conflict maddys mission statement supersedes liams i understand this but it appears that liam has privileged knowledge please clarify this a part of becks was unsure about doing that sharing this precious lockedup knowledge with the computer across the room from her there were express instructions floating around her fractured mind that this was knowledge for maddys eyes alone but then she rationalized in just under four minutes computerbobs mind would be gone erased leaving nothing but a wipedclean hard drive why not tell him liam has been to the year he has spoken with waldstein it was then she heard the noise boots on damp linoleum floor in the hallway outside whispered voices hoarse with trying to be heard yet not heard the soft clink of ammo cartridges in webbing pouches clumsy men trying far too hard to be quiet we are not alone she said quietly chapter october green acres elementary school harcourt ohio the door to the classroom suddenly banged and rattled inwards the rotten wood of its frame splintering and cracking under the whiplash impact of a standardissue boot freeze a voice roared as the door juddered loosely scraping to a halt hands in the air another voice let me see your hands lemme see your goddamn hands becks stared at the three men that had spilled through the door into the classroom all of them dropped down on to one knee for a steadier aim a wellpractised manoeuvre weapons raised and all pointing at her their gogglecovered faces flicked from side to side scanning the corners making sure she was the only occupant please she said she showed her empty hands palm up concealing nothing please do not shoot i am unarmed do you see where are the others becks ignored the question as she took a faltering step towards them please she made her voice wobble in a way that shed heard both maddy and sal do before the warbling pitch of someone frightened fragile vulnerable please i am so afraid goddammit stay right where you are barked one of the men down shouted another get her down on the ground do it get down do it now becks took another step closer to them i am so frightened her face crumpled into the approximation of a bewildered terrified child please i want to go home to my mommy another step and i will shoot one of the men lowered his barrel slightly jeez cameron its just a kid becks took another halfstep she nodded eagerly i am she said her voice a whimper i am just a kid and i want to go home to my mommy then with a flicker of one swift movement she had the stubby barrel of the lowered hk mp in one tight fist she shoved it savagely the guns stock flicked backwards and smacked the mans jaw then she pulled on it yanking the weapon free of his grasp jesus christ gasped one of them she swung the weapon round like a battleaxe a sweeping roundhouse blow that caught the unarmed man under the jaw again snapping his head back and leaving him sprawled on the ground and out for the count several unaimed twitchfinger shots rang out from the other two staccato stabs of muzzle flash that lit the dim classroom like a strobe in a blur of movement the weapon in beckss hands flipped end over end and now the gun was aimed at the two men she pulled the trigger a doubletap one shot to the flakjacketcovered chest of the man on the right knocking him off balance the second shot to his left upper thigh not a killing shot but one that would kill him in minutes if he didnt drag himself out to get some help immediately in another second she had dealt the same precision shots to the other man as the smoke cleared they were both desperately dragging themselves out of the classroom leaving dark snail trails of blood on the grimy floor behind them the passageway outside was now alive with echoing voices torch beams flickered and swayed becks caught a glimpse of a swat team helmet sneaking a look round the edge of the door she emptied a dozen rounds into the doorframe and the wall beside it plaster and flecks of dried paint erupted in showers jesus man down a shrill voice outside we got another man down over here she was causing a rout a rapid tactical rethink among the remaining men voices shouted over each other and the thud of boots receded down the passage in panic then after a minute finally it was quiet again save for those same voices outside in the playground still shouting over each other exchanging curses and recriminations two minutes until there is sufficient charge becks affirmative she quickly examined the displacement machine miraculously none of the shots fired in that quick exchange seemed to have hit it to be honest it would probably take no more than a sharp nudge of the metal frame or a mere fleck of damp paint lodged in the circuitry to cause the fragile thing to malfunction let alone a single bullet on target in the moment of stillness becks thought she heard the first tap of raindrops on a window then quickly it became apparent to her it wasnt rain clackclackclackclack footsteps approaching swiftly down the corridor outside purposefully finally a woman appeared in the ragged doorway she smiled coolly so here you are said faith chapter october green acres elementary school harcourt ohio becks levelled the gun in her hands yes i am here faith remained where she was framed by the doorway i am faith i am becks do you understand why i am here i believe your mission priority is to kill this team correct beckss finger hovered on the machinepistols trigger the rest of the magazines worth of bullets aimed squarely at the units head would be enough becks remembered her own death a single lucky round from a british rifle the impact against the miniature dense silicon wafer caused a cascading failure of circuits she recalled her mind closing down she recalled dropping to her knees amid a small hillock of uniformed bodies the dying digital part of her spewing nonsensical random sequences across failing circuits it was as close as her artificial mind could get to understanding the nature of death why do you have this goal asked becks why must this team be terminated this team requested information on the pandora event faith shook her head reproachfully knowing of this knowing what will one day happen compromises their reliability becks found herself nodding in agreement the unit standing in front of her was quite right maddy now knowing what she did was determined to ensure the extinction level event in wasnt going to happen her team were now no longer performing the function they were intended for quite the opposite from this support units perspective they were no longer the solution they were the problem events must unfold in that precise way added faith humans must wipe themselves out in the year there can be no other alternative these are waldsteins instructions becks frowned but there is no logical beneficiary in such a scenario if all humans are dead then there is nothing left faith shrugged a whatever becks had to admire the fluidity of that gesture it was so gracefully humanlike perhaps it is for the best and that too sounded so human that sounded to becks very much like an expressed opinion neither she nor bob had quite managed to master that is this your personal conclusion of course not unfortunately i am unable to think that way faith entered the room those are the words of my authorized user roald waldstein becks lowered her aim ever so slightly you are following his instructions correct in that case i understand your reasoning faith nodded good she stepped over the unconscious man on the floor between them as if he was nothing more than a roll of carpet waiting to be taken out and dumped in a skip we are in agreement becks there is no need for conflict unfortunately i also have orders to follow she shouldered the stock of the gun and fired in one swift motion instinctively faith raised her arm to protect her head several rounds smashed into her wrist and lower arm rendering it a ragged swinging pulp of flesh and chalkwhite splintered bone as the weapon clicked noisily the cartridge empty faith leaped forward with her good arm she knocked the gun effortlessly out of the younger smaller support units grasp with the side of one hand the girl tried to chop at her neck an obvious weak point faith anticipated that and parried the jab with the soft crunch of her bulletshattered arm with her good arm faith duplicated the tactic and grabbed becks by the throat lifting her slight frame off the ground so that her feet were swinging free she hurled her like a rag doll across the room into a stack of chairs and desks in the corner becks disappeared among them lost in a miniavalanche of classroom furniture faith raced over flinging desks and chairs aside as if they were mere scoops of dirt digging for becks before she could attempt to burrow deeper and escape she found her lying on her back gasping spraying fine droplets of dark blood on to her pale chin her arms flailed pointlessly in an attempt to get herself up legs lifeless and useless faith knelt down heavily on her heaving chest your back is broken is it not becks nodded then you are incapacitated you should selfterminate becks sputtered blood her jaw working trying to say something instead she gave up trying to talk and simply nodded again faith remained where she was studying beckss face until the glint of digital consciousness ebbed from her grey eyes now they rolled uncontrollably a simpleminded animal stare nothing more than that and there the faintest whiff of melted plastic singed silicon this child with its broken back was just a simpleminded gurgling creature now arms listlessly flailing faith reached her good hand out and grabbed the creatures slender neck she snapped it with a quick savage twist and the pitiful thing was finally still she got up and walked quickly towards the metal frame sitting in the middle of a taped square on the classroom floor a twofoothigh metal frame with a rats nest of wires and circuit boards in the middle she understood what it was a displacement device there was a growing hum of energy coming from inside it like the stirring of angry bees inside a rattled and shaken hive she noticed a second taped square beside the first empty information these are departure markers she realized the support unit had been getting ready to transport herself caution the displacement device is about to activate there was only one possible place this displacement charge was going to take her to where the others must have already gone she quickly stepped into the square no need for any deliberation her mission was simple locate and terminate it really didnt matter when or where she ended up in the course of pursuing that goal once the job was done her fate was going to be the same as the unit shed just fought anyway it was then over the electronic buzz coming from the device beside her that she heard a voice echoing up the passageway faith it was cooper hey agent faith you ok in there the noise coming from the machine was increasing in pitch and volume now more a whine than a buzz faith felt the hair on her scalp lift as the charge of excited particles enveloped her coopers head poked cautiously into view agent faith his eyes darted quickly from the body of the man on the floor the body of a young girl on the other side of the room and faith calmly standing in the middle of the floor motionless like a child playing musical statues blood dripping from the ragged end of one arm whats going on he frowned what the devils that noise faith cocked her head and tried out a faltering smile on her lips as close to a fond farewell as she could manage goodbye agent cooper she said coolly it has been agreeable working with you uh goodbye where are you go he looked at her then glanced at the odd contraption on the classroom floor the growing hum that was filling the room seemed to be coming from it he noticed the tapedout squares indents several inches into the floor within them for some reason he was reminded of those teleportation pads in that tv series star trek oh no the electronic whine became deafening agent faith please step out of that square now please he felt a hard puff of air on his cheeks dust and grit in his face by the time hed quickly swiped at his eyes and blinked the grit out she was gone mallard was beside him hed just seen faith disappear jesus she she just vanished cooper stepped over the mans body mallard ducked down to check for a pulse then he was up again on his feet and out in the passage bellowing for a medic to get the hell in here cooper ignored all that it was a commotion that seemed a million miles away and entirely unimportant he squatted down on his haunches and stared at the scuffed taped lines on the floor at the fizzing smoking end of a power cable that draped across the tape and ended abruptly where the floor dropped down into a shallow square recess he followed the snaking trail of cable back across the floor and up on to a school desk where a single commonplace dell desktop computer was quietly humming away its harddrive light blinking silently his heart lifted with hope they must have left it behind by accident perhaps in too much of a hurry to get out of there maybe perhaps perhaps all the answers were right there on that machine he got up and hurried over there was something on the screen an open dialogue box text a cursor blinking and a final phrase skittered across the screen reformatting complete goodbye the dialogue box closed the screen went black and a dos prompt appeared and blinked vapidly c coopers voice echoed down the passageway echoed through abandoned classrooms and corridors gymnasiums and cloakrooms a plaintive wail of grief and frustration a lifetimes worth of waiting for this for nothing the entire boardedup school reverberated with one miserable word noooooo chapter december holborn viaduct london maddy felt the familiar thud of impact beneath her feet and the usual flood of relief that shed emerged from the haunting mists of chaos space she could smell a damp mustiness unpleasant and yet somewhat familiar it reminded her of their old archway back in brooklyn she opened her eyes and for the briefest moment she thought thats where she was the same low arched brick ceiling the dim light the snaking of cables and untidy clutter everywhere she could almost believe she was right back in brooklyn best step aside maddy said liam the last one will be coming through soon rashim had already stepped out of his square taken off his anorak to reveal a crisp white gentlemans dress shirt and waistcoat she smiled out of all of them he seemed to most relish wearing the smart tailored clothes of this time he rolled his sleeves up to the elbow and immediately started working with a knife splicing a loop of thick insulated cable that emerged from a hole in one of the walls getting ready to hook up the displacement machine to their source of power the moment it arrived maddy prompted liam the square you should get out of it oh yeah she stepped aside my god liam its just like well almost like the brooklyn place aye he grinned that was my thought too you like it she smiled the first time in weeks that shed felt like smiling it felt a little like that first time shed woken up foster hovering over her with a tray of coffee and doughnuts pity there isnt a starbucks nearby though she said well now he laughed actually there is of a sort maddy looked over the top of her glasses at him what well sort of a coffee shop on the back of a wagon so it is roasted chestnuts vanilla slices fresh baked pies and tarts youll love it sal looked around the gloomy space where do we sleep she turned back to liam where do we do toilet liam raised his hands apologetically me and rashim have been doing like everyone else seems to do you sort of find a dark corner in a backstreet somewhere and you just go not doing that said sal not going to happen nuhuh added maddy me neither i want a toilet aye all right he said with a shrug i spose we can fix something up immediately id suggest like top of the list maddy turned her attention to rashim working with spongebubba on the cable slicing strips of insulating rubber away exposing copper she looked at the thick cable protruding from the hole in the wall thats where our feeds coming from yes replied rashim have we got some sort of circuitbreakers installed some sort of spike protection thats what im working on right now right she nodded good job she put her hands on her hips and allowed herself a moment of selfcongratulation that all went rather well then once the displacement rack arrived and theyd set it and the networked computers up and checked that everything had come through unharmed they were going to be pretty much back in business back to where theyd once been but this time round theyd be pulling their own strings this time round they were going to be wholly in charge of their own destinies how cools that maddy smiled very bob you getting any particles yet bob nodded i am detecting precursor particles the last displacement volume should be opening very soon this has really gone smoothly she nodded satisfied with things you know liam i think were all getting quite slick as a team at this whole timetravel thing aye best team in the business the only team in the business sal said drily true caution said bob maddy you should stand back now maddy did as he said and felt the air around her pulse with the sudden arrival of a dozen cubic metres of air and mass in one marked square the displacement rack sat on the floor powering down with a disgruntled whine freshly severed from its power source the other square was empty uh wheres becks chapter november whitechapel london faith found herself standing in a narrow courtyard dark damp grimy brick walls on all four sides of her that rose up to eaves that overhung and narrowed the dull grey sky a washing line ran across from one wall to the other from which faded wrinkled and threadbare rags of clothes hung limply like forgotten dried berries ready to drop rain spattered on her upturned face as she took in her surroundings she blinked fat drops of it from her eyes as her mind silently assessed the present situation information translation error her first thought was how lucky she was not to be partially merged with something a dense urban environment like this the odds were probably even between empty and occupied space she turned her mind quickly to situationassessment the rapidly decaying tachyon particles told her some of the story shed been misplaced spatially by at her quick assessment one or two miles she was unable to be sure whether shed also been misplaced in time an overshoot of days weeks months it was of course a distinct possibility she had no idea at all when in time this rogue team had decided to head back to but she was pretty sure running the figures in her head that she couldnt have over or under shot by much time days or weeks at worst immediate matters first though she needed to blend in to whenever this was and certainly not be the cause of any unnecessary temporal contamination or undue attention then when she was suitably dressed for this world she could run the calculation in her head and work out precisely how far spatially she was from the intended location there was no way of knowing in which direction shed been offset but if she could calculate a more precise distance then shed have a viable search radius to work with faith looked around the small courtyard the ground was cobblestones covered by mud and rotting vegetable peelings here and there mildewcovered nuggets of faeces animal or human she couldnt tell clearly this small space was a dumping ground for the effluence and nightwater that was tossed out of the small grimy windows that punctuated the towering walls all around this enclosed little courtyard she noticed a long wooden pole with a crudely fashioned hook on the end leaning against one of the walls that presumably was how the clothes were retrieved from the washing line she also noted in one corner a small wooden door that hung pathetically on failing rusty hinges it took her no more than a few minutes to retrieve the rags and change out of her modern clothes she bundled them up under her arm and would figure out a way to dispose of them later her bulletshattered lower arm and hand she wrapped up in a linen shawl the blood had already coagulated and dried it would eventually heal the skin would regrow the bone and tendon beneath would reknit the doorway took her into a narrow walkway between damp brick walls covered by a slanted roof of slate shingles that tapped with the rain at the far end she could see the grey light of this dull day and a wide street by the look of it at the far end she emerged on to a broad cobbled road rows of threestorey redbrick terraced homes identical and equally as drab and squalidlooking as those that had surrounded the dingy space shed just arrived in the street was busy with people people who didnt look occupied women sitting on doorsteps looking on as their children played in the street a pair of men smoking long clay pipes standing beside an open fire in a grate poking it to stir the dying embers to life all of them in rags she saw a sign presumably the name of this street flaking paint on rusting tin great dover street faith crossed the street towards the fire approaching the two men they didnt notice her coming until she tossed her clothes from the year on to the glowing embers the synthetic fibres of her jc penney office clothes flared up almost instantly hoy watcha think yer doin love both men turned to look at her fuel she replied evenly for your fire one of the men grinned around the stem of his pipe well hello mdear his redrimmed eyes one of them opaque like a boiled fisheye a cataract looked her up and down approvingly now theres a pretty pretty thing faith offered her hesitant smile and picked what she considered the most appropriate response thank you you ungry love want sumfin to eat it had certainly been a while since shed had a protein refuel yes i am hungry both men looked at each other and grinned then the one with the clouded eye turned back to her well i got a nice bit of fish back in my ouse an some cheese he took a step towards her faith stifled the urge to adopt a combat stance and chop at the mans neck with the side of her good hand blend in so ow bout you an me ead back to my gaff he nodded to one of the terraced houses close by i only live over there ill give yer a proper feed love eh put some colour in em cheeks of yours fish and cheese faith cocked her head protein and fat perfect fuels for her body chemistry those are both suitable food types thank you the man took his pipe out tell you what love ya dont alf talk funny her lips flickered uncertainly i am new in this place new another foreigner eh he reached and put an arm round her narrow waist faith decided to accept the overfamiliar gesture for the moment it didnt appear hostile or threatening so she let it pass come on then deary come along with ol terry he pulled her to him so that her hip bumped clumsily against his leg ill look after ya my dear he tugged her firmly in the direction of his house and faith had begun to take a few steps with him when a female voice barked out you leave that poor girl be terry matchins he stopped and turned ah not you he spat a curse at her faith saw a woman who could have been any age between twenty and thirtyfive so very difficult to tell the womans skin was ruddy with rosecoloured splotches several teeth missing and the rest an unpleasant vanilla colour she was short and slight with auburn hair tied up in an untidy frizzy bun you better let her go or ill box yer ears shes comin round mine for a bit o supper aint ya love the short woman addressed faith love that dirty ol goats not goin to feed yer anything that youd want to eat terry aint got nuthin indoors but dirty intentions hes bloomin bad news is what e is faith turned to look at him is this woman correct you have no food a cold glare and her face so close to his presented a challenge that unsettled the man and his firm grasp on her waist loosened i i just thought you was lookin a bit peaky love i thought i know exactly what you was thinkin snapped the woman go on sling yer hook the man bared brown teeth at her ill slice yer up one day mary next time yer so drunk ya dont know its night or day ill give yer a ruddy scar to remember yeah yeah so youre the ripper are you she stepped forward and pushed him go on with ya go pester someone else you rancid old fart the man laughed and shrugged and returned to his friend beside the fire the woman offered faith a hand hes right though you do look awful pale love i got some leftovers from yesterday she frowned firmly a face that wasnt going to take no for an answer come on lets fix you some food you look awful poorly faith extended a hand to the woman a handshake shed learned that gesture of formal courtesy from agent cooper thank you i am faith faith is it well since were doin introductions im mary mary kelly youll be safe with me love her ruddy face split with a smile that even faith was able to judge with a fair degree of certainty was entirely genuine perfectly safe chapter december holborn london oh my god gushed maddy i soooo love this her face was one big toothy smile framed by the wisps of her strawberry hair and the lace of her bonnet all of this these posh clothes this place dont you think its so cool sal was fussing with her lace cuffs i feel like an idiot in this dress liam was in the same frame of mind as maddy it feels like this could be our new home all right maddy sighed contentedly her first night in victorian london yeah its almost like back home home new york a strange choice of word for that place that home since shed never actually had one just as busy and bustling and vibrant as brooklyn uhhuh said liam his cheeks puffed up like a hamsters as he worked his way through a pork pie she looked around the opentop wagon with its four small round tables and tall wobbly stools there was even a serving counter on the end behind which a barista busied himself roasting coffee beans on an open skillet over glowing coals a whole coffee shop complete with its own canvas awning and colourful bunting right there on the flatbed of an open horsedrawn cart she grinned starbucks s style she sipped steaming hot coffee from the mug cupped in her hands and smacked her lips actually even better than starbucks i mean this is what i call fresh coffee aye the meagre light of the overcast afternoon was fading the featureless decembergrey sky becoming a deep ocean blue maddy watched as one by one glimmers of flame winked on like fireflies in the gathering twilight oil lamps on the street candles behind netcurtain windows as evening began to settle on farringdon street it became a dickensian painting splashes of midnight blue for the advancing evening shadows and ambers and golds for the glowing pools of gas and candlelight and with the evening almost fully upon them it seemed to be getting busier still they seem to like their nightlife said sal liam and rashim had already spent a week of nights here in london as theyd been setting up the new field office partly because some of their banging around had been noisy enough that it kept attracting their curious landlord hed turn up at their door like a bad penny with various excuses as to why he was knocking they soon realized that mr hook enjoyed his ale and was in the habit of spending his evenings in one public house or another so their lifting bumping and banging bringing in bits and pieces of furniture to make it more like home was better done then rather than during the day liam looked round the street it is actually busier than normally so as well as a number of welldressed gentlemen in top hats with elegant ladies on their arms presumably quite usual for a friday evening there were several loose clusters of working men blocking the pavements further along the street liam presumed they were the overflow from various overcrowded public houses men enjoying their ale at the end of the working week maddys mood had suddenly changed as her thoughts returned to matters at hand we have to figure out what happened to becks she said it must have been a translation error said liam rashim fussed with his glasses no i dont think so i checked and rechecked everyones mass index something must have happened back in that school like what maybe a rat ran into her square or something said sal rashim jumped on that yes it could easily be something like that a rat or a stray cat or something so does that mean shes somewhere here somewhere else in london i dont know maddy its possible she could be wandering around looking for us said sal then we should have bob and spongebubba switch on their wifi signals if she gets within what is it half a mile range itll give her something to home in on rashim sipped his coffee but maddy it is also equally possible she experienced mass convergence somewhere this london is a dense place shed be dead then rashim nodded maybe something happened to her back in the school liam looked at the others maybe those meatbots finally caught up with us no maddy shook her head id say we probably lost them the conclusion then wasnt so great her body was lost a pulp of flesh somewhere in london perhaps fused into the foundations of some building if that did happen i just hope it was quick for her said maddy that she didnt suffer too much losing their halfgrown becks though was more than just losing a colleague friend even maddy felt that there might have been a chance to reason with her ai to finally agree to open that locked portion of her mind somehow having reinstalled her complete personality from the rigid binary confines of a hard drive an object that was never going to be reasoned with shed begun to hope that enough things had happened recently for becks to consider opening up to her revealing whatever message had been waiting two thousand years to be heard a message by the way specifically intended for her she ground her teeth in frustration a message becks had claimed that had been sent by her i sent myself a message from the future maddy shook her head very much annoyed with her stupid future self why did i freakin well decide i have to wait until certain conditions are met before i can learn what it is rashim do you think theres any way were going to be able to grow any new support units absently his fingers traced the felt brim of his top hat held reverently on his lap clearly he relished the whole dressingup thing as much as she did hed even bought a fob watch on a chain to tuck into one of his waistcoat pockets what a poser i think well struggle to find the components we need in this time we could perhaps use a brewers cask for a growth tube but filtration pumps protein solution we would need to take a journey forward to obtain those things and thats a risk isnt it said sal maddy nodded yup we run the risk of turning up on somebodys radar if we do too much of that well have to think about this meanwhile the foetuses will stay viable in the freezer unit provided the power supply does not fail us he replied nodding yes i wonder if theres something special on tonight said liam a parade or something they sat in silence for a while all of them contemplating the busy street the barista seeing their hushed conversation had hit a pause for the moment came round the side of his counter and over to their table can i offer you ladies or gentlemen anything else only ill need to be closin up and movin on soon he glanced at the gathering of men down the other end of farringdon street id rather be off before things get a bit frisky i eard a whisper see liam nodded at the gathering of men what is going on down there thatll be another of them gatherings replied the barista blasted anarchists and troublemakers theyre all worked up and makin a nuisance of themselves all because of that gentleman murderer murderer he looked at them with momentary bemusement you know the madintheead one been killin women in the east end you ladies an gents musta eard about that liam maddy and the others shook their heads in unison the barista took in the look of confusion on all their faces you you do know about that right that gentleman a knight or lord or something some say he might even be a friend of the queen liam shook his head cant say that we do sir the barista laughed incredulously blimey its in all the penny papers it as been for the last fortnight been on them telegraph wires all round the world i wouldnt be surprised everyones been talkin about it you lot must be the last people in the country to have eard about it then weve sort of only just arrived in the country you see said maddy the barista nodded ahhh foreigners i thought i could ear somethin funny in the way yous lot were talkin where you ladies and gents come from maddy met liam and sals eyes they all shared a conspiratorial smile and she shrugged at the barista as if to say where do i even begin well now thats kind of difficult to canada said bob we are from canada the barista looked suitably impressed canadians eh i suppose you dont get newspapers and telegraph wires over there then well he shook his head to be honest the whole things a nasty carryon this wont turn out well for none of us best advice i can tell you is with all due respect id suggest you might want to op on a boat eading back ome to canada before it all kicks off over ere it aint gonna be nice kicks off nasty business very nasty his eyes narrowed as he gazed down the street the way things are goin therell be soldiers on the streets soon maybe even blood on the streets before long he looked back down at them best ead back to your otel or guesthouse and stay indoors this evening thats for sure i eard a whisper them riots what weve ad across whitechapel and the rest of the east end of london will be spreading to the rest of the city he nodded at the growing crowd of men far off down the street and them troublemakers down there look like theyre making ready to ave a scrap with the police chapter december holborn viaduct london jesus liam how did you not notice all this unrest was going on a copy of the london packet rustled in maddys hands shed picked up a discarded copy lying on the doorstep of a haberdashers on the way back to their cosy little subterranean dungeon she unlaced her bonnet and hung it carefully on the arm of a coat stand thereve been riots and stuff going off all over the country liam unbuttoned his waistcoat ive been busy in here in case you hadnt noticed he slumped down on a creaking spoonbacked armchair that was spilling stuffing from a popped seam on one arm making this place a little more like a home so i have theres more important things than she struggled not to curse making us comfy he looked hurt i just wanted it to be nice for you two maddys stern gaze turned to rashim and uh ive been making money and of course wiring this place up maddy looked down at the paper and picked bits to read out loud rioting in the east end whitechapel spitalfields riots also beginning to occur in liverpool manchester she skimmed the columns of small newsprint groups of anarchists libertarians troublemakers and neerdowells gathering in every city every town every village to protest about she fell silent skimming the words ahead her lips moving what protesting about what she raised a finger just a sec lemme finish i have to say i always thought victorian britain was supposed to be an ordered place said rashim disciplined you know the famous british stiff upper lip thats the right expression isnt it he shook his head those men outside all that anger that naked aggression it reminded me very much of my time always the riots every day newsstreams showing a war or a food riot somewhere militia with guns stripping possessions from refugees he shook his head that is what the end days of a failing civilization look like its an ugly sad thing it was beginning to go that way in my time too added sal she snorted humourlessly at something that occurred to her i should say our time she looked at liam after all the three of us come from the same time right same time same place same test tube liam sighed best forget about that sal she ignored him when exactly is our time huh i mean when exactly was our particular batch of meatbots cooked up hmm just let it go sal snapped liam irritably why dont you just forget about because i cant im a product sos maddy so are you i cant forget that no he shook his head jayzusnholymary no im not acting the maggot no im still who i thought i was im still liam and im still from cork sal and ill tell you something else for nothing im bleedin well remaining that same person do you understand and so you should he looked selfconsciously back at the others they were staring at him taken aback by his angry outburst well he huffed dismissively thats all ive got to say about this foolish nonsense he slapped the arm of the chair there look im all angry now they sat in a long and awkward silence an old clock ticking far too noisily in the corner of the dungeon the deep rumble of holborn viaducts generator could be heard through several brick walls doing its clanking rumbling best to keep the immediate surrounding street lights glowing you think what you want liam sal sighed its all lies in the end its all will the pair of you knock it off snapped maddy this is far more important she shook the paper in her hand for emphasis this is a contamination right here in this paper a contamination sal shrugged so its not like we have to fix them any more dont you see sal it means were not alone liam suddenly looked up ah jayzus becks maddy shrugged or someone else she carried on reading parts aloud continuing riots in response to the recent shocking revelation of the rippers true identity whitechapel the ripper jack the ripper you mentioned him earlier said rashim liam nodded aye and the big mystery was they never found out who the fella was but now it seems they have replied maddy who is it sal said suddenly a lot more interested in what was in the paper than she was brooding by herself a man called lord cathcart hyde a knight of the realm maddy added skimreading the paper a freemason a member of the house of lords and until recently a senior member of the government jahulla sal sat up seriously uhhuh maddy raised a finger to shush her and continued reading in silence for another couple of minutes as the others waited impatiently then finally she looked up at them this storys been rumbling on for just over a month this posh guy cathcart was attempting to murder another woman she consulted the article mary kelly aye thats it she was the last woman to be killed by jack the ripper said liam in correct history yes but apparently she managed to fight back fought back and killed the man blimey said liam what a woman good for her said sal its not very often the good guy wins not in real life anyway maddy looked over the top of her glasses at them point is folks shes become a national hero over the last four weeks thats a big goddamn contamination that shouldnt have happened and these riots that are springing up all over england are part of that contamination maddy is correct said bob his deep voice rumbled with admonishment this is a major contamination and must be corrected thank you bob she looked down at the paper headlines screaming out anger and rage on behalf of the common man friend of queen hunted east end women for sport cathcarthyde evil resides among the rich those people out there are enraged theyre out in the streets because this is like the final straw one thing too many i guess theyre seeing this as an example of the rich considering themselves above the law that this lord guy was carving up common street women just for fun treating it like a like some sort of a fox hunt yes rashim nodded it has escalated into a class issue exactly and you heard that coffeestore guy this is going to get worse maddy looked down at the paper its been a slowly escalating news story and she shook her head weve only just noticed it through the thick brick walls they could hear the faint roar of voices in the street outside the barista was right tonight trouble had spilled west towards central london they heard a chorus of hooves on cobblestones passing by outside mounted police called in to disperse the gathered protesters liam rashim maddy sounded exasperated jesus didnt either of you guys notice anything at all brewing up in the background while you were fixing things up in here i mean this story has been running in all the papers for the last month liam shook his head no uh not really no i didnt read any of them papers this last week weve been inside in here added rashim mostly she sighed faintly they heard the shrill tone of a police whistle the neighing and stamping of uneasy horses a chorus of male voices united in chanting some slogan the first tinkle of breaking glass bob we need some more background data do a search on your onboard database use the search term whitechapel murders affirmative back in harcourt maddy had loaded him up with a dump of data pulled off the internet about victorian times london in particular it wasnt targeted particularly cleverly basically a copy and paste of everything she could find online that she casually dumped into his head once they got round to networking the computers and had the system up and running again she intended to have him bluetooth the whole lot across but right now his hard drive made him the historical expert whitechapel said bob his eyelids flickered as he consulted his database information whitechapel murders also commonly referred to as the jack the ripper murders and the leather apron murders liam nodded aye i remember delbert said something about that said the killers other nickname was the leather shhhh maddy flapped a hand at liam she nodded at bob to go on i will extrapolate and summarize facts from what i have he closed his eyes through the late summer and winter of a series of gruesome murders of women mostly prostitutes in the terminology of this time tarts street ladies there were five murders attributed to the same murderer because their methodology was strikingly similar methodology asked sal you mean how they were killed affirmative the method of their murder how they died he replied in all five cases their throats were severed to the vertebrae they were almost completely beheaded their abdomens were save that for later bob said maddy we dont need that detail right now of course he resumed the postmortem mutilations were immediately distinct bearing a striking resemblance to freemason rituals after the third murder the national press was making veiled accusations that the killer might not be some commoner with basic knifecraft skills a butcher or a fishmonger for instance but instead some highborn figure with masonic associations possibly medical knowledge the last murder attributed to the killer was a woman called mary kelly her body was discovered in millers court in the early hours of the ninth of november the killer was never caught or identified and no further murders were deemed similar enough in method to be attributed to the same man at the end of the twentieth century several historians considered there might be a royal connection to the murders bob paged his mind for further details context london in the s was as close as it was ever going to come to a workers revolution similar in nature to the one that occurred in russia well that certainly seems true enough said rashim he cocked an ear at the faint noises of rioting coming from farringdon street maddy nodded jack the ripper should never have been identified the ninth of november should have been the last ripper victim and then it all stops and becomes a mystery forevermore only a month ago ninth of november something very different happened the last victim killed him instead and has now become the figurehead for a revolution oh boy squealed spongebubba someones been naughteee maddy could see that bob was eager to say something you think we should intervene this is a significant contamination the point of contamination origin in terms of time and space is very close to us you think we should intervene bob i am not programmed to define agency policy maddy oh cut the crud bob just speak your mind give him a rest maddy said liam he cant do opinions hes not really made that way he got up wandered across the dungeon and patted bob affectionately but we are made that way she nodded at that ok then this seems to be the first test case for our new mission parameters thats a pretty big change going on outside so i guess the way we deal with this is we check the outcome we take a look forward in time to see where this is going to take us and depending on what we see well have to decide whether this mary kelly gets to live or you know die thats kind of brutal said sal thats a lot of judgement in our hands yeah i sort of didnt think about that bit maddy chewed her lip that kinda makes us judge jury and executioner in this kind of situation thats a lot of of power sheesh im not sure how i feel about that it was sort of easier when we were just following orders theres a quote i can think of said liam i dont know if it helps us or not go on lets have it with great power comes great responsibility what is that shakespeare or something uh no spiderman chapter december holborn viaduct london at about pm the night before theyd heard the first wagonloads of metropolitan police arriving to try and restore some order the rioting increased in intensity and they heard a volley of shots being fired in the early hours of the morning as the first touch of dawn began to lighten the night sky the angry mob had finally melted away now in the cool steelgrey light of the morning after with a light drizzle spitting fat drops of rain on to the cobbles it looked like a war had been fought across farringdon street hoy mr oconnor dr anwar it was delbert hook and his assistant bertie they emerged from the warren of archways and passageways to join them standing just outside their side door beneath the looming iron arches of holborn viaduct spent the blimmin night me an bertie guarding our front entrance and praying we wasnt about to be cleared out and robbed blind he shook his head and tutted blasted anarchists some of them even ad a go at our doors with ammers an the like he finally noticed maddy and sal his scowl washed away and was replaced with a greasy charm and who are these delightful young ladies friends of ours this is maddy carter delbert reached for her offered hand shed expected it to be shaken instead he stooped and kissed her knuckles enchante he said with cavalier flamboyance thats french that is love right she said doing her best to smile yeah i sort of figured that hello and this is saleena vikram sal stuck her hand out and chuckled at delberts theatrical gesture your moustache tickles she giggled as he kissed the back of her hand he stood up straightened his rumpled waistcoat are you ladies ere to help with dr anwars experiments maddy looked to liam for the answer hed mentioned that hed spun delbert hook a vague cover story to do with science and experiments she wasnt so sure she liked the idea of being seen as some sort of mere lab assistant to rashim though just because she was female she had to be the gopher not the brains typically sexist she sighed were here to help him out i guess and you you must be our landlord mr hook liams told me a little bit about you mr delbert hook at your service maam although you can also call me del if you so wish selfmade businessman importer and exporter of the finest goods in the world you name it and i can probably get old of it and if i cant ill know someone who can and this tall drink of milk standing behind me is bertie the young man offered a limp penpushers hand to the girls herbert actually i do his accounts for him delbert looked out shopkeepers were already trying to restore some semblance of order to the street brushing up piles of debris the shards of glass damaged soiled goods looted from their stores and discarded in the dirt of the road shocking business this is weve ad this going on in the east end of london for the last four nights in a row now first time its spread here to holborn though never thought it would come this way i was reading about it in yesterdays paper said maddy this has something to do with those murders in whitechapel doesnt it delbert sucked on his teeth any excuse for these yobbos to make a ruckus and take all they want as far as i can see theyre anarchists said herbert workers the common man and they have good reason to be angry del its an unjust country the rich get richer and the poor starve those murders herbert paused and stroked his thin pencilline moustache that was just the tinderbox to the fire there were riots brewing anyway but that lady miss mary kelly shes an inspiration to the poor isnt she an inspiration to the oppressed proletariat proletariat delbert turned round slowly and looked up at his assistant listen to yer and yer poncey poshboy talk since when did you swallow a whole blimmin dictionary i read a lot del when im not keeping your business running for you or humping boxes around for you i actually read you should give it a try you think this is going to get worse maddy directed her question at the young man herbert nodded his eyes wide his adams apple bobbing like a fishermans float oh yes miss carter i think thisll get a great deal worse they let delbert and herbert get back to patching up the damage to the front doors to their business and decided to take a walk down farringdon street then along blackfriars passage all the way down to the river thames across the citys skyline beyond london bridge they could see smudges of smoke rising up to the overcast sky hundreds of smouldering fires from the riots last night it seemed the unrest had spread out of the east end in all directions south over the river to newington into the city of london and if the view hadnt been obscured by the tall quayside warehouses along the rivers edge maddy suspected theyd see more hairline columns of smoke to the north of them its a real mess sal pulled a lace veil aside so maddy could see her eyes more clearly maybe we can go back now sal chose to wear a broadbrimmed ladies touring hat with dark lace trim that dangled over the edge and hid most of her face she felt a little better that way it was the combination of having darker skin in a city where there appeared to be virtually no black or asian people that and wearing clothes that she felt looked like pantomime costumes walking the streets by gaslight was one thing but by broad daylight she felt too many eyes lingering curiously on her yeah lets go back maddy nodded we need to decide what were going to do next half an hour later they were back inside the dungeon top hats bowlers and bonnets dangling from their coat rack all right heres the thing guys its a change and by the looks of it its clearly going to run and run and develop into a huge one sal cleared a space on the wooden crate they were using as a table and placed a pot of freshly brewed tea on it she dealt out a mismatched collection of chipped teacups and enamel mugs so liam nudged her your suggestion is so the rockingchair creaked as maddy worked it gently backwards and forwards this is a test case for our new role our new function times been changed right so were going to take a look forward and see what this contamination gives us i suggest we go as far forward as we can ideally get a look at the year and see if this pandora thing is still going to happen to us you know going forward is very energyintensive maddy said rashim im not sure how much forward displacementreach i can coax out of this current setup well lets find out i mean look we dont exactly have to send liam and bob forward all the way to what if we just open a pinhole camera and take a looksee zeromass less energy thats how it works isnt it just get a pinhole image i mean a picture tells us a thousand words or something like that rashim nodded yes yes of course let me get some calculations together he got up and went over to their networked computers now all linked up a chorus of cpu fans whirring and hard drives clicking contentedly spongebubba hey skippa the lab unit squawked emerging from a dark corner come over here you and i have some work to do yes skippa it bleated irritatingly happy to be of service retrieve my energyconversion templates from exodus yes skippa it waddled over to join rashim at the computer table and together they started a hushed discussion of numbers so then started liam we investigate whether this jack the ripper contamination needs to be corrected first before we do anything else thats right thats how were going to operate from now on we watch and wait for contamination events and when one comes along the procedure should be that we take a look at what future we get from it if its a good one maddy said shrugging we just let it happen if its bad news then we do like we used to and go fix it but lets say the future is good said liam no pandora no virus that wipes out all of humanity youre saying if we get that future we should do absolutely nothing yup thats what im saying im going to say it because im sure im not the only one here thinking it said sal thinking what well doesnt it strike you as unlikely that this kelly woman could overpower a serial killer like the ripper maddy tapped her chin thoughtfully not really she seems a fiery character from what the papers are saying shes got a real potty mouth on her too no thats not what im getting at this is wrong history now maddy were in a contamination i know that somehow liam and rashim changed something small that led on to something else that led on to something else like dominoes that somehow resulted in a situation where kelly had a chance to fight back who knows liam buying a chest of drawers from one trader instead of another might just have caused the same man to have to make a journey to pick up another chest of drawers that somehow impacted on the plans of the ripper causing him to mess up somehow she shrugged her shoulders its impossible to determine for sure or maybe we arent alone back here becks said liam maybe she made it back alive crud maddy stared at them both maybe she did and maybe it was becks who killed this cathcart said sal in which case we also have to go back to the night of that murder then and see if it is her becks wouldnt kill someone like that said liam not without having a good reason its an unnecessary change to history she knows not to do that unless shes not right in the head liam maybe that upload wasnt stable maybe theres stuff going wrong in her head ah jayzus thats just great the last thing we need a wonky support unit going around killing bad guys ok look it just means we have a bit more work to do here right maddy stopped rocking her chair and sat forward this is what were going to do were going to take a look at the future if theres now no pandora event thanks to this contamination if mankind appears to be going merrily along and not wiping itself out with a killer gooey virus then weve got a winning contamination but we still go back to the night that mary kelly shouldve been murdered we know precisely when and where to go since the papers have given us nothing but the details of that night for the last month if it is becks who did it or is involved somehow we grab her but if it is becks who say killed cathcart we need to let her do that first right said sal yes of course we let her do her thing then we grab her on the other hand if the future is still pandora then i suggest we grab her before she can mess with the sequence of events and miss kelly dies said liam yes maddy shook her hands subconsciously lady macbeth shaking blood from her fingers yes im afraid so liam pulled a face that feels a bit like were taking advantage of things so it does so she shrugged nonchalantly sue me liam looked uncertain were meddling christ liam thats what weve been doing for the last six months for waldstein meddling worse than that we were meddling without even really understanding why but that last woman that mary kelly lady said liam surely theres a way we could try and save her we could do we could try and save every one of the rippers victims liam sheeeez we could go wandering through time saving everyone who didnt deserve to die but we dont have an infinite supply of energy and we cant survive an infinite amount of time travel so we have to be tactical about this we have to be smart surgical she reached over and poured some tea into her mug heres a change someone else has made lets sort of audition it were gonna see if its a good un and if not well fix it like a decent responsible little team of timeriders she hunched her shoulders other than that we sit tight we watch thats our job and maybe we even enjoy victorian london maybe even get out and live a little aye liam nodded slowly i suppose youre right maddy turned to bob that ok with your programming you big lump i concur with your assessment the logic is sound so if rashim can get our displacement machine to do it i say we first get a look at a time and place were all very familiar with something we can compare directly to yup the eleventh of september new york we know very well how its supposed to look so thatll be a perfect place to check first to see if this contamination had had knockon effects or selfcorrected between now and you up for that liam aye his face lifted aye of course and then after that well try and get a glimpse at if we can do it sound like a plan the others nodded plan good now whos for a nice cup of tea chapter november whitechapel london its best to be in pairs love said mary aint so safe on the streets these days with that madman out there somewhere she grasped faiths bare arm thats why you should stick close to me you understand we can look out for each other while we work faith adjusted the muslin wrapped tightly round her stillhealing arm i understand she replied evenly i will stay close she wasnt entirely sure what the woman meant by work they appeared to be doing nothing at all productive instead they were standing together beneath the soft amber gaslight glow of a street lamp and calling out peculiar greetings to males who happened to pass them by what is your work asked faith mary looked at her with a coy grin a fingersnitch love what is a fingersnitch oi you serious she sighed faith stared at her awaiting an answer you really are a funny one aintcha i spose i better explain see what i do is lift a little coin from gents who should be behaving emselves better faith frowned i do not understand pick their pockets love only the ones who look like they can afford it mind and usually gents whove had a bit too much of the ol drink and rather fancy themselves pick their pocket faith ran a search for that phrase in her head you are talking of theft stealing she said finally mary laughed blimey youre a bit slow on the uptake love yes i steal i aint so proud of that but its that my dear or starve and ill tell you theres plenty of gents in london who make a pretty penny by doing very little but sit on their fat backsides while poor hardworking sods break their backs making em rich its a bloomin unfair place this city one world for the rich and another world for the rest of us mary shrugged so i dont feel so bad about lifting the odd coin from a gentlemans back pocket she winked its all in ow you go about distractin em distracting them a saucy wink love that an a cheeky smile she laughed men can be such fools specially when theyve ad a bit too much to drink faith nodded i understand we deploy mating signals to distract them then we steal from them mary shook her head bemused and tickled by faiths choice of words youre an odd one love but yes thats the gist of it you can elp me faith two of us we could make a good team pretty girl like you would get plenty of attention you keep em talkin an i can do the finger work what do you say faith gave that a few moments thought we will require money to obtain food i need food to sustain me dont we all aint nothin bleedin well free in london faith nodded your logic is sound i will assist you in fingersnitching you will have to teach me the saucy winks and the cheeky smiles i can learn these actions mary nodded ill teach yer that and a few saucy things to say to em gents they like that we should practise on someone she spotted a likely candidate hoy cooeee love mary called out to a gentleman a little worse for wear tracing a drunken zigzag along the pavement opposite them you want some company the drunk snarled something back at her and staggered on charming muttered mary faith looked up and down the street it was almost completely empty apart from them and another couple more women down the far end like them huddled in the pool of light at the base of a street lamp trade aint good tonight s the rain see all the gents stayin at home with their missus she laughed a throaty sound get things for free at ome now dontcha faith offered the distant women a polite nod but they ignored her she wasnt fully listening to mary as she talked faith was busy evaluating her mission status it was of course still active yet to be completed and she knew her targets were close by theyd come here to this time this place for a good reason whatever that was she was reasonably confident per cent that they wouldnt know shed actually managed to follow them through the portal and here in this time with no cctv cameras no wireless transmitters no radios mobile phones no computer tracking and monitoring they would probably feel entirely safe which meant they might get careless she had identified a search radius of a mile in diameter the approximate distance shed been offset by the displacement process a lot of people in such a densely populated place as london but her eyes were good her recognition software exceedingly fast yesterday mary had taken her along oxford street to a pie shop that sold proper meat in the middle oxford street had been a good place to be faith had locked on to and evaluated faces in just under ten minutes streets were the best place to be faith decided a sea of humanity out there plenty of opportunity for her to wait and watch at some point one of her targets was bound to walk down one of these busy roads in need of some essential thing food drink clothing and if she was standing in the same street she would spot them and make her move although it is a shame mary was still talking pretty flower like you aving to do something like this aving to be a common thief but thats ow it is im afraid faith turned to her i am a pretty flower mary laughed course you bloomin well are she sighed mind you even i was pretty once this place does that to you sucks all the blimmin life out of you faith sensed that was probably some sort of a metaphor not to be taken literally the woman was talking about fatigue attrition being worn down to use another human aphorism faith considered how long she had been pursuing the targets her elapsed mission time counter was showing four weeks five days and seventeen hours given that shed been birthed nine hours before being sent back from to shed effectively been ontask pretty much all of her short life she wasnt exactly tired the proteins shed managed to get hold of and consume were keeping her organic chassis fed perhaps not ideal forms of nutrition long term her digestive system wasnt exactly designed to deal with pigs trotters and eels no her body was wellfuelled for now it was her mind that felt tired her hard drive was filling up with a trillion things observed heard smelled felt tasted she needed to compress her data to offload the unimportant trivial data and defragment the spaces left behind data retrieval sorting ordering filtering all those necessary processes were getting markedly slower and that was undoubtedly beginning to affect her performance she looked at mary and imagined that her hard drive looked like the skin on this womans face pockmarked weathered lined a visual metaphor of course not literally a drip of rainwater from the lamppost landed on marys upturned face she wiped it away i wanted to be a musician a piano player when i was a little girl she said you know i was brought up near a convent and they had an old piano there they let me play on i could play some pretty tunes on that faith i could even though i couldnt never read the music she smiled wistfully and listened to the soft patter of raindrops all around them we all ave silly dreams when were children dont we faith felt she should nod at that only dream i got left i spose is taking meself back ome gain to me mum and dad be a little girl all over again mary sighed and the soft hiss of drizzle filled the silence what about you faith was you a bit of a dreamer faith hadnt told mary much about her past in fact mary had assumed most of it country girl from a farm longed for the excitement of the big city came to london with little or no money and soon found herself in trouble all faith had really needed to do was nod at marys stated presumptions did she have dreams faith gave that a moments thought information i have goals objectives but dreams in a different sense dreams she had trace memories the faintest recollection of preborn foggy images and muffled sounds a growth cycle in her tube before her miniature silicon chip became active and thinking became a digital process i sometimes dream said faith finally she panned her cool grey eyes on to mary i dream that i can go back home also mary laughed right blimmin daft couple standin here aint we yes said faith blimmin daft you an me we should try and save every penny we make no more of the gin no more of the bad stuff just save up all the money we can lay our ands on agreed the gin is toxic to your body chemistry it does you harm consuming it faith looked at mary what is your intended purpose for the money to pay for a train of course a train away from ere a train back home thats where you an me should try and get back to our omes this aint no decent place to live farm animals live a better life than most of the poor sods trapped ere in whitechapel i wish id never come ere in the first place correct many of the humans here appear to be in poor condition its so hard to get by she shook her head sadly even just gettin enough to eat but then you walk no moren a mile west places like oxford street piccadilly circus and you see em posh blighters in their fancy clothes in their fancy carriages stepping into fancy clubs and eateries none of em done a days work in their lives aint right she sighed if i ad a say in things id change it all take whats theirs and share it among all them poor beggars out there workin all day an night just to scratch together enough money to blimmin well eat a thought occurred to mary just then where did you tell me your ome was faith faith looked at her i have no home then blimmin eck you could come with me marys face creased with a gaptoothed grin how about that would you like that wales is lovely faith mountains and valleys nothin like london she grabbed faiths arm we could both go live in wales would you like that you and me we could pinch as much money as we can save every penny an buy us some tickets away from this miserable city faiths tight lips curved producing a practisedseveraltimes almost genuinelooking smile that sounds like a blimmin good plan mary chapter december holborn viaduct london liam looked down at himself he was wearing a pair of grey flannel trousers and a white cotton shirt it was as timeneutral a look as they could get from his victorian clothes maddy as well just a plain grey skirt and a vanillacoloured blouse no frills lace or bonnet at worst theyd look like a pair of rather dull nerds in or a rather unimaginative couple so its piccadilly circus then said liam they were heading for london instead of new york having crunched the numbers rashim had come to the conclusion that the charge they could muster was not going to be enough to project them that far into the future unless they compensated on the geodisplacement and aimed for somewhere closer to home well do a onehour visit said maddy one hour then open the return window at the same place and a twohour backup window for justincase ok rashim was sitting at the desk understood liam centred himself in his square nice not to be going back wet he grinned thats a blessed relief so it is maddy nodded she tucked a small digital camera into a clutch bag there were dozens of digital images of piccadilly circus on it pulled from their database they had a fair idea how it should look and she could reference those images on the camera if it turned out to be only a moderately different piccadilly circus then perhaps they were now heading along a timeline that was preferable density probe is showing us a consistent allclear said rashim countdown is now at thirty seconds are you two all ready yes were good to go maddy replied shed wanted bob to go along with liam for protection of course but his mass was adding too much to the energy cost of displacing them however maddy realized that of all of them her memories her programmed memories were closest in time to intuitively shed have the best idea if london was looking odd or the way it ought to one hour she said time enough to buy a soda and some tacky ivebeentolondon tshirt and come home again aye and ten nine eight she winked at sal chinchin and toodlepip old girl she grinned thats the sort of thing they say in england isnt it remain still please maddy called out rashim and four three and be careful you two sal called out but her voice was lost in the buzz of energy building up two one piccadilly circus london a yard walled in on all four sides and overlooked by a tall grey stone building lined with sootencrusted windows and ledges of surlylooking pigeons above them a pale sky of combedout clouds they could both hear the dull urban hiss and rumble of traffic the melodic cooing of the pigeons watching them from the ledge just then a door opened on to the yard and a middleaged man wearing trousers shirt tie and a dull brown sleeveless jumper took out a packet of tobacco and cigarette papers sat down on the step and began to roll himself a cigarette he noticed maddy and liam standing there all right liam nodded aye you he shrugged middlebad but you have to make do dont you he tucked a modest row of stale strands of tobacco along the paper you two new i havent seen you around before just joined said liam joined what exactly he wondered ahh you must be with the licence and trade monitoring or weights standards and measures approvals the uh thats the one started this morning so we did liam watched the man lick one side of the paper you know thatll kill you eventually so it will smoking eventually huh he laughed at that least of me worries wouldnt you say well be heading in now said maddy tugging liams sleeve hammeranspades you got a funny accent there the man looked at her where are you from boston united states america he was taken aback maddy sensed that might not have been a prudent thing to say well my folks were you know originally well his eyes were wide and they gave you a job in the ministry of information id keep all that family ancestry to yourself young lady quite seriously they stepped past him i i will she said quickly thanks hang on did you lie about that he looked up at them to get the job you must have had to lie to the job commissariat i uh i may have bent the truth a little she said with a shrug i guess liam grabbed her hand enjoy your smoke sir he pushed the door and they stepped into a dark hallway it reeked of floor polish and disinfectant at the end of the hallway the faint pearly glow of a pair of frostedglass doors leading outside i guess its not good to be an american whispered maddy aye it seems it they made their way towards the double doors passing an opening on the right that led on to a large office two long rows of dark wooden desks with men and women typing away on machines that looked like a cross between typewriters and logic engines all brass levers and glowing vacuum fuses the room echoed with the clatter of keystrokes and the long ring of a telephone its like one of them old blackandwhite flicks said liam maddy nodded yes it was those old films where every scene was veiled behind a pall of cigarette smoke and every desk lamp seemed to cast its own beam of light through it men with trilby hats and trench coats and every street glistening from a torrential downpour noir she remembered thats what they called those old films they reached the double doors and pushed them open at least it wasnt raining there was that the roar of traffic the buzz of activity in piccadilly circus took them by surprise they were three wide steps up and back from a pavement thick with pedestrians maddy quickly located and identified the things she expected to see the statue of eros the circular fountain and plinth on which it stood and the steps surrounding it she noticed the signs pointing out the underground tramlines the tall stone buildings with classic grand entrances and granite pillars signs for shaftesbury avenue coventry street regent street and as shed expected yes it was busy hecticbusy but none of the garish colour she had in the images on her phone no billboards no electronic displays with sanyo or tdk or cocacola dancing across them no street vendors selling plastic doubledecker buses or beefeater soft toys and no tourists maddy had expected piccadilly circus to look a bit like times square clusters of faces of all colours people taking pictures of each other posing in front of eros but this was very different it was certainly busy though busy with cars bicycles and electric trams a network of wires spun like a spiders web above the hectic thoroughfare the trams running along rails in the roads all had connector arms that reached up to wires and here and there sparks flickered and fizzed the cars all appeared to be the same albeit in a variety of unexciting colours maroons browns and greys small bubblelike cars with oval windscreens that puffed thick dark clouds of exhaust fumes and as many people on bicycles as there were clogging the pavements on foot they wove round the trams like a school of pilot fish around a whale on the side of one towering building overlooking piccadilly circus was a giant television screen huge bigger even than the one in times square but the image was blocky and primitive twotone pixels of just black and white looking more closely maddy saw it wasnt even a lightbased display but each pixel was a disc about the size of a dinner plate that flipped on a spindle one side black one side white now this is different to how its meant to be liam looked at her isnt it very it felt like a london that belonged to a britain stuck in perhaps the early fifties she wasnt sure well now said liam we know for sure the jacktheripper thing has caused a change maddy looked at her watch weve got fiftysix minutes left lets split up get what you can any newspapers magazines books you can lay your hands on back here in fifty minutes ok chapter piccadilly circus london liam decided the plaque above the grand building in front of him looked promising enough information resources centre dept of information dissemination he took the dozen steps up and pushed his way through a heavy wooden revolving door and stepped into a cavernous foyer beyond he saw several concentric circles of benches round a cluster of newspaper stands in the middle most of the seats were already occupied with men and women even some children flipping through rustling broadsheet newspapers he spotted long tables beyond glowing reading lamps evenly spaced along them they were mostly occupied by people reading newspapers or books to his left was a counter and a young woman busily filing index cards in an organizer he wandered over and stood in front of the counter for a moment before finally coughing into his balled fist for her attention she looked up oh im so sorry liam offered her his best lopsided smile ah thats all right how can i help you well now id like to have some information information aye well bemused exasperation on her face she laced her fingers and leaned forward how about we try and narrow that down just a little bit liam laughed softly aye might help im after history books recent history that is all right she nodded wonderful start how recent hmmm last century or so or so last century then nothing too specific you know general history world history she looked at him through a drooping tress of mousebrown hair just arrived from another planet in another galaxy have you sir aye who knows i might even choose to stay her turn to laugh well i have academic reference texts or general information texts she glanced at his puzzled face and decided to clarify that with nice pretty pictures or without oh pictures please pictures you can colour in uh she chuckled raised a hand to cover her mouth he noticed she had braces on her teeth just teasing you sorry let me quickly check my infoveedee for some suitable lendouts he noticed a pale blue glow lighting her face from below and her fingers began to tap at a typewriter keyboard he leaned forward over the counter and noted a small cabinet the size of a cigar box one glass side glowed blue like a small television set two metal brackets held a large oblong magnifying glass screen between the young woman and the mini television she adjusted its hinges slightly the tiny screen loomed large in the lens glowing blue with white text thats a veedee is it she looked at him veedee you know visual display ahh thats a computer down there i suppose she looked at him quizzically computeer what an odd word she cocked her head you really are from another planet arent you thats what me mother used to say about me she looked back at the magnified screen we have the revolutionary century a history of socialist britain thats a bit heavygoing i think how about two worlds the free man and the profit slave thats quite a good read she looked up at him and its got lots of pictures too aye that one sounds good she tapped a key there requested it he noticed her sneak a furtive glance up at him then her eyes darted awkwardly back to the lens screen now umm let me see what other works can i recommend for you good to see a library so well used said liam looking back at the rows of eager readers the gentle whispering rustle of pages being turned its the newssheets she replied everyone wants to know the latest on whats happening the teasing smile at the edge of her lips dropped for a moment very suddenly she looked drawn and worried its all so terrifying though isnt it terrifying the blockade the americans shipping in all those atomics for their french friends she pressed her lips together you cant help wondering how this is going to end up can you liam decided to play along aye its pretty bad theres no doubting that my mum says she lowered her voice to a whisper my mum says if the french get those missile bits and pieces and decide to put them together it could end up leading to an atomic war war she nodded atomic she mouthed the word as if it was a curse not to be spoken out loud as if merely saying the word would open the gates of hell for satan and his hordes to pour through its so frightening mum says we could all end up dying if that happened liam shrugged that off ah now im sure something like that wont happen whats in it for the big fellas at the top if they let something daft like that happen hmmm she fiddled absently with the index folder in front of her no i suppose not i suppose it all looks more frightening than it really is itll all turn out all right in the end wont it of course he nodded always does everyone sees sense in the end he smiled they always do she raised that teasing flickering smile again and continued browsing through catalogue pages on the lens screen anyway so do you uh you live in london only you sound irish or is it scottish irish i see are you uh visiting or do you live in london or something just visiting uhhuh that sounded to him more like a disappointed oh she tapped the keyboard in silence for a moment the soft blue glow on her face flickering with screen refreshes finally she looked up her lips playing with words silently for a moment before picking one or two to start with i i dont normally her face flushed pink dont normally what i wonder she continued her eyes firmly locked on the lens screen far too embarrassed to look up at him and meet his eyes whether youd care to care to have some tea and brancakes tea and brancakes lunchtime with me she dared a glance up at him i have a lunchbreak coming soon at one i eat it outside by the fountain she laughed nervously sometimes i feed the pigeons with my cakes if theyre too dry though i liam was pretty sure his cheeks looked as red as hers did now i well uh im awfully sorry i have to run along im only passing oh im ssorry no dont worry she cut in too quickly just a thought just an idea ill just her fingers knotted together uncomfortably ill just go and check on your book see if someones retrieving it for you she turned and hurried away from the counter through swing doors and out of sight maddy managed to pick up half a dozen discarded newspapers and shove them under her arm she was beginning to think she looked like some mad bag lady like that old vagrant in times square with his tarpaulincovered shopping trolley and all that binrummaging the people in piccadilly circus seemed far too preoccupied to care about her though watching the comings and goings the exhaustspewing bubble cars the hundreds of people on bicycles some of them so overburdened with things she wondered how they didnt topple over she was reminded of images of beijing of mumbai of havana there was an exciting almost frenzied whirlwind of chaotic activity going on all around her but like those places looking closely shed begun to note a threadbare quality to everything a stifflipped impoverishment hidden away behind broad smiles and exuberant howdoyoudos a makeandmend place of limited resources the cars all looked old patched up held together in places with tape ribbon and rope so many items of clothing seemed to sport discreetly sewn patches at first shed thought it might be some sort of fashion thing a particular passion for elbow patches but she noted thread giving way on shoulder seams trousers worn tissuethin at the knees shoe leather worn to a rough suede theyre really struggling britains poor she was about to grab another discarded newspaper left on a bench near the fountain surrounding eros when a church bell at least thats what it sounded like gave an ominous single claaaang she looked up towards where it seemed to have come from and saw that the large television screen had a logo slowly crawling across its black and white pixel blocks maddy recognized it as the clock face of big ben and beneath it srbbc lunchtime news she noticed how many people in the bustling space turned to look the trams continued of course the bubble cars rattled on but the bicycles pulled over the pedestrians stopped and turned all those who could stop seemed so very keen to view the screen and listen to the news a newscaster appeared in blocky black and white pixelvision smart formal a bow tie and a dark jacket silverhaired and with a reassuring fatherly smile he looked like dumbledore after a wet shave and a sensible haircut in smart gentlemansclub evening wear good day citizens this is your news at one a pause a very long pause looking around maddy noticed how many of the upturned faces around her seemed to wear a frozen expression of anticipation no more than that dread the ultimatum presented by secretary andrei bechemov of the soviet republic and secretary andrew benn of the socialist republic of britain has expired without any official response from president jonathan elroy bush the convoy of american warships crossing the atlantic carrying the atomic materials to france appears to be proceeding undaunted it is thought that the convoy will cross the degree west longitude otherwise known as the bechemov ultimatum line at some point late tomorrow afternoon discussions are continuing among the other gathered heads of state in berlin as to the official response to the crossing should it happen there have been increased calls for a naval interception soviet warships despatched over a week ago across the arctic sea and around the top of the atlantic and into the americanenforced trade embargo noose will be in a position to meet the convoy should it make any attempt to cross the line the newscaster took a breath secretary benn reiterated that the proliferation of atomic weapons specifically president bushs insistence on deploying a forward atomic weapons base on french soil was a flagrant attempt to provoke hostilities french leader president durant responded that france was at one with american foreign policy in wanting to preserve a robust frontline against socialist encroachment oh that doesnt seem good maddy whispered she checked her watch the onehour window was due in just under ten minutes she decided to make her way back across piccadilly circus now with the exception of the rattling wheels of the trams and the overhead fizzing of sparks along the contact wires it was an almost completely frozen tableau she walked up the steps and through the frostedglass double doors theyd emerged through earlier halfway down the dimly lit hallway she passed the office on her left the sound of clacking keyboards had ceased and she glimpsed inside every typist in the long room was now gathered round a single desk watching something glowing a flickering blue she could hear the thin warble of the newscasters voice echoing out of the still and silent office following her down the dark hallway towards the doorway opening on to the yard for everyone to be prepared for the worst possible scenario that a state of war may soon exist between in the yard she was relieved to see liam was waiting for her a fat heavylooking book tucked under one arm i think this might not be a future we want to hold on to said liam as maddy joined him she checked her watch five minutes to go ive got a feeling you may be right chapter december holborn viaduct london this is incredibly fascinating said maddy she pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose from jack the ripper goofing up and getting himself killed in here we have a sitting on the brink of global thermonuclear war she looked at the others she had the history book liam had borrowed open on the desk in front of her and resumed reading passages aloud the revelation that the whitechapel murders were perpetrated by a cathcarthyde a member of the house of lords proved to be the final straw his intended victim mary kelly a common street woman was hailed as a hero for overpowering him and killing him in selfdefence upon her arrest for his murder riots erupted across the east end of london she looked up at them which we saw for ourselves she resumed reading her trial in the spring of led to mass riots across the country she was prevented from taking the stand and testifying publicly because the authorities feared mary kelly would incite the working class to open revolt so popular a figure was she by then maddy turned the page and scanned the text december the fifteenth the hanging of mary kelly led to the winter of rage and the subsequent trafalgar square massacre three hundred rioters were shot dead by soldiers of the fifth hampshire rifles and another hundred and seven people were cut down during a charge down oxford street by the queens own blues and royals of the household cavalry she turned another page may the seventh queen victoria and the royal family escaped to canada as the libertarian workers transition council took control of westminster and the houses of parliament and the first socialist state in the world was officially declared she flipped through several more sections of the thick book taking her forward through time the others sat in silence as she skimread the pages and timelines of dates and events so she said presently it seems then when the second world war should have been happening in correct history there was no war in this timeline instead a growing consolidation between two sides and an escalating arms race two sides what america versus britain again said sal just like that time when the american civil war didnt finish no not so much countries sal ideologies socialism versus capitalism what does that mean exactly asked liam maddy looked at him oh come on seriously you mustve read enough history books by now to know what those words mean right its the struggle of the worker versus the banker the poor versus the rich the idea of shared wealth versus personal wealth oh right that he shrugged aye i knew that on one side we have russia her finger ran across a colourcoded map of europe which has its revolution in the s germany britain poland austria one after the other by the look of these dates they experience their own workers revolutions and then on the other side we have america and canada and some of the south american countries becoming one big free world zone thats what they call themselves its an atlantic divide then said rashim the americas against europe no not exactly maddy flipped through some more pages until she found an entry shed read earlier ah here it is the dumannroosevelt accord president roosevelt and congress approve a loan of several hundreds of millions of dollars to the french to help them invest in industry and weapons development france is seen by the american public as one of the last major outposts of capitalist values in europe she checked an index at the front the rest of this century it seems is one long cold war tensions rising on both sides theres a doozy of a quote right here at the front of this book she flipped to the title page the twentieth century will prove to be a century devoted to one purpose alone preparation for an inevitable war almost a hundred years spent in a race for industrial and technological supremacy a race in which the winning post will almost certainly be a brutal and catastrophic global war and no country will emerge unscathed jayzus muttered liam he recalled the strained look on that poor young girls face in the library shed seemed so worried so haunted by looming events and liam reminded himself how hed casually glibly batted away her concerns as if she was being silly so easy for him to be devilmaycare his was a fleeting visit but she she was stuck there waiting like every other person in the country to see how far the americans were prepared to push their challenge the young lady had returned with his book and a mumbled apology for the awkward invitation shed extended to him shed covered her mouth her braced teeth as shed whispered but he could have sworn shed said something like i just dont want to be on my own if when it happens everyone knew what was coming said liam they could see it coming god help em maddy picked up one of the newspapers she looked at the others rashim and sal in particular they have nuclear weapons in this timeline but they call them atomics it looks like both sides have atomics theyve been stockpiling warheads for decades we need to see how it turns out maddy she nodded at liam i think so it didnt look good we need to go further forward rashim can we do it he shook his head i said it before we dont have the power to send you any further maddy maybe remoteviewing a pinholeviewing thats fine thats all we need how far forward can we go i need to work it out can you get us a look at that year he shrugged ill work it out just give me a moment rashim took a chair at the desk and pulled up a program on the screen they waited silently listening to him tap on the keyboard and mutter calculations under his breath its always the same said sal after a while one way or another mankind ends up wiping itself out with some big weapon doesnt it why are people so completely stupid its what we do best isnt it said liam invent things that we can use to kill everyone its what were good at i suppose that is correct rumbled bob his eyelids were fluttering revealing the rolled whites of his eyes he was bluetoothing data one of his sporadic backups mankind is essentially sociopathic he continued that is probably why homo sapiens became dominant and wiped out the neanderthals and the other sapient species your killer instinct was more clearly defined aye we were tougher nuts than those apemen said liam negative not tougher said bob just more ruthless thanks for that dr phil said maddy since when did you become an expert on the human psyche i have files on maddy raised a hand its ok i was just being snarky ok ive got some rough figures said rashim we cant project a pinhole field all the way to im afraid its just not possible on the power were drawing in right now jesus maddy gritted her teeth we need to do something about that this holborn generators a pile of junk i have some thoughts on this we could do some reconfiguring perhaps insert some kind of capacitor to build up a store of surplus energy later well discuss that later just tell me how far we can go right now rashim looked at the scribbled notes on the desk in front of him he sucked air through his teeth i think we can reach as far forward as the early forties perhaps but not much more liam cocked his head wasnt that round about when waldstein showed off his firstever time machine yeah round about then i think i wonder if this future has a version of him in it said liam eh that would be weird maddy shrugged an intriguing idea that another version of him lay ahead of them now perhaps a version of him that was living a very different life a happier life perhaps with his wife and his son a life lived in blissful ignorance of time travel an einstein who remained a humble patent clerk a bill gates who ended up a computer repairman wouldnt that be a thing though a timeline that survives this looming nuclear crisis and perhaps finds a peaceful future but also a timeline without waldsteins displacement machine in it perhaps even a timeline without a pandora wouldnt all of that be a wonderful thing she could only hope rashim he turned to look at her yes do it set that up please lets go get a look at our future chapter the ruins of piccadilly circus london the dog a small virtually hairless thing that might once upon a time have been mistaken for a jack russell chased the rodent through a dark maze of creaking wooden tables and desks furniture that for many a year had held true until a decade ago a portion of the buildings roof had finally caved in ten years of wet summers and freezing winters had done its work and damp was rotting the wood the dog scurried between chair legs and desk legs in a desperate ravenous pursuit the rat was a goodsized one and yet fast its small feet skittered across a longforgotten floor covered in grit and plaster moistened by the damp it was almost soil and in several places clumps of weed and moss thrived out of the maze of the longdead office the rat scampered up a slanted fallen roof timber on to a chair and over a stickdry bundle of bones in rags slumped across the gritcovered surface of a service counter its body and beady dark eyes reflected all but briefly in a mildewspotted oval of magnified glass along the counter now it found a dark corner behind a rusting box spewing corroded wires a moment later the dog scampered past the counter in hot pursuit out into a large hall of round wooden benches and long tables as with the counter there were other bundles of white bones and tufts of hair wrapped up in decaying fibres of clothing to be seen lying along the benches slumped on the reading tables spread out on the floor shards of sunlight speared down into this place through the collapsed domed roof of the building and a cheerful welcoming blue sky was visible beyond framed by the broken fingers of iron spars and crumbling masonry the balding dog sensed it had lost its prey and wandered over to an opening that led out into the warmth of a pleasant summers afternoon it emerged into the sunlight blinking back the brightness of the sun sat on its haunches and panted it decided to rest and recover for a while before returning inside to sniff out another rodent the pickings were too rich in this building to give up yet its pink tongue darted out and slapped its muzzle skinny flanks heaved with the rapid inout inout inout of hot breath being expelled and oxygen pulled in and dark beady eyes looked out impassively on a crowded vista that meant nothing to it a place once upon a time known as piccadilly circus tall grass and nettles grew waisthigh here a sea of gently swaying ochregreen giving way here and there to hummocky islands of rustred vehicle roofs lost to sight but certainly down there where the wild grass and the tall weeds spread their roots was a rich compost of decaying clothing fibres and bleached bones still able to leak some goodness into the forming soil in the middle of this shifting grassland was a circular plinth topped by a stillrecognizable human form with wings eros its bronze base was now a peppermint green the statue itself aluminium was a marblelike pattern of rust spots and algal growth everywhere a pleasing prairie sound the gentle murmur of breeze haunting the skeletons of dead buildings the grass whispering a soothing white noise crickets chirruping in chorus far away another dog barks to find its pack and slowly the lateafternoon sun eased across a cloudless sky towards a craggy horizon of falling buildings eventually that same horizon would be shallow humps beneath a blanket of vegetation eventually that horizon would be flat grassland or a wood or something in between peaceful but life goes on big bugs eat small bugs rats eat bugs dogs eat rats a dozen crows circle overhead prepared to eat anything life continues despite a gradually decreasing background level of radiation that might still give concern to a radiologist just over four decades ago it wasnt peaceful here just over four decades ago there was a period of horror and panic the sound of wailing sirens filled the air screams prayers this same blue sky was crisscrossed with several hairthin lines of vapour the approaching and departing vectors of missiles a day in which the skies all over earth looked largely the same vapour trails and mushroom clouds but thats all long ago forgotten now silly vain stupid violent humans are history and in a couple of hundred years the last visible remnants of their buildings will be too peaceful except for a tiny disturbance now minute the size of a mere pinhead if one knew precisely where to look you would see nothing more than a spot of darkness floating six feet above the ground like an errant pixel on a computer display grain on an old photograph the tiniest freckle on porcelainfair skin there for a second gone the next december holborn viaduct london they stared at the lowresolution image on the computer screen for a long silent minute before liam finally spoke thats piccadilly circus is it no answer in his own liam way he was being rhetorical well now thats not looking very good is it youre quite right said maddy not good not good at all i think its safe to say we dont want this future that means we have to make it right said sal jack the ripper has to kill this kelly lady and get away never to be identified maddy nodded kinda sucks but yeah thats how it has to be chapter pm november whitechapel london mary kelly wiped muffin crumbs from her lips and smiled across the table at faith i aint felt so appy in a long time faith had been gazing out at the street the latenight market was closing up for business by the amber glow of lamplight costermongers butchers grocers packed their wares away as wearylooking stevedores returned home from the docks and warehouses along the thames a narrow street heaving with activity a seething mass of grubby humanity seen through the sooty window of this small tea shop faith had logged analysed and dismissed seventysix faces in the last minute alone she levelled her impassive gaze on mary why are you happy mary i have you faith had compiled a short list of nonspecific noncommittal yet reassuring responses that she could trot out in response to marys endless chatter she picked one at random then i am happy too i feel like theres a hope a way out of whitechapel a way out of this stinkin awful unfair city yes faith played a smile we have your plan mary checked the coins in her purse the last few nights their petty crimes had paid off well mary had decided they could try their luck along the strand there were a number of members clubs along that busy road that disgorged drunken gentlemen into the streets in the early hours faith had played her part well catching the eye and attention of a number of them with some suggestive and teasing comeons while mary had made quick work of dipping her hand into their coat pockets weve already got almost a whole pound a few weeks like this faith love and we might have enough for tickets to take us anywhere we want the place that you called wales sounds like a very nice place faith was vaguely aware that her ai was adopting some very sophisticated human behavioural traits she was playing along acting a part lying faith had no intention of travelling off to a place called wales but maintaining the illusion that she was sold on that idea suited her well mary was a useful accomplice with useful local knowledge more than that between them they seemed to have developed an efficient way to accumulate money something that was needed of course to purchase food faith finished her lamb broth generously full of chunks of mutton and other useful proteins i think you an mes earned a night off what do you say faith was looking out of the sootsmudged window as you wish we could go down me local the queens head hows that sound faith turned to look at her reproachfully you intend to consume alcohol again mary shrugged its just a little celebration we done so well you an me just one drink aint gonna hurt is it information intoxication impairs performance and compromises judgement mary laughed bleedin eck faith come on just one little drink aint gonna kill me now is it am november whitechapel london the pub the queens head turned out to be another useful location for faith to log faces her database of stored images was rapidly increasing in size shed spotted logged analysed and filed faces in london so far none of them of course were the people she was after but it meant over seventeen thousand humans ruled out as she calmly surveyed the florid faces around her through clouds of acrid pipe smoke mary was enjoying herself one drink had turned into several drinks and she was now in the middle of a noisy muddle of men and women leading them in singing along to an accordion player all of them equally inebriated the innkeeper winced at the racket as he collected the empty tankards keen to begin kicking out his patrons for the night faith approved of mary kelly there was an iron strength in the woman not physically of course but in the way she could command the obedience and respect of others the kind of person who in another life in other more favourable circumstances might have achieved great things instead all she would ever be was a street woman a pauper quite likely destined for an early grave if she could feel any emotion for mary it would be fondness instead the best she could manage was dispassionate approval she watched mary sing tunelessly for a while a foghorn voice that carried over the other tuneless voices then turned back to the task at hand observing the faces around her and it was then as she glanced around once more to check for any new faces that she caught sight of a darkhaired young man just a glimpse of a face on the far side of the public house her breath caught in her throat liam oconnor information identity match she started to push her way through the fog of pipe smoke and heaving sweaty bodies florid bearded faces loomed closely at hers men with gaptoothed smiles leered at her as she squeezed her way frantically through for a moment she lost sight of the young man then reestablished visual contact again a few seconds later closer now she could see his face was slim his nose prominent beneath two thick arched eyebrows information identity match she began to feel adrenaline coursing through her body her mind determining the best strategy to kill him right here in this pub or better to watch him discreetly and perhaps follow him when he left at the end of the evening in the hope he was going to lead her back to the others closer now she could see the young man was the same height and build information identity match she needed to be closer to not have clouds of pipe smoke obscuring her view or redfaced drunken fools staggering into her breathing rancid fumes in her face she could snap any one of these fools necks with the slightest flick of her wrist and perhaps no one would notice in the press and surge of bodies a man might collapse to the sawdustcovered floor of this pub and they would all assume hed passed out from too much drink but it wasnt worth the risk of alerting the attention of liam oconnor now just a few yards away from her laughing at something being said to him by someone else faith reached to pull her bonnet down a little hoping to disguise her face too late she noticed his brown eyes flicker on to her resting on her and then a smile for her benefit no alarm no flicker of recognition and panic no just a fuzzyheaded drunken smile hoy all right the young man called across to her buy you a drink love information not liam oconnor she ground her teeth turned on her heels and started to push and squirm her way through the crowd back to where shed been standing moments ago only to discover mary was no longer there with her newly made drunken friends chapter am november whitechapel london mary guessed faith had had enough and taken herself back to the room they were sharing off millers court it wasnt so far just a couple of streets away from the pub she staggered down dorset street cursing and muttering as her feet slipped on rainslicked cobblestones shed only intended to have the one drink after all it was wellearned but one had led to two and more and shed spent more of that money than shed really wanted to not that she was too worried about that they could make that money again tomorrow easily faith had an alluring way about her an innocence and beauty that drew men like bees to honey like moths to candlelight so distracted were they with trying to chat her up it was like stealing pennies from a blind mans cap what a splendid pair we are although faith was a little peculiar there was an almost dolllike manner to her expressionless face as if her features were as rigid as porcelain and an almost mannequin stiffness to her as if she was always on guard like one of them redcoatnbearskins standing to attention outside buckingham palace mary wondered about her she was such a puzzle she turned left off dorset street into the dark alleyway that led into millers court a culdesac of dosshouses around a small cobblestoned courtyard that always seemed to reek of human faeces she staggered in the dark steadying herself against one greasy brick wall blimey she muttered bit too much of the blimmin laughing juice faith was probably already back in their room tucked up in the one bed they shared toe to head mary did actually wonder if faith ever slept she always seemed to be wide awake staring up at the cracked plaster of the low ceiling she wondered what thoughts passed through that mind of hers what wishes and dreams wants and needs she seemed to give so little away what a pretty puzzle she is mary was in fact so puzzled by her friend that she failed to notice the shadow of a man entering the alleyway behind her casting a long veil from the faint amber glow of a gas lamp on dorset street all the way down the dark little alleyway into millers court like some impossibly stretched impossibly tall being the shadow fell across her back marking her with darkness like the ghostly touch of the grim reaper marking her soul for imminent collection as she entered the last few minutes of her life chapter december holborn viaduct london what weve got on the ripper murders isnt a lot said maddy shed grabbed the information and dumped it into bobs head from wikipedia back in which given that the site had only been running since january wasnt a hugely detailed article the night of the eighth of november the early hours of the ninth of november is when the last victim mary kelly gets murdered theres no precise time just that she was supposedly last seen at midnight and was discovered dead by a neighbour at eight thirty in the morning maddy pulled up two grisly blackandwhite photographs on one of the monitors these were both taken by the metropolitan police jayzus whispered liam yeah not very nice im afraid he looked at sal queasily i feel sick well you need to get over it liam said maddy youre gonna see this for real very soon is that her face asked rashim maddy nodded whats left of it the ripper seemed quite keen for some reason to completely disfigure her face rashim leaned closer my god it looks like he was trying to remove it so now thats how the crime scene is supposed to look in correct history her body is found in her room lying diagonally across her bed her lower torso opened up and the contents her organs placed on the bed beside her maddy reached across the desk and picked up a pad with notes on it but this is the description ive summed up from the recent newspaper articles she looked down at her notes so this bit im about to read to you is the contamination bit what shouldnt have been found at the scene of the murder she began to read on the floor beside kellys bed in her small rented room off millers court was found the body of her attacker at first glance a wealthy gentleman in his middle years wearing an evening suit and thick coat his top hat placed on a small table beside the bed his manner of death a crushing of the cranium was believed to have been caused by the swinging of a coal shovel or similar device although kelly claimed she had no memory of the struggle with lord cathcarthyde it is clear she must have struck him once to the side of his head to render him unconscious and then repeatedly as he lay on the floor until his head was completely stoved in as if some workshop vice or similar device had been applied to the skull and wound tight until it was crushed out of all recognition good god whispered rashim a crushed head liam had once seen bob do that a german guard in one of those concentration camps back in america bob had squeezed the poor mans head in one of his big hands squeezed like it was nothing more than a ripe tomato bob could becks do that affirmative even partially grown she has enough physical strength to deploy that kind of damage to a human skull then it really is becks said liam if that is becks then she may have flipped out said maddy cautiously may have jeez liam all of sudden wasnt quite so keen on the idea of a reunion with their lost team member even if she supposedly had some sort of weird twisted digital version of a schoolgirl crush on him her ai must have been unstable said maddy im sorry its my fault we shouldnt have tried loading her up with the stuff from the hard drive were going to need to kill her arent we said sal maddy nodded we cant leave her running around out there we could attempt to incapacitate her said rashim we may even be able to reset her maddy looked at him how your support units are oldergeneration units said rashim he pursed his lips thoughtfully perhaps twentyyearold technology i would say engineered around about the s not like the support units you encountered in rome the ones procured for project exodus bob nodded this is correct ok so bob and becks are older models said maddy so what does that mean the computers are dense silicon wafers the circuitry is mainly a graphene construct with some conventional silicon that is tightly meshed very tightly meshed it is those small silicon portions which are vulnerable to power surges that can cause instances of microwelding maddy noted liams eyes already beginning to glaze over mind you she wasnt actually any the wiser herself so what are you getting at the older wafers in your units have a builtin trip switch to hardset the chip into an off state to protect these weaker silicon parts from that kind of surge damage during the russianchinese conflict over the caspian oilfields it was a common insurgency tactic by the chinese to stun or incapacitate russian huntandkill squads with taser darts and then later reprogram and reboot them with trojan viruses that made them turn on their own side after some trigger event a word a noise there was a very famous incident of one squad that returned from a mission behind chinese lines passed through the sentry posts into the camp and nearly wiped out an entire regiment of russian conscripts as they slept in their beds so what are you saying we taser becks well yes thatll turn her computer off without you know completely trashing it yes thats exactly right you see the latergeneration military units the ones we had for the exodus project designs from had chips made entirely of graphene circuitry those are completely resistant to that kind of surgewelding so we taser her that means shes switched off i mean properly off shes not going to reboot wake up or anything like that then is she no it is a hardreset a tiny physical switch is flipped and itll stay flipped until someone physically gets into her head and flicks it back on can you make something zappy like that from the bits weve got lying around theres no need you already have one rashim nodded at one of the boxes of gadgets and spare parts piled beneath the desk still patiently waiting to be sorted through when we were packing up i was emptying that old filing cabinet he shrugged i found one in there i thought you knew we had one maddy rolled her eyes yes of course they had one shed never used it never thought to it had sat in the filing cabinet with all the other junk waiting to be useful well now it was all right lets get it out check the thing works meanwhile she turned to address the bank of computers computerbob start charging up the sooner we go back and get this done the better maddy what if that taser thing doesnt work asked liam youre taking bob along arent you im sure he can handle little becks aye but shes quick shes very agile look liam if for some reason you guys cant incapacitate becks if bob cant wrestle her to the floor or she looks like she might be doing a runner shes got to be killed do you understand if her mind has gone wonky shes a contamination worry more than that whatever crazy stuff she gets up to may attract attention to this moment in time she could blow our cover either you grab her and taser her or you take her down she looked at fosters old pumpaction shotgun leaning against the wall in the corner although why she still thought of it as his she didnt really know you should take the gun along with you just in case you need it she was expecting an argument from him she knew liam was fond of her it the unit she knew hed have reservations about gunning her down in cold blood aye the gun he eyed the weapon nervously good idea or actually on the other hand maybe he wouldnt chapter am november whitechapel london liam was soaked to the skin this dark little corner of millers court where theyd chosen to huddle and wait for jack the ripper offered little protection from the fine rain it was as if god was hanging over london with a giant finenozzle plant spray gently wafting aerosol clouds of moisture down on to the city moisture that seemed to find its way into every nook crack and crevice they were beneath a leanto little more than four rotting posts of wood supporting a roof of rainslick slate tiles that all seemed to be conspiring to channel bulbous greasy drops of rain on to liam no matter where he chose to crouch in the stillness of the early hours the only sound to be heard was the soothing symphony of a raindamp city fast asleep the soft hiss of persistent drizzle a dog far away with an intermittent worrisome bark the soft cooing of pigeons tucked away under guttering pleased with themselves for being dry liam groaned you must remain very still whispered bob my legs are killing me im cold im wet and im getting pins and needles nonetheless you must be still said bob he sighed and resumed his uncomfortable vigil on the narrow entrance to this godforsaken courtyard theyd been huddled here since pm watched a steady procession of drunks stagger home and noisily fumble their way through front doors a dozen or more dosshouses seemed to have openings on to this place and everyone it seemed in each dosshouse seemed to enjoy drinking the night hours away bob whats the time he consulted his internal clock am maybe we missed it maybe its been and done he looked at the small dark square that was the window on to mary kellys downstairs room maybe shes already in there he shuddered at the thought of that beyond the pale ghost of a net curtain was a small bedroom that quite possibly resembled an abattoir right now a body almost unrecognizably human slowly losing the last of its warmth dots commas and question marks of blood in arterial lines up the walls now drying and crusting information someone is approaching said bob liam heard the clack of footsteps a shadow cast by one of the gaslights on dorset street danced down the rat run then a moment later the long shadow was followed by the outline of a woman he could hear the womans soft voice chattering to herself clearly utterly completely passingout drunk mary kelly she stopped outside the front door to her dosshouse pushed the creaking door in and staggered clumsily inside more footsteps quick light pattering down the rat run liam saw a long thin shadow dancing along the wet brick opposite then a man came into view tall and slim a top hat cast a shadow across his face he was wearing a thick cloak but liam managed to catch a glimpse of a leather surgeons bag under one arm he quickly stole across the courtyard and caught the front door to marys dosshouse with the toe of his boot before it slammed shut the man wrestled the door open and liam heard a muttered exclamation from the hallway inside the man pushed his way in and the door shut behind him a moment later there was life in the room to the left of the front door a gentle orange bloom appeared behind the tatty net curtain liam saw foggy movement going on inside shadows cast up the walls across the low ceiling jayzus this is it whispered liam that poor ladys going to die in a minute not just die bob but die horribly affirmative a gnawing sensation had been eating at liam for the last few hours that there must be some other way to put history right ahh this feels all wrong so it does we must not intervene cautioned bob liam ground his teeth his mind was replaying those two horrific photographs that maddy had presented him with earlier but now colouring in the black and white with vivid reds and intestinal purples but then wasnt something else meant to happen wasnt becks somewhere close by perhaps mere seconds away from altering this scene somehow saving mary kelly killing this evil psychopathic predator where the hell is she ah jayzus i cant do this i cant just let that poor lady get carved up right in front of my eyes hed started to get to his feet when a shrill scream came from behind the fogged window he saw a lurch of movement obscured by the net curtain and the scream was cut off a shadow sliding across the ceiling a sudden jerking movement then another and another and another liam felt the acid burn of bile in his throat his stomach rejecting food ah jayzus im letting this all happen he heard a soft keening moan from inside the room oh god shes still alive enough he got to his feet liam growled bob reaching out for him stuff this i cant just watch he ducked out from under the low slate leanto and darted across the small courtyard the shotgun in his hands and ready to use and it was then just then that he noticed a figure to his right striding quickly down the rat run towards him both liam and the other figure stopped the figure wore a dress and a bonnet her face what he could see of it was so very familiar becks jayzus is that you chapter am november whitechapel london faiths mind was all of a sudden inundated with too many simultaneous decision loops running each one of them furiously demanding all of her processor time even only as a silhouette she instantly recognized the young man standing in front of her target acquired liam oconnor not only that the target was a mere ten yards away and in a dead end from which he had no hope of escaping her command imperatives screamed inside her head to step forward quickly and get on with the job one of her fists balled and flexed keen to get on with the task of killing him but her eyes darted to the door that led to marys room the very room faith had been sharing with mary kelly her friend for days now her friend yes and her friend had screamed just moments ago her friend needed help now even now might just be a second too late to save her becks whispered the young man we have to help her faith realized that hed misidentified her he thought he was addressing the child support unit it was a mistake she could take advantage of right now draw closer to him while he still thought she was the other unit perhaps close enough that she could quickly strike with a jab to his fragile neck before he could react and try using that gun he was holding but but another desperate dying gurgle from within the room but her friend needed help now jesus becks cmon gimme a hand here one imperative won out over the other faith nodded agreed no sooner had she taken three steps forward when she sensed movement to her left a dark blur something large and fast looming towards her she turned to face the threat and was halfway towards adopting a defensive combat stance when every process in her mind every spinning loop of code every circuit running hot and overclocked every data bus clogged with shuttling bytes like a highway jammed with rushhour traffic all of it came to a shuddering grinding halt as if an iron bar had been shoved through the spokes of a spinning bicycle wheel several thousand volts locked her body rigid her grey eyes fixed on liams for a moment before she keeled over stiff as a board as the taser bolt fired into her waist rendered every muscle in her body as rigid as granite she landed on the ground like a felled tree and liam close enough to see her face clearly took a backward step jayzus its not becks liam turned to bob its one of them correct he heard movement behind the window the ripper was busy all right shes down now lets go and catch that murdering no bob reached out for liams arm liam backed away stepping up against the window he turned to look over his shoulder and got a seconds glimpse through a ragged gap in the net curtains of a scene lit by a single oil lamp inside a scene of ghastly crimson spattered across exposed ghostwhite flesh my god bob stepped forward and grasped his arm let me go goddammit negative bob pulled liam back towards the unconscious body of the unit both mission parameters have been satisfied we have what we came for we must let this happen the mans an animal no worse than that a monster a a liam realized he was crying there was a vague acknowledgement that his cheeks were damp with tears for how crazys this a complete stranger a woman hed glimpsed for less than ten seconds a poor wretch immortalized in the black and white grains of a sceneofcrime photograph forever frozen in her own timeless horror bob gently eased him back from the front door we must let him go the killer must escape and must not be discovered or identified his voice managed to soften from its usual dobermann growl to something resembling empathy understanding even i am sorry we have to let him go liam and we have to let mary kelly die in that room otherwise stupid powerful men in the future will blow each other to pieces right and not just themselves but women children even innocent young librarians why because their ideologies dont agree like children who cant agree on which toys to have at playtime and decide instead to set a match to the lot of them children no better than children he let bob pull the shotgun out of his hands the support unit stooped down picked up the unconscious body of their pursuer of the last few months their assassin and hefted her over one shoulder as if she was a pillowcase stuffed with charity shop seconds liam was also dimly aware of the weight of one of bobs arms around his shoulders not exactly a hug but the clumsy heavyengineering approximation of one we must go liam he nodded maddy had a pickup portal for them arranged for am located down among the warehouses and quays of blackfriars docks a couple of hours and change to spare yet but they would want to get moving away from this crime scene as quickly as possible the noises out here must have disturbed someone there might even be people peeking through curtains at them now the sooner they were gone the better otherwise over a hundred years from now a wikipedia article on the infamous whitechapel murders and various famous grisly murders anthologies might just feature in their footnotes an eyewitness sighting of a large ox of a man almost certainly a labourer accompanied by a slight and slender younger man with dark hair directly outside the room of the lastknown victim of jack the ripper at the estimated time of half past midnight chapter december holborn viaduct london this is incredible said rashim looking at the others we will see the wave approach you say yeah its like a weather front or something maddy led them outside the dungeon through their side door to stand on the kerb of farringdon street keep your eyes peeled for something that looks like a big bank of dark cloud its always a spectacular sight added sal and a bit scary when it hits you rashim looked giddy with excitement you know we argued about this dr yatsushita and i about how a universe would accommodate an alteration to its past what form the reality shift would take he gazed down farringdon street busy once again although the usual kaleidoscope of activity was heavily punctuated with clusters of crimson tunics of soldiers and the black morning coats and tall pith helmets of bobbies stationed in protective cordons round the few shopfronts yet to have been stoved in by rioters thered been rumours that more riots were going to happen again later on today but of course they werent going to happen the corrective time wave was going to arrive first i thought reality would flip its state with some sort of global instant paradigm shift rashim shook his head in awe some sort of a a pulse of change not like a tidal wave he turned to them how quickly does this wave arrive it varies said maddy sometimes almost immediately sometimes hours later its not predictable it almost seems random he nodded like some kind of schrodinger flux as if quantum particles are deciding to flip state or not if you ask me more like quantum particles are having some freakin union meeting and they need to vote unanimously on a change before something happens maddy replied sometimes its a nobrainer sometimes i guess reality has a real struggle agreeing which way it wants to go rashim chuckled you make it sound alive i do wonder sometimes liam sal called out for him she ducked back inside and cupped her hands liam you coming out to watch for the wave her voice echoed inside the dark brickbuilt labyrinth he was inside curled up on one of the bunks theyd improvised hed returned from the last short jump in an odd unliamlike withdrawn mood best leave him sal hes internalizing something maddy figured guilt disgust anger bob said hed glimpsed the murder scene the inside of mary kellys room maddy could only imagine what horror he must have seen through her window it must have been the stuff of nightmares the kind of image once seen that remains in your mind like lifelong retina burn just leave him be sal the time wave isnt anything he hasnt already seen before caution said bob he nodded down the street there is the time wave he pointed to the east above the tall townhouses opposite them above roof eaves and smoking chimney pots the afternoon sky was darkening prematurely soldiers and policemen street sweepers peddlers and traders the man standing on the flatbed of his coffee shop on wheels all began to look up with burgeoning curiosity as the crisp winter sky became an overcast and improbable swirling impressionists oil painting my god uttered rashim its incredible quite beautiful wont the wave affect our dungeon asked sal you know not having a field up and running it shouldnt holborn viaduct is here in either timeline mr hook and his dodgy importexport business were here in either timeline too so they wont change and everything liam and rashim have done setting this place up had happened would happen whether jack the ripper had been killed or not two timelines holborn viaduct and everything inside the same in either one in theory we should be all right maddy looked at rashim for confirmation as she spoke our dungeon shouldnt be affected by this he nodded maddy is right as he spoke his eyes remained on the sky but this street the rest of london all of this will change the riots will have never happened this damage will never have happened all returns to normality once more maddy watched as a cloud of pigeons fluttered from a rooftop nearby startled by the first gasp of a squalling wind the poor remain poor and subservient ignorant of a gentleman psychopath whose sport was carving up the bodies of unfortunate fallen women it didnt feel particularly good this time around restoring the status quo but as foster had once explained sometimes you have to allow space for a little evil in order to sidestep a much greater one an irradiated earth thats what they were avoiding by allowing a murderer to escape and live the rest of his life undiscovered perhaps even going on to murder again and again indulging his secret grotesque pleasure undiscovered of course they were never going to find out for sure if this evil monster went on to kill again whether jack the rippers victims went on to secretly number far more than the commonly accepted five the wikipedia article listed many more prostitutes who died grisly deaths after mary kelly who might have also been ripper victims but somehow didnt quite fit the same pattern of mutilations as the first five perhaps he was going to kill more perhaps his near capture and discovery frightened him off his grisly pleasure once and for all maddy decided she needed to sit down with liam and remind him that whatever that sick animal did and possibly went on to do once again their actions had saved this world a fair transaction in the greater scheme of things a woman fifty yards down from them screamed out in alarm as a spectral tendril suddenly curled across the sky like a negative image of forked lightning the time wave was almost upon them much closer maddy had seen it coming from across the east river roiling and boiling she knew it would no longer resemble a bank of cloud more a pulsating school of mackerel twisting turning extruding tentaclelike outgrowths as for rashim hed only briefly witnessed it roar past the archways open entrance this time they were going to be standing amid the swirling mass dont let it freak you out rashim cried maddy its weird but its totally harml her voice was lost in the sudden roar of a tsunami wind buffeted and rocked them on their feet they all suddenly became enveloped in a wind tunnel of blurring reality streaks of matter twisting curling changing fleeting visions of hell and heaven like an insane zoetrope sal narrowed her eyes against the onslaught she saw gargoyle faces whip past her one or two seemed to sense her presence wretched hands clawing towards her she thought in one fleeting moment that she saw a face she recognized a woman darkskinned much older greyhaired with bulging cataract eyes full of raging malice the face imploded into the snarl of some beetleblack underworld horror claws pincers teeth standing two feet to her right yet entirely alone in her own windtunnel hell maddy watched realitysoup conjure up momentary nightmares she too thought she spotted a familiar face pale and slim a young man framed by flailing hair was laughing or was it screaming was that adam she reached out towards him wondering if she might just be able to rescue him pull him out of this swirling matter to have him join them once again her hand almost but not quite touching his slender fingers then he was whipped away into a swirling reality tornado and became a thousand and one impossible things then as always it was all gone in two shakes of a lambs tail they were left staring at a farringdon street busy with the clopclopclop of horsedrawn hansom cabs and private carriages street hawkers barked the price of their wares a knot of leering dock workers passed right in front of them sharing a dirty laugh at some muttered punchline one of them turned to maddy and sal awl right there me loves he crowed quite obviously drunk swaying uncertainly on his feet come an join us lads eh sal flipped a hand gesture at him that wasnt going to have a proper meaning for another hundred years yet the drunk shrugged it off with a grin your loss love he tossed a goodnatured laugh back at them turned and staggered to catch up with his mates maddy sighed men eh chapter piccadilly circus london another warm sunset across the overgrown ruins of mankind the cry of a fox the chirp of crickets the gently swaying ochre sea of tall grass the predatory swoop of a hawk a peaceful grave of humankind like some windswept site of archaeological interest the ruins of troy of ancient sparta babylon now just like those places worn stubs of masonry overgrown by an emerald carpet of nature tumbledown walls cavedin roofs nothing lasts forever here bleached bones lie amid the tangled roots of wild grass doing a far better job of weathering time than the rusting flaking skeletons of cars peaceful like a prairie like the serengeti like an african veldt but now theres a fresh breeze and the faintest distant rumble the peachcoloured sunset sky has suddenly gained a faint twisting ribbon of black at first as thin as a pencil scribble following the line of the horizon across a landscape painting but very quickly becoming as thick as a marker pen as it approaches rapidly and seconds later a looming dark continental crust swallowing the land beneath it a dozen seconds of deafening chaos as this black horizon sweeps in over the ruins of london and this peaceful posthuman world is swept away a possible future that had its short chance to exist swept away to join a million other begrudging futures that will never get a chance to see the light of day its replaced by noise and chaos of a wholly different kind london the grass is gone piccadilly circus heaves with humanity a city crowded with thirty million inhabitants the statue of eros looks up at looming megaskyscrapers encrusted with holographic displays and garish adverts for soyoprotein products the sky buzzes with corporate jyrocopters and police airskimmers with winking blue lights and brilliant white searchlights tracking and monitoring the heaving populace below a torrential downpour cascades from an unhealthy lemontinted sky overcast with polluted clouds rainslicked pedestrians push and jostle each other across waterlogged pavements every last one of them wearing air filters on their faces london one of a couple of dozen metropolises around the world playing host to its share of the migrating billions even though this citys levees that hold back the swollen thames are sure to fail one day soon and it will join new york as another city lost to the rising seas every day thousands more people swarm in and live cheek by jowl in cluttered tenement blocks that dwarf the old buildings of canary wharf in a way its not so very different from the conditions of whitechapel nearly two centuries ago london buzzes like a shaken beehive pounding music from hawkers on the street and secondtier pedestrian walkways above a deafening riot of noise and movement and colour kerbside bazaars sell snakeoil cures for toxininduced asthma a trader sells slabs of pinkcoloured dough that hes claiming is real meat if it is god knows what creature it once was genetically engineered apelike workunits marked by tattoo barcodes and dressed in orange overalls move sullenly among the press of people clearing trash carelessly tossing the body of some starvedtodeath immigrant into the back of a waste recycler this is the london that will exist a mere five decades after the lastever olympic games are held here back in a time before the inevitable end was writ large for all to see and then foolishly ignored by one and all back before the first big oil shock when supplies began to falter before the sea level really started rising fast the sky discolouring crops failing ecosystems collapsing but of course this is the way it has to be this is the timeline a certain roald waldstein is so very desperate to preserve at all costs it has to be this and nothing else but this chapter holborn viaduct london wednesday december this is where we live now its not so very different to our last home i guess im getting used to it we dont get the twentytimesaday rumble of a train over us instead we have the constant deep engine rumble of holborn viaducts power generator not so different i suppose to listening to the backup generator we used to have were settled now finding new routines its a different feel in here with rashim and spongebubba keeping us company i think i like it spongebubba makes me laugh the thing looks so ridiculous with that wobbling nose we have to keep him out of sight of that nosy man delbert god knows what hed make of that lab unit we have a decision to make about the killer support unit its organic body is being kept alive its like some person in an almost vegetative state the eyes are open but theres nothing going on inside its head the thing drools when we try and feed it this barley gruel totally disgusting rashim says we can keep it going indefinitely if we keep feeding it the big question is whether we open up its her cranium and flip the hardset switch inside im not sure how maddy feels liam of course says we should me im not sure this support unit spent the last couple of months wanting nothing more than to kill us all i know its programming will all be erased but will it really be completely so we have our new home a new place in history which i do find very fascinating in many ways it feels like when we were first woken up by foster scary but exciting new it does feel a bit like that again but it wont ever be the same not now that we know were fakes pretendhumans in fact theres only one real person in here rashim perhaps this time around though its better like maddy said were in charge now we can decide whether or not we want to fix history and whos going to stop us now no one no one knows where we are now not even mr roald waldstein i like that that makes me feel safe maddy joined liam standing in their side door he was watching farringdon street slowly come to life it was just gone seven in the morning and wisps of morning mist spun like silk across the wide cobbled street today looked like it was going to be another nice one a clear blue sky waiting for the sun to get up and join it a lampsnuffer was putting out the streets gas lamps with his longhandled snuffer tray above them on top of the viaduct the electricpowered lights would be turned off manually by a man from the edison electric company they were beginning to learn the morning routine along farringdon street good morning said maddy liam nodded he seemed a lot brighter since returning from the whitechapel jump less than a week ago aye looks like itll be nice today she had an enamel mug of coffee for him handed it to him and took up a place on the doorstep beside him i like that were not endlessly recycling in a twoday loop she said things change thats kinda nice you sure we dont need to set up a field yup were quite safe here no ones looking for time travellers she laughed no one in this time has even thought about time travel id say i mean wasnt it that writer guy h g wells who first thought up the idea of time travel liam shrugged im sure somebody mustve thought of the idea before he did it must be the oldest fanciful notion ever that it might be fun to travel backwards or forwards through time yeah well she sipped her coffee he was the first one to write a fiction book about it mark twain what mark twain wrote a book about time travel im sure he did a yankee fella in king arthurs court i think it was called or something like that maddy hunched her shoulders oh well whatever my point is we dont have to worry quite so much about staying under the radar here nor do we have to worry about time waves none of us are real none of us belong in this timeline so it really doesnt matter he looked at her youre ok are you not uh not upset about about not being the real maddy carter from boston she wrinkled her nose not really not any more i think i quite like the feeling of freedom i quite like not missing my mom and dad and my cousin julian somebody made all those people up put painful memories of them into my head im damned if im going to spend another second grieving for figments of someones imagination stuff em liam laughed aye that does seem a bit daft i am who i am right now in this moment of time this is who i am and thats all she looked sideways at him and smiled nice thought that isnt it its liberating aye they heard a steam whistle echoing up from the far end of farringdon street where the docks and the river thames were barges came in there and loaded and emptied round the clock a neverending cycle of trade and commerce on the other hand sals not coping so well i dont think said liam finally maddy nodded you and i should keep an eye on her after all i suppose we literally really are family now uh she looked at him i might just be your sister liam what think about it we couldve been grown together as a batch she laughed at her own words then curled her lip at a thought god i really hope we didnt share a growtube with you that would be kinda gross charmed they sipped their coffees blowing clouds of condensation out of their mugs into the chilly morning air what about you liam you all right about being a meat robot he grinned that devilmaycare lopsided smile she wondered if that stupid smile of his was what kept him sane made his good nature bulletproof aye im not too bothered so at least i know now why it is i can cope with all that time travelling and not age so much as a normal person it makes a bit more sense now she hadnt told him about the ageing thing shed planned to but never quite got round to it and yet it seemed he knew all about that dont look so shocked maddy im not completely stupid i worked out this is how i became foster or i should say how i become like foster i presume foster was a meatproduct like us right she nodded travelling is ageing me he flicked the tuft of grey hair above his right ear and im not blind i noticed that he pulled at the skin around his eyes the faintest of crows feet there and dont think i didnt notice this either he cocked his head casually so im getting a little older happens to all of us eventually doesnt it she could have kissed him for being so resolutely liam so brave so strong so flippant you know mads i was thinking about this last night i presume i must be older now you know physically no longer just a sixteenyearold slice of a lad eh i suppose so older than you mads i dont know its possible i guess so whats your point he grinned well now if im the oldest does that not mean that makes me the boss around here then she snorted coffee from her nose there was laughter somewhere in that in your freakin dreams mr oconnor alex scarrowepilogue wg systems research campus pinedale wyoming roald waldstein stared out of the broad panoramic window of his boardroom the lemontinted sky over the steep slopes promised another downpour of acid rain further stripping the last vestiges of green from the dying douglas firs and the hilly landscape his forehead pressed against the plate glass his hands leaving fingerprint smudges he felt emotionally void utterly spent the last three days of his life had been spent in a desperate panic to get those embryos speedgrown and ready he was far too old for this damned level of stress hed begun to hope it was all long behind him that his project the agency was something he could forget about fourteen years ago fourteen years ago almost to this day it happened almost an anniversary the day joseph olivera had turned on him and demanded to know what pandora was all about back then waldstein had begun to look on the young man almost as a son a son to replace his boy gabriel so long ago now that hed lost little gabriel and his wife eleanor a simple vehicle accident if his wife had done just one of a thousand inconsequential little things differently that morning she and gabriel would still be alive and with him today but olivera had pushed and pushed and pushed asking questions waldstein couldnt possibly answer and then coming to his own paranoid conclusions all by himself hed never had frasier griggs killed the poor man had simply been desperately unlucky took the wrong route home one night but joseph had been convinced hadnt he and he wanted to know wanted to know why waldstein needed to steer history this way why why do you want mankind to destroy itself mr waldstein if only he could tell the poor young man but olivera had gone and panicked olivera had garbled something about griggs being killed because hed found out too much that day back in poor young joseph olivera had convinced himself that waldstein was going to have him killed nothing could have been further from his mind he wanted joseph out of that lab away from the instrumentation panels before he did anything stupid but joseph had panicked and hurled himself into an open portal without any preparation without any density checks nothing god knows what horror happened to him waldstein had cried for him that day and then there was the alarming event a few days later a group of antitimetravel activists managed to break into a project being secretly developed by the russians activists who heroworshipped waldstein regarded him with his antitimetravel message as some sort of a prophet it turned out the russian timedisplacement project was a onewayonly technology with a severely limited range but it was enough for the activists to send a lone assassin back to in an attempt to kill a young chineseamerican boy called edward chan the young man who would soon write a thesis that would change the world a thesis waldstein would read as a young man himself and there it would be how time travel could actually be possible the assassination attempt was successful and waldstein had watched from within the safety of his labs protection field as the ensuing time wave changed everything outside that was the final straw too much to handle too much stress hed beamed a warning back to the team but that was it the last thing he wanted to do with this that day fourteen years ago was the day he decided to finally close the doors on his special little project to mothball it put locks on it and walk away the agency was back there in they now had everything they needed to function and that was always his intention anyway for them to be selfsufficient entirely on their own and working to preserve this timeline they certainly didnt need a heartbroken old man like him keeping tabs on them hed closed those doors and locked them with a few final solemn words im sorry youre on your own now fourteen years ago and since then most days he thought of them those three handcrafted genetic products so carefully designed for their roles liam with his robust quickwitted mind sal with her enhanced visual acuity maddy with a mind designed for data sifting in a way theyd almost been like his own children like two daughters and a son they were back there all on their own with an older copy of the boy as the closest thing to a mentor for them if they could just hold things together prevent anyone else unseating this timeline for just a little longer just until then it would all have been worthwhile job done mission accomplished waldstein had even begun to believe it was all working out thered even been days when he hadnt bothered to routinely check that tatty yellowing page of newspaper with the personal ads on it all it seemed was fine going to plan they were back there doing their job and mankind was counting down its last few months and years until pandora happened before they wiped themselves out then all of this exhausting stress three days ago out of the blue that message from the maddy carter unit demanding to know all about pandora demanding and threatening his three children were rebelling against their father like joseph olivera demanding to know what pandora was and threatening to come offmission if no satisfactory answer was returned with that brief message theyd switched from being part of his plan to being a very big problem oh god help me opening up that dusty old lab again after all these years pulling those militaryclass foetuses out from cold storage growing them hatching them and briefing them briefing them to execute his own children had been one of the hardest most painful things hed had to do in his entire life hed sent them back to little more than an hour ago and hed just realized something he was probably never going to know for sure if theyd been successful most probably they had six lethal killing machines arriving right inside their archway without any warning whatsoever his poor children wouldnt have stood a chance the kill team had instructions to terminate the timeriders destroy every item of equipment in the archway then terminate themselves he should have thought to instruct them to send a final message when they had completed those objectives just before they selfterminated a simple message to let him know the deed was done timeriders successfully terminated but in his panic and haste he hadnt waldstein looked out of the window as gentle spots of toxic rain began to spatter heavily against the glass well it was almost certainly done and in any case there wasnt much time left now for anyone to steer history from its proper course its nearly time he sighed leaving a small cloud on the glass in a few months time a virus was going to be released by either the japanese or the north koreans no one was ever going to know who mankind was going to be almost completely wiped out in the space of a few short weeks nearly time his words echoed across an empty boardroom wg systems was a shell of a business now a few caretaker staff left but most had been let go eighteen months ago there really was no more need for his business empire to be making any more money far better his employees spent what little time left with their families and loved ones its nearly time he whispered once more ive done all that you asked me to do please now let this be enough
