aneurisms no ruptures assaults or dramas night shift at city central was deathly quiet he wanted it to be more so no less than four nurses and one intern had used the lull to ask him how he was coping no really dr reynard if youd like to talk about it he didnt he glowered at everyone who came close he settled himself in the staff lounge and he concentrated on his reading specifically he concentrated on reading the appointments vacant in this months medical journal wheres dimboola my aunty lives in dimboola one of the theatre nurses ventured its in north west victoria aunty liz says its a great little town right he said and struck a line through dimboola there was silence while he checked a few more ads then wheres mission beach north queensland the same nurse told him you remember joe and jodie joe and jodie joe was the paediatric intern here last year big blond guy almost as hunky as you six feet tall and yummyevery sensible womans dream she grinned but in a way that said her compliment wasnt idle banter but was designed to cheer him up as was everything anyone said to him at the moment lets look after fergus joe married jodie walters from icu she continued as she failed to elicit a smile they took a job at port douglas last year and thats close to mission beach ok fergus sorted the dross and came up with the information he needed there were people he knew close to mission beach another line he knew the next place in the list of advertisements and the next and the next more advertisements were consigned to oblivion then wheres cradle lake silence this was hopeful he gazed around checking each of his colleagues for any sign of recognition does anyone know where cradle lake is never heard of it graham his anaesthetist told him cradle mountains in tasmania is it near there apparently not it has a new south wales postcode never heard of it then no one knows it fergus demanded and received four shakes of four heads in reply great he said and the line became a circle thats where im going ginny got the phone call at two in the morning shed known it had been coming but it didnt make it any less appalling richard was ringing from his hospital bed he hadnt wanted her with him when he was told and hed waited until now to call who could blame him where could anyone find the courage to face news like this much less pass it on they cant do another transplant he said in a voice devoid of all emotion the specialists say theres no hope itll work i guessed it must be that she whispered when you didnt call earlier i thought it must be bad news oh richard she sat up in bed trying not to cry ill come no not now what are you doing staring at the ceiling wondering how im going to face whats coming and whether i have the right to ask to ask what ginny i want to go home back to cradle lake she drew in her breath at that she hadnt been near cradle lake for years richard had referred to cradle lake as home home was where the heart was she thought dumbly home surely wasnt at cradle lake richard there are no medical facilities at cradle lake i dont think theres even a doctor there any more the time for the clever stuff is over he said so roughly that he made himself gasp for breath it took him a moment or two to recover gaining strength for the next thought i just needi just need to know itll be ok surely having a doctor for a sister has to count for something you can do whats necessary i dont know that i can you can keep me painfree there was only one answer to that the medical part was the least of what she was facing and it wasnt her medical skills she was doubting yes well then richard the house her mind was spinning at tangents trying to find a way out of what was inescapable its been neglected for years you can get it fit for us if i stay in hospital for a few more days youll have time to organise it we dont need luxury im prepared to stay here until the weekend gee thanks she thought her mind churning through grief through shock and confusion surfacing suddenly with anger hed wait while she quit the job she loved while she packed up her apartment while she salvaged the wreck of a house she hated and while she moved her life back to a place she loathed but at least she had a life she closed her eyes willing anger to retreat she knew from experience that anger made pain recede that was why she was feeling it now but in the long term anger didnt help anything pain would always surface she couldnt let her anger show nor her pain are you sure you want to do this she managed and was thankful she was on the end of the phone and not by her brothers bedside she didnt want him to see her like this she was trembling all over shaking as if shed been placed on ice im sure he said more strongly im going to sit on our back veranda and his voice broke off he didnt have to finish they both knew the word that would finish the sentence this was a family song sung over and over will you do this for me ginny he asked in a voice that had changed and once again there was only one reply of course i will she managed you know i will she always had she thought but she didnt say it there was no point in saying what they both knew the cost of life was losing chapter one she was lying where he wanted to drive dr fergus reynard was lost hed been given a map of sealed roads but sealed roads accounted for about one per cent of the tracks around here take the second track left over the ridge the district nurse had told him and hed stared at wheel marks and tried to decide which was a track and which was just the place where some obscure vehicle had taken a jaunt through the mud after the last rain somewhere around here someone called oscar bentley was lying on his kitchen floor with a suspected broken hip oscar needed a doctor him the hospital land cruiser had lost traction on the last turn hed spun and when hed corrected there had been a woman lying across the road the woman wasnt moving she was face down over some sort of cattle grid he could see tight jeansso tight he knew it was definitely a woman he could see ancient boots she was wearing an even more ancient windcheater and her caramelblonde shoulderlength curls were sprawled out around her why was she lying on the road he was out of the truck reaching her in half a dozen strides expecting the worst had she collapsed had she been hit before hed arrived he knelt his medical training switching into overdrive at last she muttered as he touched her shoulder whoever you are can you grab its other ear medical training took a step back um pardon its ear she said her voice was muffled but she still managed to sound exasperated my arms not long enough to get a decent hold i can reach one ear but not the other ive been lying here for half an hour waiting for the football to finish and if you think im letting go now youve another think coming he needed to take in the whole situation woman lying face down over a cattle grid arm down through the grid he stared down through the bars she was holding what looked like a newborn lamb by the tip of one ear the ear was almost two feet down underneath the row of steel rails the pit was designed to stop livestock passing from one property to another a fullgrown sheep couldnt cross this grid a newborn lamb couldnt cross the grid either but this one had obviously tried it was so small it had simply slipped through to the pit below ok trapped lamb girl lying on road ferguss training was asserting itself in an emergency hed been taught to take in the whole situation before doing anything make sure theres no surrounding danger before moving into help mode on top of the ridge stood a ewe bleating helplessly she was staring down at them as if they were enemiesas if shed like to ram them did sheep ram anyone the girl obviously wasnt worried about ramming sheep so maybe he shouldnt either but maybe continuing to lie in the middle of the road wasnt such a great idea i could have hit you he said then as she didnt answer anxiety gave way to anger i could have run you over are you out of your mind no one drives fast on this track unless theyre lunatics she muttered still clutching the lambs ear sane drivers always slow down at cattle grids that pretty much put him in his place do you intend to stand there whinging about where i should or shouldnt lie or are you going to help me the woman demanded and he decided maybe he should do something what do you want me to do squeeze your arm through the bars and catch the other ear right maybe that was easier said than done the woman was finely built which was why shed been able to reach the lamb itd be a harder call for someone heavier someone with a thicker arm like him then what he said cautiously i cant get my other arm into position if i release this ear hell bolt to the other side of the pit and itll take me ages to catch him again if you can grab his other ear and pull him up for a moment i reckon i can reach further down and get him by the scruff of the neck and pull him out she sighed thats the idea einstein theres no need to be rude no she agreed neither is there any need for me to rescue this stupid lamb its not even my lamb but i just walked out to catch some bucolic air and i heard him bleating its taken ages to catch him and hell die if i leave him ive been in the one spot for half an hour waiting for the footy to finish so someone would come along this damned roadand the irons digging into my faceso can we cut it out with the niceties and grab the stupid ear right he said and rolled up his sleeves it was even harder than hed thought he had muscles built from years of gym work at his wellequipped city hospital and those muscles didnt help now up to his elbow was easy but then he had to shove hard and it hurt and even then he could only just touch jump the woman yelled and he and the lamb both jumpedwhich gave him access to an extra inch of ear he got a hold they were now lying sprawled over the cattle grid with a lambs ear each neat fergus thought and turned to grin at her she wasnt grinning she was pressed hard against him her body warm against his and she was concentrating solely on sheep let go and youre dead meat she muttered on the count of three we pull our ears up well break its neck i only want to pull him up a couple of inches or so in a nice smooth pullno jerkingand then ill grab his neck if i try and pull by one ear ill break his neck ready set now what happened to the one two three but he was ready and hed gone beyond arguing he tugged the lamb upward she grabbedand somehow she had a handful of wool at the back of the little creatures neck then she had more orders shove your hand under its belly she gasped as she tugged the creature higher and he did and thirty seconds later they had a shivery skinny still damply newborn lamb rising out of the pit into the late afternoon sun oh hooray the woman whispered she struggled to her feet cradling the lamb against her and for the first time fergus managed to get a proper look at her she was in her late twenties he thought deciding she wasnt a whole lot younger than his thirtyfour years she was five feet four or five dressed in ancient jeans and an even more ancient windcheater her tousled curls were blowing everywhere freckles were smattered over a pert and pretty nose she was liberally mudspattered but somehow the mud didnt matter she was patting the lamb but her clear brown eyes were assessing him with a candour that made him feel disconcerted she was some package youre not a local she said and he realised shed been doing the same assessment as him im the local doctor shed been trying to stop the lamb from struggling as she ran her hands expertly over its body she was doing an assessment for damage he thought but now her hand stopped in midstroke the local doctors dead old doc beaverstock died five years ago he agreed the people who run the hospital seem to think they need a replacement thats me speaking of which can you tell me youre working here as of yesterday yes her eyes closed and when they opened again he saw a wash of pain and something more relief oh thank god she said then she set the lamb onto its feet and let it go the place where they were standing was deserted to the west lay lush paddocks any selfrespecting sheep would think were sheep paradise to the west was the ewe to the east was the cattle pit and dense bushland leading down to a lake formed by an ancient volcano west or east some actions were nobrainers the lamb turned and ducked through the womans legs straight for the cattle pit stop she screamed and not for nothing had fergus played rugby for his university he took a flying tackle and caught the creature by a back hoof as it hit the first rail face down in the mud he lay holding onto the leg for dear life oh well done she was laughing kneeling in the mud beside him gathering the lamb back into her arms again and he thought suddenly she smells nice which was ridiculous in truth she smelt of lamb and mud with the odd spot of manure thrown in how could she smell nice dont let him go again he said weakly wiping mud from his face as he shoved himself into a sitting position hed hit the ground hard and he was struggling to get his breath im so sorry she rose and grinned down at him and she didnt look sorry at all she had a great grin think nothing of it he managed take the damned thing away i havent got a car holding the lamb in one arm she offered a hand to help haul him to his feet he took it and discovered she was surprisingly strong she tugged and he rose and suddenly she was justclose nice he thought inconsequentially really nice im about half a mile from where i live she was saying but suddenly he was having trouble hearing so he was disconcerted the feel of her hand yep he was definitely disconcerted she released him and he was aware of a pang of loss she didnt seem to notice she was looking up toward the ewe brushing mud from her face and leaving more mud in its place it was dumb to let him go she muttered he and his mum need to go in the house paddock until were sure hes recovered how do you get them to a house paddock fergus asked and then thought maybe that was a question he shouldnt have asked it was tantamount to offering help and here it came the request she bit her lip i dont think i can herd a sheep and a lamb up to the house she admitted ewes arent like cows they might or might not follow even if i have the lamb she looked at his land cruiser and he saw exactly what she was thinking can you give me a lift to the bentley place thats where these two belong oscar bentleys he demanded startled yes she handed him the lamb and he was so astounded that he took it just stand there and dont move she told him then no she corrected herself joggle up and down a bit so the ewes looking at you and not me i need to go he was remembering oscar bentley yes the lambs needs were urgent but a broken hip was more so not until we have the ewe she moved swiftly away twenty thirty yards up the slope moving with an ease that was almost catlike then she disappeared behind a tree and he realised what she was doing he was being used as a distraction ok he could do that obediently he held the lamb toward the ewe the ewe stared wildly down at her lamb and took a tentative step forward the woman launched herself out from behind her tree in a rugby tackle that put ferguss efforts to shame the ewe was big but suddenly she was propped up on her rear legs which prevented her from struggling and the woman had her solidly and strongly in position it had been a really impressive manoeuvre to say fergus was impressed was an understatement put the lamb in your truck and back it up to me she told him gasping with effort and he blinked um i cant stand here for ever if shed had a foot free she would have stamped it move he moved he was about to put a sheep in the back of the hospital truck fine as of two days ago he was a country doctor this was the sort of thing country doctors did wasnt it it seemed it was this country doctor had no choice he hauled open the back of the truck shoved the medical equipment as far forward as itd go and tossed a canvas over the lot miriam his practice nurse had set the truck up for emergencies and she had three canvases folded and ready at the side for coping with sheep maybe miriam knew more about country practice than he did anyone would know more about country practice than he did he put the lamb in the back and started closing the door but as he did so the little creature wobbled he hesitated he sighed and lifted the lamb out again he climbed in behind the wheel and placed the lamb on his knee dont even think about doing anything wet he told it housetraining starts now the woman was walking the sheep down the slope toward the track he backed up as close as he could mess my seat and youre chops he told the lamb in a further refinement of housetraining he closed the door firmly on one captive and went to collect another getting the ewe into the truck was no easy task the ewe took solid exception to being manhandled but the woman seemed to have done this many times before she pushed they both heaved and the creature was in the door slammed and fergus headed for the drivers door in relief the woman was already clambering into the passenger seat lifting the lamb over onto her knee wherever they were going it seemed she was going too i can drop them at bentleys he told her thats where im going youre going to bentleys thats the plan he hesitated but im a bit lost go back the way you came she said snapping her seat belt closed under the lamb i can walk home from there its close take the second turn to the left after the ridge thats the second time ive been given that direction he told her only im facing the opposite way you came from the odonell track to get to oscars im not a local he said exasperated youre the local doctor im here as a locum ive been here since thursday and ill be here for twelve weeks she stared and he thought he could see calculations happening behind her eyes that might be long enough she whispered and he thought she was talking to the lamb she was hugging it closetwo muddy waifs he wasnt exactly pristine himself whatever she was thinking though she didnt expand on it they drove for a couple of minutes in silence and he realised he didnt even know her name im dr fergus reynard he told her into what had suddenly become a tense stillness im ginny viental ginny short for guinevere but im not exactly guinevere material hadnt guinevere been some gorgeous queen if that was the case but maybe she was right fergus decided maybe queen guinevere wouldnt be splodged with lamb mud but there was definitely gorgeous underneath the mud im pleased to meet you ginny he told her figuring he should concentrate on keeping the truck on the slippery track rather than letting his attention stray to this very different woman beside him it was a hard task do you live around here i used to live here she told him ive just come backfor a while do your parents live here they lived here when i was a kid she said discouragingly i did too until i was seventeen she wasnt seventeen now he thought trying again to figure her age she looked young but there were lines around her eyes that made him think shed not had things easy but something in her face precluded him from asking questions oscar bentley he said cautiously searching for neutral ground youre sure its his lamb im sure the cattle grids on our property but he has agistment rights oscar was an ordinary farmer fifteen years back now he seems to have lost the plot completely hes hardly made a decent access track fergus muttered hauling the truck away from an erosion rut a foot deep he likes making it hard for visitors ginny told him why has he called you out unless thats breaking patient confidentiality im not sure there can be much patient confidentiality about a broken hip a broken hip thats what he thinks is wrong she snorted yeah right broken hip ill bet hes fallen down drunk and he wants someone to put him to bed you know him well then i told you i lived here i havent been near oscar for years but he wont have changed if you dont live here now where do you live will you quit it with the inquisition she said her voice muffled by the lamb again i hate the smell of wet wool so dont stick your nose into wet sheep theres a medical prescription for you she said and she grinned which somehowchanged things again wow he thought that was some smile when the lines of strain eased from around her eyes she lookedbeautiful definitely beautiful why are you here she demanded hauling her nose off the lamb as if the question had only just occurred to her and it was important i told you im here as a locum weve never been able to get a locum before i cant imagine why not he said with asperity releasing the brakes then braking again to try and get some traction on the awful track this is real resort country not youre seeing it at its worst we had a doozy of a storm last week and the floodings only just gone down its not bad he conceded staring out at the rolling hills and bushland and the deep clear waters of the lake below sure it was five hours drive to the nearest city to the nearest specialist backup but that was what hed come for isolation and the rugged volcanic country had a beauty all its own lots ofsheep he said cautiously lots of sheep she agreed looking doubtfully out the window as if she was trying to see the good side too if you think sheep are pretty she twisted to look over her shoulder at the moroselooking ewe in the back of the truck as if on cue the creature widened her back legs and let go a stream of urine oh yeah she agreed sheep my favourite animals he was going to have to clean out the back of his truck already the pungent ammoniac smell was all around them despite that his lips twitched a farmer born and bred im no farmer she said which might explain why you were lying on the road in the middle of nowhere holding a lamb by one ear when the entire crowd from the cradle lake football game could have come by at any minute and squashed you there was that grin again the entire crowd from this side of the lake being exactly eight locals led by doreen kettle who takes her elderly mother and her five kids to the football every week and who drives ten times slower than you the last of the eight will be the coach who drives home about ten tonight cradle lake will have lostwe always loseand our coach will have drowned his sorrows in the pub therell be no way hell be on the roads until after the cradle lake constabulary go to bed which is after football replay on telly which finishes at ninethirty leaving the rest of saturday night for cradle lake to make whoopee how long did you say youve been away he asked cautiously and she chuckled it was a very nice chuckle he decided light and soft and gurgling really infectious ten years but nothing nothing nothing changes in cradle lake even doreen kettles kids when i left she was squashing them into the back of the car to take them to the footy theyre still squashing only the squashings got tricker i think the youngest is now six feet three she brightened but then youve changed cradle lake has a doctor why are you here he sighed the question was getting repetitive i told youas a locum no ones ever been able to get a locum for cradle lake before the last doctor was only here because his car broke down here just after the war he was on his way to visit a war buddy and he couldnt get anyone to repair it he didnt have the gumption to figure any other way of moving on fergus winced hed only been in the district for a couple of days but already the stories of the old doctors incompetence were legion your trucks still operating ginny pointed out so why did you stop this is the hospital truck and i ran my finger down the ads in the medical journal and chose the first place id never heard of she stared why i wanted a break from the city she eyed him with caution you realise you wont exactly get a holiday here this farming lands marginal you have a feeder district of very poor families wholl see your presence as a godsend youll be run off your feet with medical needs that have needed attention for years i want to be busy she considered him some more and he wondered what she was seeing his reasons for coming he hoped not he tried to keep his face expressionless so by break she said cautiously you dont mean a break from medicine no she eyed him for a bit longer but somewhat to his surprise she didnt ask any more questions maybe she didnt want him asking questions back he thought and he glanced at her again and knew he was right there was something about the set of her face that said her laughter was only surface deep there were problems real and dreadful problems as a good physician he should probe no he wasnt a good physician he was a surgeon and he was here as a locum to focus on superficial problems and refer anything worse to the city he needed to think about a fractured hip they were bumping over yet another cattle grid before them was a ramshackle farmhouse surrounded by what looked like a graveyard for ancient cars about six illassorted halfstarved dogs were on the veranda and they came tearing down the ramp baying like the hounds from hell as the vehicle pulled to a stop im a city boy fergus said nervously staring out at the snarling mutts and ginny grinned pushed open the door and placed the lamb carefully on her seat behind her she closed the truck door as the hounds reached her seemingly ready to tear her to pieces sit she roared in a voice that could have been heard in the next state they all backed off as if shed tossed a bucket of cold water over them three of the mongrels even sat and a couple of them wagged their disreputable tails she swiped her hands together in a gesture of a job well done and then turned and peeped a smile at him you can get out now she told him the dragons have been slain and were quits you rescued me and ive rescued you right back thanks he told her stepping gingerly outbut all the viciousness of the dogs had been blasted out of them but the dogs were the least of his problems doc it was a mans voice coming from the house and it was a far cry from the plaintive tone that had brought him here in the first place is that the bloody doctor the voice yelled about bloody time a man could die the voice broke off in a paroxysm of coughing as if the yell had been a pentup surge of fury that had left the caller exhausted lets see the patient ginny said heading up the ramp before him who was the doctor here feeling more at sea than hed ever felt in his entire medical training fergus was left to follow oscar bentley was a seriously big man huge hed inched from overweight to obese many years ago fergus thought as a fast visual assessment had him realising the man was in serious trouble maybe that trouble didnt stem from a broken hip but he was in trouble nevertheless he lay like a beached whale sprawled across the kitchen floor a halfempty carton of beer lay within reach so he hadnt been in danger of dying from thirst but he certainly couldnt get up his breathing was rasping each breath sucked in as if it took a conscious effort to haul in enough air the indignant roar hed made as theyd arrived must have been a huge effort ginny reached his patient before him hey oscar doc reynard tells me youve broken your hip she was bending over the huge man lifting his wrist what a mess the elderly mans eyes narrowed he looked like hed still like to yell but the effort seemed beyond him his breathing was dangerously laboured yet anger seemed tantamount youre one of the viental kids he snarled what are you doing here im ginny she agreed cordially and to ferguss astonishment she was looking at her watch as her fingers rested on the mans wrist did she have medical training a viental the farmer gasped and he groaned as he shifted his vast bulk to look at her more closely what the hell are you doing on my property why arent you dead im helping doc reynard plus i pulled one of your lambs out of the cattle grid dividing your land from ours her face hardened a little ive been up on the ridge looking over the stock youve been running on our land your ewes have obviously been lambing for weeks and at least six ewes have died during lambing theyve been left where they died no ones been near them mind your own business he gasped i didnt call doc reynard for a lectureand i didnt call you i dont want a viental anywhere near my property you called doc reynard to get you on your feet again she snapped theres no way he can do that on his ownwithout a crane that is lets check the hip fergus said uneasily and she flashed a look of anger back at him theres no difference in the length of oscars legs he has breathing difficulties but thats because he wont do anything about his asthma hell have got himself into this state because he couldnt be bothered fending for himself so he feels like a few days in the hospital he does it deliberately and hes been doing it for twenty years she glanced around the kitchen and winced though by the look of it its gone beyond the need for a few days in hospital now maybe we need to talk about a nursing home she had a point the place was disgusting but still the hip fergus reiterated trying again to regain control right the hip she sat back and pressed her fingers lightly on oscars hips how about that she said softly while both men stared at her astounded no pain aagh oscar roared but the roar was a fraction too late enough he was the doctor and this was his patient do you mind moving back he demanded lifting ginnys hands clear i need to do an examination theres no need hell have stopped taking his asthma medication do you want me to get oxygen from your truck i was called to a broken hip fergus said testily he didnt have a clue what was happening herewhat the dynamics were her pressure on the hips without result had been diagnosis enough but he wasnt taking chances on a patientand a situationthat he didnt know let me examine him almost surprisingly she agreed ill get the oxygen and then ill wait outside ill take care of the sheep someones got to take care of the sheep then ill come with you to the hospital he frowned he wasnt too sure why she intended coming to the hospital he wasnt even sure he wanted her there was something about this womans presence that was sending danger signals thick and fast you were going to walk home hell have to go to hospital she said evenly hes drunk his breathings unstable and you wont be able to prove he hasnt got a broken hip without xrays how are you planning to lift oscar yourself ill call in the paramedics he snapped excuse me but this is the last home and away football match for cradle lake this season ginny snapped back if by paramedic you mean ern and bill who take it in turns to drive the local ambulance then youll find they refuse absolutely to come until the matchand the postmatch celebrationis over especially if its to come to oscar which was why he had come here in the first place he thought dourly the call had come in and thered been no one willing to take it that leaves you stuck she continued for a couple of hours at least unless you accept help fine he conceded trying not to sound confused ill accept your help can you wait outside very magnanimous she said and she grinned his lips twitched despite his confusion it was a great grin get on with the job ignore gorgeous grins just go he told her and she clicked her disreputable boots together and saluted yes sir chapter two she went fergus did a perfunctory examination and then a more thorough one oscar had no broken hip but ginny was rightthe man was dead drunk his blood pressure was up to one ninety on a hundred and ten and his breathing was fast and noisy even once he was on oxygen fergus checked his saturation levels and accepted the inevitable i gotta go to hospital dont i doc oscar demanded with what was evident satisfaction his breathing was becoming more shallow now and fergus wondered whether hed drunk a lot fast just as theyd arrivedjust to make sure i told you i got a broken hip you dont appear to have broken anything fergus told him but yes you need to come to hospital he gazed around the kitchen and grimaced maybe we need to think about some sort of permanent care he suggested unless theres anyone who can stay with you thats not me ginny said through the screen door or anyone in this district this isnt exactly mr popular here whats the prognosis mr bentley needs help with his breathing fergus said trying not to sound like he was talking through gritted teeth he knew by now that the diagnosis shed made had been spot on hes not safe to leave alone the ambulance will have to come out to collect him i told youthey wont come for at least a couple of hours will you stay with mr bentley until they come he asked without much hope and she shook her head nope im needed elsewhere and i cant stand mr bentley i cant stand you either miss the farmer snapped you and your whore of a mother you and your family deserved everything you got ginny had opened the screen door and stepped inside but oscars words stopped her she flinched recoiling as if she had been struck her colour faded and she leaned back against the kitchen bench as if she suddenly needed support no family ever deserved what happened to us she whispered and she turned to fergus as if she couldnt bear the sight of the man on the floor she swallowed evidently trying hard to move on from his vicious words obese patients like him are the pits she said and if you leave him alone hell stay alive just long enough to sue mores the pity so you need to take him to hospital if neither of us want to sit here for a couple of hours that means we use the back of your truck i got the ewe out you got the ewe out he said blankly and she managed a weak smile that would be the sheep city boy the one that waswell making herself at home in the back of your land cruiser i put the ewe and her baby in the home paddock she glared down at oscar with disdain i put hay in there too and i filled the trough she said much to the relief of the rest of the stock youre so off our property id rather let the place go to ruin than let you agist on our place again the dogs are starving the sheep are flyblown and miserable and theres a horse locked up she broke off and fergus saw real distress on her face ill get the rspca out here straight away she whispered and i hope you end up in jail you deserve to be there not hospital whew ginny can we keep to the matter at hand fergus said trying to keep control in a situation that was spiralling we cant take mr bentley in the truck sure we can ginny said making an obvious effort to shove distress aside ive washed it outsort of a nice amniotic smell never hurt anyone maybe we could be supernice and find a mattress the back of the land cruiser is long enough to make an ambulance but lifting a stretcher wont do it she agreed wed break both our backs hang on for a bit and ill find a door and some fence posts and a mattress be right back and she was gone slipping through to the living room and the bedrooms beyond you gonna let her just walk though my house oscar roaredor tried to roar but the drink and the asthma were taking their toll and he was losing his bluster his roar was cut off in midtirade and the last words were said as a gasp im not sure what else to do fergus admitted shes in control and were not so you concentrate on your breathing and well let ginny sort us both out his opinions were consolidated five minutes later while he watched as ginny attacked the kitchen door shed found a mattress and had it lying on the floor beside oscar shed also found three cylindrical fence posts each about three feet long and now she was unscrewing door hinges do you mind letting me in on the plan fergus asked but oscar chose that moment to retch and he had to focus on keeping the airway clear he took this too far ginny said briefly glancing across at their patient with active dislike if you hadnt been available hed have risked dying hes played this too many times for the locals to take any notice fergus sighed doctors were trained to save lives no matter how obnoxious those lives were but it didnt always feel good now he thought longingly about his beautifully equipped city hospital and his wonderfully trained nursing staff whod cope with the messy bits that he was forced to cope with himself now back in sydney if a patient retched hed step back and hand over to the nurses im good at woodwork he told ginny without much hope and she smiled not in a million years mate she told him im on door duty youre on patient duty finally the last screw holding the door to the hinge was released the door fell forward and ginny grunted in satisfaction as she took its weight great i was afraid itd be solid this is light enough to give us a bit more leverage so now what lets get it under him she told him is his airway clear as good as i can get oscar was drifting into alcoholic sleep which at least meant that they could work without abuse well leave the oxygen on till the last moment ginny told him hell have to be unhooked for a bit while we load him into the truck but well work fast are you medical he asked bemused but she wasnt listening she was sliding the door toward him signalling him to shove the other end as close as he could to oscar then she hauled the mattress on top put this pillow between his hips in case he really has got a broken bone she ordered and he stopped wondering whether she had a medical background he was sure now fergus was on one side of oscar ginny was on the other with the doorcumstretcher between ginny and oscar roll him sideways as far as you can toward you she said one hand on his shoulder the other just above his hip dont try and liftyoure just rolling and ill shove where did you learn to do this i had a different childhood she said i played doctors a lot and moving patients was my specialty shut up and roll so he rolled and she shoved and a moment later their patient was threequarters on the door great she muttered completely intent on the job at hand now we slide you do the shoulders ill do the pelvis lets keep those hips in a straight line yes maam he uttered under his breath but he didnt say it where did her knowledge come from even with knowledge oscar was huge how could she do it she did it fergus was getting more and more gobsmacked by the minute her strength was amazing they now had their patient fully on the door now we tie him on she said producing something that looked like frayed hay bands im not going to all this trouble to let him roll off so they tied sliding the ropes under the door and fastening them across his legs hips and stomach oscar grunted a few times but he seemed to be intent now on his breathingwhich was just as well they completed six ties before ginny declared them ready youre not proposing to lift this fergus muttered knowing that lifting only one end was beyond him trust a man to think of brawn when theres brains at hand she told him she disappeared briefly outside and came back carrying something that looked dangerously like an axe hey im not sure about operating here and axes arent my tool of choice fergus told her startled and she grinned this is a splitter for chopping wood or its a really neat wedge she laid it sideways so the edge of the splitter lay under a corner of the door she put her weight behind the handle and tugged it in a quartercircle the splitter dug under the door and the corner rose ill keep shoving and you stick in a pole she ordered and he was with her the fence posts long cylinders ready to roll were lined up ready to insert under the door ill operate the axe though he told her seeing her strain to get the sedge further in enough was enough he had to be stronger than she was he had to be something more than she was whoever whatever the plan worked two minutes later they had three poles under the door at first push the door started rolling with fergus and ginny carefully manoeuvring it toward the back door whats happening oscar muttered sluggish and barely conscious fergus was hauling a pole out at the back of the door to carry it forward so it became the front roller youre going for a ride he told him courtesy of the most amazing ambulance officer ive ever met and the most amazing trolley it worked luckily oscar had a ramp instead of steps leading to the veranda and the only hard part was keeping the thing from sliding too fast the dogs watched from a distance seemingly almost as bemused as fergus then there was the little matter of getting their makeshift stretcher into the truck but they did that working as a team finding wedges and chocks of different sizes in the woodshed tying the ropes under oscars arms tighter so he couldnt slip gradually levering up the end of the door to a new level chocking levering again until finally the door reached the height of the floor of the truck that was the only time when they needed real strength there was a moment when they had to take a side apiece and shove one two three the door slid in like a dream this place stinks oscar said clearly through his mist of alcohol and confusion and fergus climbed up beside him to administer oxygen again and tried not to flinch at the by now awful smell in the rear oscar was no pristine patient and the ewes legacy was disgusting but it was oscars ewe ginnys phrase came back to him shed just walked out to take in some bucolic air its good bucolic air he told oscar trying not to grin ginny was still outside the truck and she too was smiling her satisfaction it had been a neat piece of engineering and they deserved to be pleased with each other ms viental wasnt that what you were stepping out to find this afternoon theres lots of it in here would you like to ride in the back with our patient while i drive but ginny was already swinging herself into the drivers seat reaching over to the back and holding out her hand for the keys youre the doctor she said sweetly im just part of the bucolic scenery they made a stop on the way that fergus hadnt planned on i cant go straight to the hospital ginny told him as they left oscars farm behind them richard will be worried richard i told him id be gone for an hour and its been two already she was driving more competently than hed been steering the truck with a skill that told him shed spent years coping with eroded country tracks where had she learned ambulance skills her farming skills what else did she have going for her gorgeous figure lovely complexion good sense of humour he had to concentrate on his patient luckily that wasnt too difficult oscar was rolling from side to side fighting against the straps and fergus was starting to get really concerned if he had a broken hip hed be in agony the way he was moving ok he didnt have a broken hip but fergus was starting to worry that the mans blood alcohol level was dangerously high he reeked of beer and whisky and his breathing was getting weaker we need to get to the hospital fast he told ginny ring richard from the hospital no can do she told him and turned off the main track onto an even smaller one where was she going i need icu facilities he told her we cant delay i know its not optimal care she was intent on the track but oscars played ducks and drakes with his health for years if i hadnt been there today you wouldnt have him this close to the hospital now ive sped you up a heap itll take me two minutes to check on richard and i am going to check phone him go to hell he sat back on his heels and stared through to the cab he could see her face in the rearview mirror all humour had disappeared and her face was tight with strain is richard your child he asked confused and she shook her head just concentrate on oscar she said tightly leave richard to me but somewhere in the haze of alcohol and lack of oxygen oscar was still hearing hed figured what was happening and he was starting to be scared you get me to hospital he breathed shoving the oxygen mask away so he could make himself heard im checking richard first ginny flung over her shoulder hes just as important as you are he should be dead he damn near all but is there was no response ginnys hands gripped the steeringwheel so hard her knuckles showed white she kept on driving but fergus could see what looked like tears ginny shut up she snarled just shut up and look after oscar because im sure as hell not going to she checked on richard whoever richard was fergus wasnt allowed to know they pulled to a halt outside a farmhouse that was even more ramshackle than oscars ginny ran inside yelling at him not to follow and as promised two minutes later she was back in the cab and the truck was heading back out to the main road not dead then oscar wheezed and the look fergus caught in the rearview mirror was one of pure murder but now wasnt the time to ask questions not with oscar ready to put in his oar and with ginnys anger threatening to explode all he could do was keep a lid on it keep oscar alive and leave questions for later would he ask the questions he wasnt here to get involved he reminded himself what was he here for to turn off to find a place where he could immerse himself so totally in his medicine that everything else would be blocked out but the pain on ginnys face it found a reflection in what hed been through there was something who was richard a husband an invalid husband he wasnt here to get involved i hurt the man on the stretcher moaned and fergus sighed where do you hurt i told youi smashed my hip yeah right i cant give you morphine until the alcohol wears off and i need to do xrays old doc woulda given me a shot by now yeah he would have shut you up whatever the cost ginny flung at him over her shoulder i can see where hes coming from dr reynard keep me away from that morphine cradle lake hospital was not exactly the nub of stateoftheart technology that fergus was used to it had been built fifty or sixty years ago a pretty little cottage hospital that looked more like a country homestead than a medical facility most of the rooms were single looking out onto the wide verandas that had views down to the lake on one side or up to the vast mountain ranges of the new south wales snowfields on the other it was a great spot for a hospital unfortunately it had been five years since cradle lake had been able to attract a doctor and in those years the place had become little more than a nursing home old people came here to die patients needing doctors on call were transferred to somewhere with more facilities nevertheless fergus had been stunned by the level of care displayed by what seemed an extraordinarily talented pool of local nurses being the only hospital for a hundred miles the local nurses were called on for everything from snakebite to road trauma they dealt with medicine at the coalface and from what hed learned in his two days here by the time emergency cases were passed over to specialist care the emergency would often be over miriam the nurse whose job it was to do home visits and whod welcomed him with open arms was waiting as they drove into the entrance to emergency a middleaged farmers widow she was as competent as she was matter of fact now she came out from the hospital entrance looking worried and as he emerged from the back of the truck she looked even more worried where have you been i should have come with you oscar should be in a nursing home hes not fit to be alone but i was sure he was putting it on i would have left him until morning but you insisted he had insisted fergus had been in the call room when oscar had phoned miriam had been inclined to be indignant and let him wait but fergus had decided to go anyway he didnt really break a hip did he she demanded and as fergus pulled the door of the van wider and she saw their improvised stretcher she gasped youve brought him in how on a door fergus said grinning and youre right hes not fit to be alone we need to look at a longterm nursinghome optionespecially if by going home he gets to be in charge of animals again meanwhile miriam we need a proper trolley to get him out of the truck we need one strong enough to slide oscar and a door onto well not move him again without a hydraulic lift who miriam asked and as if in response to the unfinished question ginny jumped out of the cab miriams jaw dropped ginny she gasped ginny viental hi ginny said smiling its mrs paterson isnt it i remember you can you look after dr reynard now im going home wait and ill drive you fergus said still trying to sound as if he was in control but ginny shook her head and he knew that control was an illusion i still havent finished my walk and richards ok for a bit longer ill enjoy the hike and then she hesitated until now the valley had been blanketed with the hush of a lazy country saturday afternoon everyone was at the football watching the football on the telly or starting the hike to bring the cows in for evening milking but the hush was broken now by a siren it started low a soft rise and fall from the far side of the lake but it was unmistakable the boys are bringing someone in miriam stared out over the valley as if she was trying to see what was happening there was no callout through here and they havent radioed in that means theyre both busy it must be an emergency from the football they regrouped all of them a medical team facing a medical crisis fergus glanced at ginny and saw her reacting the same way he was lets get oscar stabilised fergus snapped miriam fetch a trolley ginny go to oscars feet move ginny moved miriam moved too and no city hospital could have done it faster they shoved the door onto a stainlesssteel trolley and almost in the same motion they were wheeling it inside they set oscar beside a bed in a single ward but there was no time to move him into the bed not until they knew what the incoming emergency was get me into bed oscar muttered but fergus was intent on setting up an iv line all in good time he muttered youre safe where you are i need a mil syringe he glanced up expecting miriam but it was ginny not miriam who was handing him what he needed while he worked she was setting up a cardiac monitor and checking the oxygen flow shed followed him in behind the trolley and shed started working without questioning him miriams calling in reinforcements ginny told him as shes the only nurse on duty she might need help the ambulance boys arent answering the radio which makes her think things might be dire get me into bed oscar muttered again as soon as we can fergus told him you just lie there and sober up ill stay with him until were sure the oxygen rates optimal ginny offered and fergus hesitated the siren was so close now that the ambulance would be there in seconds but was she qualified as what and there was no love lost between ginny and oscar you wont murder him he asked and he was only half joking weve both taken the hippocratic oath ginny murmured mores the pity his eyebrows took a hike youre a doctor only for now she said and her tone was a warning only when i have to be so dont get any ideas about weekends off now go leave oscar to me and ill do my best to keep him breathing a doctor fergus made his way swiftly back to emergency his mind racing suddenly he felt a whole lot better about what he was facing he hadnt thought this through when molly had died hed simply taken the cowards way out he hadnt been able to stay at his big teaching hospital any more everywhere hed looked there had been memories and peoples eyes every time theyd come toward him theyd clapped him on the shoulder or taken his hand and pressed it in gentle empathy that last day had been unbearable hed been performing a simple catheter insertion and the nurse assisting had suddenly choked on a sob and left leaving the patient sure that there was a disaster his medical team wasnt telling him aboutand leaving fergus sure that he had to leave some of his workmates had been better he acknowledged theyd been matteroffact trying not to talk about itmoving on but the way theyd spoken to him had still been different he couldnt bear them not talking about it as much as he couldnt bear them talking about it and in the end he hadnt known which hed hated more have a break his father told him jack reynard was senior cardiologist at the hospital his father had been caring but from a distance all the time molly had been illand after shed died hed hardly been able to face fergus go lie on the beach for a month or two the thought of lying on any beach without molly was unbearable but so was staying where he was so hed come here it was only now hearing the siren thinking about how truly alone he was that he wondered how qualified he was to take care of a rural community but now he had backup ginny whatever her story was his strides lengthened he could cope with whatever it was he decided as long as he had another doctor behind him was she nuts telling him she was a doctor now was hardly the time for recriminations ginny decided there was work to be done and it had to be done fast the siren meant there was trouble coming and now shed admitted she had medical training she knew she could be called on to help ginny adjusted oscars drip checked his obs and made him as comfortable as she could without trying to move him it took two people to use the hydraulic lift and there werent two people available there might not be any people if this was a true emergency on its way here she thought she might be needed but she was concerned about leaving oscar the huge man was dead drunk and he could roll off the trolley if she was called away ok viental do something she muttered she propped him up on pillows so he was halfsitting there was no moan as she hauled him upshed given the broken hip cursory credence and she gave it even less credence now he was showing little sign of pain hed be safer sitting up if he were to vomit and xrays of a possible broken hip would have to wait then she stood back and looked at the bed the bed had rails ready to be raised at will oscar needed those rails to be safe right lets get you organised she muttered the trolley was resting against the bed but it couldnt reach the wall at the bedhead because of the bedside table she could do better than that in seconds she was under the bed grabbing the bedside table and hauling it under she pushed the head of the trolley hard against the wall at the end of the room then shoved the trolley sideways till it was against the wall which left a foot between bed and trolley what was happening outside dont ask she told herself get oscar safe first she flipped the bed rails up and shoved the bed sideways securing her patient with the wall on one side of him and the railed bed on the other oscar was now as safe as she could make him apart from his breathing but even there what else could she do his oxygen was up to maximum his airway was clear he needed supervision but if there was a greater need and fergus needed her as a doctor what happens if i want to get out oscar mumbled but he was so close to sleep she could hardly hear him youre welcome to try she told him but i suspect youre trapped just like i am ginny it was a call from the corridor urgent miriams face appeared round the door fergus needs you she snapped and disappeared i need to go she told oscar stay breathing thats an order i need a doctor youve had one she told him relax and let yourself go to sleep get lost he snapped and added another word for good measure she turned away but she couldnt help but grin that last expletive had been strong and sure reassuring her more than anything else that the man might very well survive she was right back into medical mode now almost as if shed never been away in truth the adrenalin surge was there as it always was in these situations shed missed it maybe she could work a little with fergus what sort of man was he dangerous she muttered as she pushed open the swing doors to emergency though she wasnt sure why she thought it but that was her overriding sensation shed looked up from the cattle grid as shed tried to hold onto the lamb and shed been caught fergus was tall bigboned and a bitweathered he had deep brown hair crinkly a little bit too long it needed a comb maybe he raked it with his fingers she thought inconsequentially that was what it looked like his lazy grey eyes held laughter and a certain innate gentleness he wasnt much older than she was he seemed nice definitely dangerous and she didnt have time in her life for dangerous she didnt have any inclination to go down that road ever chapter three that was the last chance ginny had time to think of the personal for hours the moment she opened the doors to emergency she could see why the ambulance boys hadnt had time to radio in a woman was lying on the trolley and one glance showed ginny that they were in trouble she seemed to be unconscious limp and flaccid with each breath shallow and rasping she was in her late twenties or early thirties ginny guessed simply dressed in faded jeans white tshirt and pink sandals long blonde hair lay limply around a pallid face and even from the door ginny could tell that here was a woman who was fighting for her life or maybe here was a woman whod come to the end mummy ginny glanced across to the main entrance to see a little girl being carried in four years old maybe she looked a waif of a child tearstreaked and desperate her blonde hair shoulder length was tied back with a red ribbon with blue elephants on it but the ribbon was grubby and the curls hadnt been brushed for days she was wearing shorts and a tshirt and nothing else but it was her feet that caught ginnys attention she was barefoot and her soles seemed to be a mass of lacerations there was blood on her ankles triage fergus was working over the mother and he had miriam and an ambulance officer helping him the guy holding the child seemed helpless ginny moved at once to the child mummy the little one screamed every fibre of her body straining toward her mothers trolley dr fergus is looking after your mummy ginny told her but the child was past listening the ambulance officer was looking to ginny desperate to hand over responsibility give her to me ginny sat on the examination couch and gathered the little girl into her arms miriam was hauling the crash cart toward the trolley and ginny thought uhoh should she swap places with miriam she watched for a minute as the child fought her hold miriam looked competent and swift there was already a cardiac monitor set up the womans breathing seemed to be pausing she was suddenly so limp that ginny thought oh no but fergus was shaking his head at miriam signifying the paddles werent needed there must be a heartbeat but the expression on ferguss face as he looked at the monitor ginny knew what that look meant shed worked for three years in er in a major teaching hospital and she knew it all too well triage the childs feet were bleedingbadlyand her terror was palpable unless fergus said otherwise ginny was needed where she was youve cut your feet she told the little girl making her voice sound astonished she was trying to haul the childs attention from her mother to her feet goodness what have you been doing i want mummy the little girl sobbed and ginnys heart twisted but this was hopeless fergus needed all his concentration if he was to get a good result and there was no way the little girl could go to her mother so make a break and make it fast dr fergus is looking after your mummy and im looking after you she told the little one forcing her voice to sound authoritative hugging her close but standing and moving toward the door we need to get bandages for your feet before you can come back and see mummy mummy the childs voice was a terrified scream fergus looked up and met her eyes he gave an imperceptible shake of his head get her out of here his body language said please lets go ginny said bring what i need for stitching and dressing she told the nearest of the ambulance boys now it took almost an hour to get the little girls feet dressed she sobbed and sobbed and in the end ginny administered a sedative and then simply sat and hugged her close until the childs sobs subsided finally she collapsed into exhausted sleep and ginny was able to lay her down on the bed in an empty ward and take care of the worst of the damage some time while shed hugged the ambulance officer whod brought her the dressings shed needed had disappeared soon after he had been replaced by a young male nurse whod introduced himself as tony tony wasnt what ginny was accustomed to in a nurse under his obviously hastily donned theatre gown he was dressed in football gearfilthy shorts a black and orange jersey muddy socks and muddy knees the sixfootthree footballer looked a mile away from a competent nurse but his concern was genuine and when she started work she couldnt have asked for anyone better he helped clean the gravel from the worst of the cuts it was painstaking work many of the stones were deeply embedded and when the feet were fully cleaned there were two cuts that needed stitches do we have any idea what happened ginny asked as she stitched until the child had drifted into exhausted sleep shed spoken only to her but now there was space and time to talk to tony my beeper went off just at the final siren tony told her the groundskeeper gave me a ride in and he told me what he knows the mother seems to have collapsed at the wheel of her car half a mile or so from the football ground any houses close by would be empty everyones at the footy maybe the mother told the kid to get help or maybe the kid figured that the source of noise was the only place to come but theyve just resurfaced the road gravel over bitumen by the look of her feet id reckon she must have run the whole way in bare feet thats what it looks like ginny agreed wincing in sympathy as she applied another piece of dressing over the stitched lacerations of all the brave she swallowed and looked down to the tearstained little face do we know whats wrong with the mother cardiomyopathy ferguss frame was suddenly filling the open door his face as bleak as death and weve lost her lost ginny stared at him in consternation shed known shed seen it in the womans face but she went into cardiac arrest just as you left he said and then interpreting her distress he put a hand out as if to ward off recriminations there was nothing you could have done to help believe me id have called you back if there was weve been trying to figure out what went wrong and now we know cardiomyopathy ginny whispered dazed how on earth the local police sergeants been through the car there was a full medical history on the back seat she must have travelled with it accessiblejust in case plus she travelled with an oxygen supply plus enough medication to stock a small dispensary she was desperately sick then why on earth was she travelling looking for one richard viental he hesitated his eyes meeting hers and holding would that beyour richard my richard ginny shook her head i dont understand you think i do fergus sounded weary as if hed taken in too much information for one man to absorb as maybe he had hed lost a patient under his hands less than an hour agoa young mother who by rights should have lived for another fifty years no matter how long you were a doctordid anyone ever get used to it this letter was inserted as the first page of the medical history fergus said after a break while they all seemed to have trouble keeping breathing tony was winding leftover bandage but after he finished he automatically started rewinding without the spool fergus was holding a sheet of notepapera letter handwritten in a spidery hand that scrawled off the page the police sergeants read this he said sounding apologetic and unsure ive read it too he sighed and looked down at the bed where the little girl lay huddled in exhausted sleep its addressed to richard but maybe you should read it as well he suggested i should i phone richard ginny whispered and he shook his head just read it dazed beyond belief ginny lifted the paper it was addressed to richard she shouldnt read it but she read dear richard i hope you dont have to read this i hope i can tell you myself please god i havent left it too late ive just kept on hoping hoping by now you might hardly remember me we were in hospital together five years ago you were in for checkups after your lung transplant just overnight for tests and i remember being jealous i was being assessed for a future heart transplant and i thought wouldnt it be great to have it over like you had but then the doctors told me id get another couple of years from my old heart thats a laugh isnt it a couple of years five years and one baby later its still thumping just which is just as well as theres no new heart for me anyway five years ago we were released from hospital together we went for a drink and i remember you looked great i was feeling almost normal high on the knowledge that i didnt have to face a transplant quite yet women were looking at me with youand me thinking they looked jealous maybe i got a little bit drunk maybe we both did the next day i was a bit worried about pregnancy but i remember you laughing bitter but laughing all the same saying no worries sterility you said no kids ever you said i looked it up on the internet later thinking youd been lying but you had grounds for thinking you were right ninetyeight per cent sterility the article i read said for you madison must be the result of the two per cent that got through should i have told you well maybe i should but by the time i realised i was pregnant id done more research on what i was facing and i guess i wasrunning everyone was saying i should have an abortionput my health first they said i thought if you wanted me to have one as well i couldnt bear it and i hardly knew you you had so many planswhat to do with your new lungs to tie you down with a sick woman no you know maybe i thought that having madison would kill me and maybe i even welcomed that was that sick dumb maybe anyway it didnt work i made it through the pregnancy afterwards when i realised what a wonderful thing wed donehow special it is and how wonderful madison isi tried to ring you butyour sister is itwas at the address you gave me she said you were back in hospital and there were problems with your transplant i hung up without telling her why i was calling the last thing you needed was a daughter my mother said wed be fine my mother would always be there for madison only of course theres never a happy ending mum died last month of cancer and what with the strain and everything i had a cardiac arrest they only just got me back and im on oxygen now and i know im failing i shouldnt drive but i rang your apartment againshades of desperation huhand the caretaker told me youd moved to the country to your parents farm he gave me the address and i thought please let you be well and even if youre not youre at home with your parents on a farm a farm madison loves animals richard she needs someone so much i know i should see the social workers again and organise something for her and not hope for everything from you but the last time i was ill she was in fostercare it didnt work she was so unhappy i cant bear it richard youre her father please take care of your little girl if you get this letter it means i cant bear to think what it means please love her to bits for me and thank you for giving me the gift of a daughter yours with loveand with gratitude judith crammond ginny stared at the letter she stared at it some more and the words blurred before her eyes this cant be right she whispered at last and fergus hauled up a chair and sat beside her he flicked a look up at tony and tony gave an imperceptible nod and disappeared she was suddenly the patient ginny thought she was about to be counselled no she said blindly and fergus took the letter from her lifeless fingers folded it carefully and put it on the bedside table it seems crazy he said softly but it seems that its right judith was driving with a car full of medical paraphernalia how she thought she was going to get here our local police sergeant ben cross has been in to see me when ben found the medical notes in the car he rang the hospital on the letterhead to confirm we had the right woman he brought the information straight in thinking it might help it didnt she whispered there was no way we could get her back fergus continued talking almost to himself i couldnt believe what i was hearing when i put the stethoscope on her chest i was waiting for her to arresti couldnt believe she hadnt done so already maybe it was just sheer willpower to make sure her daughter was safe once she knew she was here she simply slipped away her daughter was hardly safe ginny whispered and unconsciously her hand reached out to touch the little ones hair this washer brothers child her niece the medical notes are from sydney central fergus was saying the hospital staff told sergeant cross there was no way judith should be driving they said she was far too sick theyve attempted to organise fostercare for the little girl but its been refused there are any number of their staff deeply concerned for the two of them not enough to follow up theres only so much help you can force anyone to take fergus said softly this was judiths little girl she had to sort it out her own way shes sorted it out now i dont know fergus said has she no this richard the man the notes addressed to he hesitated but then asked what he needed to know hes your brother yes then would you like to tell me his side of the story or what you know of it ginny took a deep breath and swallowed tell me ginny fergus said and he took her hand it was one warm link in a world that had suddenly turned bewilderingly cold she had to tell him she had to say it richard has cystic fibrosis she whispered at last the lung transplant judith talked aboutyeah it worked but just for a while not for long enough thats why were here thats why were both here this is where we were kids together richards come home to die there were medical imperatives to be got through medicine had always been a retreat ginny thought as she moved on her studies and the resulting medical imperatives had been the means to block off the reality of the outside world for a long time and they helped her now oscar had to be got to bed though the way you have him wedged hes safer on his door tony said admiringly and ginny even managed a smile oscar was deeply asleep snoring so loudly the glass tony had set on the bedside table was vibrating the ventolin was taking effect his breathing was easier and there was no trace of pain on his face as he slept i guess this gets to be our happy ending for the afternoon ginny told tony trying to make her voice sound normal we need one tony looked at her fingers as she tried to adjust the drip rate and suddenly the big nurse was moving to take the equipment away from her her fingers were shaking and she couldnt do a damned thing about it so much for burying herself in medical imperatives i can manage here he told her youve done enough dr viental go find dr reynard then he smiled a great footballers smile that totally enveloped his face pushing her to cheer up hey weve gone from a tiny nursing home with no doctors to two doctors on staff how great is that im not on staff you look like youre on staff from here he told her but then his smile died ginny i know about your family im so leave it she said roughly go and find fergus he said gently go and do what needs to be done fergus was making phone calls ginny found him in the office marked medical director though the letters were faded and the d looked more like a c he was talking to someone about what had just happened ginny entered the room leaned against the wall and waited for him to finish she felt drained of all energy where to go to from here im not sure whether we need a social worker or not fergus was saying into the phone for tonight well keep her in hospital but theres family here family that would beher richard was supposed to be the end she thought the end of family for ever how could she keep giving she couldnt fergus replaced the receiver and looked at her for a moment nothing was said he simplylooked clear grey eyes calmly assessing maybe seeing more than she wanted him to see we need to talk to richard he said how sick is he hes really sick we cant tell him this why not hes dying she said desperately how do you think itll make him feel if you were dying would you want to know you had a daughter no itd complicate my life but its part of life and an important part fergus said gently richards not dead yet is he mentally impaired no then he has the right to be treated as alive while he is alive he has to know oh god how can i tell him let me do it for you she stiffened trying to protect herself with anger i dont need you to tell me how to treat my own brother im not telling you how to treat him im offering to help anger wasnt going to work so what was new she paused and tried to think what to say nothing came helplessly she crossed to the window staring down through the bushland to the lake beyond most of the buildings in this valley were built to face the lake the lake itself was teardropshaped a couple of miles across blue and glistening in the ring of dense bushland around it cradle lake when she had been small she and her family had spent every summers day they could manage on this lake theyd swum theyd built moats on the shore theyd had fun she had a glistening memory as a sixyearold of swimming triumphantly from the shore to the buoy marking the start of deep water it had been her first real swim she remembered turning to see her father with nineyearold richard cheering her on her mother with toddler chris in the shallows was clapping and laughing as well then yelling at them to come and get their picnic tea it was her last good memory richard had taken longer than most cystic fibrosis sufferers to get dangerously ill hed had bowel problems as a baby and infection after infection during childhood but the diagnosis hadnt been picked up chris had become bad first diagnosed soon after that day at the lake their local doctor finally coming up with the answer one sibling sick had meant there was a likelihood more could be so richards diagnosis had been made as well and ginnys parents had been advised to have no more children but of course toby had already been on the way there had been no going back richard was the last of her family the end finished but this means ill have family again she whispered to the lake you dont want family ive had family parents three brothers and chris died when he was eight toby died when he was ten my father disappeared after chriss death when it seemed toby would soon follow he simply walked out and never came back then after tobys death my mother drank herself into oblivion his face didnt change leaving you to what was left of my family she whispered but thats finished and now youll make me take on madison no ones making you take on anyone are you kidding she whirled on him furious youve seen her shes richards daughter she even looks like us when i saw her she looks familiar and its how they all looked my little brothers chris and then toby do you know what sort of a childhood i had i was six when it all started to fall apart and ive nursed them all since and now youll tell richard he has a daughter and hell accept herof course hell accept herand of course he wont ask me to take her on he knows how much itll hurt but he doesnt have to ask hell just look at her and itll be done maybe its already done he said gently maybe it was done from the time she was conceived you just didnt know about it until now have you any idea how much it hurts her voice cracked on a sob she swallowed it and made herself continue you sit there and you have no ideano idea at all what youre asking me to do ginny shes not your daughter he hadnt moved it was like he was locked into position you can arrange fostercare or adoption for her after richard dies or there might be other family on judiths side who you can give her to oh sure you can ginny he said softly its possible to walk away how the hell would you know ive watched it done its possible to stay detached yeah and go crazy you need to keep things in perspective theres no perspective she flung at him i dont want this so walk away now he was watching her dispassionately his voice curiously calm this is richards daughter not yours he may be dying but he has the right to sort things out he has no right to include you in those plans as if he couldnt as soon as he knows of her existence then shes part of my family part of my responsibility he mustnt he mustnt youre suggesting we dont tell him he rose circling the desk to join her at the window i dont know what to suggest she said and her voice was dull bleak and accepting already that what she wanted had little to do with the way things would pan out i cant do this ive had enough youre tired of caring i want out i dont want to love anything anyone ever again her voice trailed off and she lifted her hands to her face hidinghiding from what there was no place to hide she knew it and so did fergus he took her hands in his drawing them down gripping them with a warmth and strength that said he knew what she was going through that he understood which was an illusion no one knew what she was going through she didnt understand it herself you just do what comes next he said softly drawing her in and hugging her she felt herself be drawn she had no strength to fight him shed been fighting to be solitary for so longto stay aloof richards death was to be the final step in her path to independence she didnt need this man to hug her she didnt need anyone but she didnt fight him for this moment she needed him too much human contact that was all it was she thought fiercely warmth and strength and reassurance it was an illusion she knew but for now for now she let herself be held she let her body melt against his letting him take a weight that had suddenly seemed unbearable he was strong and firm and warm his lips were touching her hair she should pull away but she couldnt for now she needed this too much no one had held her like this not ever she thought or maybemaybe when she had been tiny when shed still been a child when she hadnt had the weight of the family firmly on her shoulders had her parents ever held her like this they must have but that had been so long ago that shed forgotten i dont dorelationships she muttered and his hands shifted so he was holding her by the waist good neither do i youre holding me its a medical massage he said and she heard a lazy smile in his voice when all else failshug she liked it she decided in times of crisishug who was she kidding you needed someone to be permanent to hug and people werent permanent you needed to let yourself close to find that degree of security but with that closeness cameperil if she lost anyone else dont do it she whispered im not getting close to you fergus reynard i think you already are he said chuckling and holding her closer but i know what you mean you neednt worry this is for now because i suspect its what we both need but its only for now im here for twelve weeks and then im out of here why did you come maybe i knew how much i was needed he told her but she could tell by the tone in his voice that it was much more than that youre running she said and he shook his head and put her away from him she looked into his face and what she saw there this was no young medic taking a locum job to save for the next overseas jaunt she thought there was a recognition here theirs was a shared journey she realised bleakly she didnt know the details but she knew she was right and she also knew what he said was the truth he could hold her as much as she needed but there was no fear of further commitment shed built her fences and so had he two levels of razor wire around their hearts maybe his was impervious shed thought hers was too but out there out there in the ward was a little girl called madison and the only way for her to survive was for ginnys barriers to come down no there must be some other way madison will sleep for hours fergus said softly into her hair miriam and tony will care for her oscars stable and there are no other patients in this place except nursinghome residents can i take you home to meet richard i need to tell him we need to tell him nothing fergus said judith has written to him we give him the letter and we help him sort out what he wants done dear god theres no way through this but through this fergus told her lets do it chapter four richard had been sleeping when ginny had left him the back veranda of the old farmhouse looked down over the lake facing west so afternoon sun drenched the ancient sofas and rickety chairs left over from when theyd lived here this had been their favourite place as children and it was their favourite place now richard had fought every inch of the way with this disease but in the last couple of weeks his fighting had ceased he wanted to see no one but ginny im closing my world down hed told ginny when shed had to turn away requests from old friends to see him im severing ties hed slept more and more and out on the veranda ginny had found some measure of peace what she had to do now what she had to tell him severing ties ha but fergus was right behind her and his presence helped a little it made the impossible seem possiblejust she climbed the veranda steps and turned to where theyd organised richards daybed the bed was empty why richard had trouble moving shed left him set up with everything he needed but if hed had to go to the bathroom had he fallen abandoning fergus she hauled the screen door open and headed inside richard she called richard nothing he wasnt in his bedroom but he hardly used his bedroom preferring to sleep where he could watch the stars he wasnt in the bathroom or in the kitchen she came back out to the veranda at a run concern deepening to fear the bedclothes were flung back as if hed just left hed had his oxygen cylinder on a trolley so he could tug it with him if he needed to it was gone whats wrong fergus asked but she ignored him richard and then she saw her car it was at the far side of the house to where fergus had driven in it was a small red sedan a bit battered and not particularly noticeable but it was noticeable now there was a garden hose snaking into the drivers side window and rags wedging the rest of the gap closed richards oxygen cylinder was lying on its side abandoned beside the drivers side door richard she screamed but fergus was before her hed seen he was down the veranda steps crossing to the car in huge strides hauling the car door open richard was slumped at the wheel as fergus pulled open the door he toppled sideways he would have fallen right out but fergus held him he crouched and caught him breaking his fall hauling him free from the car in the one swift movement ginnys hands were on his neck feeling for a pulse feeling there was one she had a pulse thready but a pulse nevertheless hes breathing fergus said and her world somehow started up again from a dead stop richard she whispered richard he opened his eyes and stared at her he even managed a sickly smile richard she said again brokenly fighting nausea you could her brother said softly his voice the thread of a weary whisper have filled the bloody thing up with petrol fergus carried him back to bed once richard had been too heavy to carry the cystic fibrosis which had killed her younger brothers early had been gentler with him slower in its deadly progress hed had a time when hed almost seemed normalwhen his body had almost seemed as if it could be healthy that time was long past her goodlooking vibrant brother was now an emaciated thread of a man close to death that afternoon hed come within a hairs breadth ginny trailed behind fergus carrying richards oxygen still trying to fight down the waves of sickness she shouldnt have left him shed wanted a walk then when shed stopped in on the way to the hospital hed seemed fine go hed said go be a ministering angel to someone else for a change and let me enjoy the sunset she faltered as she reached the stop step of the veranda and fergus set richard on his bed and glanced back at her hes fine he told her as she set the oxygen tank down richards fine she wasnt she needed the bathroom fast when she came out richard was settled back on his pillows attached again to oxygen he looked even paler than usual but his chest was rising and falling with reassuring rhythm the sight of him made the nausea return ginny plonked herself down on the back step and stuck her head between her knees see what youve done to your sister fergus said mildly and richard grimaced she did it to me he whispered hell ginny i just assumed that i had a full tank she managed i didnt even look a few minutes then splutter splutteri couldnt believe it all that trouble so is life that bad for you that you want to finish whats left of it now ferguss voice was nothing but conversational ginny was staring down over the lake trying to control the shudders that threatened to be her undoing she felt sick to the soul too much had happened too fast and her mind was having trouble catching up with her stomach but richard was alive that was all that mattered for now she told herself everything else could take care of itself at some future time who the hell are you richard was asking and she tried to focus enough to listen im a doctor mate fergus said fergus reynard i brought your sister home im supposed to say thank you we didnt save your life if thats what youre suggesting fergus said mildly seems ginny did that by being lousy with her petrol buying i was going to fill it up yesterday ginny whispered but it was raining i thought there was enough to get into town again tomorrow and the weatherd be better but neither man seemed to be listening to her maybe she wasnt listening to herself so why did you decide topping yourself was a good idea fergus asked is that any of your business i imagine its your sisters and i think ginnys past asking leave us be richard said wearily sinking into his pillows it doesnt matter im guessing it does to ginny as well as to you im dying anyway are you scared then fergus asked of whats to come no then why ginnys stuck here he managed and took a few gasping breaths of oxygen while ginny took that on board you think i mind that she demanded you think i resent spending a few weeks of my life with you richard she broke off unable to go on youve done this so often richard muttered he swivelled a little so he was staring at fergus and his eyes were almost fierce i had two kid brothers with this damned disease my father sloped off and our mother coped via the bottle she died of cirrhosis of the liver when ginny was sixteen ginnys done the lot youve been there too ginny whispered and her voice broke you know thats a lie and i wont be with you for this one richard whispered and closed his eyes youll be alone when i thought there was time this afternoon youd just get it over with fergus ended for him what else is there to live for there was a deathly silence it went on and on maybe fergus was waiting for her to say something ginny thought but she couldnt she couldnt as it happens fergus said finally still with the friendly interested tone about him there is something you might like to live a bit longer for if youre not afraid im not afraid thats sensible im not sure who looked after your brothers while they died or what sort of deaths they had but im here to tell you that if you permit me i can take care of you for as long as you want i can keep you absolutely comfortable i can keep it so youre in control every step of the way no decision will be made without your sayso short of helping you into gasfilled cars youll find that medical help can make the next few weeks as fulfilling as you want them to be as fulfilling richard said drifting into white wings and halos theres some who reckon its hosts of virgins fergus said mildly and grinned me i dont know but even with virgins waiting upstairs peacefully slipping away seems like youre dead already which thanks to ginnys lousiness with the petrol now isnt true youre alive until youre dead mate youre not dead yet and you have a job to do which is richard sounded stunned as well he might ginny thought she was feeling pretty stunned herself getting to know your daughter fergus said bluntly and handed him judiths letter afterwards they walked out to the car together richard had taken in the contents of the letter had asked incredulous questionsand then had suddenly slept it was as if the culminating emotions of the day had simply become overwhelming and his body had demanded time out there had been no denial however simply a barrage of questions then silence then sleep silence seemed good ginny walked fergus back to his car and silence seemed the only option if i leave you promise you wont commit suicide yourself fergus asked as he reached the drivers door not enough petrol she said and gave a short laugh which almost turned into a sob almost but not quite she managed to haul herself back together but it took an effort ginny this is a theres no need to swear she broke in i know exactly what it is his hand reached out and took hers it was a strong grasp warm and reassuring it was his bedside manner she thought and she was suddenly angry she might as well be angry as anything else she thought and tried to haul her hand away he didnt release it im fine she said unnecessarily but still he didnt release it youre not fine he said softly you were sick back there reaction of course it was reaction how long have you been with richard this time this time he said and his face grew a little grim hearing the years of commitment behind those two words since he came out of hospital they wanted to move him into a hospice but it was better that he came back here better for who ive learned the hard way she said softly that its easier to do whats asked rather than live with regrets afterwards so its as hard as i think it is coming back here her eyes flew to his with shock he knew i did your brothers die here he asked and your mother im thinking youd never want to be back here silence you were here for them more silence and richard was richard there when the rest of your family died did you have any support richards been ill she said defensively and she knew by the look on his face that he understood the story behind that too or part of it richard hadnt wanted to spend his limited life caring for dying siblings or distraught parents hed turned off at an early age making every excuse to be away from home ginny didnt blame him he had been ill and young and the fact that shed been given no choice didnt mean she had to resent richard lets think of a plan here fergus said and she managed to haul her hand from his and glare theres no plan there has to be he said ill come back after evening clinic and see what richard has decided to do richard wont decide to do anything he must you cant put the responsibility for for his daughter on him all of a sudden fergus sounded grim sympathy fading yes i can but its not me doing it like it or not this little one is his daughter and no matter how sick he is he needs to face that sure hes shocked fergus this afternoon he tried to kill himself did he he looked down at her and she could no longer read his face you know even a dying man can read a fuel gauge ginny she gasped what are you saying he wouldnt have staged it what possible reason i suspect hes wanting more help than he thinks youre prepared to give she didnt understand he knows im prepared to give whatevers needed he refused to go to a hospice and he asked me to be here for him i said i would and i will which fits with my theory fergus said evenly why go to all this trouble to come back here if just to kill himself if hed really wanted to die he could have killed himself back in the city why come here i dont have a clue but its taken me so much work to get this place back into habitable state to organise equipment here thats what i mean ginny what would you have done just now if i hadnt been here exactly the same as if you had pulled him out got him back to bed been sick and not left him alone again he said gently tomorrowyoure not going to leave him for more than a few minutes are you i how can i which means hes got what he needs hes asked you to come back here and youve come this afternoon you were away for several hours and i suspect he hated it and it made him fearful now hes fixed it so that you cant leave him its called emotional blackmail ginny and you need to see it for what it is we need to organise you some help she stared at him incredulous i dont need help you do he said and smiled which made her insides twist why did his smile affect her like this she wondered wildly she shouldnt be emotional she mustnt be shed been through too much in the past to fall to bits now i can cope she muttered sure you can but you neednt he glanced at his watch and grimaced i have patients waiting i need to go but expect me back at eight tonight i dont want you back sure you do he said and grinned you and your brother both need me and like batman i always turn up when im needed when the world needs saving wearing your jocks on the outside she managed bewildered and he smiled thats better he told her much better then before she could guess what he was about to do he lifted his palm to her cheek his hand rested against her facejust for a moment it was a gesture of warmth and strength and solidarity it was a gesture that said she wasnt alone she didnt need such a gesture she didnt she backed away from him and he let her go but then as his car drove out of the driveway as he headed off back to his medicine back to his hospital back to his outside world her hand came up to retrace the path of his fingers there was still warmth there she didnt need help but she stood and held her hand against her face for a very long time richard slept he woke briefly to eat the dinner ginny prepared but he said little i dont want to talk about it he said when ginny raised the matter of the letter and when he saw she intended to push he simply turned back over on his pillows and slept some more how could you hit a dying man she couldnt but the flare of anger behind her panic refused to disappear completely it was all very well for him cocooned in his pillows knowing he was leaving accepting that any problems were hers and not his emotional blackmail maybe she washed up went outside and stared down at the lake the sun set late here it was still a tangerine ball behind lowlying clouds on the horizon it was an hour before fergus was due back if she left and richard woke up she walked across to his bed and stared down at him ferguss words came back to her even a dying man can read a fuel gauge he wasnt dying this week hed survived petrol fumes and fear without his oxygen youre alive until youre dead she said softly not knowing whether he could hear her or not but not really caring richard dont do this to me silence of course there was silence what to do there was no television in this place no radio it was all very well staring out over the lake until you die she thought bleakly but she wasnt dying she actually felt ever so slightly more alive at the moment than shed felt for a while was that something to do with a pair of caring grey eyes and the touch of fingers against her face oh yeah lets fall in love with the doctor shall we she said to herself mocking shed do no such thing she very carefully kept herself free of relationships and fergus was no exception this feeling she had was nonsense she should sit and watch the sunset she stared at the sunset for three or four minutes it was a very nice sunset enough she turned back to the bed to her sleeping brother im going over to oscars to check his lambs and make sure his dogs have been fed she told his nonresponsive form ill be back in threequarters of an hour dont die while im away she bit her lip and then added and if you do its not my fault chapter five oscar should never have been permitted to farm she should never have agreed to let him use their land to graze his cattle she knew that as she trudged back over the paddocks it was yet another burden on her heart but at least the walk over the hills got a bit of air into her lungs and gave her a chance to take a little time out from the impossibility of what lay ahead and at first it seemed things were ok ginny checked the house paddock where shed left her lamb whod been stuck in the cattle grid everything there was great the sheep there were surrounding the trough as if not brave enough to leave it in case it drained again her rescued lamb was suckling from his resigned mother his tiny tail wagging with the ferocious intensity of an avid eater one happy ending great she walked back behind the house up to the paddock where oscar kept his lambing ewes shed been there earlier that afternoon and had found six sad mounds of disintegrating wool stories of lambing gone wrong there were ewes and lambs everywhere here lambing was almost at an end she ran her eyes over the flock searching for trouble and of course she found it there was one ewe down why had she looked for trouble she demanded of herself oscar had left his flock to their fate letting nature take its course so should she she couldnt she walked over and knelt by the ewe the animal had gone past straining lying on her side and panting gazing ahead with eyes that were starting to dull with pain im not an obstetrician she told the sheep but she checked what was happening and winced ouch she couldnt leave her a bucket of hot soapy water might help very soapy water and a bit of luck she rose and fergus was standing by the paddock gate watching her medical emergency she said briefly and walked across to meet him he held the gate open for her and she passed him aware that she smelt like sheep again and he didnt aware that he was six inches taller than her aware that he had great eyes i didnt think youd leave richard he said i seem to remember you told me i might she said plus hes sleeping plus weve run out of petrol why are you here same as you id imagine i thought id check on our lamb our lamb it had a nice ring to it she thought a glimmer of humour in a day that had been singularly without any such thing hes fine so i see but theres a ewe in trouble the lambs stuck one foot out nothing else i need to find some lubricant whats your medical speciality he called after her shed hardly stopped walking he closed the gate behind her and now he caught her up as she headed into the house emergency medicine she said briefly yours im a surgeon a surgeon what was a surgeon doing in cradle lake no matter concentrate on the job at hand so if neither of us is an obstetrician you reckon between us we can deliver a lamb i reckon between us we can call a vet no time she said over her shoulder reaching the ramp up to the veranda and shoving her way past interested dogs the vet comes from marlborough and the ewe will be dead by then shes young too damned young to have been joined id have said but then im a doctor not a farmer you spent your childhood here yeah so you farmed so i did they were through oscars back door she grabbed a bucket by the laundry trough and started running hot water can you find a sheet or something that i can rip up to make a rope how about a rope too coarse i dont want to deliver a lamb only to put it down because ive damaged it you think its still alive i didnt listen for foetal heartbeat if thats what you mean she said exasperated dr reynard do you want to be some use i yes then go find a sheet and join me out there when fergus got back to the paddock ginny was lying full length in the mud why do ewes never choose a nice soft grassy patch to give birth she muttered as he approached what is it with the muddiest hardest rockiest spot in the paddock ow ow he said cautiously and knelt to watch what she was doing she was trying to manipulate the shoulders stuck she said tightly one foots come free and not the other i need to get it back in and get the two legs out together if that happens maybe i can get its head down only shes having contractions again she was maybe it was their presence but the ewe had finally decided to come to life again her belly was rippling with strong contractions and she was even struggling to rise here was something he could do he pressed the sheeps head down with one hand and laid his other hand firmly on her flank its ok girl he told the ewe softly dr vientals an emergency specialist you couldnt be in better hands ginny cast him a suspicious glance and kept on working she had small hands he thought which was just as well she was using the soap as lubricant trying to manoeuvre in the birth canal which was just a bit tricky when the contractions were designed to push her hand out again can you tell her not to push she gasped dont push he told the ewe remember your breathing techniques the ewe had obviously forgotten ginny swore again the force of the contraction would be crushing her fingers then got it she said and at the next contraction another tiny hoof appeared two hooves tie them she told him swivelling to soap her hands again just tight enough to give you some purchase its almost impossible to pull by hand were going to pull when i get the head in position breathe damn you she told the ewe if you push now youll risk breaking your babys neck her fingers were already working using the break in contractions to find purchase fergus was looping the sheet twisting it so the two little hooves were tied together with a little of the sheet folded between them so they didnt crush each other his fingers were right against ginnys there was so little room another contraction and she grunted in pain not yet she muttered i cant i cant yes yes fergus said cautious heads down next contraction i want you to pull very gently ill leave my fingers where they are pushing the head down he looked at how far inside the ewe her hand was he remembered the strength of the contraction your fingers are behind the head youll break something i wont break anything she told him im tough as old boots but i may just swear i wont listen very wise she muttered and he didnt listenor not very muchand one minute later a feeble excuse for a lamb slithered out into ferguss waiting hands it was alive some things were instinctive newborn lambs werent so different from newborn human babies and hed done his basic med training in obstetrics almost as soon as it was out he was clearing its nose checking its airways making sure it gave a pathetic mewing attempt at a bleat and ginny grinned we have liftoff houston indeed we do fergus said wiping the lamb on what was left of oscars bed sheet this felt good he thought more somehow in the drama of this day theyd been granted a little happy ending two happy endings he thought if they counted the lamb theyd pulled from the cattle grid the ewes head was turned she was straining to see and fergus lifted the tiny creature round to its mothers head well done us ginny whispered and wiped her face with the back of her hand which maybe wasnt such a good idea you look like youve just been playing with a chainsaw fergus told her and she grinned knowing he was feeling exactly the same as she was deaths while practising medicine were unavoidable there was nothing like an intervention and a saved life to balance things up it didnt make it better but it helped get things in perspective a bit whats a bit of blood between friends she demanded and he grinned back at her enjoying her pleasure you love your medicine i do indeed she rose tossing soap and scraps of linen into her bucket it takes me into another place as opposed to the place youre stuck in her smile faded leave it she said she stood looking down at ewe and lamb the lamb was nuzzling the ewes flank already searching for a teat the ewe was still down but she was starting to move there was a warm night in front of them shed be safe shed make it we have another baby to care for now fergus said gently and she flinched madison madison i dont know how to face it she said bluntly and he nodded thats what im here for so were out in the paddock delivering lambs he smiled a gentle smile that said he knew how she was feeling it was a false smile she thought how could he know but somehow it worked he was a doctor with an excellent bedside manner she decided trying to get a hold on things that were impossible to get a hold on ginny hadnt been near cradle lake since her mother had died the house had been rented out for years it had taken a huge amount of effortand moneyto get it to the stage where she could take care of richard there and now standing in the paddocks looking down over the lake with emotions surging through her that had been in overdrive since the first of her brothers had been diagnosed this man wasnt helping she thought shed fought since shed been a kid to get some form of emotional independence not to break apart when she lost things now suddenly she wanted to fall on this guys chest and weepand what use would that be to anybody you met tony our footballercumnurse fergus was asking yes hes out at your house right now fergus told her hes talking things through with richard it seems he and richard were in the same grade at school here and tony says they were friends tony reckons he can help no one can help and richard doesnt want anyone she snapped before she could stop herself but he appeared not to notice her anger cradle lakes a tiny community he said theyre geared to help they havent in the past you heard oscar yeah i talked to tony about that he said thoughtfully he had his hands in his pockets and was watching the newborn lamb suckle her mother the ewe had struggled to her feet it seemed that maybe life was going to go on after all it seems your parents pretty much drove the community away he said and she flinched like richards doing now my dad left us when chris died and your mother hit the bottle and kept the community away you cared for her alone and for toby until he died any time someone came near they were hit with abuse in the end when there was no one left but you you were left to social workers ginny didnt say anything in response to that she remembered that time though just after tobys death richard had been eighteen then and he hadnt even stuck around for the funeral he had been ill but not so ill he had been unable to manage to care for himself hed had a girlfriend and theyd simply climbed into his girlfriends combivan and headed for queensland ill look after him ginny remembered the girl telling her the weather up there will be better for his lungs and this way you dont have to look after him as well ginny had been fifteen toby had been two days dead her mother had been comatose that had been when social security had stepped in ginny had been placed with a fosterfamily in sydneygreat people whod helped her get where shed most wanted to be which was independent she had been independent until the disease had finally caught up with richard as theyd always known it would and now tonys taken bedding out to your place fergus said softly watching her face in case richard decides he wants to keep madison close i cant take care of madison she said panicked no ones asking you to ginny fergus said gently there was a bit of a community meeting this afternoon people wanted to help your family twenty years ago and they werent permitted to oscars the exception rather than the rule cradle lake was horrified at what happened to you and everyone really wants to help if youll permit if ill permit it has to be your decision he told her or some of it does whether richard wants to be a part of madisons life for whatever time he has left is up to him but the rest if he does want to spend time with his daughter then miriam will come out here later tonight shell bring madison with her and she and tony will take turns to stay as a livein nurse to the pair of them for as long as it takes i know richard doesnt want anyone but he hasnt a choice in this ginny weve organised it to care for you and if he doesnt want itwell theres still the hospice in sydney he smiled but i think youll find tonys persuaded him he can be very persuasive our tony best goalkicker in the district and theres a reason his smile was persuading her to join him but she couldnt it was as if all the air had been sucked out of her lungs leaving her with nothing well he said softly and her eyes flew to his his gaze was gentle questioning expecting an answer tonys telling richard that he has no choice he continued gently hes telling him that what hes asked you to do is too hard and the community as a whole has decided to share you nursed your little brothers until they died and you nursed your mother your mother drove the community away but they wont stand back this time and do nothing they cant do anything else thats what you think he told her you have no idea no one knew that the new people in the viental place were vientals or thered have been neighbours round here by now his smile deepened you have no concept of the network in this valley ive been here a few days and already i know that the community network is just plain scary casserole production has gone into overdrive there are even farmers offering to take over livestock duty on this placenot because they like oscar but because they know you and theyve already guessed that you wont be able to leave oscars stock to fend for themselves she swallowed i dont i cant madison there are two things that can happen with madison he told her his voice calmly reassuring theres no need to look like a startled rabbit because weve talked about that too we me and tony and miriam and a number of locals who i bet you can hardly remember but who clearly remember you the idea is to give you some space depending on what richard wants tonight there are different courses of action if he wants her now then well bring her out here miriam and tony will stay and well nurse her back to health alongside her father he hesitated it seems hard introducing a child to a father who hasnt long to live but ginny madisons almost five years old i remember a bit of what happened when i was that old and i bet you do too you dont remember much but some things stick we think that maybe its more important that madison be left with a shadowy remembrance of a father than no remembrance at all his voice faltered she stared up at him there was suddenly pain in his face pain for madison no he had his own shadows she realised there was a reason he was here why not now he said and she knew hed sensed the question that was forming somehow he seemed to read her mind before she even knew what she was thinking herself for now all you need to think is that madison is richards daughter not yours theres no reason why the burden of raising her has to rest on your shoulders theres all sorts of couples whod give their hearts to a little girl called madison and you know as well as anyone that fosteringor adoptioncan work brilliantly but suddenly once again she heard pain she could hear it behind the carefully professional words she should query it but there was too much overwhelming her life at the moment to even begin to admit more i dont know how i could have her adopted she whispered and his hands came out and caught her shoulders holding her steady in the face of her fear but to take her on a child you dont need to think of that right now he told her you just think of the next halfhour we need to get a bit of sheeps blood off ourselves so we dont scare the community of cradle lake half to death with stories of our bloody exploits then we need to go talk to richard and to tony and see what richard has decided to do richard was sitting up in bed when they arrived back at the house he was angry ginny got that the moment she and fergus walked around the side of the house tony was at his bedside seated beside him on the veranda listening richard was trying to yell he was gasping for breath but his anger was palpable ginny gasped and started forwardbut ferguss hand found her arm and he hauled her back out of sight let me shh theres no way you can make me richard was saying no ones making you do anything tony responded his voice unperturbed no one made you do anything five years ago but its done mate like the rest of us youre now facing the consequences i have no intention you deny shes your kid no but there you are then tony said evenly it can happen to us all if were dumb enough he grimaced you know i got a bit pissed after a footy dinner a few years back me and bridget didnt take precautions bang nine months later there was michael bawling his head off redfaced and scrawny my kid bridget and i had been pretty keen on each other so getting married wasnt such a big deal but wed intended travelling a bit first seeing the world before we settled down now we have michael lissy followed soon after and here i am a family man whoopee ginny could hear a smile enter his voice you

examined her all over he says she looks like she hasnt been getting enough to eat her mothers obviously been too ill to take proper care of her and she ran half a mile on gravel to save her mothers life she lost thats your kid richard a tough brave little urchin who looks like you you want to turn your back on her ginny will look after her richard said flatly and ginny made to move forward again once again fergus restrained her not your conversation he whispered shut up and listen i know where my sister would have told me to go if id tried that line on her tony was saying im dying arent we all mate i could get run over by a bus tomorrow hell thatd leave my bridget and michael and lissy in a right mess you know what i mean im dying now how can i be anyones father you already are you just didnt know this is nonnegotiable what i want to know is if youll do the right thing if we bring her out here what the hell do you want me to do you cant ask this of him ginny whispered but ferguss hold was strong and sure and convinced he had her hand in his his fingers linked through hers reassurance in a crazy world a notion that she wasnt alone that he was there for her dumb it was dumb she hauled at her hand but it wasnt relinquished you want to see her tony was asking no do you mean that tony said softly he turned fergus is that you mate their approach had obviously been heard by tony at least fergus gave ginnys hand a reassuring squeeze and tugged her round the corner out where they could be seen hi he said as if he was dropping in for a casual evening visit ginny and i have just delivered a lamb horribly complicated presentation exhausted mother only the pure skill of two dedicated doctors could have created the outcome of healthy mum healthy baby tonys big face creased into a smile sheep obstetrics multitalented huh arent we lucky to have you yes fergus said promptly and tony laughed he turned back to richard you want us to bring out your daughter i need to speak to ginny richard said almost sulkily but fergus shook his head joining the conversation as if hed heard what had gone before as indeed he had this isnt ginnys decision mate its yours of course its ginnys decision richard said angrily when i die ginny will have to ginny wont have to do anything this is your call i cant get involved in a kid if ginny wont lets leave ginny out of the equation fergus said and there was a hint of steel in his voice she has her own life to worry about shes agreed to do some parttime work with me over the next few weeks ginny flashed him a look that was pure astonishment but neither man noticed and she wont be around so much oh shell be around when you most need her shes promised you that but not every waking minute shell go under if you ask that of her and im here to treat her as well as you you made her ill with your suicide bid this afternoon and its not going to happen again this is none of your business ginny gasped but fergus took her arm again restraining her from hauling away from his side its none of tonys business either but hes here youve elected to come to a tiny community and that means people sticking in their oars all over the place richard your daughters at the hospital and she has no one if you permit well bring her here and care for her here for as long as youre well enough to cope if you play it right when you die shell retain a memory of a father who cares her mother obviously thought that was important if you dont think its important then well contact the social workers in the city and organise fostercare you need never see her your call mate decide you cant ask me richard gasped we are asking you i need to talk to you dont need to talk to anyone you make the decision now you ask to see madisonyour daughterand well bring her to you with a nurse to help care for her i dont want a nurse ginny can ginny cant his voice was tough inflexible giving no quarter there was a long silence broken only by the harsh rasping of richards breathing it wasnt fair ginny thought miserably to ask it of him its not fair mate fergus said in such an unconscious echo of her own thoughts that she gasped but shes your daughter i have no choice but to put things to you as they are richard stared up at him he glanced across at ginny but ferguss hand was on her arm protectively as if he knew that this responsibility would be handed over but there was no way hed let this happen tony said she looks like me richard whispered finally and fergus nodded shes beautiful shes battered and shes lost her mother and shes alone and yes she looks like her father do you want to meet her or dont you ginny held her breath it could go either way she thought and she waited they all waited i have a daughter richard whispered at last and something in ferguss face reacted it was like a muscle spasmpain it was there only momentarily and then gone but ginny was sure shed seen it you have a daughter he agreed then maybe i need to meet her only if you agree to a nurse coming to stay as well theres no need ginny will ginny wont the two men faced off strength facing fear and strength won ferguss determination was implacable and all of them could sense it fine richard said at last if the kid needs a nurse if your daughter needs a nurse my daughter richard said and the petulance disappeared from his voice my daughter so we can bring her to her father yes he whispered and looked up at them yes please chapter six what followed were two weeks that ginny would look back on later as surreal she didnt know what was happeningonly that she had to do what came next a search was made for judiths family there was a father in new zealand who hadnt seen her for twenty years and who wanted nothing to do with either burying his daughter or taking responsibility for his grandchild so judith was buried in the cradle lake cemetery richard came in a wheelchair and on the advice of a child psychiatrist fergus had organised to see her madison came too the little girl seemed impassive and ginny held her and watched her and thought of what people had said to her after chris had died after toby had died after her mother had died and how nothing had helped fergus stood in the background and said nothing at all there was this feeling between them ginny thought hopelessly as the ceremony moved to its conclusion it was some sort of intangible link that was somehow justthere both of them could feel it she thought but neither of them wanted it it was as if both of them were afraid she was afraid she decided and she was right to be so whatever she felt for fergus it had to be sternly set aside no involvement after the funeral ginnys back veranda was set up as a hospital ward in miniature a couple of tradesmen arrived refusing payment they set up a screen that could be pulled back at will thus there could be two rooms one side was richards the other was madisons the child was stoic that was the simplest way to describe her ginny thought as the days went on there were no tears no emotion nothing tears might have been easier to deal with what terrors lay behind the expressionless listless façade she voiced her concerns to fergus and he organised the child psychiatrist from the city to make a second trip to see her the woman sat by madisons bed for all of one long afternoon gently probing trying to make her talk at the end the woman wondered whether she should be moved taken to a specialist unit in sydney that was the first time richard was moved to anger surprising them all she stays here he snapped this is where she belongs and push back that damned screen that was a sort of breakthrough father and daughter at least seemed aware of each other from then on although mostly all they did was sleep but sometimes ginny saw richard watching his daughter with eyes that were sad and yet proud and when richard moved madisons gaze followed him every inch of the way dont pressure her the child psychiatrist advised before she left she needs time to get used to her new surroundings to her new she faltered then because no one could imagine madison would have time to get used to her new father even for the psychiatrist this was new territory its not fair on madison ginny told fergus as the second week ended fergus had come out to check on richards medication there was no longer any need for him to treat madison the little girls feet were almost healed there was no need for her to still be in bed but whenever they dressed her whenever they tried to do anything with her she passively did what they asked then returned to her bed as soon as she could maybe we should be doing something more active to cheer her up the psychiatrist said give her time fergus told her and richards her father he calls the shots fergus had finished treating richard at almost the same time as tonys wife bridget had arrived to take a shift theyd been walking back to ferguss trucka bit selfconsciously because that was the way ginny always was around fergus bridget was an occasional nurse when im sick of the kids and her presence was a welcome relief easing strain now she included herself in their conversation putting in her oar with customary cheerfulness leave them be she advised talking can sometimes make it worse with kids im the eldest of eight and that was my motto if you couldnt figure out what to do then do nothing this is a funny sort of fatherdaughter relationship but if thats all they have then i reckon we should leave them to sort it out richards not exactly being warm fergus said thoughtfully as bridget walked up the steps and left them to it ginny wished she hadnt fergus was too close for comfort whenever he was here he was too close for comfort she thought there was this frisson can you blame him she managed if he gets close to his daughter shell be hurt all over again when he dies yeah fergus said he looked as if hed say something else but then thought better of it instead he stepped away from her a little maybe he was feeling this frisson as well how are madisons feet theyre fine but check them yourself she hesitated they were out of earshot of richard madison or bridget the frisson wasnt going away and she wanted it dealt with she needed this man as a personnot some gorgeous hunk of a doctor who sent her hormones into overdrive fergus why are you leaving madisons medical care completely to me she tried tentatively why dont you go close to her she hesitated but the sudden stillness of his face told her she wasnt wrong in her guesswork theres more than richard and i who are scared stiff of being involved here no i dont know what you mean in truth she didnt know what she meant either it was just a gut reaction to what she sawthe slight hesitation every time he approached madisons bed there was something hey doc what about taking ginny out to dinner it was bridget calling from the veranda she could do with a break and you two look so good together they both took a hasty step in different directions and bridget grinned i dont need ginny started but bridget was on a mission you dont need sausages she retorted which is all you have here for dinner richard likes them madison likes them but the last time we had them you hardly touched them take her out doc would you like to go out fergus asked would she in the last two weeks she hadnt been housebound shed spent time at the hospital sharing ferguss load immersing herself in the medicine that gave her blessed time out but that didnt mean shed spent any real time with him and then there was this scary frisson the pubs good on friday night bridget was saying breaking into her train of thought take her there doc i should stay ginny said taking another step backward why bridget demanded and crossed her arms in disapproval theres no need for you to be here she told the nurse trying to sound decisive you could go home to tony i have two kids at home and an untrained puppy im staying here bridget grinned my kids need to bond with their daddy tonys done less than his fair share this week and im here to stay bridgets not going home fergus said that was the agreement when we brought madison here therell be a fulltime nurse here all the time he hesitated and she saw the same uncertainty in his eyes but it seemed he was braver than she was what about a steak at the pub but what about what about ginny looked at him and thought about the tension between them and thought this was a really bad idea but when she opened her mouth fine she said what was she saying her head was screaming that it wasnt fine it was high risk to both of them fine said fergus and she knew he felt exactly the same way lets go to dinner the eatingout options at cradle lake were limited to the pub the pub served steak and chips sausages and chips bleah fish and chips or the vegetarian option catering for city types who cruised through the place on sundayspasta and chips the steak however was fantastic deservedly famous throughout the district dorothy the pub chef had been cooking steak for fifty years she cooked their steaks now then came to the diningroom door to watch her product go down the whole pub watched fergus and ginnys steaks go down the dining room was separated from the rest of the pub by the bar but from the moment theyd walked in every eye was on them and it stayed on them for the entire meal you wouldnt want to be an undercover agent in this place fergus complained and ginny grinned in truth she was enjoying her steak very much and enjoying being away from the claustrophobic atmosphere of the house even more im used to it i was brought up hereremember which is why you didnt want to come back i never said i didnt want to come back you didnt have to you look like a deer stuck in headlights gee thanks think nothing of it he said and concentrated on his steak again so how about you she asked as they ploughed through their massive plates how come you look like a deer caught in headlights as well i dont he glanced up at her startled and then caught himself his expression regained that careful control she was starting to recognise for what it was a shield im the one whos afraid of the commitment madison might mean she said softly but when youre forced to be near her i see exactly the same fear only worse at the funeral you acted as if you were afraid of coming close so whats happened in your past to drive you here dr reynard nothing you know almost everything there is to know about me she went on suddenly angry yet you keep yourself hidden theres a child in there somewhere isnt there a tragedy its none of your business yet my life is your business thats different your brother is your patient yes but im not your patient it doesnt stop you poking your nose in not that im not grateful she said hurriedly as he looked up from his steak you know i am ive really appreciated the work youve given me over the last couple of weeksand the freedom but its feeling really lopsided im feeling like im wandering in a void and part of that is your fault his mouth twisted into a wry smile gee thanks you know what i mean she said softly and met his gaze directly over the table shed been trying not to think this for two weeks but it had been there like it or not and suddenly it had to be brought out into the open you feel it too dont you this thing you mean i want to jump you he said and the ears on the other side of the bar almost stretched to where they were sitting is that the thing you mean i might not have put it quite like that she hesitated and then she smiled tension easing do you want to jump me yes he said promptly you want to jump me too fergus they taught me at medical school to say it like it is he said suddenly cheerful attacking his steak again with zeal never prevaricate if you need to tell bad news then spit it out cos otherwise the patient will guess anyway and wont thank you for quibbling so is this bad news she said after a moments stunned pause that you want to jump me depends on lots of things he told her like like im not in the market for a permanent relationship you think i am i know youre not he said his voice softening so that for the first time she was sure the audience on the other side of the bar couldnt hear relationships have been beaten out of you the hard way so how about you she placed her knife and fork together over at least half her steak and at the door dorothy sighed her disappointment fergus devoured the last mouthful of his steak hesitated and looked thoughtfully at ginnys unfinished plate go right ahead she told him and dorothy brightened again fergus switched plates in one smooth slide and kept right on eating that doesnt let you off answering the question she said if i were to agree to beingjumped gee thats romantic im not sure how else we can put it she said a relationship with no involvement lets not call it anything fine but i need to know the background she retorted youve been married yes but who to katrina where is she now shes a professor of pathology at a very large hospital in katrina newry she interrupted awed ive heard of her the worlds heard of katrina so what went wrong its only my business if you want to jump me she agreed equitably which youve just agreed you want to do but i dont go to bed with strangers there was a hushed ripple from the other side of the bar and ginny thought gee the acoustics in here are good or terrible depending on what angle you wanted to look at them from can this wait until i finish my steak fergus asked and she knew hed realised the same thing fine only its my steak ill have coffee while i wait you dont want pudding after a steak that hangs over every side of the plate you have to be kidding i never kid i dont want pudding she retorted i want history you just shut up and eat she told him kindly and then shut up and talk pardon you know what i mean so he finished his steak they both had coffee and then they walked outside fergus had driven them there in his truckcumambulanceit was parked in the car parkbut the night was lovely and of course the pub had been built to face the lake there was a track leading down to a spit of land where you could watch the moonlight glimmering on the lake below lovers walk the locals called it and ginny knew every person in the pub would be watching as they turned away from the car park and headed down the track it seemed fergus knew it too you realise your reputation is shot fergus said morosely even if we turn and head up to the car park now theyll assume we were just very very fast im not fussed about my reputation in this town she retorted its the least of my worries because after richard dies youll never come here again thats right life was pretty bleak here what do you think he nodded then caught her hand as they made their way along the track it was a simple gestureboygirl contactbut it felt good dangerously good ginny thought because she didnt want a relationship and this was teetering remarkably close to feeling close dumb she didnt do close neither did he apparently she needed to find out his reasons maybe they could reinforce hers you turn away from madison like youre in pain she said softly into the stillness of the night and she felt the sudden tension in the link between their fingers why i dont im right there was a child wasnt there i tell me about her theyd reached the spit now there was a seata vast gum tree that had fallen sixty years before the locals had sheared off the rough bark so it lay now as a huge bench seat almost twenty feet long they were the only lov the only people here tonight below lay the lake and around them lay the entire valley swathed in moonlight up above there were still people in the pub but the acoustics of the valley meant that sound rose didnt fall they were swathed in silence and in moonlight there was nothing to stop secrets being told here except reluctance fergus pulled his hand away but it was ginny who held on as they sat sensing that if she was gaining strength from this contact then so would he a daughter she asked softly guessing and he nodded molly is she with her mother shes dead it was said with flat vehemence almost shocking in the beauty of the night oh fergus youre sorry everyones sorry he pulled his hand from hers and raked long fingers through his hair in a gesture of weariness that was uncalled for he told her i apologise of course youre sorry and its not that i mind but i do know she whispered when toby died and then chris and then my mum i thought if anyone else said sorry when did she die three months ago so recently she flinched why how molly had downs syndrome she had a congenital heart defect we knew from birth that she had a limited time she didnt say anything she couldnt you didnt need to be loaded with that he said at last and she flinched i walk around in my own little ball of misery and dont see others i should see im sorry i didnt sense this before you cope with what you need to cope with he said gently its called triage you only have so much capacity and that has to be channelled where its most needed theres no point being sad for me he smiled then and rose looking down at her with almost a challenge and its not all sad he said molly had a great life even if it was short andyour wife his face stilled hardened remember i told you it is possible to be detached katrina took one look at her baby and detached she didnt want to be a part of mollys life she walked away cut ties more fool her if she knew what she missed out on but its still awful ginny said hesitantly when you look at madison then i see molly he agreed or i see what molly might have been if thered been just one more chromosome and youre in cradle lake because the hospital where i worked molly attended day care there we lived in a hospital apartment and when i worked at weekends molly was there with me the nursing staffeveryoneloved her almost as much as i did when molly died it was like the whole hospital went into mourning in the end i needed to get away from everyone elses grief as well as my own so youve been flung straight into my tragedy im not in anyones tragedy he said roughly im on the outside looking in which is how im facing the world from here on which is how i suggest you face it but madison ginny there are wonderful potential parents out there who are aching to have a little girl like madison you know as well as i do how hard it is to find a child to adopt you also know that you as her guardian when richard dies will have a say in choosing those parents and youll have rights to access as she grows up when richard dies you can step away you know you can you can live your own life i dont think you can he said softly but strongly he reached forward suddenly and seized her hands tugging her to her feet standing so she was right before him and he was looking down at her in the moonlight youre a woman of strength ginny viental and you can use your strength to keep yourself independent right so standing here now with you holding my hands looking at me like this thatd be independent i can be independent and still want to kiss you yeah sure he said and if there was a trace of defiance in his tone both of them ignored it becausemaybe both of them knew it was impossible or at the least risky but there was suddenly no way that kiss wasnt going to happen he was so big ginny thought so male sogentle gentle was the wrong word but it was all she had he stood looking down at her smiling quizzically in the moonlight and it was as if for the first time in her life someone knew her someone could see what was underneath the carefully cultivated layers but she didnt feel exposed because what lay under those layers the fears and the void of loss were the same for both of them this man shared something shed thought was hers alone trust the word entered her subconscious and stayed there she could trust him because he knew her and that trust its sweetness was almost a siren song she gazed up into his face and he looked back and his eyes were gently asking if he could take the next step the next step in trust to kiss she smiled back at him albeit a shaky smile a smile full of uncertainty but a smile for all that he kissed her and her world changed just like that ginny had dated before of course she had she was almost thirty and she was no innocent shed carefully held herself at arms length when it came to letting her heart get involved but she enjoyed a great social life but shed never felt what she didnt know it was some indefinable factor but it slammed into her with such force that it shook her to the core the moment ferguss mouth met hers it was different in a way she could never have imagined could never have dreamt of her heart stopped beating what a dumb thought of course it didnt stop she was a sensible person she was a doctor this was the stuff of romance novels a kiss changing things she made to pull back and he released her his eyes searching her face in the moonlight you dont want this i yes i do she whispered or i think i do but i dont do relationships her voice was almost fearful of course you dont wise girl neither do i but kissing you know as well as i do that this isnt going to stop at kissing he stilled there was a moments pausea regroup this was the time for them both to pull away but his hands were holding hers and the feel of his mouth was still on her lips the taste of him how could she pull away youre a really desirable woman he said and there was a trace of uncertainty in his voice now id be lying if i said i didnt want you but you dont do relationships no still there was that uncertainty and it scared her you promise she said and her voice was urgent the smile came back into his voice thenand into his eyes they crinkled at the edges the laughter lurking behind a big gentle man who took on the troubles of the world youre saying we can make love as long as i agree to take off like a cad at first light theres a lot to be said for cads she whispered and managed to smile back no strings he murmured nno strings youre sure she looked at his face in the moonlight and she felt fear a sensible woman would retreat right now she thought but but shed suddenly had it with being a sensible woman life was suddenly far too bleak the future was suddenly far too scary heaven knew what would happen tomorrowshe certainly didnt theyd both seen too much grey she thought and if she was suddenly defiant rather than sensible who could blame her the night was still and warm this man was right before her back at home lay no dont think of that she could see from ferguss eyes that he was feeling exactly what she was he needed this night and so did she and shed take it no matter how stupid no matter how dumb i dont suppose she whispered that you have a condom at hand there was a moments hush the laughter faded and then sprang back again can you doubt it im a doctor up in my truck i have a doctors bag with almost a fully equipped pharmacy inside it ginny are you sure that means we have to go via your truck right umyeah his hands pulled her into him holding her close theres probably all sorts of creepycrawlies here anyway snakes and stuff probably she agreed equitably and snakesand stuffare decidedly unsexy i know a better place there you are then he grinned i have a condom you have a placewhat more do we want each other she whispered for tonight but just for tonight fergus just for tonight he agreed no strings but ginny mmm for tonight im going to love you chapter seven ginny had no intention of returning to the house neither did she want to go ferguss apartment attached via a connecting door to the hospital with all the connotations that held but down on the lake was the viental boatshed in her awful teenage years ginny had used it as a refuge shed gone there when life had simply overwhelmed her it didnt seem like home it didnt seem like any other place it was simply the boatshedher retreat from the world she directed fergus they drove in silence with fergus every now and then glancing across at her as if reassuring himself that she was still there still real she sat with her hands clasped loosely on her knees and tried not to think the same of him this was a moment out of time she thought one grasped moment of unreality a gift not to be extended a magic disappearing gift here for tonight but gone in the morning the contact with someone who sharedher heart lets not be fanciful she told herself but her lips curved in a tiny smile that wasnt quite mockery she looked sideways and found fergus was smiling as well an echo just for tonight she told herself just for tonight the world was holding its breath the boatshed was nestled in a patch of natural bushland just off the road fergus pulled the car onto the verge he grabbed his jacket from over the seat and ginny grinned you need a jacket my phones in the pocket he said apologetically and her smile died medical imperatives huh i did agree to take this job are we expecting medical imperatives theyd have to be pretty damned imperative you unlock the boatshed ill get my bag out of the back because it contains medical imperatives absolutely was this wrong ginny hauled open the boatshed door feeling like she should be feeling qualms or conscience or worry or something she felt none of those things she just feltright by the time fergus followed she had the doors open on the other side of the shed this was a dry shed with the boat having to be winched up a tracked ramp to be under cover the boat the family had used had long been sold but the shed itself was weatherproof and completely dry ginny had always loved it it had become a bolthole when things had been too awful at home and shed squirrelled things away here blankets pillows an old mattress with a couple of broken springs her comforts were ancient but not so old they couldnt be very useful now fergus stopped at the door and gazed around in appreciation the moon was almost full and as soon as ginny flung open the boat doors onto the lake the moonlight flooded in i have candles ginny said a trifle selfconsciously and he nodded i bet you have with little cupids engraved theres no need to mock im not mocking he said softly grinning ginny this is magic a man could fall in love but you wont of course i wont he said though he suddenly sounded a trace unsure he came up behind her and placed his hands on her shoulders turning her to face him his smile faded ginny are you sure about tonight im as sure as ive ever been about anything but tomorrowtheres no tomorrow fergus we both know that so we do he said gently but there is tonight she looked up at him fixing her eyes on his making sure and then suddenly before any more of these stupid scruples could get in the way she tugged her shirt over her head then she flicked the fasteners of her bra letting it fall free and reached for the zip of her jeans he caught her hand this is not an offering youre making he said softly catching her other hand as well and holding her before him this is mutual lovemaking were indulging in here mutual i want you ginny but i want you to want me i do want you she whispered not for sex ginny for lovemaking whether or not theres a tomorrow this needs to be an act of love or i want no part of it i need you to kiss me she gazed up at him he was looking down at her but he wasnt looking at her breasts as some men might have he was searching her eyes he was soso there was something changing inside her something she hadnt been aware could be changed fergus she twisted the grip of his hand so it was she who was doing the holding she lifted his hand high so the back of his hand was against her cheek so she could feel the roughness of his skin against her this was so right for this night this was her man he was big and tender and scarred with the same horror shed faced she put her hands up and touched his face gently tenderly never letting her eyes move from his fergus he bent and he kissed her and in that instant her world readjusted itself the awful tilted axis somehow righted itself lovemaking hed called it and maybe it was the right description for now for this wondrous moment the horror of commitment made way for for what she wasnt asking and neither was he because wonderfully inevitably fergus was merging his mouth with hers her hands were cradling his face brushing his cheek with her fingers tracing the roughness of skin and for this moment she was loving every inch of him he deepened the kiss and the sensation made her want to cry out in pleasure but she couldnt for to do that would be to break the moment to take pause but he did take pause he moved back then just a little so she could see the flare of desire in his eyes but could also read the sudden doubt ginny it is lovemaking yes but only for tonight just for tonight she whispered knowing it was what he wanted to hear but suddenly no longer sure that her words held truth she smiled up at him forcing her smile to be that of a calm sure woman with the situation totally in her control the fact that the situation was suddenly totally out of control was no fault of his and it was no less magical for that for the first time in her life she was out of control and glorying in it please the word was no sooner formed in her mind before she had her answer she was being kissed again and it seemed shed been waiting all her life for this kiss her lips parted joy surging through her body as she realised that hesitations were gone for this moment things had indeed changed he was her fergusthe man whod lain beside her and rescued a lamb and somehow changed the way she viewed her world she closed her eyes aching with sensual pleasure as he deepened the kiss his fingers were holding her tracing the contours of her waist seeking to know her he was glorying in the smoothness of her skin slowly wonderingly and each inch of movement sent shivers of sheer sensual pleasure through her entire body she let herself lean into him letting her bodys weight be supported by his seeking reassurance that he was real and not some romantic fantasy not some dream that would dissipate before it went further that this was happening in truth and not in dreams she was naked to the waist and he was still clothed but that was of no concern she could feel the strength of him underneath the clothes would disappear in time and for now it seemed they had all the time in the world for tonight i love you fergus she whispered this is indeed lovemaking it is indeed he held her at arms length ginny are you indeed sure you know i make no promises i want no promises for now i just want you he gazed down into her eyes for a long long moment questioning probing but her answers had already been given my beloved fool were both fools no were a mature man and woman with a condom out to have a very good time she smiled up at him aware that her whole universe was centred in this one moment and she caught his hand and held she kissed every finger in turn while he gazed down at her bent head with wonder in his eyes he kissed her once more but it was different better he kissed her as she needed to be kissed as she ached to be kissed her neck her lips her eyelids she lifted his hand and led it to her breast he slipped his fingers around the soft swell cupping the smooth contours tracing the nipples making her cry out in a soft low ache of need and desire and love he was still in his shirt and she needed him closer she needed the fabric to be gone the night was dreamlike and wonderful as she pulled away the flickering rays of moonlight off the water were playing on their faces there was no need of candlelight here her fergus for tonight this was her fergus they didnt speak there was no room for speaking there was no need her fingers were unfastening the front of his shirt he watched her his hands gently touching her face and she could hear his breathing deepening as she made her way downward her fingers were feeling the warmth of his skin under the fabric her lovely fergus her hero wounded as she was but for this night magically healed his breathing was becoming ragged as she ran her hands over his chest feeling his hair between her fingers leaning closer she kissed his neck tasting the salt of him loving him the shirt had fallen away and he was left with only his jeans her fergus hers she locked his arms behind him then lifted her head to allow him to kiss her he was tasting her neck caressing her shoulders with his tongue and the sensation was so exquisite she thought she must cry out in pleasure she could hardly breathe she stood motionless gasping her pleasure as he lowered his head and kissed between her breasts slowly slowly his hands gently cupped each breast and his lips moved from one to the other he kissed them in turn tantalising teasing the proudly upright nipples savouring his fingers moved gently whispering down her back her arms neck and then he tugged her into him and their heated bodies moulded together skin to skin their mouths were joined again her hands holding him in urgent primeval need his hands tugged at her hips and she felt her jeans slipping good this was right she searched for the zipper of his and tugged and her hands kept on tugging away away as his clothing disappeared her hands stayed at his hips she felt his body stiffen with shock as her fingers found what they were seeking and she found what for this moment she desired above all else that which would link her to this man in a way she must be if she was to live she was under no illusion now this night was changing her hauling her out of a dark abyss that she could no longer bear to be in the escape for her was in loving this man whether he wanted her or not but joyously he did want her for this moment and that was all that mattered it was all that could be allowed to matter their bodies were melting into each other he tugged her closer then swept her up into his arms and lowered her onto the ancient mattress she heard herself cry out with dismay as they were momentarily separated as he did what he needed to do to keep them safe but it was done in an instant and then he joined her his body melting against hers slow tender inevitable their bodies curved against each other and as they met skin against skin she felt herself growing dizzy with passion shed never known that shed never realised she could know oh the feel of him the joy he kissed her neck a rain of kisses running his tongue over her smooth soft skin while his magic hands caressed the hot skin of her breasts her navel her belly and beyond he was so beautiful this magnificent body strong and virile in full manhood what right did he have to turn away from loving because hed once been hurt fergus they lay entwined on the mattress and the night air warmed their naked skin creating an intimacy far greater than any closed bedroom door the night was warm and still and the tiny waves from the lake were slapping against the boatshed floor there were plovers calling along the grassland on the shore their calls eerie and wonderful every sense was arousedshe was aware of every nuanceshed never felt so alive as she did at this moment fergus she whispered her voice husky with passion and he rolled on top of her in one lithe move he was above her then his knees holding her hips within the strong bounds of his thighs she arched upward aching to be closer closer kissing his chest breathing hard tasting the salt of him fergus she was moaning now kissing him clutching his back aching for him to be inside her but he held himself still his arms were hard and sinewy as he held himself up drawing out the moment she so longed for she arched again but he leaned forward and kissed her deeply his tongue caressing promising giving a foretaste of what was to come my beautiful girl he whispered my crazy fool my heart come into me her thighs were aching with need her body was creating a flame all of its own but still he resisted he lowered himself but not where she most needed him instead he laid his chest lightly against her breasts brushing over and back over and back until her breasts felt as if they were alive and her whole body was trembling with want and ache and love still he brushed over and over and then he kissed her every part of her moving languorously from her lips to her neck to her breasts down over her belly taunting the aching need within until she thought she could die right at this minute and know that here was paradise enough enough she took his body and held in a fierce possessive hug that had him centred exactly where he needed to be centred lowering exactly where he needed to lowerand he was there she buried her face in his shoulder and she knew she was weeping he was deep inside her strong and gentle plundering yet loving she moved with him her body taking her rhythm from his letting him take her where he wanted but assuaging her own need reaching her heart taking her to where she was meant to be taking her to a home shed never known she could have her eyes were wide in the moonlight as he loved her and loved her still how could she close her eyes on this wonder his body in the night was a thing of raw strength and beauty she marvelled at his beauty as he moved above her as he loved her his body was glistening with sweat with concentration with desire her man for tonight her man her path to the future but then she stopped thinking thoughts gave way to pure sensation as her body reacted to the moment to his strength to his love to her aching tearing need the night and the moonlight and the sounds of the waters of the lake merged into her feeling for this man this wondrous fulfilment of passion that had her crying out arching her body moving without her willing it taking its need and causing the night to merge into a mist of heat and stars and whitehot love it went on and on surging throughout her body and the moment the sensation eased another started to build in a long rolling burning heat over and over she wept and her hands clutched his body and she knew that her world was right here her love and when it finished when finally he lay back exhausted still he held her his arms cradled her and she moulded herself to his body and she felt his heartbeat and knew that in her world things were finally right she found the strength to raise herself over him and she kissed him on the eyelids on his cheeks on his mouth gently tenderly he gazed up at her with eyes that were spent from passion but still held all the tenderness she could desire oh god ginny god has nothing to do with it she whispered allowing a touch of severity to enter her voice and if he has i hope he has his eyes closed for an unmarried woman to take such pleasure no god could deny you pleasure he whispered after the things youve facedhave yet to face you mean if i sleep now ill wake up and see you naked in the dawn she demanded refusing to be drawn where he was taking her and he chuckled a deep glorious chuckle that had her heart twist in a way it had never twisted in its existence scared i guess im not she said smiling and burying her face in his chest you are the most extraordinarily sexy man i know he said modestly and she giggled ginny hush she whispered suddenly realising what he might say and knowing she didnt want to go there ok fergus youre extraordinary but are you going to prove it or are you going to sleep if youre extraordinary what then youd be making love to me again right now your call fergus and it was no call at all he gazed at her for a long time and laughter died and she saw the doubts were still there behind the laughter my ginny he whispered my dream my heart my love my beautiful golden girl how can you need me it cant be real it cant last but for now youre here youre my woman and you want me youre a miracle thats here for the taking and i cant refuse you my love and why would you want to she demanded with some asperity and the corners of his mouth twitched into a crooked smile why indeed he tugged her down to him his mouth claimed hers and the whole glorious cycle started again until the phone rang until the medical imperative took over she didnt go with him there were yet two hours before dawn and this sounded like a simple case of a child with gastroenteritis one doctor could handle this alone so fergus could go play doctor and she could stay here and play abandoned lover in the moonlight which suited her mood entirely but she didnt feel in the least abandoned she lay in what was left of the moonlight staring out at the shimmering surface of the lake shed sworn never to come back here this place had been her refuge as a child but as an adult it had represented a security she knew was an illusion was it an illusion happy ever after itll end she whispered into the night itll end in tears but maybe not yet maybe i could give this loving business one more chance youll be hurt yes but if i dont try she rolled over and the mound of blankets where fergus had lain was still warm she buried her face in his pillow and thought she could smell him now i am being a lovesick teenager he doesnt want me even if he doesnt he was off saving the world she thought off being busy trying to block out pain trying not to let love creep in at the edges he had so much love to give so do i she told the lake i thought i didnt but tonightits crazy but suddenly theres more room for fergus for whoever fergus might or might not want her for much longer she thought and she could cope with that she had no choice tonight had been magica wonderful time out for both of them and for her an experience that had resettled her world on an axis it had been shaken off so many years before but for fergus his pain was raw and new and hed had no time to adjust to the awfulness of loss to expect tonight to change him it wont she told the darkened lake and she saw the light fade as the moon slipped beneath the horizon to the west soon it would be dawn could she cope with it i surely can she said and sat up and hugged her knees then she put out a hand and laid it on the ancient floorboards touch wood itll take guts yeah but it feels so goodconnecting she hugged her knees some more as if she was reassuring a friend as if she could conjure up ferguss body in her arms itll hurt again i know but it hurts anyway and im so tired of feeling empty dammit im going to try she stared around the ancient boatshed and realised what had happened i swore never to come back here she told herself and here i amback fergus drove toward the horace farm feelingodd like hed just been hauled back from a precipice and he wasnt at all sure he appreciated the sensation hed been so close to toppling over once when hed been a young intern in a busy emergency room an ancient lady had suffered a cardiac arrest on his shift hed done what hed been trained to do hed called for the crash cart hed applied the defibrillator hed worked on her hard for fifteen minutesand hed got her back it had felt great but two days later hed visited her in the ward and when shed realised who he was shed hurled her bowl of hospital broth at him with more force than such a woman could reasonably have been expected to possess i was ready shed hissed theyve all gone before me my husband my friends two of my children they were waiting and i was ready and you hauled me back for what what young man what it had been a salutary lesson and now he made a huge effort to learn which of his patients would elect to give the order not for resuscitation which should have no bearing on how he was feeling now he thought dryly but it did hed lain with ginny in his arms and hed felt so close to declaring himself in love hed gone so close to tumbling into the whole relationship thing again and now that hed been pulled back now that hed been pulled back he was feeling sick and empty maybejust maybe loving again wouldnt be so bad just ginny he told himself hastily in case his mind should get any funny ideas about taking it further maybe ginny and i could have some sort of relationship the thought of holding her again of lying with her of burying his body in hers was infinitely appealing and ginny didnt want attachments she wouldnt want children they could be a career couple carefully independent but meeting somewhere meeting where in marriage his mind closed on the ideabut then the thought of ginny rose up before him he let the image stay and the more he let it drift in his mind the more seductive the image grew just ginny he said into the darkness if shell have me if shell let some of her precious independence go not that i want her to be dependent what did he want and the answer came back he wanted ginny his cellphone rang again and he clicked through to the speaker on his truck console you on your way doc it was clive horace sounding anxious stephanies just chucked again and that makes it five times since midnight wont she be getting dehydrated yeah fergus thought shoving away the image of the seductive ginny until he had more time to focus stephanie would he needed to concentrate on medicine ginny would have to wait but not very long he told himself fiercely she was still at the boatshed lying sleepily in her cocoon of ancient blankets maybe if he was fast he wouldnt be fast if stephanie had vomited five times since midnight shed probably need to be admitted medicine was for now ginny was for tomorrow their paths didnt cross in the morning ginny came into the hospital early and spent two hours running a prenatal clinic shed organised shed done it simply by putting a notice in the window of the general store if youre pregnant and would like your checkups done here instead of bowra come along on tuesday morning the obstetrician in bowra was delighted to have pressure taken off what was a vast workload and ginny ended up with twelve ladies to see she did the antenatal checks but it ended up as an impromptu gettogether of cradle lakes prospective mumssomething just as valuable as any medical advice she could have given fergus came in at the end but ginny had just left shes left us to natter one of the ladiesa woman who by the look of her was planning on delivering her entire family in one hittold him oh but shes lovely we were just telling her that when you leave well try to persuade her to stay and she didnt say no wouldnt that be fantastic fantastic fergus frowned richard didnt have long left ginny would leave straight awayhe was certain of that shed organise madisons adoption and then head back to the city which was where their relationship could maybe become something they could take seriously maybe they could take a step or two toward permanence hell it had been a onenight stand so far he told himself startling himself with where his thoughts were going hed made love to a woman whod made him feel alive again and it had started him thinking that maybe he didnt need to cut himself right off from the world fine but one step at a time if it worked out it had to work out no it didnt he told himself saying farewell to the happy cluster of mumstobe and striding out to the truck to take a quick ride out to see richard hed promised to drop in on richard this morning and it was almost lunchtime and ginny would be there there was no reason at all for his steps to quicken as he strode out of the hospital toward toward ginny his steps definitely quickened chapter eight there were dogs at ginnys farmhouse fergus pulled into the yard and he could see things had changed there was a fencedoff area to one side of the veranda a temporary construction of chicken wire and garden stakes there were three dogs inside the pen and ginny was sitting in the middle of them up on the veranda sat madison every time hed come shed been sitting lethargic and uninterested now she was sitting on the top step watching with what seemed almost eagerness richard was still in bed he was getting weaker by the day and it was too much to expect him to get up now but tony had hauled his bed around so that he too could watch tony was sitting on the end of the bed overseeing the entire proceedings this was some strange hospital youre going to have to be polite if you want some hot dog ginny was saying and he hauled his attention back to her without any effort at all sit what was she doing three dogs three disreputable mutts one looked like some sort of whippet long rangy and lean there was a black and white border collie with a little bit of kelpie thrown in for good measure and there was a little dog a wirylooking terrier who looked sharply intelligent it was this dog ginny was addressing the other two were already seated waiting expectantly while he watched the little dog gave a tentative yap your friends are waiting ginny said you sit and you all get a bit of hot dog sit sir yap you heard what i said the dog stood four square and looked at ginny ginny sat on the grass and eyeballed the dog straight back you want the hot dog then sit she raised the hot dog over the little dogs head so it was forced to look up she pressed the dogs chest very gently the dog sat well done she said and beamed and handed out three pieces of hot dog from the veranda came the sound of clapping fierce clapping from tony faint clapping from richard andamazinglyan even fainter clapping from madison whats going on he demanded and all eyes swivelled to fergus the dogs reacted with startled aggression hurling themselves against the chicken wire hey ginny said manners you want more hot dog quiet her last word was a roar three tails went between six back legs sit she said and beamed as they sat she promptly distributed more hot dog theyre oscars dogs he said on a note of discovery and she grinned and climbed over the chicken wire i knew you were clever why are oscars dogs here ginny always was fabulous with dogs richard managed giving his sister a faint smile she bounded up the veranda steps three at a time reached the bed and gave her brother a hug i still am i still will be werent they great my daddy likes dogs madison said cautiously and richard smiled at his daughter your daddy certainly does he had to stop thereenergy was fading as they watchedbut some sort of link had definitely been made fergus thought my daddy things had happened since hed been here last oscar had six dogs he said feeling his way ginny plumped down on the step beside madison and hauled her in so they were linked hard side by side these are the good dogs the others had to go to a home for bad dogs fergus stared at the dogs he stared at richard and then at ginny and madison then he turned to the nurse on duty do you know whats going on you know oscars agreed to stay in the nursing home tony asked and fergus nodded yeah the council ranger called at the place yesterday tony told him ginnys been feeding the dogs and caring for the stock in general one of the neighbouring farmers has agreed to take on the sheep until things are sorted out but no one wants the dogs oscars said he doesnt care so the ranger told ginny yesterday that hed take them to he hesitated and glanced at madison to the dogs home right fergus said still feeling his way he looked at the way ginny was hugging madison and he thought shes changed somethings definitely changed was it the way he thought about ginny sure that had changed but there was more until yesterday ginny had treated madison with kindness shed held her at the funeral shed treated her feet shed told her stories shed done the physical caring but thered been that tiny distancing a professional distancing hed thought today there was no such distance today she was hugging madison as if she meant it i went over this morning ginny told him still hugging madison on the way back fromwhere id been i knew the whippetor sort of years ago when we left our farm oscar took over our two dogs he always liked a dog pack even if he never trained them and back then when i was a teenager it was either leave our dogs with oscar or have them put down the social worker whowho took me away said i didnt have a choice she gestured down to the whippet in the pen im guessing this ones related anyway i ran them all through their paces paces he still sounded cautious he thought but it behoved him to be cautious hed come out here with plans for himself which just might include ginny but suddenly ginnys side of the equation didnt look quite as uncomplicated as it had last night i fed them and took their food away halfway through their meal she said id fed them last night so they werent all that hungry but despite that three of them tried to bite me the other three looked at me like i was being mean but they let me do it that was test one i sat down with them for an hour and at the end of the hour i had the three nonbiters on my knee all telling me they were prepared to be devoted the other three took themselves off to the other side of the yard and refused to be friendly shed gone over prepared to take on the whippet richard whispered into the silence trust our ginny to bring back three her hearts bigger than the titanic only its different its unsinkable he subsided fergus glanced at him concerned and gestured tony to adjust the oxygen flow tony gave an almost imperceptible shrug which told him a hundred per cent oxygen was already running richards time was fast running out maybe a week fergus thought maybe less he looked back at ginny and saw the wash of pain cross her face he knew that his diagnosis had found concurrence is there anything you need he asked softly but he was asking the question more of tony than of richard richard had slumped into sleep soon his sleep would be more than that things are fine ginny whispered tugging madison up onto her knee and burying her face in her hair your daddys sick but hes not hurting is he love hes gone to sleep now soon hell sleep all the time my daddy and mummy are going to be together madison whispered so softly that fergus had to stoop to hear her but ginny and the puppies will look after me what fergus stared down at ginny as if shed taken leave of her senses what are you saying he asked and she gave him a rueful smile what i ought to have been saying two weeks ago the heart expands to fit all comers sorry i went to oscars to get a dog she said one dog only two other dogs put their heads on my knee and i thought ok i can fit three dogs into my life in your hospital apartment things might have to change how i think i might make a cup of tea tony announced into an atmosphere that was suddenly charged does anyone else want a cup of tea id love one ginny told him and gave him a grateful smile you want to come with me tony asked madison theres cookies with smiley faces in the biscuit barrel youve been making cookies fergus was so astounded that he almost barked the question and madison flinched at the unexpected noise he winced sorry he told the little girl i didnt know your i didnt know ginny knew how to make cookies i dont ginny agreed one of the neighbours brought over a bunch of baking but i might learn you might learn he stood feeling winded while tony gathered madison up and carried her into the house richard had seemingly drifted into a deep untroubled sleep there was suddenly only fergus and ginny and the future ginny was silent fergus hesitated then sat on the step beside ginny and stared out over the yard the dogs had slumped into a pile of canine contentment in the shade of a cotoneaster ginny looked as if she was watching them maybe she was but who knew what she was seeing they remained silent for a couple of minutes ginny didnt seem inclined to talk and fergus was struggling to find the right words he didnt know the right words ginny he said softly at last and she nodded mmm last night was fantastic it was wasnt it she agreed and there was a note of smugness in her voice that had him taken aback you agree mindblowing sex she said in satisfaction if id known that was what id needed to jolt me out of my misery id have had it years ago mind its a bit hard to find mindblowing sex that is i wouldnt know he said faintly you dont know how hard it is to find you havent been looking ginny her smile faded it was fantastic she said softly and not just the sex thank you fergus youre thanking me i surely am for what for jolting me i thoughtwhat we hadit was more a joining than a jolting he said cautious again she thought about that considering it from all sides you mean joining in more than a sexual way i havent always been celibate in the six years since my wife left he told her but last night was different mindblowing the smugness was back he smiled but persevered ginny you and i could have something special we do have something special i feel it as in she whispered he hesitated but it may as well be said it was how he was feeling theres no need for us to be alone he said just because weve been wounded in the past no she whispered she stared out at the dogs but the dogs were doing nothing going nowhere i figured that last night id always thoughtwell you know im a carrier for cystic fibrosis that doesnt mean youll have children with cystic fibrosis no she agreed her tone was blank almost businesslike that would only happen if my partner is also a carrier but even if my partner was free i still have a fifty per cent chance of passing on carrier status to a child so so this damnable disease would live on through me ive always sworn that will never happen that was fine as far as it went he thought he nodded theres life without children there is she said and her voice softened youd know that all too well we could make it happen he couldnt stop the urgency entering his voice hed seen a glimpse of an escapea sliver of something that might be a way of life he could embrace a beautiful woman smart and funny a professional colleague with a life of her own someone whod make him smile whod lie in his arms at night and take the emptiness away im keeping the dogs she said and his vision took a back step thats crazy whats crazy about giving dogs a home wed never be able to keep them we if you and i fergus im just thinking ginny he said i last night you and i for the first time since my wife left i thought that i might have met someone i could make a future with he lifted her hand linking her fingers through his ginny it was as you said mindblowing it made me think that maybe we could make something for ourselves be selfish justput away the pain and create a partnership that would edge out the darkness forget the darkness she whispered how can we forget block it out you cant do that she said softly ive been running for years and it doesnt work thats what i figured last night i lay there after you left and i stared at the darkness and i thought the way ive been trying to block out the pain is by pretending to be someone im not and i cant do that ive been trying but it doesnt work im just me ginny and i need people you made me see that last night you need me he asked not understanding and she shook her head not just you though youre definitely in there if you want to be in gee thanks she smiled but her smile was troubled dont thank me fergus because i dont think you want what im offering what are you offering im keeping the dogs she whispered he stared out at the canine pack why theyll be great when ive trained them you cant keep them in your sydney apartment no flat definite resolute youre not seriously thinking about staying here no her chin jutted a little and he thought he could see a trace of fear she might be determined but this determination was very new and veryscary im not thinking about staying here ive decided to stay here after richard he hesitated and glanced toward the bed after richard dies she said and her voice steadied i talked it through with richard this morning and i have his blessing to do what to make this house a home again she said if i can to give madison a place to live youll stay at cradle lake with madison he forgot to whisper if he sounded astounded he couldnt help it this was a woman whom hed thought was running from commitment as fiercely as he was i thought i hated it she whispered cradle lake was claustrophobic i knew everyone and everyone knew me you know how many times ive had to cook since people found out richard was back i dont i havent had to she continued ignoring his interruption ive been away for almost fifteen years yet im still one of them i have a community he flinched a community i have that where i work he said its not so rare people care its why im here to get away from it yeah but youve only been running for months ive been running for fifteen years she whispered i thought last nighti can stop do you have any idea what youre saying i have she said and again her chin jutted forward he could see fear behind her eyes he thought and he knew she wasnt as determined as she made out im jumping into the human race again i thoughtafter i lost richard that thatd be the end its not it cant be and for some reason last night made me see that i dont want it to be i dont want to hand madison over to adoptive parents madisons my last link with my family and i want to teach her to use a canoe on the lake i could be your family he said suddenly urgent and she gazed down at their linked hands and her smile became almost wistful you felt it too then last night i surely did more than mindblowing sex ginny we fit together you and your wife she said cautiously did you fit its different we were professional and our sole mutual interest was our work so you and mewhat would our sole mutual interest be ourselves he said but it sounded lame even to him i bet thats what you and your wife thought at the start fergus i want something more from a relationship than a mutual involvement in medicine he paused out in the pen one of the dogs the collie rolled over on her belly and started to scratch in an entirely undignified manner this isnt what you were saying last night he said cautiously and she nodded no its not but i made you no promises last night fergus i went into last night thinking it was a onenight stand and i cant help that it changed things what changed things you see i dont know she whispered im still trying to figure it out i only know that i woke up different i dont even know whats different ginny i want you thats lovely she said i want you too fergus but i come with strings dogs and a daughter youre not serious about madison ive never been more serious shes damaged she needs specialist care you think i cant give her that she needs two parents he spoke more roughly than hed intended and both of them turned to look at richards bed but richard wasnt moving i cant help that ginny said apologetically i only know that when i woke up this morning she was mine i went to sleep in your arms last night thinking i had no family at all and when i woke up i did have family and ill fight to the death to defend it he stared at her baffled how could things have changed so fast hed driven out here thinking that his world was starting to make sense againjust a bit that he could find a little joy but ginny wasnt content with a little joy she wanted the whole catastrophe he stared out at the disreputable dogs and thought could he could he the screen door swung wide and out came tony who was carrying madison who was carrying a plate of cookies with exorbitant care i didnt spill any of them madison said and ginny beamed and bounced up and took the biscuits thats brilliant poppet she said and madison frowned my names madison yes but youre also a poppet ginny said thats because you look very very cute i had a little brother like you once and my mum used to call him poppet ginny fergus said almost explosively would you like a cookie dr reynard no he took a gripalmost the sight of madison smiling was suddenly almost overwhelming the pain ginny saw it her face softened and she took a step toward him fergus im sorry she murmured i know its much too soon its never going to be any better he muttered backing off is there anything else you needmedically she saw it and responded immediately as if shed expected no less we need orders for an increase in morphine richard was unsettled last night and i promised him he neednt be tonight ill write it up now he turned to tony tony ill take madison down to talk to the dogs while you sort out medical needs ginny told him setting down the cookies and gathering her niece into her arms you look after the medicine im looking after my family ginny thats the way it has to be fergus she said softly i knew when i figured it out last night that it wasnt going to be easy i dont want to hurt you but i know what i have to do he couldnt do it fergus drove away from the farmhouse feeling sick hed driven out here with his heart full of ginny feeling like he was waking from some sick grey trance but now dogs maybe but madison a little girl like molly she wasnt in the least like molly he thought savagely she had all her chromosomes she had a healthy heart she could be a vibrant happy little girl ginny had no right to keep her she needed two parents molly had been ok with one parent and the hospital community madison was no molly molly the pain around his heart tightened burned threatened suddenly to almost overwhelm him the thought of her small arms around his neck the way she had of burrowing her nose into his shoulder and saying daddy daddy daddy like it was a mantra madison wasnt burrowing her face into anyones neck yet he thought but if she had proper parents she would be she should be but it wouldnt be his no how could he lift a child and cuddle her and give her the love she deserved he couldnt hell it was hard enough caring for patients it had been hard enough last night caring for stephanie horace stephanie was eight years old shed had to be admitted and her father had a bad back fergus had carried her out to the car and even that had hurt having a childs body limp and warm against his chest what ginny was asking was too much she wasnt asking it of him hell he said into the silence and then he thumped the steeringwheel so hard that he hurt the back of his hand hell hell hell where were the answers there werent any do you know what youre doing fergus had been gone for ten minutes ginny and tony and madison had consumed milk and cookiesor coffee and cookies for the grownupsand then tony and madison had gone inside to wash up soon miriam would be there for handover they really didnt need a nurse here any more ginny thought as she sat on her veranda step and stared down over the lake shed agreed to a nurse being here because she hadnt wanted to get close to madison but now hell run a mile her brother whispered and she turned to find richard wideeyed and watchful youre awake he managed a smile sometimes i can be how long have you been awake she asked cautiously and he shrugged long enough to hear you scaring the good doctor into the middle of next week he wants you ginny maybe he does but but what he doesnt want what comes with me yesterday you had nothing richard whispered it was almost beyond him to speak now and ginny walked over and sat on his bed taking his hand in hers bending close so he didnt have to strain to speak yesterday you were running as fast as i have been maybe weve both come to the end of our running i surely have he whispered hell ginny you know its ok with me if you have madison adopted weve asked so much of you big sister to a family of tragedy i loved you all she whispered back speaking almost to herself i loved chris and toby to bits i loved mum even when i knew she was drinking herself to death i understood why you ran i behaved so unfairly i wasnt so sick that i couldnt have helped no but to watch what youd have to go through yourself eventuallyi understood everyone has to die some time i was just a coward like dad was a coward but not you you were always the bravest ginny and ill not let you be taken advantage of ill organise madison into fostercare myself you do so over my dead body she said and her sudden flash of anger startled them both shes my family we dont do family he whispered but her fury was still there like hell we dont who did you come back to when you were ill thats different why is it different you know i slept with fergus last night i guessed he said and managed a wry smile was it good she smiled back aware that her face was flushed but also knowing that there wasnt a thing she could do about it it was excellent the thing is the thing is what he asked closing his eyes and she withdrew her hand from his youre so tired i shouldnt i have all the time in the world for sleeping he said and the anger was in his voice now he left his eyes closed but his hand still held hers the thing is what i fell in love she said softly and his eyes flew open again you fell in love just like that she whispered and he lefthe had a house calland i lay there and i thought ive been trying to seal up the jagged edges every time theres a death chris toby mum and now you it hurts so much and ive been trying to shrink my heart make it less and less exposed and its been grey and horrid and i didnt know what to do about it except to keep on shrinking only then this morning suddenly all those jagged edges opened up again and it was like my heart was suddenlybeating again oh ginny it feels better she said almost defiantly sure its crazyits terrifying if you like but the alternatives worse youve had fun since youve been diagnosed youve had lovers the result of one of them is in our kitchen eating cookies right now but you always knew you were going to die it didnt stop you learning to surf seeing every part of australia you could having fun yes but but thats what im saying she whispered its the same thing i figured it last night yeah i might get hurt again but if i dont take those risks then i might as well wither right now so im taking on the dogs and im taking on madison and fergus she hesitated he has his own figuring out to do she whispered hes been hurt hes lost a child recently a little girl mmm then its not fair to ask him to take on madison its not she agreed and im not asking him to but you want her ill fight to the death to keep her even if it means losing fergus i dont think i can lose fergus she whispered i dont think i have him to lose he loves you i dont think hes figured what love really is she said what it can be so what will you do take care of my brother for as long as he needs me she whispered and stooped to kiss him lightly on the forehead look after three dogs look after one little girl andmaybe even look after the medical needs of cradle lake for as long as cradle lake will have me chapter nine richard slept miriam arrived to take over nursing duties from tony she didnt question the fact that there were now three dogs on the place or that when she arrived ginny was sitting under the trees with madison heaven knew what tony told herprobably every single damned thing including her thoughts ginny thought but she didnt think it bitterly cradle lake had seemed a prison for years the communitys intimate knowledge of everyones nearest concerns had seemed claustrophobic now suddenly it seemed like a refuge you know madisons a very long name she told her niece cautiously as they finished the third reading of a poky little puppy did your mummy call you madison all the time my mummy says madisons a lovely name the child whispered she was lying on the grass beside ginny when theyd first started telling stories madison had been a good foot away but then one of the dogsthe whippethad crawled over to drape herself over ginnys stomach and madison had come a little closer when ginny had encouraged her to pat the dog and now the childs little body was hard against ginnys it was a tiny measure of trust but it made ginny feelwell that maybe things could work that maybe things were working for her as well as for madison did she ever call you maddy only when she was giggly madison said was she often giggly my mummy stopped being giggly madison whispered she says the pills took away her giggle she used to cry sometimes its right to cry ginny said stroking the little girls tousled curls sometimes its the only way to say goodbye to people i think your mummy was crying because she knew she was saying goodbye to you i didnt want her to go no but when somethings so wrong that even the doctors cant make it right then theres no choice your mummy would have stayed with you if she could but she was too sick instead she brought you here to be with your daddy for a little bit to get to know him until he has to say goodbye then to be with me and miriam and tony and all these lazy lazy dogs the whippet chose that moment to turn and give ginny a slurpy kiss i hope shes been wormed ginny thought and then decided there was no way oscar would have wormed his dogs but maybe worms were the least of their problems but shed worm dogs and everyone associated with dogs right away a nice uncomplicated piece of medicine will we stay here for ever madison asked and ginny stroked her hair some more would you like to id rather stay with my mummy you know you cant do that but me and the dogs might learn to be ok you might get to like us she stroked the childs curls some more fighting for the right words your mummy and your daddy have been unlucky she said at last i think you wont have to say goodbye to me for a very long time so far ahead you cant even imagine was it the right thing mmm madison said noncommittally but her head stayed on ginnys lap and she snoozed into sleep ginny gazed up and saw that miriam had been standing on the back step listening she wiped her eyes fiercely with the back of her hand said dratted hayfever and disappeared into the house with speed hayfever was catching ginny found herself sniffing and hauled herself together with a fierceness that was almost anger shed lose richard did she have to lose fergus slowly the anger faded she stared out over the sleepy rural landscape and tried to do a bit of crystalball gazing which was very very hard for no matter how she looked the crystal ball didnt show fergus her heart was screaming fergus if she went back to the city she could be with him maybe it could work her hands were stroking madisons hair and the whippet was nuzzling her leg if she went back to the city then maybemaybe a suburban block no fergus wanted no appendages hed made that clear even looking at madison hurt he wanted a sexy relationship with no strings yesterday that had been fine but now she wanted strings she was desperate for strings and here they were lying on her lap she was damned if shed cut any more strings of her own accord im calling you twiggy two after my old dog she told the whippet then as the other two dogs thought maybe this wasnt a trap and maybe they too could get into this patting business she granted them names as well youre snapper she told the collie and the collie snapped at a fly in honour of the naming ceremony and youre bounce she told the little dog because im betting that if i feed you right and hug you often thats what youll do like madison by the time i finish with her shell be maddy you mark my words itd be ok she was sure itd be ok phone miriam said from the veranda and she sounded apologetic as if she knew how important this discussion was and she really didnt want to interrupt it she still sounded sniffy its fergus he needs you no he doesnt ginny thought but she handed over her charges to miriam and went to find what the impersonal need was that fergus wanted her for ginny stephanie horace has appendicitis shes the eightyearold i admitted this morning with suspected gastro the symptoms this morning werent specific but they are now can you give the anaesthetic if i operate straight away ferguss voice was so formal that she almost flinched instead she held the phone away from her face took a deep breath and switched into medical mode or tried to she wasnt too sure how shed handle being close to fergus right now itd be easier if they didnt have to see each other she thought bleakly but she still needed his help with richard and she had agreed to help him when needed youre sure its appendicitis she asked without much hope there was very little local tenderness this morning plus there was a history of two siblings with a tummy bug a couple of days before fergus sounded more strained than the situation demanded maybe he was feeling the same as she was i popped her into hospital with an iv line and she settled but shes started vomiting again now theres acute tenderness on the right side and shes looking sick youre thinking that an attack of gastro could have pushed a grumbling appendix into an acute infection ginny said and got a grunt of assent thats what it looks like no rebound yet but i want it out fast can you help or will i send her on rebound painpain when pressure was releasedwas a sign of a burst appendix if there was no rebound pain they might be in time to take out an intact appendix much as she didnt want to face fergus again so soon there was no choice of course ill help i thought you might not oh for heavens sake if she could be clinical surely he could be too you thought i might not what she snapped you offered to help out before he said but things have changed youre making a family yes things have changed her voice softened fergus theres no eitheror in this game youre saying im an unemotional clinical medico or im part of a family im allowed to be both you were both until molly died im both now she looked down at her torn jeans with dog hair attached and grimaced look out for the lady with so much domesticity attached to her you cant imagine thatll be me but im also a doctor have the theatre ready the minute i arrive thats telling him miriam said mildly as ginny put down the phone and ginny turned and faced her with a slightly shamefaced smile i had no business talking to him like that but he was being ridiculous miriam smiled back at her maybe he is hes in love with you ginny no hes not are you crazy he cant keep his eyes off you richard and i were just saying so the mans besotted hes not in love with me how can he be his little girl died three months ago hes raw with pain oh my dear miriam said softly her smile fading we did wonder is that why he came here to get away apparently that makes it so much harder now youre taking on the little one i know she whispered but how can i not you know our family history madison looks like toby she looks like chris how can i not be part of her family i justam even if it means giving up dr reynard i dont have him to give up she said honestly he fancies me as an unencumbered partner when needed but it seems encumbrances are part of who i am i just seem to collect them and if he loves you then he has to see the whole picture miriam agreed encumbrances included like thats going to happen i dont think so the appendix burst just as fergus reached it damn he muttered and glanced up to see that shed realised what had happened a straightforward appendectomy took only minutes and ginny had administered a really light anaesthetic now that it had burst there needed to be a full washout of the cavity carefully cleaning every possible trace of the infected tissue ginny nodded and adjusted her dosage then went back to watching her dials monitoring breathing taking care but stephanie was a normally healthy eightyearold whod only been ill for twelve hours this was not a complicated anaesthetic there was time to watch fergus operate to see the skill in his fingers to think that he couldnt be expected to stay here with a skill like this he should be a city surgeon so what was she about wanting him to stay here she didnt want him to stay here she didnt want to stay here herself but she would madison needed her the dogs needed her she needed to be needed oscars heard youve taken his dogs mary the nurse assisting fergus handed fergus his threaded needle the cleaning was finished and fergus was starting to close the nurse went back to swabbing to keep the site clear of blood but she was relaxed enough now to talk to ginny mary was an older nurse than miriam another farmers wife her farm was just north of oscars hes telling everyone its theft and hes talking about having you arrested she said hes angry about everything fergus muttered concentrating on stitching the mans perpetually twisted you want me to kick him out of the nursing home and tell him to go and look after his dogs himself hed die ginny said but there was a certain amount of reluctance in her voice fergus glanced up at her and you wouldnt be sorry im always sorry when patients pass on she said and made her voice prim but those dogs have been starved and beaten its a wonder the whole six of them arent savage hes not happy in the nursing home mary said threading the next needle tell me where he would be happy hes never had a family mary said what he needed was a wife and six kids instead hes just sat in that farmhouse and thought about the injustices of the world until hes come to this that caused a bit of an extended silence where mary appeared to think about what shed said i mean theres nothing wrong with not being married she said at last a trifle selfconsciously i dare say you two will turn out to be very nice people fergus grinned not me im into injustices like ginny being arrested for taking on the care of three starved dogs that could get me bitter and twisted in no time then youll be carted off to a nursing home kicking and screaming ginny retorted any minute now get yourself some encumbrances theres three of oscars dogs left he said thoughtfully maybe i should take them on the ranger put them down this morning mary said and all their smiles faded with oscars permission fergus asked oscar said put them all down mary told them including the ones ginny has hes decided to come into the nursing home and he doesnt want anyone benefiting from his animals hes almost psychotic about being ripped off so technically ginnys guilty of dognapping hes not happy that shes saved their lives fergus demanded incredulous and mary shook her head ill give the man enemas fergus muttered three a day for as long as we both shall live youre only here for another ten weeks mary reminded him and he glowered some more time enough thats seventy by threetwo hundred and ten enemas hell crack and sign a promise not to sue before im done with him he wont sue ginny said the mans all bluster im not frightened of him you used to be mary retorted he and your motherthats an old story that oscar will never let drop there was a story went round the town when you were about eightthat oscar berated your mother and you stood up for her and he belted you my uncle was the town policeman at the time and i remember him being livid that your mother wouldnt press charges he hit you fergus demanded he was concentrating on the job at hand but it was merely dressing now and there was room for rage he hit lots of things in his time mary said equitably but look at him now alone in a nursing home with his very own doctor threatening to give him enemas which ill thank you not to give him ginny said equitably thats all in the past now youve moved on as of last night i havedoctor she said meekly and both mary and fergus stared at her you want me to reverse my anaesthetic she asked and they were back into medical mode again which was just as well yes please fergus said but mary stared at both of them and ginny thought no she hadnt moved on but ginny wasnt answering questions she couldnt mary and a young orderly took the recovering stephanie out of theatre fergus left to let the parents know how things had gone ginnie rid herself of her theatre gear fast hoping to escape but when she emerged fergus was seated in the waiting room with a couple who were obviously stephanies parents the woman had been crying ginny saw and it was obviously taking time to reassure her and to be able to speak coherently to the pair of them the appendix has burst he was saying its out now and its fine but it was a bit messy im really sorry i didnt diagnose it this morning its meant that we need to keep stephanie in hospital for a little longer than we otherwise would shell have to stay on intravenous antibiotics to make sure the infection from the appendix doesnt cause any more problems but she will be ok the woman asked tremulously and fergus met her look square on he hesitated but the woman was shaking he put a hand on her shoulder and gripped hard it was often like this with people whod never had medical trauma in their lives before ginny thought these two had been shocked to the core by the realisation that their little girl was vulnerable in the worst possible way to lose a child fergus had lost a child what that must mean shell be ok he was saying ginny should go through the room past them to the exit at the very least she should make her presence felt instead she stood in the doorway and watched if youd operated earlier it wouldnt have burst the farmer said probing and fergus nodded thats right it was my mistake and im sorry for it how often did you hear a doctor say that ginny thought incredulously surgeons had a reputation for being minigods in their domain not this one but we all thought it was gastro the woman was crying still but shed calmed down now and she took ferguss hand and lifted it the local schoolone kid after another has gone down with this bug and we thought it was the same we practically told you it was the same and clive here even thought you were overreacting when you brought her in this morning bloody doctors trying to fill hospital beds he said and i agreed so she gulped so im saying theres no blame on you from us for not diagnosing it earlier is there clive and she turned to her husband and waited hmm it could go either way here ginny thought clive horace had the look of a man who could be belligerent but it seemed that ferguss blatant apology had done the trick we wont be blaming you doc he said if you hadnt been here and she stopped vomiting we probably wouldnt have even taken her to the doctor until late today cos itd mean a threehour drive by which time i reckon shed be worse she would have been just lucky you were here then he said and he looked up and saw ginny watching and you too miss he told her the nurse said youd given the anaesthetic and you a viental and all i your familys had such rotten luck the farmer said and here we are terrified about one of our kidlets with appendicitis i dont know what were making a fuss about if it was my kid id be making a fuss ginny said they say you have a kid the farmer said richards kid they say youre taking her on i yes youre a brave lass he rose and took his wifes hand drawing her up after him thanks to you both he said heavily can we see her now she wanted to go home she felt drained and a little sick she turned and headed out to the car park and when she heard fergus call she was tempted not to stop ginny she did stop but she didnt turn to face him she just stood motionless staring ahead at her car he caught her and touched her shoulder she flinched shed made her decisionbut she didnt have to like it he withdrew his hands ginny yes i was wondering if youd come out with me tonight i dont think thats a good idea no he said gravely its a dumb idea but its the only idea i have hell ginny what sort of a childhood did you have are you saying you want to take me out tonight because you feel sorry for me she managed and she heard him suck in his breath in exasperation of course not then what i just think youre the bravest woman he murmured ive never met anyone like you ginny i really need to get to know you better i dont think thats a good idea either why not she whirled to face him because im falling in love with you she whispered i think thats a really good idea he said and he smiled no its not ginny we need to see where this can take us thats nuts like theres five roads branching out ahead and we know three end in brick walls so lets just put our foot on the accelerator and go where the steeringwheel takes us i just want to take you to dinner no why not you know why not richards doing little but sleeping miriams with madison you see theres the problem she whispered madison needs to be with me she needs to start seeing me as a constant he drew in his breath at that he really was absurdly handsome ginny thought inconsequentially he was still wearing his theatre gown and slippers hospital green hed raked his hair as hed spoken to stephanies parents and it was tousled and rumpled and she just want to no maybe i could try he said and she blinked try try what he chewed his bottom lip ginny this thing between usyou say you think youre falling in love im trying very hard not to she said and he nodded me too so why are you asking me out to dinner because ive got this appalling feeling that i might be making a mistake fergus my appendages arent going to go away she said softly believe me i didnt mean this to happen i know this is really fast but its overwhelming every time i look at you i think how can i have appendages when it means i cant have you but i do have them fergus madison is right here in my heart and im even falling for my dogs ok then he said and she blinked again ok what ill try youll try what lets have a picnic on the lake tonight with appendages attached not in the boatshed she said in a hurry and he grinned not in the boatshed a proper picnic she sounded suspicious but she couldnt help it yes she bit her lip but it had to be said i can bring madison you can bring anyone you want a barbecue yes if we can build one on the shore theres a cairn down on the east shore we can use as a barbecue she stared at him for a long moment and came to a decision right if i leave now i can catch the butcher just like that just like that she said are you doing evening surgery yes but its lightly booked it should be finished by six ill see you at seven then she told him on the east shore with sausages see you then terrific she thought as she drove butcherwards what on earth was she doing she didnt have a clue chapter ten she was therewith appendages fergus pulled into the east shore parking area where a row of eucalypts divided the paddocks from the sandy shore and he thought shed brought everyone she could think of ginny madison twiggy snapper and bounce richard lying on a blowup mattress on the shoreline and seemingly asleep and miriam calmly sitting beside him her stockings off and her feet in the water it was a real family picnic fergus thought and he wanted to run hi ginny rose from where shed been sorting through a picnic hamper she was wearing a crimson bikini with a crimson and white sarong she was smiling maybe he didnt want to run bounce nearly ate the sausages madison announced she was also wearing a bikinia miniature version of ginnys the cradle lake ladies auxiliary had held a working bee to augment madisons scant wardrobe she now had outfits for every occasion but her tiny body still looked waiflike and fergus felt his heart wrench maybe he should run so who saved the sausages he asked and richard opened his eyes and managed a weary smile our ginny was a rugby player in a previous life it was a tackle that would have done an international player proud ginny got a sore knee madison said gravely and fergus looked at said knee and saw a graze and a trace of blood do you need a doctor he asked and she flushed a little i dont need a doctor thank you very much she managed we need a cook miriam told him youre on barbecue duty why men tend barbecues richard whispered and i cant it was all richard could do to make himself heard fergus thought looking down at his patient in concern it must have cost him a huge effort to be there tonight but together miriam and ginny had him comfortable they had his oxygen cylinder set just above the water line theyd lain him right on the waters edge and he had a hand trailing lazily in the water the night was warm and dreamy the sun a low ball of fading heat reflecting softly off the water if i only had a few days left this is where i might like to be fergus thought and glanced at ginny and saw she was thinking exactly what he was thinking there was pain behind her eyes knowledge of imminent loss lets get these sausages cooked he said maybe more roughly than hed intended maddy would you like to help me madison she whispered sorry madison would you please help me with the sausages what do you want me to do have they been pricked pricked no ginny told him theyre unpricked sausages thats a terrible state of affairs he told the little girl let me teach you how to professionally prick a sausage they pricked cooked and ate their sausages they polished off salad and lamingtons and sponge cake and grapes and lemonade its time to swim ginny decreed arent you supposed to wait for half an hour after eating fergus asked and she gazed at him blankly why in case of cramp what medical textbook did that come out of my mothers he said and she grinned my mother said every minute out of the water on a night like this was a minute wasted are you pitting your mother against my mother no he said faintly i darent you did bring your togs he had he felt a bit selfconscious hauling off his shirt and trousers with everyone looking at him ginny had seen him before but the thought of that made him even more selfconsciousand miriam whistling didnt help at all ooh dr fergus you make me go all wobbly round the knees i begin to see what you see in the man richard managed and fergus made a valiant attempt not to blush im swimming he said and turned toward the water not before the race ginny announced and he hesitated the race we have a boat ginny gestured up the bank to where an ancient bathtub lay on its side thats a bathtub he said cautiously the mans intelligent as well as goodlooking richard whispered ginny youve struck gold quiet ginny ordered she turned back to the lake and gestured to a series of poles curving about two hundred yards out into the lake we use the bath to paddle through as many poles as we can the poles are all in shallow water she said they mark the boundary of where nonswimmers can go plus they act as a sort of slalom run a slalom run fergus said cautiously as in skiing right um anything else i should know our bathtub doesnt have a plug right ginny grinned at his evident confusion right behind where the bath is theres a clay bank she told him its really gluey clay and its the makings of a cradle lake tradition you make your own plug your plug can be made of anything you can find on the ground like leaves grass even cow patsbut the plug has to be held together by clay i see he shook his head nope i dont see the trick is to make your plug launch your bath and then paddleusing only arms over the side you weave in and out of the poles the record is the third last marker before the plug disintegrates and the bath sinks who holds the record fergus asked and richard managed a smile that would be me aged all of fourteen twentythree poles richard was great ginny told them smiling down at her brother in affection but fergus youre a grown man with muscles that make even miriam whistle surely you can beat a mere fourteenyearold whippersnapper with cystic fibrosis richard added everyone without cystic fibrosis should be handicapped no ones beaten your record ginny said soundly stuff cystic fibrosis it didnt beat you then it didnt beat you then this was a battle fergus thought he looked from brother to sister and back again and thought this disease had been a part of their lives for so long that it was a tangible thing a monster to be beaten over and over again until it could no longer be beaten which would be soon meanwhile they were watching him expectant you want me to show you how its done ginny asked richard would but hes a bit tied up at the moment you could say that richard said and grinned madison sit by me while your aunty ginny plays boat captain i reckon madison could go in the boat miriam said smiling at the lot of them like an indulgent aunt instead of the efficient nurse she was can the dogs go in the boat too madison asked and ginny held up her hands in horror one child maybe but no dogs i intend to set a mark that dr reynard cant beat madison you can help paddle but the dogs would sink us by the first pole right miriam said decisively thats it then the crews are decided lets get this boat race under way it looked easy fergus thought sitting on the sunwarmed sand and waiting as ginny prepared her plug the trick is not to show dr reynard what were doing she told madison and they turned their backs on him and stooped over the clay bank but the trick is to weave the grass over and over watch two heads bent intent this was great fergus thought this for madison was a night off she was totally absorbed and for the moment she could forget the horrors of abandonment the loss of her mother she was handing ginny blade after blade of grass and a complicated piece of neurosurgery couldnt have elicited more attention right said ginny at last fergus youre permitted to help haul the bath to the waters edge gee thanks think nothing of it they hauled the bath down to the shore then ginny fitted the now empty picnic hamper into the rear upside down thats your seat she told madison put your toes down into the water and kick as hard as you can kick and kick and kick i find yelling helps too a sort of warrior war cry listen as i yell and follow madison looked dubiously at ginny for a moment fergus thought shed refuse but ginny was squeezing a little more water out of her plug and not paying attention finally she looked up satisfied right she told madison woman to woman are we ready yes said madison so madison was seated on the wicker basket ginny climbed aboard and squished her plug into the hole right she yelled push fergus and miriam pushed the boat out into the water through the first poles go ginny yelled she was in the bow of the bath leaning forward so her hands were paddling crazily in front of her the boat was hardly steerable the trick was to get close enough to the next pole to grab it and haul the tub around go go go ginny yelled and madison kicked with a ferocity that belied her four years of age go madison yelled entering into the spirit of things and kicking harder go go go the dogs were going crazy barking in chorus miriam was laughing and richard was doing a close approximation to a chuckle holding his hands up and clapping to show encouragement five poles six seven eight the tub settled lower in the water kick ginny yelled hauling the tub round the next pole go go go two more poles the bow dipped the bathtub slid silently underwater but by the time it sank ginny had madison in her arms hugging her and cheering as their vessel disappeared from view we were fantastic maddy girl she whooped werent we fantastic madison maddy said but she was smiling fourteen poles ginny said in satisfaction beat that dr reynard only of course he couldnt he made a plug he was sure would hold miriam and ginny and madison shoved him forward with a push he had to concede was as powerful a start as hed given them they whooped the dogs barkedand he sank as he reached the eleventh pole pathetic richard whispered as they hauled the bathtub back to shore see what cystic fibrosis can do for a man ill get better fergus said not if you only stay here a few more weeks richard told him it takes a lifetime to build a skill like that he broke off gasping and ginny flinched but it seemed she was determined to keep them all cheerful we all need a swim she said determinedly richard would you like us to push you further in im happy where i am richard managed just watching ive pushed my bathtub for twentythree poles what more can a man expect out of life they stayed until dark miraculously ferguss pager stayed silent they dried off ginny did a quick change behind a beach towel that had fergus fascinated then they toasted marshmallows on the fire and sat and watched as the moon came up over the water miriam excused herself ill be back at the house when you get there she told them but theres not a lot of nursing to be done here fergus if youll stay to help ginny get them all home i might nip home myself and spend an hour or two watering my vegetable patch she shouldnt be staying with us ginny said obviously feeling guilty as miriam left its costeffective fergus told her we worked it out two patients needing fulltime care wed have to put another nurse on if we had them in hospital so the boards happy to pay tony and miriam and bridget to work like this how hard did you have to twist their arms i didnt fergus said honestly this is a great little community ginny i know it is she said i hadnt realised if only my parents had asked for help and you hadnt had a neighbour like oscar she shrugged oscars irrelevant she turned and looked at richard as the sun had set theyd piled blankets over him to keep him warm hed stayed awake until the last ray had faded behind the distant mountains watching with something akin to greed hed watched the sun set on the lake hed watched his daughter trying to swim this was some hospice fergus thought would that all dying patients got such care he was deeply asleep now deeply for a moment fergus hesitated but then he rose and crossed to the makeshift bed he stooped and felt for the pulse it was still there just a thready too fast pattern he turned and ginny was hugging madison to her tight her face had blenched its ok he said gently hes still with us the tension eased from her face but not the pain soon she whispered soon he agreed but youve given him this night youve given him the knowledge that his little girl will be cared for its some gift ginny youve helped she whispered like richard madison had slumped into sleep shed been seated beside ginny and gradually shed eased down onto ginnys knees ginny was cradling her taking comfort as well as giving it the little girl stirred now and whimpered a little as if she realised that the arms she was in werent those of her mother ginny eased her down onto the rug pulling another rug over her then she sat and watched the tiny face concentrating fiercely on sleep soon theyd have to stir theyd have to wake richard and move him back to the house soon this evening would be ended she didnt want it to end fergus thought watching ginnys face and knowing instinctively what she was thinking she knew her brother wouldnt be coming back here something was ending tonight he couldnt bear it he didnt remember moving he justdid one minute he was kneeling beside richard the next minute he was on the rug with ginny he had her in his arms and he was kissing her he was kissing her as she needed to be kissed it was different from last night last night their lovemaking had been driven by passion and laughter and mutual need tonight tonight he needed to kiss this woman as he needed to breathe she was so beautiful so needful so brave she was taking the world onto her shoulders and shed already been there he had no doubt of the childhood shed had loaded with responsibility beyond her years and here she was taking it on all over again she was soso ginny and she needed him he could feel it in the way her body melted into his in the way her face came up to meet his kiss but more it was as if she was a part of him that he hadnt realised was missing when her lips met his it was a completeness that hed never experienced could never experience with anyone but this woman ginny her lips were opening under his she was wearing a fleecy jogging suit soft pants and an oversized sweater which should be keeping her warm on such a mild night and so close to the fire but she was trembling he held her and kissed her and kissed her and he thought this was right this was how the world was meant to be this woman in his arms for always for ever but madisons little body was hard pressed against ginny maybe she felt the change in ginnys body maybe she felt the trembling and it fed her own insecurities for whatever reason she suddenly whimpered a little and drew away it broke the moment ginnys hands touched his shoulders but already he was drawing away looking down at the child in concern looking back at ginny seeing ginnys uncertainty in the firelight i she reached up and touched her lips where shed been kissed as if she had trouble understanding the sensation the taste the lingering feeling of awe she must feel because that was how he felt like the world had changed shed said their time in the boatshed had changed her world he thought dazed maybemaybe tonight had changed his no last night hed known that he wanted this woman the only thing that had changed was the intensity of that feeling ginny we need to be together he whispered and touched her face i dont see how we can work it out we must i dont see how i can do this he said he hesitated taking in the scene lit by the firelight and the rising moon a dying man three dogs lying by richards side richard had demanded the leftover sausages and hed fed pieces of them to the dogs while theyd swum making them his devoted fans for ever or for however long he had before him was a beautiful woman huddled into an oversized windcheater gazing at him with eyes that were uncertainbut challenging all or nothing her gaze said if i can do it you can do it start again a child a little girl lying by her side he could do this he could step back into its too soon fergus she said gently but surely mollys been dead only these last few months its too soon to even think you can create another family its not replacing he said but for the life of him he couldnt keep the uncertainty out of his voice molly and madisontheyre so different yes but i love you ginny he said ill do whatever it takes you see thats what i dont want she whispered because i dont think that im even ready for that yesterday i thought that maybe i could rejoin the human race i could let myself get attached to madison and the dogs and this community but taking you on what do you mean taking me on he asked startled and she managed a wavering smile you come with your own ghosts she said if i didnt have a mass of my own to deal with then maybe i could help you with yours im not asking you to no butfergus im not denying this love thingthis feeling we have for each other the way you make me feel but it scares me everything scares me come back to me in a year or so when ive learned what loving is again when youve figured out what it means not being mollys dad any more ginny i want you i know but we need to be sensible i dont feel like being sensible he touched her cheek with the back of his hand and she moved into the touch like a magnet finding its north he hesitated but hed gone too far to stop ginny id like to marry you it was a dumb proposal he thought he knew it the moment the words were out of his mouth and he saw her flinch marrying me means taking on madison as your daughter she whispered fergus are you sure you can do that maybe you see theres no maybe about it she said and suddenly she sounded angry she rose backing away from his touch as he rose with her this is a crazy conversation you know its much too soon we hardly know each other we need to go home can you help of course i can help but could he this is what this is all about he thought ginny had a brother and a child and three dogs she couldnt handle them on her own marriage to ginny meant marriage to everything theres a child booster seat in the back of my car ginny said moving on marriage proposal set aside she hesitated richard was uncomfortable in my little car on the way here can we put him in your truck fine but it wasnt fine he wanted to spend more time here he wanted to gather ginny into his arms again and kiss her senseless and make her see reason dogs first she said dr reynard i need your help maybe shed seen where his thoughts were headed regardless shed called him dr reynard for a reason he needed to be practical richard needed care they both needed to move into professional mode they left madison till last the dogs were easy to load into the truck as was the detritus from their picnic richard was harder he woke up when fergus touched his shoulder time to go he said softly and richards face clouded its never time to go he muttered and turned to look at the moon streaming over the lake fergus saw tears slipping down his gaunt face hey richard ginny said and slipped her hand into his there was a moments pause fergus stepped back and left them together letting the moment stretch out how to say goodbye to life but finally richard gave a tiny decisive nod and fergus saw his grip tighten on ginnys hand lets go he said easier said than done he had no strength left to stand they slipped their arms under a shoulder apiece and somehow manoeuvred him into the front passenger seat of ferguss vehicle he should be on a stretcher fergus thought but he also knew it had been important that this night hadnt involved stretchers it did involve oxygen though and it was a fiddle getting everything in the front of the truck richard youre going to have to diet before we come back ginny told him and that got a weary grin but then he winced he wouldnt be in physical pain fergus knew hed been so careful at monitoring medication that he knew there could be little breakthrough but there was more pain than merely physical ginny he whispered and ginny held his hand tight can you put madison in my car while i stay with richard she asked and fergus hesitated richard needed ginny you drive richard home in my truck he said ill follow with madison if youre sure ginny said she looked down into her brothers face maybe we could drive right round the lake miriam will be at home to help you put madison to bed and she trusts you even if she wakes up she did fergus thought she had no choice shed been thrust into a family she didnt know and she had to take what was thrust at her including him thats fine he said and something must have shown in his face because ginny hesitated i dont like ill be fine he said making his voice definite and motioning with his eyes for ginny to say nothing more in richards hearing richard needed this time so badly there was so little time left thanks mate richard whispered and fergus wondered how much he guessed hell so they left and all fergus had to do was lift the sleeping madison into his arms carry her over to the car and lower her gently into the child seat but as he did so she stirred she hardly woke up but she roused enough to know that she was being carried and she knew enough to make herself more secure she sighed a weary sigh of a child whod been through too much and had found no joy at the other side she lifted her arms she twined them around his neck and she huddled tight as if she was finding her security any security he cradled her against him as he carried her to the car and she feltshe felt dont think it its ok sweetheart he whispered into her hair im taking you home to bed home with ginny and your daddy daddy she whispered and the word cut through him like a knife molly somehow he managed the short drive but the knowledge that there was a child right behind him as thered been a child right behind him for the last six years except for three empty months made him feelempty blank like he didnt know how to go on he concentrated on the road ahead kangaroos jumped out of nowhere around here he needed to concentrate i want my mummy the little voice whispered from the back seat and his heart clenched ginny will be home i want my mummy no substitutes he knew how she felt god he knew how she felt that she wasnt molly he pulled into the farmyard and miriam was on the back veranda waiting for him richard and ginny are coming home the long way in my truck he explained theyll be here soon lets get the bairn to bed miriam said accepting things fast for what they were ill pull the sheets back if youll just carry her in will you he began but shed already turned away he opened the car door and unclipped the child harness bedtime he whispered and once again her arms wound round his neck and she clung he carried her up the stairs in silence the whole night was silent the dogs were in the back of his truck being ferried around the lake miriam was out of sight doing what had to be done madison clung and sighed and his heart twisted until he was sure it must break all over again as it had broken the night hed said goodbye to molly how could he think he couldnt he justcouldnt madisons bed was waiting miriam was holding the sheets back ill change her into her pyjamas if she wakes up and needs to go the bathroom she said but it wont hurt her to sleep in what shes in she was in a tiny version of what ginny was wearing soft fleecy pants and windcheater he gazed down at her tiny face and he saw a likeness to ginny fleeting but there family she snuggled her face into the pillow and her arms came out still almost in sleep this was an involuntary movement made maybe every night as a sleeping chid was carried to bed cuddle night she whispered and he had no choice but to put his face down on hers kiss her gently and give her a soft hug she hugged him back she couldnt be mistaking him for her mother now he thought dazed he had a stubbly chin hed smell different hed feel different daddy she whispered and settled back into sleep it was half an hour before ginny arrived we drove right round the far side and watched the moon until richard slept ginny told him slipping silently from the truck and going around the back to release the dogs im sorry you had to wait its ok he said but something about his voice must have changed what is it nothing lets get richard to bed the next few minutes were taken up with the mechanics of getting one very ill man into bed settled rewired im setting up a subcutaneous line fergus told ginny hed watched how much richard hador hadntconsumed during the evening and he knew hed be getting really dehydrated very soon eating and drinking were now too much trouble theyd spoken about this to richard he wanted no heroic rescues or anything as intrusive as nasal gastric feeding but dehydration had been explained to him and hed agreed to fluids when the time came im with you on that one ginny said i talked to him about the need for it this afternoon and he said when you said he needed it then it was fine by him youre his doctor fergus he was and he couldnt walk away now over the next few days hed be back here over and over again but if he had a choice whats changed she said with richard settled theyd walked down to his truck miriam sat up on the veranda watching her charges but she was out of earshot and even if she hadnt been fergus knew that anything he said here would never be repeated this town knew everything about everyone already there was no need for eavesdropping miriam probably knew already what he was about to say right now ginny i cant you cant be with me she whispered i know that i told you i thought fergus youre not thinking she interrupted and she laid her hand on his arm and pressed youre hurting you and i had a wonderful onenight stand that night set things free for me in a way that i could never have imagined but it didnt set you free and my freedom doesnt mean im taking things further with you youre where ive been for years running from encumbrances theres no way ill load you with mine but you fergus im a package deal she said softly and she lifted his hand and held it against her face i thinki think youre a wonderful man a man id love to love but theres lots of things to love in this world and youre only one of them gee thanks he said blankly and she managed a shaky laugh dont mention it its only madison no she said softly its nothing to do with madison you think youd like to be with me if only you didnt have to look at a child again but you dont really want to be with me not hownot how i want to be with you i dont understand he said miserably and she smiled and reached up and kissed him lightly on the lips thats because you havent had an epiphany she whispered i hope one day you have it for your sake somehow youve given it to me an epiphany i used to try and drive away pain by anger she said or work dive into medicine and dont think of anything else and when the world got too grim id go to the gym and kickbox kickbox he stared and she grinned didnt know that about me huh nno puts me in an altogether new light maybe he said faintly and her smile faded look it doesnt matter all im saying is that by loving you i realised that it works i can love again i can make this life work for me i can be happy again even if ive lost yeah but this isnt about you she said what im saying is about me you look at madison and you cringe inside and theres no way you should put yourself in that position we go back to being professional colleagues fergus maybe in a few years youll have your epiphany and maybe ill be sitting in my rocking chair with my knitting and my dogs and ill spend a little part of my pension on another rocking chair so you can sit beside me lie beside me he growled and she chuckled im betting youll be a very sexy octogenarian ginny enough she kissed him again lightly but with purpose we both know this isnt going to happen now for us face it fergus and move on i love you but i dont need you i wish that could make the loneliness better for you but i dont think anything can except maybe time so give it to yourself fergus love walk away chapter eleven richard died eight days later fergus had been back at the house many times in the interim but hed kept his visits relatively formal with ginny with richard hed established something that was as close to a friendship as could be made between people in such disparate circumstances youll look out for ginny for me mate richard had whispered in one of his last few moments of consciousness when fergus had been by his side ginny had been out visiting one of the communitys new mums and had taken madison with her shes playing hardy but when the others died she breaks up inside richard had told him fergus knew what that felt like he thought of a griefstricken ginny and thought if he only had the courage to take ginny to take three dogs to take one little girl ill keep in touch with her fergus said though im not sure you dont have to be sure itll lead anywhere richard whispered and you dont have to be scared either take it from me theres nothing to be afraid of you know a few weeks ago i was terrified but not now ive been given this place ive been given the gift of knowing i have a kid and madisons going to be great great for ginny great for he paused and his gaze turned inward as it did increasingly well who knows who shell be great for but ferguswatch out for her for me i will fergus promised and when tony rang him at two in the morning to say it was over he remembered his promise as he drove through the darkness to what to a deathbed in such circumstances it wasnt even necessary for a doctor to attend richard had been in a coma for the last three days his death had been inevitable the local undertakers could come and do their job without him and fergus could sign the death certificate in the morning but not to go now was unthinkable he pulled into the yard and tony was standing on the veranda waiting for him i knew youd come he said in satisfaction ginny said not to call you but but id said call fergus said almost roughly in truth hed wanted to be here himself at the end but time of death was totally unpredictable and fergus was employed to take care of the needs of the entire community not just one man or one mans sister was it ok at the end he asked there were deaths and deaths hed worked hard to make this one right hed rung a sydney palliative care physician hed doublechecked himself every way please he just slept into it tony reassured him if ginny hadnt been sitting with him holding his hand we wouldnt have known exact time of death he just slipped away ginny shes not here tony said she said she needed to be by herself for a bit she left in the car a couple of minutes ago hell he needed to see the whole picture he needed not to focus just on ginny madison shes sound asleep we thought we wouldnt wake her no you want me to call the undertaker theres time fergus said he checked richards body but it had been like tony had said hed just slipped away leaving his body like an outer husk of what had once been there a peaceful death can you stay on a bit longer he asked tony and tony smiled and shrugged we agreed this was a part of our regular shift work madisons on the books as well as richard im on duty until seven ginny will be back by then youll go and find her tony asked and fergus could see that he was troubled you think i should i think you should the big nurse told him mate i think you have to she was in the boatshed hed guessed she would be but even so it was a relief when he pulled into the clearing and saw her car the door of the boatshed was open he pushed it wide and saw her she was at the other door sitting on the ramp which slid down into the water she wasnt moving for a moment he thought she was in control simply sitting staring out over the lake but then her shoulders heaved with a convulsive sob and he moved like a shot from a gun kneeling gathering her into his arms holding her pulling her against his chest taking the brunt of the wrenching sobs as she wept her heart out for the brother shed loved she wept and wept until it seemed she could weep no more and then she subsided against him spent he kissed the top of her head and she shuddered a long racking shudder that seemed to go right through her and then she pulled herself away from him her face was almost colourless in the moonlight almost deathlike youre never ready she whispered and he nodded no i thought that this would be different you love richard how can a loss of a love be anything less than that oh god he couldnt bear it he couldnt bear it for her and here she was opening herself up again for future pain shed taken on madison shed taken on three dogs shed take him on if he only could he couldnt he stared down into her face and the grief he saw was a reflection of the pain that had torn him apart for months to take on more she saw it and she withdrew just a little just enough to show that shed get past this she knew it the control was there ready to slip down she might hurt as much as shed done before but maybe shed learned that shed survive a lesson he hadnt learned yet thank you for coming she whispered i shouldnt have neededbut i did of course you did see thats the problem she managed ill always need thats why she shook her head as if ridding herself of a bad dream and tried to struggle to her feet he was before her lifting her supporting her as she made her knees firm under her im fine thank you for being here for me fergus ill go back to the house now i need to get the undertaker before morning i dont want madison to be awake when she took a deep breath theres things need doing let me help you youve done enough she told him you gave richard the best medical care possible more you gave him friendship but you have nine weeks left in this place she told him i understand you came here to get away fromstrings if you wanted to leave now i could understand what was she saying leave everything including his medicine i signed a contract yes but im available to be medical officer for the district now not yet he told her finally finding some ground he was sure of you need time to adjust madison needs time maybe she said but maybe not this is a new life maybe all we need to do is jump right in but not tonight he said roughly grasping her arms she stared down at his hands on her forearms and then very gently she pulled away yes tonight she whispered thats all there is to do jump right back in at the deep end tonight luckily for fergus the next two days were extraordinarily busy the medical scene was hotting upmostly as the surrounding community realised there was a real doctor who could give real consultations and they didnt have to travel to say he was beginning to be overwhelmed was an understatement i cant leave all this to ginny he growled to miriam the morning of richards funeral and she smiled and shrugged before you we had no one and we coped were blessed that ginnys agreed to stay here do you think well stand by and see her worked into the ground but she wont say no he growled i know her look out in my waiting room who would i say no to well protect her miriam said gently youll go back to your life and well get on with ours with ginny and never the twain shall meet why did that hurt meanwhile you have a queue of six patients dr reynard just make sure im clear for the funeral at two he muttered and she nodded of course as i said we do look after our own im not your own while youre going to richards funeral yes you are hed thought the funeral would be tiny it was anything but the church itself was tiny an ancient grey stone building covered with a mass of briar roses that almost buried it miriam and fergus drove up together having stopped on the way to check on ginny were fine shed told them shed been sitting on the back step dressed in a flowery chintzy dress that hadnt looked in the least like a funeral and she had been holding onto madison dressed in much the same way the undertakers picking us up let us take you fergus had urged but shed shaken her head madison and i are family well do this by ourselves shed looked defiant and brave and only the pallor of her face had given away the true way she was feeling and now shell have to face the whole community fergus said as they pulled up at the church alone shes not alone miriam said the undertaker is sam leith and he went to school with ginnys dad this is where she belongs were her people she gazed around the car park therell be some who are here simply out of curiosity she grimaced as she saw oscar in a wheelchair with a group of half a dozen residents of the nursing home many of the oldies will be here because they knew ginny and richards grandparents and parents many will be sympathetic though theres always a few who think a funerals a good excuse for an outing and a free drink or six and then theres oscar she went on before fergus could interrupt and ask hell be here because he hates the family did you know ginnys mother refused to marry him wise woman anyway its always rankled and hell be pleased another vientals dead but hes an exception most of this community will be here because they know ginny wants to stay herethat shes decided she belongs but its so soon hed pulled into the last available parking space behind the church and now he was looking back along the road to where a stream of cars was still arriving and madison should she be coming ginny talked to the child psychiatrist miriam said as if this had been a major source of discussion she said itd make it much easier for madison later on if she has some shadowy memory of whats happening ginny and richard brought her together to her mothers funeral judith and richard will be buried side by side itll give madison some sort of link but today is going to be hard for both of them miriam agreed if shed let me be there you know maybe she would miriam said softly but if she let youwould you stay i dont know what you mean i think you know perfectly well what i mean she retorted if ginny lets herself lean on you now shes going to need you for always thats not what you want now is it no he said at leasti dont think so by the time they walked into the church the place was packed people were being directed to the hall next door where a video link had been set up but as they made to turn away the usher called them back theres a pew for the medical staff who treated richard he said second from the front on the left so fergus sat between miriam and tony and bridget the organ was playing gentle waiting music the church was hushed out the front was the coffin burnished oak and beautiful loaded with the same wild roses that covered the church the last funeral hed been to the coffin had been so much smaller there was a touch on his hand and he looked down and miriams broad palm was covering his hang in there kid she told him and he looked at her in wonder how much could be read on his face hed come to cradle lake to hide how could he hide here she shouldnt be bringing madison he whispered miserable that he hadnt been able to talk about this with ginny but every attempt at contact over the last days had been met with a gentle thank you fergus were fine we need to start as we mean to go onmadison and me let us do this on our own shes bringing madison miriam whispered i told you the child psychiatrist talked her through it they have a plan a plan the idea should have made him feel better it didnt then a stir at the back of the church made him turn sam the undertaker was there and ginny and madison and dogs three dogs all garlanded with flowers wearing garlands woven ropes of flowers of every description ginny and madison were bedecked with flowers too the flowers of their dresses augmented with the gay garlands round their necks madison had a circlet of roses in her hair woman and child dogs and flowers the church gasped as one in they came ginny had the whippet and the collietwiggy and snapperand madison held the smaller bounce as if this was a very serious responsibility the two girls and three dogs made their way in dignified style down the aisle behind the greysuited undertaker there was a momentary pause as snapper decided to cock a leg on a pewhe was clearly only at the beginning of dignified dog behaviour training there was no consternation however sam was carrying a vast armful of flowers posies and wreaths of all description snapper paused ginny paused madison sucked her breath in with fouryearold indignation and said bad dog snapper but clearly this eventuality had been rehearsed ginny simply lifted a pile of flowers from sams arms and laid the pile over snappers spot more flowers in a church that was redolent with flowers the congregation giggled that set the flavour of the entire ceremony richard had had friends for these last few weeks hed wanted to be alone and hed asked them not to come but they were here in force now celebrating his life as ginny had obviously agreed that they should there was musicfabulous music there were people telling wonderful stories of the richard theyd known and obviously loved there was a boy maybe only sixteen accompanied by his parents whod met richard in hospital some years before and who spoke of the way richard had made him see that a life with cystic fibrosis could be a great life short didnt necessarily mean empty short just meant stacking more in living for every moment living for now and then ginny and madison rose accompanied by their dogs its time to say goodbye to richard ginny said softly your friend my brother madisons daddy she smiled gently at the little girl whose hand she was holding madison do you want to say what happens now we bury the shell madison said holding on for dear life to bounces collar with one hand and ginny with the other but her clear little voice reached out through the sound system and filled the church my daddy and my mummy were in shells like snails she looked up at ginny for reassurance but she kept gamely on weve all got shells she said like snails my mummy said ive got a pretty one with nice hair and bounce has got a fuzzy one with stiff hair like a hearth brush my mummy said we have to enjoy every minute of being in our shells she said we should stay in our shells till we get really really old and probably thats whatll happen to me and ginny and bounce and snapper and twiggy but sometimes we get sick like my mummy and daddy and we come out of our shell early ginny says thats ok she thinks my mummy and daddy might have found a new shell together thats sad cos we dont know where that new shell is but we still have to bury the old shell and thats what we do now what child psychologist had worked their wonder here fergus wondered dazed what medical textbook did this come from judith and ginny between them madisons mother and madisons new mother two redoubtable women there was a sniff beside him and the clutch on his hand tightened oh fergus miriam quavered and he would have given her his handkerchief but he needed it himself thats what we have to do ginny said softly into the hushedexcept for sniffingsilence we need to say goodbye to richard and bury his shell a guitaristone of richards friendsstarted to play six more of richards friends separated from the congregation to act as pallbearers and ginny and madison and dogs led the way out into the sunshine it was over afterwards refreshments were served in the church hall it was more like a party than a wake fergus thought he couldnt get near ginny he stayed for more than an hour an outsider watching in the end he was almost desperate for a medical emergency to draw him away but his beeper stayed silent and he couldnt leave he justcouldnt so he stayed and he watched as ginny smiled her way through the afternoon greeting people over and over listening to anecdotes of richards life being polite trying desperately not to sway with weariness he could see exhaustion seeping in but there was nothing he could do about it the only time he approached her her smile had slipped and shed said with something akin to desperation go away fergus i dont need you i cant please just go away so hed gone away but not far hed made small talk to other people and hed tried not to look at her instead hed watched madison it had been an extraordinary performance he thought recalling the way shed spoken to everyone in the church for a fouryearold to speak like that she was the only child of a single mother and he recognised the result judith must have talked to this little one as an equal she must have needed madison almost as much as madison had needed her the result was a child who was older than her years but she could still revert tonys children were here and others richards friends were in the age group who had young children and there were maybe a score of youngsters in the hall doing what kids do when grownups were boring amusing themselves the overflow of flowers had been brought in here set up in vast urns or simply lain in fabulous colourful piles around the walls looking at madisons garland in envy some of the older children had set up a cottage industry the older ones had taught the younger ones and now the funeral flowers were being made into daisy chains daisy chains with a difference instead of daisies every single flower imaginable was put into use the children made garlands for themselves and then they moved on to parents and aunts and uncles and friends and finally every single person in the hall was being decorated with richards flowers it was fantastic fergus thought and the remembrance of his own little girl slipped back molly would have loved this molly whod slipped from her shell too soon but shed had a wonderful life as the afternoon settled so too did a part of his pain madisons words echoed over and over in his heart we have to enjoy every minute of being in our shells these children were doing just that making flower garlands from funeral flowers he watched madison intent on her flowers too old for her years she was intent now on reverting to childhood enjoying every minute of her time he could help he could its a pity you cant stay on in the valley an elderly lady was telling him you know this place is calling out for two doctors you and our ginnyd make a ripper medical team yes we would fergus thought but it wasnt just the medical concept he was thinking of it was as if the fog hed been moving in for the last few months was lifting and outside the fog was life well have to think about it he said absently to his conversation partner madison had just completed her garland and he wanted to see what she did with it shed been lying full length on the floor totally committed to the job at hand now she looked up scanning the hall looking to see which of the adults were not yet decorated most were the older children were working faster than the littlies and the production line was becoming efficient ginny was wearing no less than six garlands fergus had two the lady he was talking to had three at the far end of the hall the men had set up a bar he watched as madison searched the crowd looking for a bare neck oscar he was in a wheelchair soaking up the free booze what was the man doing here fergus though in irritation madison started to move toward him fergus moved to intercept he didnt trust doc if youre not going to stay at least tell us where youll be practising in the city the lady beside him said and she grasped his arm as he tried to move away my daughter lives in sydney and her doctors terrible last week she had three children down with chickenpox and could she get her doctor to do a house call i dont think so and the migraines she gets you have no idea her grip on his arm was insistent fergus was too late to stop madison shes already reached oscar let the man be gracious he thought let him accept his garland and get on with his drinking the garland caught oscar by surprise because he was in a wheelchair madison could reach she simply slipped up behind him and the garland plopped over his head he spilled his beer swore and swivelled what happened next fergus couldnt tell he was too far away to hear but the man grabbed the child by the arm hauled her up so his face was right in hers and spat words at her that made her blench and then he almost threw her aside others were closer than fergus tony reached her first sweeping her up as one of his own hugging her letting her bury her face in his shoulder and carrying her back to ginny that should be me fergus thought struggling through the crowd and the surge of certainty was so great that he felt almost overwhelmed by it it was as much as he could do not to haul over there and grab the little girl from tonys arms but she needed ginny already ginny had gained her trust and when tony reached her ginny held out her arms and madison crumpled into them and sobbed her heart out there was nothing for fergus to do except he was right by oscar now hardly aware how hed got there what the hell did you say to her nothing oscar muttered and held up his empty glass get me another bloody kid spilled my drink there was a nurse close bya girl whod come with the six nursinghome residents she moved forward unsure and fergus motioned her closer i want mr bentley back in the nursing home he said through gritted teeth now you cant tell me the only reason youre not being prosecuted for cruelty to animals is that you pleaded disability fergus snapped the inspectors spoke to me and i was forced to confirm it but if youre well enough to attend funerals if youre well enough to get drunk on free beer and to abuse young children then youre well enough to stand trial over neglected horses and dogs and sheep you wouldnt watch me fergus said through gritted teeth he glanced up and found miriam miriam could you arrange mr bentleys transportation now im on it now doctor miriam told him grabbing oscars wheelchair and propelling it toward the door with savagery the hospitals downhill from here permission to stand at the door and push they didnt know what had been said to the child no one had caught it whatever it had been though it was as if madisons fragile shell had been shattered she was limp and unresponsive in ginnys arms and her bravado had disappeared completely this was the madison of three weeks ago i need to take her home ginny said and fergus agreed ill take you sam has the official car at the door ginny said gently fergus leave us be please we need to start as we mean to go on with ginny and madison gone the wake was over ferguss cellphone rang and it was a woman from ginnys antenatal class with a threatened early labour im only twentyeight weeks she quavered into the phone oh doctor we want this baby so much of course she did fergus thought grimly as he climbed into his truck and returned to medicine why wouldnt you want a baby why wouldnt you want a child it was as if the medical needs of the community had been put on hold for the funeral and wake and now with it over the queue was suddenly enormous fergus tried his best to stabilise the young woman and then bailed out calling in the air ambulance to transport her to sydney maybe his efforts to stop the labour were enough but maybe they werent and prem babies had a habit of coming in a hurry in sydney a twentyeightweek baby had a chance here there were no facilities for premies if we had two doctors here he thought but he got no further than that as his phone was running hot a cow had stood on a foot a urinary tract infection had suddenly become unbearable someone was drunk and drifting in and out of unconsciousness and the local policeman wanted him checked before letting him sleep it off in the cells ginny would have to cope with this alone when he left he thought as he worked on into the evening plus shed need time with madison madison needed a huge commitment if she was to revert to the little girl she should be the vision of her in church stayed with him a tiny girl whod held the responsibilities of the world on her shoulders what had oscar said to her to make her disintegrate he didnt go near oscar hes fine tony told him settled back into his bed with a selfsatisfied smirk why he had it in for that family its going to be hard for ginny to have to keep caring for him here fergus said and tony grinned yeah well theres a few of us have been thinking we reckon oscars asthma makes him needful of a nursing home where theres roundtheclock access to a doctor this place doesnt qualify we need to declare hes too sick to stay here a nursing home in sydney would be much more suitable wouldnt you say doctor what the hell did he say to madison i dont know tony admitted his face growing grim then he shrugged i hope ginny can defuse it whatever it was meanwhile mate theres another call sevenyearold mathew torney he fell out of the top bunk and his mother thinks hes dislocated his shoulder but ginny some of richards friends were going back to the house tony said gently mate we cant do anything there any more you know that no a child with a dislocated shoulder medicine hell it was midnight before fergus finished work he walked out of the hospital and hesitated he so wanted to go to ginny shed be exhausted she hadnt slept for days she wouldnt need him tonight but tomorrow he said into the night tomorrow please the call came at two in the morning hed been staring at the ceiling and it was as if hed been expecting it he lifted the receiver and when he heard ginnys voice at the end of the line maybe it was as if hed expected that too fergus ginny he said softly love fergus help the tension slammed into him as he heard her fear he heard her terror what is it i say it he said strongly ridding his voice of all emotion making it curt and businesslike whats happening its madison whats wrong with madison shes disappeared five minutes later he pulled up at the farmhouse ginny was waiting standing at the gate staring hopelessly down the road fergus emerged from his truck and ginny walked straight into his arms chapter twelve after the funeral the little girl had been wan and listless saying nothing and nothing ginny could say had broken through richards friends had been there back at the house wanting to sit on his veranda wanting to feel close to him and shed been hamstrung theyd driven for hours to be theresome having come from interstate she hadnt been able to send them away so shed cuddled madison until shed slept at seven when madison had seemed deeply asleep shed tucked her into her own bed and shed checked her every halfhour or so at a little after one am the last of richards friends had said goodbye ginny had walked into the house to find madisons bed empty well have people searching from one side of the valley to the other within half an hour ben cross the police sergeant had been there within minutes of being called and was now in organisation mode youre sure the people who were here were ok none of them could have i dont know ginny whispered appalled beyond belief they were richards friends there were about twenty of them some of them i know but some id never seen before i was so careful i was so worried hey ginny fergus said and hugged her tighter against him this is not your fault love lets just focus on finding madison lets think she wouldnt run away would she where would she go if she ran i dont know there were car lights coming up the hill two cars three four bens calls for help were being answered in spades she seemed almost happy today we talked and talked she was so wonderful at the funeral and then oscar we all saw that ben muttered not bothering to hide his distress what did he say to her she wouldnt tell me ginny whispered maybe its time we found out fergus put ginny at arms length and held her gaze love there are people coming to help search bens here i think the most important thing i can do is to go and talk to oscar wrong his heart was saying the most important thing he could do was to hold on to ginny for ever and ever and ever but if he was to rebuild a family for them all then he had to gather the family members together madison was part of his family he knew that in his heart maybe hed always known it ill be back as soon as i can he told ginny but i need to go oscar was sleeping the sleep of the pure of heart his asthma had receded the last few weeks of regular meals and limited alcohol had improved his health he was sleeping in a single room with a view over the valley toward the farm hed neglected for years and where half his stock had needed to be put down yet no conscience kept him awake hes a patient fergus told himself and somehow he refrained from shaking the man awake and shouting instead he switched on the nightlight behind the bed touched him lightly on the shoulder and sat down in the visitors chair waiting for him to wake gently he was doing very well he thought in some abstract part of him that was able to be dispassionate the doctor part of him congratulated the part of him that wasnt anything to do with his medicine the nonabstract part the part of him that loved ginny andmadison but oscar was waking up what do you want the big mans voice was slurred with sleep and the aftereffects of the alcohol hed drunk the previous afternoon you wake a man up in the middle of the night to do your bloody tests im not here for tests mr bentley fergus said still in that strange voice that was all professional and not personal in the least i need to know what you said to madison at the funeral today madison richard vientals little girl the kid he said his face clearing the viental kid thats right still that detached tone good he told himself very good no anger no shouting when she tried to put the flowers round your neckwhat did you say to her his face darkened she spilled my drink she did fergus agreed id be guessing that made you pretty angry a mans got to have a drink he bloody does oscar said bloody nurses it was good of ginny to put on free beer for the men today fergus said thoughtfully and he watched oscars face change her i shouldnt have drunk her beer why not shes a viental they should all be dead by now why still the conversational tone somehow theyve got this bloody disease that woman i asked her to marry me you know this bloody womans mother my farms four times as big as bloody dave vientals and she chose him made me a laughing stock i used to see em every time i walked up to the ridge playing happy families poor as blasted church mice and being he sucked in his breath on an angry hiss anyway when the first kid died i thought great this is how it ought to be she chose misery over me she could suffer the consequences then the next kid died and dave took off you know what i did then i went over there cap in hand and said you know what mary im a big man i can let bygones be bygones well ship the girl off to school in the city and the other boyll soon be dead we can start over the way its supposed to be and you know what she stood there staring at me like i was a lunatic and then she started laughing she laughed and laughed and laughed like it was so hysterical she couldnt stop and then that bloody girl came out and grabbed her arm and said come on mum you need to rest and that was that i went home and i vowed id never go to that side of the ridge again until every last one of them was dead every last one somehow fergus stayed silent somehow the medical side of himthe part of him that could suggest a diagnosis of obsessive paranoia of a solitary man stuck in the groove of hate for over thirty yearscould force the other part of him to shut up and now richards dead he said conversationally and oscar nodded good riddance but ginnyand madison theyll have it he said and his hatred sounded awful in the stillness of the night theyll both have this cystic thing her brothers are all dead she will be soon and this last onerichardwill have passed it on to the kid im sorry to have to disappoint you fergus was amazing himself his voice was almost gentle neither ginny or madison have cystic fibrosis yeah but they will no he said and his voice was suddenly harsher than hed intended you need two cystic fibrosis genes to be ill ginny has one cystic fibrosis gene that means if she marries someone with a matching gene then she might have an ill child but she herself wont get ill madisons clear shes totally free a normal little girl with a life expectancy of eighty or more but her mother her mother died of cardiomyopathy its an infection of the heart like the flu madisons no more likely to die of it that you are there was a moments silence then oscars breath whistled in through his lips in an angry gasp as he accepted ferguss words for fact then theyll live yes with me fergus thought and the thought was a good one it was reassuring in the awfulness of what he was listening to please he thought i just need to get him to tell me so what happened at the funeral to make you angry at madison he asked and oscars fingers clenched into fists on the coverlet made me sick what made you sick all that crap about the vientals everywherepeople saying what a shame it was how all the kids had died and how shes coming back here now and the kids staying with her and wont it be great and then that stuff about shells she thinks my mummy and daddy might have found a new shell together he said mimicking madisons tone and words from the funeral and fergus winced that was what i told her i told her it was crap what did you tell her fergus demanded and if he forgot to keep his voice even it wasnt for want of trying he thought back to that fragment of timea little girl slipping a garland of flowers over this mans head the spilled drink the fury the grabbing hauling her up spitting the words at her thered have been time for so little before onlookers intervened what could he have said in that short interval just oscar said and paused just fergus was holding his breath he was trying so hard to contain himself that he felt sick just what oscar your mother hasnt found a shell he spat lying back on the bed and repeating his words with relish your mother died in the car shell be rotting in the ground or if there is anything afterwards shell be stuck on the road outside the football ground whinging about her lost lover for ever he didnt hit him somehow fergus backed out of the ward and closed the door then leaned against the wall of the hospital corridor feeling ill such hate in the middle of tragedy to hold such hate to yourself when there was room to move on he thought suddenly of molly his precious little girl beaming up to him at bedtime winding her arms around his neck and kissing him goodnight there was room to move on you should move on because not to he had to move on he walked out of the hospital thinking fiercely trying not to muddle thoughts of the future with what needed to be done now he stood in the car park and let his gaze wander around the moonlit valley the football ground lay to the north about a half of the way round from the hospital or a quarter of the way round from ginnys farm at night the lights would be on for player practice lets assume madison heard those words of oscars and took them to heart shell be stuck on the road outside the football ground madison could see the football ground from ginnys farm it wasnt very clear during the day but at night it was lit up like a beacon madison would have a very clear idea of where it was but the lake was six miles round and the way from ginnys farm was rough there was a better road lower on the lake shore but the road from ginnys was a milk run designed to take in every farm thered be dogs along the road fergus thought hauling his phone out and starting to dial there were people searching already but they were searching the bushland around the farm and the lake below they were also following the main road back this way thinking that she might have tried to head back to wherever she thought of as home his gut twisted at the thought madison madison and ginny ginny answered at the first ring her voice tight with strain and hope and terror its ok love he told her i think i know where shes gone let me talk to sergeant cross how i talked to oscar he told her lets not get our hopes up too far but i think were searching in the wrong place and ten minutes later they found her ginny was in the police car ben cross should have been delegating he should have been organising others but those others would take time to get back from where they were searching to try again much easier to pile into the police car put the lights on high beam and head along the track to the football ground and there she was at first ginny thought she was imagining ita sliver of light fading into the shadows at the side of the road the moment the headlights lit the road after a curve but ben had seen it too and he slammed on the brakes and was out of the car before her madison ginny called but there was no answer but ben had his huge flashlight and he was searching the undergrowth beside the road there it was again that flash of white the cotton of the little girls nightie ben was through the undergrowth using his body as a bulldozer reaching he had her lifting her out of the bushes as one would lift a terrified animal he handed her to ginny and madison held herself rigid in her arms madison ginny managed trying to hug her close sweetheart youre safe i want my mummy madison whimpered and the tiny body stayed rigid shes not here he said there was the sound of another car coming fast headlights the car slowing as it reached them and stopping fergus climbing from the car his face slack with relief youve found her just about where you said she would be ben said looking worriedly at the small girl in ginnys arms this was no happy ending i want my mummy madison whispered again and shoved against ginnys body ginnys face crumpled in distress and fergus reached forward let me take her he said and he lifted her from ginnys arms and held her close brooking no opposition hed held molly when shed been like this when shed been cross with him which hadnt been all that often when doctors had been running tests and shed started to be distressed molly his face touched this little girls hair his mouth brushing the top of her head in a feather kiss he sat on the ground even though it was rough and gravelled and not exactly the place to sit and he motioned ginny to sit with him ben had kids of his own he knew enough to stand back to give them time ill radio off the search he said and disappeared into the police car mummy madison was still rigid but ferguss grasp was firm and solid using his body to cradle hers willing warmth into the shivering child your mummys not here he said to madison you know that the man said she hiccuped on a sob he said i know what he said but he was wrong fergus said in the tone of someone who wasnt to be argued with ginny told you what happened to your mummy ginnys not a mummy beside him he heard ginny draw in her breath and he felt her body stiffen but she didnt move away she was sitting next to him so close that her body touched his it felt good it feltright and it gave him the courage to say what needed to be said right now ginnys not a mummy yet he said soft and firm and sure but shes very very close to being a mummy and shes a doctor she knows whats right and whats wrong much more than the silly man who didnt want flowers around his neck he said we know what he said but he was wrong he was feeling tired and crabby and hed spilled his drink so he said something that he didnt mean just to make you feel bad but you know where your mummy is madison you know shes not in the car she is no fergus said and ginnys hand was suddenly covering one of his the one that she could see as he hugged the little girl tight you know how i know im a daddy daddies know things daddies know that anyway whose daddy are you she asked and he winced knowing hed opened up yet another avenue madison might find distressing but suddenly the words were there and he knew what had to be said i was mollys daddy he said softly he hesitated but it might as well be said it was what was in his heart molly doesnt need me anymore he whispered but i think that you do if you like if you want me to ill be your daddy maybe it was wrong he thought maybe it was too soon after richard but madisons relationship with richard had been fleeting for ginny to say to her now that shed be her mother would be cruel and confusing but to give her a daddy it could give her roots he thought hugging her tighter and then he thought it could give him roots youre the doctor madison whispered in a voice tinged with doubt youre not a daddy i am a daddy as well as a doctor he said evenly and i love your ginny ive been thinking if its ok with you i think we might be a family ive lost my family ginnys lost her family and youve lost your mummy if we came together i think we could make a really good new family all of us you and me and ginny and bounce and twiggy and snapper we could all live together in ginnys lovely house and we could stay together for ever there was a long silence ginnys hand had lifted away in shock it stayed lifted but suddenly it returned ginnys hand rested on his warm and sure and true and her other hand came up to touch madisons soft hair that sounds really good madison she whispered and she smiled at fergus in the moonlight as she said it fergus has come up with a really good idea what do you think ill never find my mummy the little girl whispered and something in her voice told fergus that this was necessary grief madison was letting go you know where your mummys shell is buried ginny was saying smoothing down the tousled hair and moving closer so her own body was lending warmth to the child well take flowers to the cemetery every time we want and if you stand on her grave then ill bet she can hear us when we tell her things like telling her im going to live with snapper and twiggy and bounce exactly there was a long silence while madison thought this through the whole world seemed to hold its breath waiting for a verdict then out of the silence a shattering sob my mummys never coming back no fergus whispered she isnt and with that it seemed the dam wall broke madison whod hardly cried these last awful weeks whod been selfcontained rigid older than her years sobbed and sobbed and sobbed they let her cry her heart out sitting together on the verge of a gravel road in the middle of nowhere while one sensible policeman held his peace stayed back let them do what they willed and finally the sobs eased and when they did madison was curled against ferguss chest as if she belonged there which was how it should be he thought it was how it must be from this day forth ok madison fergus whispered as the sobs eased to nothing he rose lifting her in his arms but still holding her tight against him and ginny rose with them lets take you home home madison whispered clinging close to my own bed that ginny said was mine with ginny with snapper and with twiggy and with bounce lets not forget me fergus said trying to keep his voice steady im part of this family too madison opened her eyes at that very wide still tearfilled but gazing at him and then at ginny she was completely limp now trusting them to do with her as they willed and me she said her bottom lip wobbled a little but then she regained her composure ginny and twiggy and snapper and bounce andand daddy and me andmy name is maddy chapter thirteen four oclock in the morning time for all sensible people to be in bed maddy had fallen asleep in the car on the way home the searchers had all been thanked and had gone home the police sergeant had officially watched maddy be put to bed hed surreptitiously wiped away a tear and issued a stern warning to watch over her and hed left as well the dogs had settled after the excitement ginny and fergus were sitting on the veranda steps looking out over the lake you realise this means you have to marry me fergus said and ginny blinked thats moving pretty fast maddy needs fast i need fast do you have any objections no she said and he turned and kissed her and nothing else was said for a very long time when finally there was room for speech again ginny snuggled her head down under his chinthere was a warm little spot right in the curve of his throat where she sort of fittedand tried to think this thing through um fergus about marriage tomorrow he said or maybe today if we can swing it is there a time frame i think its a month thats too long we need a shotgun wedding is gretna green too far or vegas i hear they do great weddings in vegas elvis and everything no elvis i want dogs as my bridal attendants she said serenely vegas involves quarantine rats her chuckle faded fergus are you sure i dont know anything about quarantine about me stoopid she said and felt his body chuckle in response this must be what paradise felt like she thought home home was where the heart was home was here i dont think i can have children she whispered why not im a carrier for cystic fibrosis and im not he replied after we had molly i was tested for every genetic problem under the sun you need two cf genes to make a cf baby and we only have one between us no she said and tried to focus through the hazy blissful bubble she was in but any baby of mine has a fifty per cent chance of being a carrier like me then well get them tested he said well teach them what cf involves and how they need to get their own partner tested its not fair to keep this thing going there was a moments pause you meanyou dont want to have children because your child might carry a gene and he or she might meet someone else with a gene and they might then have children with cf thats crazy its not crazy it is crazy he said pulling her against him and kissing her hair its like banning buses because they kill people our babies have the potential to be absolutely fantastic people he smirked your looks and my intelligence she punched him seriously he said and spent a little more time kissing her to show her just how serious he was ginny our marriage will be fantastic you and i will be a team providing this valley with a medical service theyve only dreamed about doctors are afraid of being lone practitioners but this valley could use a multidoctor service im betting once we set up a viable service well attract more as for us well employ a wonderful ruddyfaced housekeeper and well restore this house to what it ought to bea family home well buy dog food in bulk well take in orphan lambs i intend to grow tomatoes because ive always fancied growing tomatoes well give our maddy the best childhood a child could ever wish for and if a lovely brother or sister appears to complete the picture then well say thank you very much what do you say to that ginny viental my gorgeous dr viental my dearest love id say it sounds like a pipe dream ginny said and she couldnt keep the tears from her voice it sounds like a fairytale happy ending a happy beginning he said roughly and started kissing her again just watch this space dreams come true ginny love life holds promise im a surgeon and i should know im starting operating right now operation family dreams dont come true she whispered but she didnt sound sure and she loved it that he laughed and kissed her still more deeply yes they do he whispered operation family
