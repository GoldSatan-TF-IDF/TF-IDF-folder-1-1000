ian rankin a question of blood book in the inspector rebus series in memoriam st leonard s cid ita res accendent lumina rebus anonymous we find no prospect of an end james hutton scientist day one tuesday theres no mystery detective sergeant siobhan clarke said herdman lost his marbles thats all she was sitting by a hospital bed in edinburgh s recently opened royal infirmary the complex was to the south of the city in an area called little france it had been built at considerable expense on open space but already there were complaints about a lack of useable space inside and carparking space outside siobhan had found a spot eventually only to discover that she would be charged for the privilege this much she had told detective inspector john rebus on her arrival at his bedside rebuss hands were bandaged to the wrists when shed poured him some tepid water hed cupped the plastic glass to his mouth drinking carefully as she watched see hed chided her afterwards didnt spill a drop but then hed spoiled the act by letting the cup slip as he tried to maneuver it back on to the bedside table the rim of its base hit the floor siobhan snatching it on the first bounce good catch rebus had conceded no harm done it was empty anyway since then shed been making what both of them knew was small talk skirting questions she was desperate to ask and instead filling him in on the slaughter in south queensferry three dead one wounded a quiet coastal town just north of the city a private school taking boys and girls from ages five to eighteen enrollment of six hundred now minus two the third body belonged to the gunman whod turned his weapon on himself no mystery as siobhan had said except for the why he was like you she was saying exarmy i mean they reckon thats why he did it grudge against society rebus noticed that her hands were now being kept firmly in the pockets of her jacket he guessed they were clenched and that she didnt know she was doing it the papers say he ran a business he said he had a powerboat used to take out waterskiers but he had a grudge she shrugged rebus knew she was wishing there was a place for her at the scene anything to take her mind off the other inquiryinternal this time and with her at its core she was staring at the wall above his head as if there were something there she was interested in other than the paintwork and an oxygen outlet you havent asked me how im feeling he said she looked at him how are you feeling im going stircrazy thank you for asking youve only been in one night feels like more what do the doctors say nobodys been to see me yet not today whatever they tell me im out of here this afternoon and then what how do you mean you cant go back to work finally she studied his hands howre you going to drive or type a report what about taking phone calls ill manage he looked around him his turn now to avoid eye contact surrounded by men much his age and sporting the same grayish pallor the scots diet had taken its toll on this lot no doubt about it one guy was coughing for want of a cigarette another looked like he had breathing problems the overweight swollenlivered mass of local manhood rebus held up one hand so he could rub a forearm over his left cheek feeling the unshaven rasp the bristles he knew would be the same silvered color as the walls of his ward ill manage he repeated into the silence lowering the arm again and wishing he hadnt raised it in the first place his fingers sparked with pain as the blood pounded through them have they spoken to you he asked about what come on siobhan she looked at him unblinking her hands emerged from their hiding place as she leaned forwards on the chair ive another session this afternoon who with the boss meaning detective chief superintendent gill templer rebus nodded satisfied that as yet it wasnt going any higher what will you say to her he asked theres nothing to tell i didnt have anything to do with fairstones death she paused another unasked question hanging between them did you she seemed to be waiting for rebus to say something but he stayed silent shell want to know about you siobhan added how you ended up in here i scalded myself rebus said its stupid but thats what happened i know thats what you say happened no siobhan its what happened ask the doctors if you dont believe me he looked around again always supposing you can find one probably still combing the grounds for a parking space the joke was weak enough but rebus smiled anyway she was letting him know she wouldnt be pressing him any further his smile was one of gratitude whos in charge at south queensferry he asked her signaling a change of subject i think di hogans out there bobbys a good guy if it can be wrapped up fast hell do it media circus by all accounts grant hoods been drafted in to handle liaison leaving us shortchanged at st leonard s rebus was thoughtful all the more reason for me to get back there especially if im suspended you wont be you said it yourself siobhanyou didnt have anything to do with fairstone way i see it it was an accident now that something biggers come along maybe itll die a natural death so to speak an accident she was repeating his words he nodded slowly so dont worry about it unless of course you really did top the bastard john there was a warning in her tone rebus smiled again and managed a wink only joking he said i know damned fine who gills going to want to see in the frame for fairstone he died in a fire john and that means i killed him rebus held up both hands turning them this way and that scalds siobhan thats all just scalds she rose from the chair if you say so john then she stood in front of him while he lowered his hands biting back the sudden rush of agony a nurse was approaching saying something about changing his dressings im just going siobhan informed her then to rebus id hate to think youd do something so stupid and imagine it was on my behalf he started shaking his head slowly and she turned and walked away keep the faith siobhan he called after her that your daughter the nurse asked making conversation just a friend someone i work with you something to do with the church rebus winced as she started unpeeling one of his bandages what makes you say that the way you were talking about faith job like mine you need more than most he paused but then maybe its the same for you me she smiled her eyes on her handiwork she was short and plainlooking and businesslike cant hang around waiting for faith to do anything for you so how did you manage this she meant his blistered hands i got into hot water he explained feeling a bead of sweat beginning its slow journey down one temple pain i can handle he thought to himself the problem was everything else can we switch to something lighter than bandages you keen to be on your way keen to pick up a cup without dropping it or a phone he thought besides theres got to be someone out there needs the bed more than i do very publicminded im sure well have to see what the doctor says and which doctor would that be just have a bit of patience eh patience the one thing he had no time for maybe youll have some more visitors the nurse added he doubted it no one knew he was here except siobhan hed got one of the staff to call her so she could tell templer that he was taking a sick day maybe two at the most thing was the call had brought siobhan running maybe hed known it would maybe thats why hed phoned her rather than the station that had been yesterday afternoon yesterday morning hed given up the fight and walked into his gps office the doctor filling in had taken one look and told him to get himself to a hospital rebus had taken a taxi to a ampe embarrassed when the driver had to dig the money for the fare out of his trouser pockets did you hear the news the cabbie had asked a shooting at a school probably an air gun but the man had shaken his head worse than that according to the radio at a ampe rebus had waited his turn eventually his hands had been dressed the injuries not serious enough to merit a trip to the burns unit out at livingston but he was running a high temperature so theyd decided to keep him in an ambulance transferring him from a ampe to little france he thought they were probably keeping an eye on him in case he went into shock or something or it could be they feared he was one of those selfharm people nobodyd come to talk to him about that maybe thats why they were hanging on to him waiting for a psychiatrist with a free moment he wondered about jean burchill the one person who might notice his sudden disappearance from home but things had cooled there a little they managed a night together maybe once every ten days spoke on the phone more frequently met for coffee some afternoons already it felt like a routine he recalled that a while ago hed dated a nurse for a short time he didnt know if she still worked locally he could always ask but her name was escaping him it was a problem he had trouble sometimes with names forgot the odd appointment not a big deal really just part and parcel of the aging process but in court he found himself referring to his notes more and more when giving evidence ten years ago he hadnt needed a script or any prompts hed acted with more confidence and that always impressed juriesso lawyers had told him there now his nurse was straightening up shed put fresh grease and gauze on his hands wrapped the old bandages back around them feel more comfortable he nodded the skin felt a little cooler but he knew it wouldnt last you due any more painkillers the question was rhetorical she checked the chart at the bottom of his bed earlier after a visit to the toilet hed looked at it himself it gave his temperature and medication nothing else no coded information meant to be understood only by those in the know no record of the story hed given when he was being examined id run a hot bath slipped and fell in the doctor had made a kind of noise at the back of his throat something that said he would accept this without necessarily believing it overworked lacking sleepnot his job to pry doctor rather than detective i can give you some paracetamol the nurse suggested any chance of a beer to wash them down she smiled that professional smile again the years shed worked in the nhs she probably didnt hear too many original lines ill see what i can do youre an angel rebus said surprising himself it was the sort of thing he felt a patient might say one of those comfortable clichés she was on her way and he wasnt sure shed heard maybe it was something in the nature of hospitals even if you didnt feel ill they still had an effect slowing you down making you compliant institutionalizing you it could be to do with the color scheme the background hum maybe the heating of the place was complicit too back at st leonards they had a special cell for the maddies it was bright pink and was supposed to calm them down why think a similar psychology wasnt being employed here last thing they wanted was a stroppy patient shouting the odds and jumping out of bed every five minutes hence the suffocating number of blankets tightly tucked in to further hamper movement just lie still propped by pillows bask in the heat and light dont make a fuss any more of this he felt and hed start forgetting his own name the world outside would cease to matter no job waiting for him no fairstone no maniac spraying gunfire through the classrooms rebus turned on his side using his legs to push free the sheets it was a twoway fight like harry houdini in a straitjacket the man in the next bed over had opened his eyes and was watching rebus winked at him as he levered his feet into fresh air just you keep tunneling he told the man ill go for a walk trickle the earth out of my trouser leg the reference seemed lost on his fellow prisoner siobhan was back at st leonards loitering by the drink machine a couple of uniforms were seated at a table in the small cafeteria munching on sandwiches and crisps the drink machine was in the adjoining hallway with a view out to the car park if she were a smoker she would have an excuse to step outside where there was less chance of gill templer finding her but she didnt smoke she knew she could try ducking into the underventilated gym farther along the corridor or she could take a walk to the cells but there was nothing to stop templer using the stations pa system to hunt down her quarry word would get around anyway that she was on the premises st leonards was like that no hiding place she yanked on the cola cans ring pull knowing what the uniforms at the table would be discussingsame thing as everyone else three dead in school shootout shed scanned each of the mornings papers there were grainy photos of both the teenage victims boys seventeen years old the words tragedy waste shock and carnage had been bandied about by the journalists alongside the news story additional reporting filled page after page britains burgeoning gun culture school security shortfalls a history of suicide killers shed studied the photos of the assassinapparently only three different snaps had so far been available to the media one was very blurry indeed as if capturing a ghost rather than something made of flesh and blood another showed a man in overalls taking hold of a rope as he made to board a small boat he was smiling head turned towards the camera siobhan got the feeling it was a publicity shot for his waterskiing business the third was a headandshoulders portrait from the mans days in military service herdman his name was lee herdman age thirtysix resident in south queensferry owner of a speedboat there were photos of the yard where his business operated from a scant halfmile from the site of the shocking event as one paper gushed exforces probably easy enough for him to get a gun drove into the school grounds parked next to all the staff cars left his driversside door open obviously in a hurry witnesses saw him barge into the school his first and only stop the common room three people inside two now dead one wounded then a shot to his own temple and that was that criticisms were already flyinghow was it possible postdunblane for christs sake for someone just to walk into a school had herdman shown any signs that he might be about to crack could doctors or social workers be blamed the government somebody anybody it had to be someones fault no point just blaming herdman he was dead there had to be a scapegoat out there siobhan suspected that by tomorrow theyd be wheeling out the usual suspects violence in modern culture films and tv pressures of life then it would quiet down again one statistic she had taken notice ofsince the laws on gun ownership had been tightened after the dunblane massacre gun offenses in the uk had actually risen she knew what the gun lobby would make of that one reason everyone at st leonards was talking about the murders was that the survivors father was a member of the scottish parliamentand not just any msp jack bell had found himself in trouble six months back apprehended by police during a trawl of the redlight district down in leith residents had been holding demonstrations petitioning the constabulary to take action against the problem the constabulary had reacted by swooping down one night netting jack bell msp amongst others but bell had protested his innocence putting his appearance in the area down to factfinding his wife had backed him up as had most of his party with the result that police hq had decided to let the matter drop but not before the media had had their fun at bells expense leading the msp to accuse the police of being in cahoots with the gutter press of hounding him because of who he was the resentment had festered leading bell to make several speeches in parliament usually remarking on inefficiency within the force and the need for change all of which it was agreed might lead to a problem because bell had been arrested by a team from leith the very station now in charge of the shooting at port edgar academy and south queensferry just happened to be his constituency as if this wasnt enough to get tongues wagging one of the murder victims happened to be the son of a judge all of which led to the second reason why everyone at st leonards was talking they felt left out being a leith call rather than st leonards there was nothing to do but sit and watch hoping there might be a need to draft officers in but siobhan doubted it the case was cut and dried the gunmans body laid out in the morgue his two victims somewhere nearby it wouldnt be enough to deflect gill templer from ds clarke to the chief supers office the squawked imperative came from a loudspeaker attached to the ceiling above her head the uniforms in the cafeteria turned to look at her she tried to appear calm sipping from her can her insides suddenly felt coldnothing to do with the chilled drink ds clarke to the chief super the glass door was ahead of her beyond it her car sat obediently in its space what would rebus do run or hide she had to smile as the answer came to her hed do neither hed probably take the stairs two at a time on his way to the bosss office knowing he was right and she whatever she had to say to him was wrong siobhan dumped her can and headed for the stairs you know why i wanted you detective chief superintendent gill templer asked she was seated behind the desk in her office surrounded by the days paperwork as dcs templer was responsible for the whole of b division composed of three stations on the citys south side with st leonards as divisional hq it wasnt as hefty a workload as some though things would change when the scottish parliament finally moved into its purposebuilt complex at the foot of holyrood road templer already seemed to spend a disproportionate amount of time in meetings focused on the needs of the parliament siobhan knew that she hated this no police officer joined the force because of a fondness for paperwork yet more and more budgeting and finances were the topics of the day officers who could run their cases or their stations onbudget were prized specimens those who could actually underspend were seen as altogether rarer and more rarefied beings siobhan could see that it was taking its toll on gill templer she always had a slightly harried look about her glints of gray were showing in her hair she either hadnt noticed or couldnt find time these days to get them done time was defeating her it made siobhan wonder what price she would be asked to pay for climbing the career ladder always supposing that ladder was still visible after today templer seemed preoccupied with a search of her desk drawer eventually she gave up and closed it focusing her attention on siobhan as she did so she lowered her chin this had the effect of hardening her gaze but also siobhan couldnt help noticing of accentuating the folds of skin around the throat and mouth when templer moved in her chair her suit jacket creased below the breasts showing that shed gained some weight either too much fast food or too many dinners at evening functions with the brass siobhan whod been in the gym at six oclock that morning sat a little more upright in her own chair and lifted her head a little higher im assuming its about martin fairstone she said beating templer to the opening jab of the bout when templer stayed quiet she went in again i had nothing to do with wheres john templer interrupted sharply siobhan just swallowed hes not at his flat templer continued i sent someone round there to check yet according to you hes taken a couple of days sick leave where is he siobhan i the thing is two nights ago martin fairstone was seen in a bar nothing unusual in that except that his companion bore a striking resemblance to detective inspector john rebus couple of hours later fairstones being fried alive in the kitchen of his house she paused always supposing he was alive when the fire started maam i really dont john likes to look out for you doesnt he siobhan nothing wrong in that johns got this knightintarnishedarmor thing hasnt he always has to be looking for another dragon to fight this doesnt have anything to do with di rebus maam then whats he hiding from im not aware that hes hiding at all but youve seen him it was a question but only just templer allowed herself a winning smile id put money on it hes really not well enough to come in siobhan parried aware that her punches were losing much of their previous force if he cant come here im quite willing for you to take me to him siobhan felt her shoulders sag i need to talk to him first templer was shaking her head this isnt something you can negotiate siobhan according to you fairstone was stalking you he gave you that black eye siobhan raised an involuntary hand towards her left cheekbone the marks were fading she knew they were more like shadows now they could be hidden with makeup or explained by tiredness but she still saw them when she looked in the mirror now hes dead templer was continuing in a house fire possibly suspicious so you can see that i have to talk to anyone who saw him that night another pause when was the last time you saw him siobhan which onefairstone or di rebus both if you like siobhan didnt say anything her hands went to clasp the metal arms of her chair but she realized it had no arms a new chair less comfortable than the old one then she saw that templers chair was new too and set an inch or two higher than before a little trick to give her an edge over any visitor which meant the chief super felt the need of such props i dont think im prepared to answer maam siobhan paused with respect she got to her feet wondering whether shed sit down again if told to thats very disappointing ds clarke templers voice was cold no more first names youll tell john weve had a word if you want me to i expect youll want to get your stories straight prior to any inquiry siobhan acknowledged the threat with a nod all it needed was a request from the chief super and the complaints would come shuffling into view bringing with them their briefcases full of questions and skepticism the complaints full title the complaints and conduct department thank you maam was all siobhan said opening the door and closing it again behind her there was a toilet cubicle along the hall and she went and sat there for a while taking a small paper bag from her pocket and breathing into it the first time shed suffered a panic attack shed felt as if she was going into cardiac arrest heart pounding lungs giving out her whole body surging with electricity her doctor had said she should take some time off shed entered his office thinking he would recommend her to the hospital for tests but instead hed told her to buy a book about her condition shed found one in a pharmacy it listed every single one of her symptoms in its first chapter and made a few suggestions cut down on caffeine and alcohol eat less salt and fat try breathing into a paper bag if an attack seems imminent the doctor had said her blood pressure was a bit high suggested exercise so shed started coming into work an hour early spending that time in the gym the commonwealth pool was just down the road and shed promised herself shed start swimming there i eat fine shed told her doctor try making a list over the course of a week hed said so far she hadnt bothered and she kept forgetting her swimsuit too all too easy to blame martin fairstone fairstone in court on two chargeshousebreaking and assault one of the neighbors challenging him as he left the flat hed just looted fairstone smashing the womans head into a wall stamping on her face so hard the sole of one sneaker left its impression siobhan giving evidence doing her best but they hadnt recovered the shoe and none of the haul from the flat had turned up in fairstones home the neighbor had given a description of her attacker then had picked out fairstones mug shot later on choosing him again at the id parade there were problems which the procurator fiscals office had been quick to identify no evidence at the scene nothing to link fairstone to the crimes except an id and the fact that he was a known housebreaker with several convictions for assault the shoe would have been nice the fiscal depute had scratched at his beard and asked if they might try dropping either of the charges maybe do a deal and he gets a cuff round the ear and heads back home siobhan had argued in court it was pointed out to siobhan by the defense that the neighbors original description of her attacker bore little resemblance to the figure in the dock the victim herself fared little better admitting to a margin of uncertainty that the defense exploited to the full when giving her own evidence siobhan used as many hints as she could to let everyone know that the defendant had a history eventually the judge couldnt ignore the remonstrations by the defense counsel youre on a final warning detective sergeant clarke he had said so unless you have some reason why you wish to scupper the crowns chances in this case i suggest you choose your answers more carefully from now on fairstone had just glared at her knowing full well what she was trying to do and afterwards the notguilty verdict delivered hed bounded out of the court building as if there were springs in the heels of his brandnew sneakers hed grabbed siobhan by the shoulder to stop her from walking away thats assault shed told him trying not to show how furious and frustrated she felt thanks for helping me get off in there hed said maybe i can return the favor someday im off to the pub to celebrate whats your poison drop down the nearest sewer will you i think im in love a grin spreading to cover his narrow face someone called to him his girlfriend bottleblond hair black tracksuit pack of cigs in one hand mobile phone to her ear shed provided his alibi for the time of the attack so had two of his friends looks like youre wanted its you i want shiv you want me she waited till he nodded then invite me along next time youre going to beat up a complete stranger give me your phone number im in the bookunder police marty his girlfriends snarl be seeing you shiv still grinning he walked backwards for a few paces then turned away siobhan had headed straight back over to st leonards to reacquaint herself with his file an hour later the switchboard had put through a call it was him phoning from a bar shed put the receiver down ten minutes later hed called again and then another ten after that and the next day and the whole of the following week unsure at first how to play it she didnt know if her silences were working they just seemed to make him laugh made him try all the harder she prayed he would tire find something else to occupy him then he turned up at st leonards tried following her home shed spotted him that time led him a dance while summoning help on her mobile a patrol car had picked him up next day he was curbside again just outside the car park at the back of st leonards shed left him there exiting on foot instead by the front door taking a bus home still he wouldnt give up and she realized that what had startedpresumablyas a joke had turned into a more serious form of game so shed decided to bring one of her stronger pieces into play rebus had noticed anyway the calls she wasnt taking the time she spent by the office window the way she kept glancing around her when they were out on a call so eventually shed told him and the pair of them had paid a visit to fairstones public housing unit in gracemount it had started badly siobhan soon realizing that her piece played by his own set of rules rather than anyone elses a struggle the leg snapping from a coffee table pine veneer yielding to the mdf within siobhan feeling worse than ever afterwardsweak because she had brought rebus in rather than deal with it herself trembling because at the back of her mind lurked the thought that shed known what would happen and had wanted it to happen instigator and coward theyd stopped for a drink on the way back into town think hell do anything siobhan had asked he started it rebus told her if he keeps on hassling you he knows now what hes in for a hiding you mean all i did was defend myself siobhan you were there you saw his eyes fixing hers until she nodded and he was right fairstone had lunged at him rebus had pushed him down onto the coffee table trying to hold him there then the leg snapped and both men slid to the floor rolling and struggling it had all been over in a matter of seconds fairstones voice shaking with rage as he told them to get out rebus pointing a warning finger repeating his order to back off from ds clarke just clear out the pair of you her hand touching rebuss arm its finished lets go you think its finished flecks of white saliva spitting from the corners of fairstones mouth rebuss final words it better be pal unless you really want to start seeing some fireworks shed wanted to ask him what hed meant but instead had bought a final round of drinks in bed that night shed stared at the dark ceiling before falling into a doze waking with a sudden feeling of terror leaping to her feet adrenaline surging through her shed crawled on hands and knees from her bedroom believing that if she got to her feet she would die eventually it passed and she used her hands on the hallway wall as she rose up from the floor she walked slowly back to bed and lay down on her side curled into a ball more common than you might think her doctor would eventually tell her after the second attack between times martin fairstone made a complaint of harassment dropping it eventually and hed also kept on calling shed tried to keep it from rebus didnt want to know what he meant by fireworks the cid office was dead people were out on calls or busy in court it seemed you could spend half your life waiting to give evidence only for the case to collapse or the accused to make a change of plea sometimes a juror went awol or someone crucial was sick time seeped away and at the end of it all the verdict was not guilty even when found guilty it might be a question of a fine or suspended sentence the prisons were full and seen more than ever as a last resort siobhan didnt think she was growing cynical just realistic thered been criticism recently that edinburgh had more traffic wardens than cops when something like south queensferry came up it stretched things tighter holidays sick leave paperwork and court and not nearly enough hours in any given day siobhan was aware that there was a backlog on her desk because of fairstone her work had been suffering she could still feel his presence if a phone rang she would freeze and a couple of times she caught herself heading for the window to check if his car was out there she knew she was being irrational but couldnt help it knew too that it wasnt the kind of thing she could talk to someone about not without seeming weak the phone was ringing now not on her own desk but on rebuss if no one answered the switchboard might try another extension she crossed the floor willing the sound to stop it did so only when she picked up the receiver hello whos that a male voice brisk businesslike ds clarke hiya shiv its bobby hogan here detective inspector bobby hogan shed asked him before not to call her shiv a lot of people tried it siobhan pronounced shivawn shortened to shiv when people wrote her name down it turned into all sorts of erroneous spellings she remembered that fairstone had called her shiv a few times attempting familiarity she hated it and knew she should correct hogan but she didnt keeping busy she asked instead you know im handling port edgar he broke off course you do stupid question you come over well on tv bobby im always open to flattery shiv and the answer is no she couldnt help smiling im not exactly snowed under here she lied glancing across at the folders on her desk if i need an extra pair of hands ill let you know is john around mr popular hes taken a sickie what do you want him for is he at home i can probably get a message to him she was intrigued now there was some urgency in hogans voice you know where he is yes where you never answered my question what do you want him for hogan gave a long sigh because i need that other pair of hands he told her and only his will do so far as i know im suitably crushed he ignored her tone how soon can you let him know he might not be well enough to help if hes anywhere short of an iron lung ill take him she rested her weight against rebuss desk whats going on just get him to call me eh are you at the school best if he tries my mobile bye shiv hang on a sec siobhan was looking towards the doorway what hogan failed to mask his exasperation hes just here ill put him on she stretched the receiver out towards rebus his clothes all seemed to be hanging awkwardly at first she thought he must be drunk but then she realized what it was hed struggled to get dressed his shirt was tucked into his waistband but only just his tie hung loose around his neck instead of taking the phone from her he came forward and leaned his ear against it its bobby hogan she explained hiya bobby john connection must be breaking up rebus looked at siobhan bit closer he whispered she angled the mouthpiece so it rested against his chin noting that his hair needed washing it was plastered to his scalp in the front but sticking up in the back that better bobby fine yes john i need a favor when the phone dipped a little rebus looked up at siobhan her gaze was directed at the doorway again he glanced around and saw gill templer standing there my office she snapped now rebus ran the tip of his tongue around his lips i think im going to have to call you back bobby boss wants a word he straightened up hearing hogans voice becoming tinny and mechanical templer was beckoning for him to follow he gave a little shrug in siobhans direction and began to leave the room again hes gone she told the mouthpiece well get him back i dont think thats going to be possible look maybe if you could give me a clue what this is all about i might be able to help ill leave it open if you dont mind rebus said if you want the whole station to hear thats fine by me rebus slumped down on the visitors chair its just that im having a bit of trouble with door handles he lifted his hands for templer to see her expression changed immediately christ john what the hell happened i scalded myself looks worse than it is scalded yourself she leaned back fingers pressing the edge of the desk he nodded theres no more to it than that despite what im thinking despite what youre thinking i filled the kitchen sink to do some dishes forgot i hadnt added cold and plunged my hands in for how long exactly long enough to scald them apparently he tried for a smile reckoned the dishes story was easier to swallow than the bathtub despite which templer looked far from convinced her phone started ringing she picked up the receiver and dropped it again cutting the connection youre not the only one having some bad luck martin fairstone died in a fire siobhan told me and accident with a chip pan he shrugged it happens you were with him sunday night was i witnesses saw you together in a bar rebus shrugged i did chance to bump into him and left the bar with him no went back to his place says who john his voice was rising who says it wasnt an accident the fire investigators are still looking good luck to them rebus made to fold his arms realized what he was doing and dropped them to either side again that probably hurts templer commented its bearable and it happened on sunday night he nodded look john she leaned forwards elbows on the desktop you know what people are going to say siobhan claimed fairstone was stalking her he denied it then countered that youd threatened him a charge he decided to drop but now i hear from siobhan that fairstone attacked her did you know about that he shook his head the fires just a stupid coincidence she lowered her eyes it doesnt look good though does it rebus made a show of examining himself since when have i been interested in looking good despite herself she almost smiled i just want to know that were clean on this trust me gill then you wont mind making it all official get it down in writing her phone had started ringing again id answer it this time a voice said siobhan was standing in the hallway arms folded templer looked at her then picked up the receiver dcs templer speaking siobhan caught rebuss eye and gave a wink gill templer was listening to whatever the caller was telling her i see yes i suppose that would be care to tell me why him exactly rebus suddenly knew it was bobby hogan maybe not on the phonehogan could have gone over templers head got the deputy chief constable to make the call on his behalf needing that favor from rebus hogan had a certain measure of power right now power gifted him along with his latest case rebus wondered what sort of favor he wanted templer put down the phone youre to report to south queensferry seems di hogan needs his handholding she was staring at her desktop thank you maam rebus said fairstone wont be going anywhere john remember that soon as hogans finished with you youre mine again understood templer looked past him to where siobhan was still standing meantime maybe ds clarke will shed some light rebus cleared his throat might be a problem there maam in what way rebus held up his arms again and turned his wrists slowly i might be all right for holding bobby hogans hand but ill need a bit of help for everything else he half turned in the chair so if i could just borrow ds clarke for a little while i can get you a driver templer snapped but for writing notes making and taking calls needs to be cid and from what i saw in the office that narrows things down he paused with your permission get out then the pair of you templer made a show of reaching for some paperwork soon as theres news from the fire investigators ill let you know very decent of you boss rebus said rising to his feet back in the cid room he had siobhan slide a hand into his jacket pocket bringing out a small plastic jar of pills bastards measured them out like gold he complained get me some water will you she fetched a bottle from her desk and helped him wash down two tablets when he demanded a third she checked the label says to take two every four hours one more wont do any harm not going to last long at this rate theres a prescription in my other pocket well stop at a chemists once were on the road she screwed the top of the jar back on thanks for taking me with you no problem he paused want to talk about fairstone not particularly fair enough im assuming neither of us is responsible her eyes bored into his correct he said which means we can concentrate on helping bobby hogan instead but theres one last thing before we start what any chance you could do my tie properly nurse hadnt a clue she smiled ive been waiting to get my hands around your throat any more of that and ill throw you back to the boss but he didnt even when she proved incapable of following his instructions for knotting a tie in the end the woman at the chemists did it for him while they waited for the pharmacist to fill his prescription used to do it for my husband all the time she said god rest his soul outside on the sidewalk rebus looked up and down the street i need cigarettes he said dont expect me to light them for you siobhan said folding her arms he stared at her im serious she added this is the best chance of quitting that youre ever likely to have he narrowed his eyes youre enjoying this arent you beginning to she admitted opening the car door for him with a flourish of her arm there was no quick route to south queensferry they headed across the city center and down queensferry road picking up speed only when they hit the a the town they were approaching seemed to be nestled between the two bridgesroad and railthat spanned the firth of forth havent been out here in years siobhan said just to fill the silence inside the car rebus didnt bother answering it seemed to him as if the whole world had been bandaged muffled he guessed the tablets were to blame one weekend a couple of months back hed brought jean to south queensferry theyd had a bar lunch a walk along the promenade theyd watched the lifeboat being launchedno urgency about it probably an exercise then theyd driven to hopetoun house taking a guided tour of the stately homes ornate interior he knew from the news that port edgar academy was near hopetoun house thought he remembered driving past its gates no building visible from the road he gave siobhan directions only for them to end up in a culdesac she did a threepoint turn and found hopetoun road without further help from the passenger seat as they neared the gates to the school they had to squeeze past news vans and reporters cars hit as many as you like rebus muttered a uniform checked their id and opened the wroughtiron gates siobhan drove through i thought it would be on the waterfront she said with a name like port edgar theres a marina called port edgar cant be too far away as the car climbed a winding slope he turned to look back he could see the water masts seeming to rise from it like spikes but then it was lost behind trees and turning again he saw the school come into view it was built in the scots baronial style dark slabs of stone topped with gables and turrets a saltire flew at halfmast the car park had been taken over by official vehicles people milling around a portakabin the town boasted only a single tiny police substation probably not big enough to cope as their tires crunched over gravel eyes turned to check them out rebus recognized a few faces and those faces knew him too nobody bothered to smile or wave as the car stopped rebus made an attempt to pull the door handle but had to wait for siobhan to get out walk around to the passenger side and open the door thanks he said easing himself out a uniformed constable walked over rebus knew him from leith his name was brendan innes an australian rebus had never got around to asking him how hed ended up in scotland di rebus innes was saying di hogans up at the school told me to tell you rebus nodded got a cigarette on you dont smoke rebus looked around seeking out a likely candidate he said youre to go right up innes was stressing both men turned at a noise from the portakabins interior the door flew open and a man stomped down the three exterior steps he was dressed as if for a funeral somber suit white shirt black tie it was the hair rebus recognized in all its silvery backcombed glory jack bell msp bell was in his midforties face squarejawed permanently tanned tall and widebodied he had the look of a man whod always be surprised not to get his own way ive every right he was yelling every bloody right in the world but i mightve known to expect nothing from you lot but utter bloody downright obstructiveness grant hood liaison officer on the case had come to the doorway youre welcome to your opinion sir he tried remonstrating its not an opinion its an absolute undeniable fact you got egg all over your faces six months ago and thats not something youre ever likely to forget or forgive is it rebus had taken a step forward excuse me sir bell spun around to face him yes what is it i just thought you might want to keep your voice down out of respect bell jabbed a forefinger at rebus dont you dare start playing that card ill have you know my son could have been killed at the hands of that maniac im well aware of that sir but im here representing my constituents and as such i demand to be allowed inside bell paused for breath who are you anyway the names di rebus then youre no bloody good to me its hogan i need to see youll appreciate that detective inspector hogans up to his eyes at the minute its the classroom you want to see is that right bell nodded looking around as if seeking out anyone more useful to him than rebus mind if i ask why sir none of your business rebus shrugged its just that im on my way to talk to di hogan he turned away started walking thought i might be able to put a word in on your behalf hold on bell said voice immediately losing some of its stridency maybe you could show me but rebus was shaking his head best if you wait here sir ill let you know what di hogan says bell nodded but he was not to be placated for long its scandalous you know how can someone just walk into a school with a gun thats what were trying to find out sir rebus looked the msp up and down got a cigarette on you by any chance what a cigarette bell shook his head and rebus started heading towards the school again ill be waiting inspector i wont be budging from this spot thats fine sir best place for you i daresay there was a sloping lawn to the front of the school playing fields to one side uniformed officers were busy on the playing fields turning away trespassers who had climbed the perimeter wall media maybe but more likely just ghouls you got them at every murder scene rebus caught a glimpse of a modern building behind the original school a helicopter flew over he couldnt see any cameras aboard that was fun siobhan said catching up with him always a pleasure to meet a politician rebus agreed especially one who holds our profession in such esteem the schools main entrance seemed to be a carved wooden double door with glass panels inside was a reception area with sliding windows leading to an office probably the school secretarys she was in there now giving a statement from behind a large white handkerchief presumably belonging to the officer seated opposite her rebus knew his face but couldnt put a name to it another set of doors led into the body of the school theyd been wedged open a sign on them stated that all visitors should report to the office an arrow pointed back towards the sliding windows siobhan gestured towards a corner of the ceiling where a small camera was fitted rebus nodded and passed through the open doors into a long corridor with stairs off to one side and a large stainedglass window at the far end the floor was polished wood creaking under his weight there were paintings on the walls robed figures of past teachers captured at their desks or reaching towards a bookcase farther along were lists of namesprefects of the school headmasters those whod gone on to die in service of their country wonder how easy it was for him to get in siobhan said quietly her words reverberated in the silence and a head appeared around a door halfway down the corridor took you long enough boomed the voice of di bobby hogan come and have a look he had retreated back inside the sixthyear common room it was about sixteen feet by twelve with windows high up on the external wall there were about a dozen chairs and a desk with a computer on it an oldlooking hifi sat in one corner cds and tapes scattered about some of the chairs had magazines on them fhm heat m a novel lay open and facedown nearby backpacks and blazers hung on hooks below the windows you can come in hogan told them the socos have been through this lot with a finetoothed comb they edged into the room yes the socosthe scene of crime officershad been here because this was where it had happened blood spatters on one wall a fine airbrushing of dull red larger drops on the floor and what looked like skid marks from where feet had slid across a couple of pools white chalk and yellow adhesive tape showed where evidence had been gathered he entered through one of the side doors hogan was explaining it was break time they werent locked walked down the corridor and straight in here nice sunny day so most of the kids were outside he only found three hogan nodded towards where the victims had been listening to music flicking through magazines it was as if he were talking to himself hoping if he repeated the words often enough they would start answering his questions why here siobhan asked hogan looked up as if seeing her for the first time hiya shiv he said with just a trace of a smile you here out of curiosity shes helping me rebus said raising his hands christ john what happened long story bobby siobhan asked a good question you mean why this particular school more than that siobhan said you said yourself most of the kids were outdoors why didnt he start with them hogan answered with a shrug im hoping well find out so how can we help bobby rebus asked he hadnt moved far into the room content to stay just inside the threshold while siobhan browsed the posters on the walls eminem seemed to be giving the world the benefit of his middle finger while a group next to him boilersuited and rubbermasked looked like extras from a midbudget horror film he was exarmy john hogan was saying more than that he was exsas i remember you telling me once that youd tried for the special air service that was thirtyodd years ago bobby hogan wasnt listening seems like he was a bit of a loner a loner with some sort of grudge siobhan asked who knows but you want me to ask around rebus guessed hogan looked at him any buddies he had are likely to be like himarmed forces castoffs they might open up to someone whos been the same road as them it was thirtyodd years ago rebus repeated and thanks for grouping me with the castoffs ach you know what i mean just for a day or two john thats all im asking rebus stepped back into the corridor and looked around him it seemed so quiet so peaceful and yet the work of a few moments had changed everything the town the school would never be the same the lives of everyone involved would stay convulsed the school secretary might never emerge from behind that borrowed handkerchief the families would bury their sons unable to think beyond the terror of their final moments what about it john hogan was asking will you help warm fuzzy cotton it could protect you cushion you no mystery siobhans words lost his marbles thats all just one question bobby bobby hogan looked tired and slightly lost leith meant drugs stabbings prossies those bobby could deal with rebus got the feeling hed been summoned here because bobby hogan needed a friend by his side fire away hogan said got a cigarette on you rebus asked there were too many people fighting for space in the portakabin hogan loaded siobhans arms with paperwork everything they had on the case the copies still warm from the machine in the school office outside a group of herring gulls had gathered on the lawn seemingly curious rebus flicked them his cigarette butt and they sprinted towards it i could report you for cruelty siobhan told him ditto he said looking the amount of paperwork up and down grant hood was finishing a phone call tucking his mobile back in his pocket where did our friend go rebus asked him you mean dirty mac jack rebus smiled at the nickname which had graced the front page of a tabloid the morning after bells arrest thats who i mean hood nodded down the hill a member of the press corps called him offering a tv slot at the school gates jack was off like a flash so much for not budging from the spot are the press boys behaving themselves what do you think rebus responded with a twitch of the mouth hoods phone sounded again and he turned away to take the call rebus watched siobhan maneuver the car trunk open some of the sheets slipping onto the ground she picked them up again that everything rebus asked her for now she slammed shut the trunk where are we taking them rebus examined the sky thick scudding clouds probably too windy for rain he thought he could hear the distant sound of rigging clanging against yacht masts we could get a table at a pub down by the rail bridge theres a place called the boatmans she stared at him its an edinburgh tradition he explained with a shrug in times past professionals ran their businesses from the local pub we wouldnt want to mess with tradition ive always preferred the oldfashioned methods she didnt say anything to this just walked around to the drivers side and opened the door shed closed it and put the key in the ignition before she remembered cursing she reached across to open rebuss door for him too kind he said smiling as he got in he didnt know south queensferry that well but he knew the pubs hed been brought up on the other side of the estuary and remembered the view from north queensferry the way the bridges seemed to drift apart as you looked south the same uniformed officer opened the gates to let them out jack bell was in the middle of the road saying his piece to the camera a nice long blast on the horn rebus ordered siobhan obliged the journalist lowered his microphone turned to glower at them the cameraman slid his headphones down around his neck rebus waved at the msp gave him what might pass for an apologetic smile sightseers blocked half the carriageway staring at the car i feel like a bloody exhibit siobhan muttered a line of traffic was passing them at a crawl wanting a look at the school not professionals just members of the public whod brought their families and video cameras with them as siobhan made to pass the tiny police station rebus said he would get out and walk ill meet you at the pub where are you going i just want to get a feel for the place he paused mines a pint of ipa if you get there first he watched her drive away taking her place in the slow procession of tourist traffic rebus stopped and turned to look up at the forth road bridge hearing its swoosh of cars and lorries something almost tidal about it there were tiny figures up there standing on the footpath looking down he knew there would be more at the side of the opposite carriageway where there was a better view of the school grounds shaking his head he started walking commerce in south queensferry took place on a single thoroughfare stretching from the high street to the hawes inn but change was coming driving past the town recently headed for the road bridge hed noticed a new supermarket and business park a sign tempting the backup tired of commuting you could be working here the message telling them that edinburgh was full to the brim the traffic slowing every year south queensferry wanted to be part of the movement away from the city not that youd know it from the high street locally owned small shops narrow pavements tourist information rebus knew some of the stories a fire at the vat distillery hot whiskey running down the streets people drinking it and ending up in the hospital a pet monkey that teased to distraction ripped open the throat of a scullery maid apparitions such as the mowbray hound and the burry man there was a celebration every year to commemorate the burry man bunting and flags put up a procession through the town it was months away yet but rebus wondered if thered be a procession this year rebus passed a clock tower remembrance day wreaths still pinned to it untouched by vandals the road grew so narrow traffic had to use passing places every now and then he caught glimpses of the estuary behind the buildings on the left across the road the singlestory row of shops was topped with a terrace itself fronted by houses two elderly women were standing by an open front door their arms folded as they shared the latest rumors eyes flitting towards rebus knowing him for a stranger their scowls dismissed him as just another ghoul he walked on passing a newsagents several people had gathered inside sharing information from the evening papers early printing a news crew passed him on the other side of the roada different crew from the one outside the school gates the cameraman carried his camera in one hand tripod slung over the other shoulder soundman with his rig hanging by his side headphones around his neck boom held like a rifle they were on the lookout for a good spot led by a young blond woman who kept peering down vennels in her search for the perfect shot rebus thought hed seen her on tv reckoned the crew were probably from glasgow her report would start a shattered community is today trying to come to terms with the horror which visited this once peaceful haven questions are being asked but as yet the answers seem to be eluding everyone blah blah rebus knew he could write the script himself with the police offering no leads the media had nothing to do but harass the locals seeking droplets of news and prepared to squeeze them out of any rock or stone that might yield hed seen it at lockerbie and didnt doubt dunblane had been the same now it was south queensferrys turn he came to a curve in the road beyond which was the esplanade stopping for a moment he turned back to view the town but most of it was hidden behind trees behind other buildings beyond the arc hed just traveled there was a seawall here and he decided it was as good a place as any to light the spare cigarette bobby hogan had gifted him the cigarette was tucked behind his right ear and he pawed at it not quite catching it as it fluttered to the ground a gust sending it rolling stooped eyes down rebus started following and almost collided with a pair of legs the cigarette had come to rest against the pointed toe of a glossblack anklehigh stiletto the legs above the shoes were covered in ripped black fishnet tights rebus stood up straight the girl could have been anything from thirteen to nineteen years old dyed black hair lay like straw against her head siouxsie sioux style her face was deathly white the eyes and lips painted black she was wearing a black leather jacket over layers of gauzy black material did you slash your wrists she asked staring at his bandages i probably will if you crush that cigarette she bent down and picked it up leaned forward to place it between his lips theres a lighter in my pocket he said she fished it out and lit the cigarette for him cupping her hand expertly around the flame keeping her eyes fixed on his as if to gauge his response to her nearness sorry he apologized this is my last one it was hard to smoke and speak at the same time she seemed to realize this because after a couple of inhalations she plucked the cigarette from his mouth then placed it in her own inside her black lace gloves her fingernails were black too im no fashion expert rebus said but i get the feeling youre not just in mourning she smiled enough to show a row of small white teeth im not in mourning at all but you go to port edgar academy she looked at him wondering how he knew otherwise youd probably still be in class he explained its only kids from port edgar whore off just now you a reporter she returned the cigarette to his mouth it tasted of her lipstick im a cop he told her cid she didnt seem interested you didnt know the kids who died i did she sounded hurt not wanting to be left out but you dont miss them she caught his meaning nodding as she remembered her own words im not in mourning at all if anything im jealous again her eyes were boring into his he couldnt help wondering how she would look without the makeup pretty probably maybe even fragile her painted face was a mask something she could hide behind jealous theyre dead arent they she watched him nod then gave a shrug of her own rebus looked down at the cigarette and she took it from him placing it in her mouth again you want to die im just curious thats all i want to know what its like she made an o of her lips and produced a swirling circle of smoke you must have seen dead people too many and how manys that ever watched someone die he wasnt about to answer ive got to be going she made to give him what little was left of the cigarette but he shook his head whats your name by the way teri terry she spelled it for him but you can call me miss teri rebus smiled ill assume thats an assumed name maybe ill see you around miss teri you can see me whenever you like mr cid she turned and started walking into town confident in her inchandahalf heels hands brushing her hair back and letting it fall then giving a little wave of one lacegloved hand knowing he was watching enjoying playing the role rebus reckoned she qualified as a goth hed seen them in town hanging around outside record shops for a time anyone who fitted the description had been banned from entering princes street gardens a municipal edict something to do with a trampled flowerbed and the knocking over of a litter bin when rebus had read about it hed smiled the line stretched back from punks to teddy boys teenagers undergoing their rites of passage hed been pretty wild himself before hed joined the army too young for the first wave of teddy boys but growing into a secondhand leather jacket a sharpened steel comb in the pocket the jacket hadnt been rightnot biker goods but threequarter length hed cut it shorter with a kitchen knife threads straggling from it the lining showing some rebel miss teri disappeared around the bend and rebus headed for the boatmans where siobhan was waiting with the drinks thought i was going to have to drink yours she said by way of complaint sorry he cupped the glass in both hands and lifted it siobhan had found them a corner table nobody close by two piles of paperwork sat in front of her alongside her lime soda and an open packet of peanuts how are the hands she asked im worried i may never play the piano again a tragic loss to the world of popular music you ever listen to heavy metal siobhan not if i can help it she paused maybe a bit of motorhead to get the party started i was thinking of the newer stuff she shook her head you really think were all right here he looked around locals dont seem interested its not like were going to be flashing autopsy photos or anything there are pictures of the crime scene though keep them tucked away for now rebus swallowed another mouthful of beer you sure you can drink with those tablets youre taking he ignored her nodded towards one of the piles instead so he said what have we got and how long can we stretch this assignment out for she smiled not keen on another meeting with the boss dont tell me youre looking forward to it she seemed to give this some thought then offered a shrug you glad fairstones dead rebus asked she glared at him just curious he said thinking again of miss teri he made a show of trying to slide one of the top sheets towards him until siobhan took the hint and did it for him then the two of them sat side by side not noticing the light outside waning as the afternoon slurred towards evening siobhan went to the bar for more drinks the barman had tried asking her about the paperwork but shed deflected the conversation and theyd ended up talking about writers instead she hadnt known of the boatmans connection with the likes of walter scott and robert louis stevenson youre not just drinking in a pub the barman had explained youre drinking in history a line hed used a hundred times before it made her feel like a tourist ten miles from the city center but everything felt different it wasnt just the murdersabout which she suddenly realized her barman hadnt said anything denizens of the city tended to lump the outlying settlements togetherportobello musselburgh currie south queensferry they were regarded as just bits of the city yet even leith connected to the city center by the ugly umbilical cord of leith walk worked hard to preserve a separate identity she wondered why anywhere else should be different something had brought lee herdman here hed been born in wishaw joined the army at seventeen service in northern ireland and farther abroad then sas training eight years in that regiment before finding himself back as he would probably have put it on civvy street he abandoned his wife leaving her with two kids in hereford home of the sas and headed north the background information was patchy no mention of what happened to the wife and kids or why he broke with them hed moved to south queensferry six years ago and hed died here age thirtysix siobhan looked across to where rebus was studying another sheet of paper hed been in the army and shed often heard rumors that hed trained for the sas what did she know about the sas only what shed read in the report special air service based in hereford motto who dares wins selected from the best candidates the army could muster the regiment had been founded during world war ii as a longrange reconnaissance unit but had been made famous by the iranian embassy siege in and the falklands campaign a penciled footnote to one sheet stated that herdmans previous employers had been contacted and asked to provide what information they could shed mentioned this to rebus whod just snorted indicating that he didnt think they would be very forthcoming sometime after his arrival in south queensferry herdman had started his boat business towing waterskiers and such siobhan didnt know how much it cost to buy a speedboat shed made a note to this effect one of dozens listed on the pad back at the table youre not in a hurry then the barman said she hadnt noticed him coming back what he lowered his eyes directing her to the drinks in front of her oh right she said trying for a smile dont worry about it sometimes a dwams the best place to be she nodded knowing that dwam meant dream she seldom used scots words they jarred with her english accent that shed never tried altering her accent was testament to its usefulness it could wind people up which had proved handy in some interviews and if people occasionally mistook her for a tourist well they sometimes dropped their guard too ive figured out who you are the barman was saying now she studied him midtwenties tall and broadshouldered with short black hair and a face that would retain its sculpted cheekbones for a few years yet booze diet and cigarettes notwithstanding impress me she said leaning against the bar at first i took you for a pair of reporters but youre not asking any questions youve had a few reporters in then she asked he rolled his eyes in reply way youve been sifting through that lot he said nodding towards the table im thinking detectives clever lad he came in here you know lee i mean you knew him oh aye we chatted just the usual stuff football and that ever go out on his boat the barman nodded brilliant it was scudding underneath both the bridges craning your neck to look up he angled his head now to show her what he meant he was a boy for the speed was lee he stopped abruptly i dont mean drugs he just liked going fast whats your name mr barman rod mcallister he held out a hand which she shook it was damp from washing glasses pleased to meet you rod she withdrew her hand and reached into her pocket bringing out one of her business cards if you think of anything that might help us he took the card right he said right you are seb its pronounced shivawn christ is that how its spelled but you can call me detective sergeant clarke he nodded and tucked the card into the breast pocket of his shirt looked at her with renewed interest how long will you be in town as long as it takes why he shrugged lunchtimes we do a mean haggis neeps and tatties ill bear that in mind she picked up the glasses cheers rod cheers back at the table she stood rebuss pint glass next to the open notebook here you go sorry it took a while turns out the barman knew herdman could be hes got by now she was sitting down rebus wasnt paying any attention wasnt listening he was staring at the sheet of paper in front of him what is it she asked glancing at the sheet she saw it was one shed already read family details of one of the victims john she prompted his eyes rose slowly to meet hers i think i know them he said quietly who she took the sheet from him the parents you mean he nodded how do you know them rebus held his hands up to his face theyre family he saw that she didnt understand my family siobhan theyre my family it was a semidetached house at the end of a culdesac on a modern development from this part of south queensferry there was no view of the bridges and no inkling of the ancient streets only a quarter of a mile away cars sat in their drivewaysmiddlemanagement models rovers and bmws and audis no fences separating the homes just lawn leading to path leading to more lawn siobhan had parked curbside she stood a couple of feet behind rebus as he managed to ring the doorbell a dazedlooking girl answered her hair needed washing and brushing and her eyes were bloodshot your mum or dad in theyre not talking she said making to close the door again were not reporters rebus fumbled with his id im detective inspector rebus she looked at the id then stared at him rebus she said he nodded you know the name i think so suddenly there was a man behind her he held out a hand to rebus john its been a while rebus nodded at allan renshaw probably thirty years allan the two men were studying each other trying to fit faces to their memories you took me to the football once renshaw said raith rovers wasnt it cant remember who they were playing well you better come in you understand allan im here in an official capacity i heard you were in the police funny how things turn out as rebus followed his cousin down the hall siobhan introduced herself to the young woman who in turn said she was kate dereks sister siobhan remembered the name from the case information youre at university kate st andrews im studying english siobhan couldnt think of anything else to say nothing that wouldnt sound trite or forced so she just made her way down the long narrow hallway past a table strewn with unopened mail and into the living room there were photographs everywhere not just framed and decorating the walls or arranged along the shelving units but spilling from shoeboxes on the floor and coffee table maybe you can help allan renshaw was telling rebus im having trouble putting names to some of the faces he held up a batch of blackandwhite photos there were albums too open on the sofa and showing the growth of two children kate and derek starting with what looked like christening pictures and progressing through summer holidays christmas mornings days out and special treats siobhan knew that kate was nineteen two years older than her brother she knew too that the father worked as a car salesman on seafield road in edinburgh twicein the pub and again on the drive hererebus had explained his connection to the family his mother had had a sister and that sister had married a man called renshaw allan renshaw was their son you never kept in touch she had asked thats not the way our family worked hed replied im sorry about derek rebus was saying now he hadnt managed to find anywhere to sit so he was standing by the fireplace allan renshaw had perched on the arm of the sofa he nodded but then saw that his daughter was about to clear a space so that their visitors could sit were not finished sorting them yet he snapped i just thought kates eyes were filling what about some tea siobhan said quickly maybe we could all sit in the kitchen there was just enough room for the four of them around the table siobhan squeezing past to deal with the kettle and the mugs kate had offered to help but siobhan had cajoled her into sitting down the view from the window above the sink was of a handkerchiefsized garden hemmed in by a picket fence a single dishcloth was pegged to a whirligig dryer and two strips of lawn had been cut the mower stationary now as the grass grew around it there was a sudden noise as the cat flap rattled and a large black and white cat appeared leapt onto kates lap and glared at the newcomers this is boethius kate said ancient queen of britain rebus guessed that was boudicca siobhan corrected him boethius kate explained was a roman philosopher she stroked the cats head its markings rebus couldnt help thinking made it look like it was wearing a batman mask a hero of yours was he siobhan guessed he was tortured for his beliefs kate went on afterwards he wrote a treatise trying to explain why good men suffer she broke off glancing towards her father but he appeared not to have heard while evil men prosper siobhan guessed kate nodded interesting rebus commented siobhan handed out the tea and sat down rebus ignored the mug in front of him perhaps unwilling to draw attention to his bandages allan renshaw had tight hold of the handle of his own mug but seemed in no hurry to try lifting it i had a phone call from alice renshaw was saying you remember alice rebus shook his head wasnt she a cousin on christ whose side was it doesnt matter dad kate said softly it matters kate he argued time like this familys all there is didnt you have a sister allan rebus asked aunt elspeth kate answered shes in new zealand has anyone told her kate nodded what about your mother she was here earlier renshaw interrupted gaze fixed on the table she walked out on us a year ago kate explained she lives with she broke off she lives back in fife rebus nodded knowing what shed been about to say she lives with a man what was the name of that park you took me to john renshaw asked id only have been seven or eight mum and dad had taken me to bowhill and you said youd go for a walk with me remember rebus remembered hed been home on leave from the army itching for some action early twenties sas training still ahead of him the house had felt too small his father too set in a routine so rebus had taken young allan down to the shops theyd bought a bottle of juice and a cheap football then had headed to the park for a kickabout he looked at renshaw now he would be forty his hair was graying with a pronounced bald spot at the crown his face was slack unshaven hed been all skin and bones as a kid but was now heavily built most of it around the waist rebus struggled for some vestige of the kid whod played football with him the kid hed taken to kirkcaldy to watch raith play some forgotten opponent the man in front of him was aging fast wife gone son now murdered aging fast and struggling to cope is anyone looking in rebus asked kate he meant friends neighbors she nodded and he turned back to renshaw allan i know this has been a shock for you do you feel up to answering a few questions whats it like being a policeman john you have to do this sort of thing every day not every day no i couldnt do it bad enough selling cars watching the buyer driving off in this perfect machine big smile on their face and then you watch them coming back for service or repairs or whatever and you see the car losing that shine it once had theyre not smiling anymore rebus glanced at kate who just shrugged he guessed shed been hearing a lot of her fathers ramblings the man who shot derek rebus said quietly were trying to work out why he did it he was a madman but why the school why that particular day you see what im saying youre saying you wont let it lie all we want is to be left alone we need to know allan why renshaws voice was rising whats it going to change you going to bring derek back i dont think so the bastard who did its dead i dont see that anything else matters drink your tea dad kate said a hand reaching for her fathers arm he took it in his own hand held it up to plant a kiss its just us now kate nobody else matters i thought you just told me family mattered the inspectors our family isnt he renshaw looked at rebus again eyes filling with tears then he got up and walked from the room they sat for a moment hearing him climbing the stairs well just leave him kate said sounding sure of her role and comfortable with it she straightened in her seat and pressed her hands together i dont think derek knew the man i mean south queensferrys a village theres always the chance he knew his face maybe even who he was but nothing other than that rebus nodded but stayed quiet hoping she would feel the need to fill the silence it was a game siobhan knew how to play too he didnt pick them out did he kate went on going back to stroking boethius i mean it was just the wrong place at the wrong time we dont know yet rebus responded it was the first room he went into but hed passed other doors to get to it she looked at him dad told me the other boy was a judges son you didnt know him she shook her head not well werent you a pupil at port edgar yes but dereks two years younger than me i think what kate means siobhan clarified is that all the boys in his year were two years younger than her so she wouldnt be disposed to have any interest in them too true kate agreed what about lee herdman did you know him she met rebuss stare then nodded slowly i went out with him once she paused i mean i went out on his boat a bunch of us did we thought waterskiing would be glamorous but it was too much like hard work and he scared the shit out of me in what way if you were on the skis he tried to freak you out pointing the boat towards one of the bridge supports or inch garvie island you know it the one that looks like a fortress siobhan guessed i suppose they must have had guns there during the war cannons or something to stop anyone coming up the forth so herdman tried scaring you rebus asked steering the conversation back on course i think it was some sort of trial to see if your nerve held we all thought he was a maniac she stopped abruptly hearing her own words some of the color left her already pale face i mean i never thought hed nobody did kate siobhan reassured her it took the young woman a few seconds to regain her composure theyre saying he was in the army maybe even a spy rebus didnt know where she was headed but nodded anyway she looked down at the cat who now lay with eyes closed purring loudly this is going to sound crazy rebus leaned forwards what is it kate well its just the first thing that went through my mind when i heard what she looked from rebus to siobhan and then back again no its just too stupid then im your man rebus said giving her a smile she almost smiled back then took a deep breath derek was in a car smash a year back he was okay but the other kid the one who was driving he died siobhan guessed kate nodded neither of them had a license and theyd both been drinking derek felt really guilty about it not that there was a court case or anything so whats it got to do with the shooting rebus asked she shrugged nothing at all its just that when i heard when dad phoned me i suddenly remembered something derek told me a few months after the crash he said the dead boys family hated him and thats why i thought what i did soon as i remembered that the word that jumped into my head was revenge she rose from her chair holding on to boethius placing the cat on the vacant seat i think i should check on dad ill be back in a minute siobhan got up too kate she said how are you coping im fine dont worry about me im sorry about your mother dont be her and dad used to fight all the time at least we dont have that anymore and with another forced smile kate left the kitchen rebus looked at siobhan a slight raising of the eyebrows the only indication that hed heard anything of interest in the past ten minutes he followed siobhan into the living room it was dark outside now and he switched on one of the lamps think i should close the curtains siobhan asked reckon anyone would open them again come morning maybe not then leave them open rebus switched on another lamp this place needs all the light it can get he sifted through some of the photos blurred faces backdrops he recognized siobhan was studying the family portraits lining the room the mothers been erased from history she commented something else rebus said casually she looked at him what he waved an arm towards the shelf units it may be my imagination but seems like there are more photos of derek than there are of kate siobhan saw what he meant what do we make of that i dont know maybe some of the photos of kate had her mother in them too then again they sometimes say the youngest child becomes the parents favorite youre speaking from experience ive got a younger brother if thats what you mean siobhan thought about this do you think you should tell him who your brother tell him he was always the apple of our dads eye no tell him whats happened here that would entail locating his whereabouts you dont even know where your own brother is rebus shrugged thats the way it is siobhan they heard footsteps on the stairs kate came back into the room hes asleep she said hes been sleeping a lot im sure its the best thing siobhan said almost wincing as the cliché trickled out kate rebus interrupted were going to leave you alone now but ive got one last question if thats all right with you i wont know till ive heard it its just this im wondering if you can tell us exactly when and where dereks car crash took place d division headquarters was a venerable old building in the middle of leith the drive from south queensferry hadnt taken too longthe evening traffic had been heading out of the city rather than in the cid offices were quiet rebus reckoned everyone had been pulled to the school shooting he found a member of the admin staff and asked her where the files might be kept siobhan was already stabbing at a keyboard in case she could find anything that way in the end the file was tracked down to one of the storage closets moldering on a shelf alongside hundreds of others rebus thanked the admin clerk happy to help she said this place has been a real graveyard today just as well the villains dont know that rebus said with a wink she snorted its bad enough at the best of times by which she meant understaffing i owe you a drink rebus told her as she turned to go siobhan watched her wave a hand not looking back you didnt even get her name she said i wont be buying her a drink either rebus placed the file on a desk and sat down making room so that siobhan could slide a chair across to join him still seeing jean she asked as he opened the file then she screwed up her face sitting on top of the sheets of paper was a glossy color photograph of the accident scene the dead teenager had been wrenched from the driving seat so that the upper half of his body was sprawled across the car hood there were more photos underneath autopsy shots rebus slid them beneath the file and started to read two friends derek renshaw sixteen and stuart cotter seventeen theyd decided to borrow stuarts dads car a nippy audi tt the father was on a business trip due back later that night flying in and taking a taxi home the boys had plenty of time and decided to drive into edinburgh they had a drink at one of the shoreside bars in leith then headed for salamander street the plan had been to hit the a put the car through its paces then head for home but salamander street looked to them like a nice racing straight it was calculated that theyd probably been doing seventy when stuart cotter lost control the car had tried braking for the light spun across the road up onto the sidewalk and into a brick wall headon derek had been wearing a seat belt and survived stuart despite the airbag had not do you remember this rebus asked siobhan she shook her head he didnt remember it either maybe hed been away or involved in a case of his own if hed come across the report well it was nothing he hadnt seen too many times before young men confusing thrills with stupidity adulthood with risk the name renshaw might have clicked with him but there were a lot of renshaws out there he sought the name of the officer in charge detective sergeant calum mcleod rebus knew him vaguely a good cop meaning the report would be scrupulous i want to know something siobhan said what are we seriously considering that this was a revenge killing no i mean why wait a whole year not even a year to the day thirteen months why wait that long no reason at all so we dont think siobhan its a motive right now i think thats what bobby hogan wants from us he wants to be able to say that lee herdman just lost it one day and decided to top a couple of schoolkids what he doesnt want is for the media to get hold of a conspiracy theory or anything that could make it look as though wed left some stone unturned rebus sighed revenge is the oldest motive there is if we clear stuart cotters family its one less thing to worry about siobhan nodded stuarts fathers a businessman drives an audi tt probably got the money to pay for someone like herdman fine but why kill the judges son and that other kid he wounded why kill himself if it comes to it thats not what a hired assassin does siobhan shrugged youd know more about that than me she flicked through more sheets doesnt say what line of business mr cotter is in ah here it is entrepreneur well that covers a multitude of sins whats his first name rebus had the notebook out but couldnt hold the pen siobhan took it from him william cotter she said writing it down and adding the address family lives in dalmeny wheres that next door to south queensferry sounds posh long rib house dalmeny no street name or anything things must be good in the entrepreneur business rebus studied the word im not even sure i could spell it he read a little further partners name is charlotte runs two tanning salons in the city ive been thinking of trying one of those siobhan said nows your chance rebus was almost at the bottom of the page one daughter teri aged fourteen at the time of the crash making her fifteen now he frowned in concentration and tried as best he could to sift through the other sheets what are you looking for a photo of the family he was in luck ds mcleod had indeed been scrupulous clipping newspaper stories about the case one tabloid had got hold of a family snapshot mum and dad on the sofa son and daughter behind so that only their faces could be seen rebus was fairly sure he recognized the girl teri miss teri what was it shed said to him you can see me whenever you like what the hell had she meant by that siobhan had seen the look on his face not someone else you know bumped into her when i was walking to the boatmans shes changed a bit though he studied the shining makeupfree face the hair seemed mousybrown rather than jetblack dyed her hair powdered her face white with big black eyes and mouth black clothes too a goth you mean thats why you were asking me about heavy metal he nodded think it has anything to do with her brothers death might have theres something else though what it was what she said something about not being sad they were dead they got takeaway food from rebuss favorite curry house on causewayside while the order was being filled a liquor store down the street yielded six bottles of chilled lager fairly abstemious really siobhan said hoisting the shopping bag from the counter you dont honestly think im sharing these rebus stated im sure i can twist your arm they took the provisions to his flat in marchmont parking the car in the last space going the flat was two flights up rebus fumbled to slot the key into the lock ill do it siobhan said inside the flat was musty there was a fug which could have been bottled as eau de bachelor stale food alcohol sweat cds were scattered across the livingroom carpet marking out a trail between the hifi and rebuss favorite chair siobhan left the food on the dining table and went into the kitchen for plates and cutlery there were few signs that anyone had been cooking of late two mugs in the sink a margarine tub open on the draining board its contents spotted with mold a shopping list in the form of a yellow postit note had been stuck to the refrigerator door bread milk marge bacon bsauce wup liq lightbulbs the note was beginning to curl and she wondered how long it had been there when she returned to the living room rebus had managed to put on a cd it was something shed given him as a present violet indiana you like it she asked he shrugged i thought you might meaning he hadnt got around to playing it until now better than some of that dinosaur stuff you play in your car dont forget youre speaking to a dinosaur she smiled and started lifting containers out of the bag glancing over to the hifi she saw rebus chewing on a bandage you cant be that hungry easier to eat with these things off he started unwinding the strips of gauze first one hand and then the other she noticed that he slowed down as he got closer to the end finally both hands were revealed red and blistered and hotlooking he tried flexing his fingers time for some more tablets siobhan suggested he nodded went over to the table and sat down she opened a couple of lagers and they started to eat rebus didnt have a strong grip on his fork but he persevered dripping dollops of sauce onto the table but managing to avoid splashing his shirt they ate in silence other than to comment on the food when theyd finished siobhan cleared the table and wiped it clean better add handi wipes to your shopping list she said what shopping list rebus sat down in his chair resting a second bottle of lager on his thigh can you see if theres any cream are we having dessert i mean in the bathroomantiseptic cream dutifully she checked the cabinet noticing that the bath was full to the brim the water looked cold she came back holding a blue tube for stings and infections she said thatll do he took the tube from her and rubbed a thick layer of white cream over both hands shed opened her second bottle rested against an arm of the sofa want me to let the water out she asked what water the bath you forgot to pull the plug im assuming its the one you say you fell into rebus looked at her whove you been talking to doctor at the hospital he sounded skeptical so much for patient confidentiality rebus muttered well at least hell have told you they really are scalds not burns she twitched her nose thanks for checking up on my story i just knew it wasnt very likely youd be washing dishes now about that bathwater ill do it later he sat back took a swig from his bottle meantime what are we going to do about martin fairstone she shrugged slid down onto the sofa proper what are we supposed to do apparently neither of us killed him talk to any fireman theyll all say the same thing you want to do someone in and get away with it you get them blind drunk and then turn on the chip pan so its something every cop knows too doesnt mean it wasnt an accident were cops siobhan guilty until proven innocent when did fairstone give you that shiner how do you know it was him the look on rebuss face told her he felt insulted by the question she sighed the thursday before he died what happened he mustve been following me i was unloading bags of groceries from the car carrying them into the stairwell when i turned round he was biting into an apple hed lifted it from one of the bags sitting at the curb had this big smile on his face i walked right up to him i was furious now he knew where i lived i gave him a slap she smiled at the memory the apple went flying halfway across the road he could have had you for assault well he didnt he threw a fast right caught me just below the eye i staggered back and tripped over the step landed on my backside he just walked away picking up the apple again as he crossed the road you didnt report it no tell anyone how it happened she shook her head she remembered rebus asking her shed shaken her head then too but knowing knowing he wouldnt have to work too hard only after i found out he was dead she said i went to the boss and told her there was a silence between them bottles were raised to mouths eyes meeting eyes siobhan swallowed and licked her lips i didnt kill him rebus said quietly he made that complaint about you and withdrew it pronto then it was an accident he didnt say anything for a moment then guilty until proven innocent he repeated siobhan lifted her drink heres to the guilty rebus managed a halfsmile that was the last time you saw him he asked she nodded what about you werent you scared hed come back he saw the look she gave him okay not scared then but you must have wondered i took precautions what kind of precautions the usual watched my back tried not to go in or out after dark unless someone else was around rebus rested his head against the back of his chair the music had finished want to hear something else he asked i want to hear you say that the last time you saw fairstone was the time you had that fight id be lying so when did you see him rebus angled his head to look at her the night he died he paused but then you already know that dont you she nodded templer told me i was just out for a drink thats all ended up next to him in a pub we had a bit of a chat about me about the black eye he said it was selfdefense he paused way you tell it maybe it was which pub was it rebus shrugged somewhere near gracemount since when did you start drinking so far from the oxford bar he looked at her so maybe i wanted to talk to him you went hunting for him listen to little miss prosecution color had risen to rebuss face and no doubt half the pub clocked you as cid she stated which is how templer found out is that called leading the witness i can fight my own battles john and hed have put you on the deck every time this bastard had a history of thumping people you saw his record that didnt give you the right were not talking about rights here rebus leapt from the chair and made for the dining table helping himself to a fresh bottle you want one not if im driving your choice thats right john my choice not yours i didnt top him siobhan all i did was rebus swallowed back the words what shed turned her body on the sofa to face him what she repeated i went back to his house she just stared mouth open a fraction he invited me back he invited you rebus nodded the bottle opener trembled in his hand he delegated the job to siobhan who returned the opened bottle to him bastard liked playing games siobhan said we should go back and have a drink bury the hatchet bury the hatchet his exact words and thats what you did he wanted to talk not about you about anything but time hed served cell stories how he grew up usual sob story dad who thumped him mum who didnt care and you sat there and listened i sat there thinking how badly i wanted to smack him but you didnt rebus shook his head he was pretty dopey by the time i left not in the kitchen though in the living room did you see the kitchen rebus shook his head again have you told templer this he made to rub his forehead then remembered that it would hurt like blazes just go home siobhan i had to pull the two of you apart next thing youre back at his house sharing a drink and a chat you expect me to believe that im not asking you to believe anything just go home she stood up i can i know you can look after yourself rebus sounded tired all of a sudden i was going to say i can wash the dishes if you like thats okay ill do them tomorrow lets just get some sleep eh he walked across to the rooms large bay window stared down at the quiet street what time do you want to be picked up eight eight it is she paused someone like fairstone he must have had enemies almost certainly maybe someone saw you with him waited till youd left see you tomorrow siobhan he was a bastard john i keep expecting to hear you say that she deepened her voice worlds better off without him i dont remember saying that you would have though not so long ago she made towards the door ill see you tomorrow he waited expecting to hear the lock click shut instead he could hear a background gurgling of water he drank from the bottle of lager staring from the window she did not emerge onto the street when the livingroom door opened he could hear the bath filling you going to scrub my back too beyond the call of duty she looked at him but a change of clothes wouldnt be a bad idea i can help you sort some out he shook his head really i can manage ill hang around till youre done in the bath just to make sure you can get out again ill be fine ill wait anyway shed walked towards him plucked the lager from his loose grasp lifted it to her mouth better keep the water tepid he warned her she nodded swallowed theres just one thing im curious about what what do you do when you need the toilet he narrowed his eyes i do what a mans got to do something tells me thats as much as i need to know she handed back the bottle ill check the waters not too hot this time round afterwards wrapped in a toweling robe he watched as she emerged at street level looking up and down the sidewalk before making for her car looking up and down the sidewalk checking her back even though the bogeyman had gone rebus knew there were more of them out there plenty of men like martin fairstone teased at school becoming the runt tagging along with gangs who would make jokes about him but growing stronger for it graduating to violence and petty theft the only life he would ever know he had told his story and rebus had listened reckon i need to see a head doctor get myself checked out like see whats on the inside of your head isnt always the same as what you do on the outside does that sound like pish maybe its because im pished theres more whiskey when you need a topup just say the word im not used to doing the whole host bit know what im saying just chantering away here dont pay any heed and more so much more with rebus listening taking small sips of whiskey knowing he was feeling it four pubs hed been to before tracking fairstone down and when the monologue had finally dried up rebus had leaned forwards they were seated in squishy armchairs coffee table between them with a cardboard box beneath in place of the missing leg two glasses a bottle and an overflowing ashtray and rebus leaning forwards now to say his first words in nearly half an hour marty lets put all this shit with ds clarke on the back burner eh fact is i couldnt give a monkeys but there is a question ive been meaning to ask whats that fairstone heavylidded in his chair cigarette held between thumb and forefinger i heard a story that you know peacock johnson anything you can tell me about him rebus at the window thinking about how many painkillers were left in the bottle thinking about nipping out for a proper drink turning from the window and making for his bedroom opening the top drawer and pulling out ties and socks finally finding what hed been looking for winter gloves black leather nylonlined never worn until now day two wednesday there were times when rebus could swear he smelled his wifes perfume on the cold pillow impossible two decades of separation not even a pillow shed slept on or pressed her head against other perfumes tooother women he knew they were an illusion knew he wasnt really smelling them rather he was smelling their absence penny for them siobhan said switching lanes in a halfhearted attempt to speed their progress through the morning rush hour i was thinking about pillows rebus stated shed brought coffee for both of them he was cradling his nice gloves by the way she said now by no means for the first time just the thing this time of year i can get another driver you know but would they provide breakfast she floored the accelerator as the amber traffic light ahead turned red rebus worked hard to keep his coffee from spilling whats the music he asked looking at the incar cd player fatboy slim thought it might wake you up whys he telling jimmy boyle not to leave the states siobhan smiled you might just be mishearing that particular lyric i can put on something more laidback what about tempus fugit why not rebus said lee herdman had lived in a onebedroom flat above a bar on south queensferrys high street the entrance was down a narrow sunless vennel with an arched stone roof a police constable stood guard by the main door checking the names of visitors against a list of residents fixed to his clipboard it was brendan innes what sort of shifts are they making you work rebus asked innes checked his watch another hour ill be out of here anything happening people heading to work how many flats apart from herdmans just the two schoolteacher and his girlfriend in one car mechanic in the other schoolteacher siobhan hinted innes shook his head nothing to do with port edgar he teaches the local primary girlfriend works in a shop rebus knew that the neighbors would have been interviewed the notes would be somewhere you spoken to them at all he asked just as they come and go what do they say innes shrugged the usual he was quiet enough seemed a nice enough guy quiet enough rather than just quiet innes nodded seems mr herdman hosted a few latenighters for his friends enough to rile the neighbors innes shrugged again rebus turned to siobhan weve got a list of his acquaintances she nodded probably not comprehensive as yet youll want this innes was saying he was holding up a yale key siobhan took it from him how messy is it up there rebus asked the search team knew he wasnt coming back innes answered with a smile lowering his head as he started adding their names to his list the downstairs hall was cramped no sign of any recent mail they climbed two flights of stone steps there were a couple of doors on the first landing only one on the second nothing to identify its occupierno name or number siobhan turned the key and they walked in plenty of locks rebus commented including two bolts on the interior side herdman liked his security hard to say how messy the place had been before hogans team made their search rebus picked his way across a floor strewn with clothes and newspapers books and bricabrac they were in the eaves of the building and the rooms seemed claustrophobic rebuss head was barely two feet shy of the ceiling the windows were small and unwashed just the one bedroom double bed wardrobe and chest of drawers portable blackandwhite tv on the uncarpeted floor empty halfbottle of bells next to it greasy yellow linoleum on the floor of the kitchen foldaway table giving just enough room to turn narrow bathroom smelling of mildew two hall closets which looked to have been emptied and hastily rearranged by hogans men leaving only the living room rebus went back in homey wouldnt you say siobhan commented in real estate agent parlance yes rebus picked up a couple of cds linkin park and sepultura the man liked his metal he said tossing them down again liked the sas too siobhan added holding up some books for rebus to see they were histories of the regiment books about conflicts in which it had taken part stories of survival by exmembers she nodded to a nearby desk and rebus saw what she was pointing out a scrapbook of news cuttings these were all about soldiering too whole articles discussing an apparent trend american military heroes who were murdering their wives cuttings about suicides and disappearances there was even one headed space runs out in sas cemetery which rebus paid most attention to he knew men whod been buried in the plots set aside in st martins churchyard not far from the regiments original hq now a new cemetery site was being proposed near the current hq at credenhill in the same piece the deaths of two sas soldiers were mentioned theyd died on a training exercise in oman which could mean anything from a cockup to assassination during covert operations siobhan was peering into a supermarket shopping bag rebus heard the chink of empty bottles he was a good host she said wine or spirits tequila and red wine judging from the empty bottle in the bedroom herdman was a whiskey man like i say a good host siobhan took a sheet of paper from her pocket and unfolded it according to this forensics took away the remains of a number of spliffs plus some traces of what looked like cocaine took his computer too they also removed a number of photographs from the inside of the wardrobe what sort of photos guns bit of a fetish if you ask me i mean putting them on the wardrobe door which makes of gun doesnt say what type of gun did he use again she checked this brocock its an air gun the me magnum to be precise so its like a revolver siobhan nodded you can buy one across the counter for just over a hundred quid powered by gas cylinder but herdmans had been tweaked steel sleeving inside the chamber means you can use live ammo alternative is to drill the gun out to take calibers he used she nodded again so someone did the work for him he mightve done it himself daresay hed have had the knowhow do we know how he came by the gun in the first place as an exsoldier im guessing he had contacts could be rebus was thinking back to the s and s arms and explosives walking off army bases the length and breadth of the land mostly at the behest of both sides of the northern ireland troubles plenty of soldiers had a souvenir tucked away somewhere some knew places where guns could be bought and sold no questions asked and by the way siobhan was saying its guns plural he was carrying more than one she shook her head but one was found during a search of his boathouse she referred to her notes again mac thats a serious gun you know it ingram mac its american thousandroundaminute job not something youd be able to walk into a shop and buy lab seems to think it had been deactivated at one time meaning thats exactly what you could do he tweaked it too or bought it tweaked thank christ he didnt take that one to the school it would have been carnage the room went quiet as they considered this they went back to their search this is interesting she said waving one of the books at him story of a soldier who cracked up tried to kill his girlfriend she studied the jacket jumped from a plane and killed himself truelife by the look of it something fell from between two pages a snapshot siobhan picked it up turned it around for rebus to see tell me its not her again but it was it was teri cotter taken fairly recently she was outdoors other bodies edging into the picture a street scene maybe in edinburgh she looked to be seated on a sidewalk wearing much the same clothes as when shed helped rebus smoke his cigarette she was sticking her studded tongue out towards the photographer she looks cheery siobhan commented rebus was studying the photo he turned it over but the back was blank she said she knew the boys who died never thought to ask if she knew their killer and kate renshaws theory that herdman might connect to the cotters rebus shrugged might be worth looking at herdmans bank account for signs of blood money he heard a door close downstairs sounds like one of the neighbors is home shall we siobhan nodded and they left the flat making sure it was locked behind them on the landing below rebus put an ear first to one door and then to the other finally nodding at the second siobhan banged on it with her fist by the time the door opened she had her id out two surnames on the door the teacher and his girlfriend it was the girlfriend who answered she was short and blond and would have been pretty were it not for a sideways jutting of her jaw which gave her what siobhan guessed was a semipermanent scowl im ds clarke this is di rebus siobhan said mind if we ask you a couple of questions the young woman looked from one to the other we already told the other lot everything we know we appreciate that miss rebus said he saw her eyes drop to stare at his gloves but you do live here right aye we understand that you got on fine with mr herdman even though he could be a bit noisy sometimes just when he had a party like it was never a problemwe raise the roof ourselves now and then you share his taste for heavy metal she wrinkled her nose more of a robbie woman myself she means robbie williams siobhan informed rebus id have worked it out eventually rebus sniffed good news was he only ever played that stuff when he was partying did you ever get an invite she shook her head show miss rebus was talking to siobhan but broke off and smiled at the neighbor sorry i dont know your name hazel sinclair he added a nod to his smile ds clarke can you show miss sinclair but siobhan already had the photograph out she handed it to hazel sinclair its miss teri the young woman stated youve seen her around then of course looks like shes just stepped out of the addams family i often see her down the high street but have you seen her here here sinclair thought about it the effort further distorting her jawline then she shook her head i always thought he was gay anyway he had kids siobhan said taking back the photo doesnt mean much does it lot of gays are married and he was in the army probably a ton of gays in there siobhan tried to suppress a smile rebus shifted his feet besides hazel sinclair was saying it was always guys you saw coming up and down the stairs she paused for effect young guys any of them look as good as robbie sinclair shook her head dramatically id eat breakfast off his backside any day of the week well try to keep that out of our report rebus said dignity intact as both women cracked up with laughter in the car on the way to port edgar marina rebus looked at some photos of lee herdman mostly they were copied from newspapers herdman seemed tall and wiry with a mop of curly graying hair wrinkles around his eyes a face lined with the years tanned too or more likely weatherbeaten glancing out rebus saw that the clouds had gathered overhead covering the sky like a grubby sheet the photos had all been taken outdoors herdman working on his boat or heading out into the estuary in one he gave a wave to whoever had been left ashore there was a broad smile on his face as though this was as good as life could get rebus had never seen the point of sailing he supposed the boats looked pretty enough from a distance when watched from one of the pubs on the waterfront have you ever sailed he asked siobhan ive been on a few ferries i meant on a yacht you know hoisting the spinnaker and all that she looked at him is that what you do with a spinnaker buggered if i know rebus looked up they were passing beneath the forth road bridge the marina down a narrow road just past the huge concrete stanchions that seemed to lift the bridge skywards this was the sort of thing that impressed rebus not nature but ingenuity he thought sometimes that all mans greatest achievements had come from a battle with nature nature provided the problems humans found the solutions this is it siobhan said turning the car through an open gateway the marina was made up of a series of buildingssome more ramshackle than othersand two long jetties jutting out into the firth of forth at one of these a few dozen boats had been moored they passed the marina office and something called the bosuns locker and parked next to the cafeteria according to the notes theres a sailing club a sailmakers and somewhere thatll fix your radar siobhan said getting out she started around to the passenger side but rebus was able to open his own door see he said im not quite at the knackers yard yet but through the material of the gloves his fingers stung he straightened and looked around the bridge was high overhead the rush of cars quieter than hed expected and almost drowned out by the clanging of whatever it was on boats that made that clanging sound maybe it was the spinnakers who owns this place he asked sign at the gate said something about edinburgh leisure meaning the city council which means that technically speaking you and me own it technically speaking siobhan agreed she was busy studying a handdrawn plan herdmans boat shed is on the right past the toilets she pointed down there i think good you can catch me up rebus told her then he nodded towards the cafeteria coffee to go and not too hot not scalding you mean she made for the cafeteria steps sure you can manage on your own rebus stayed by the car as she disappeared the door rattling behind her he took his time lifting cigarettes and lighter from his pocket opened the packet and nipped a cigarette out with his teeth sucking it into his mouth the lighter was a lot easier than matches once hed found a bit of shelter from the wind he was leaning against the car relishing the smoke when siobhan reappeared here you go she said handing him a halffilled cup lots of milk he stared at the pale gray surface thanks together they headed off turning a couple of corners and finding no one around despite the halfdozen cars parked alongside siobhans down here she said leading them ever closer to the bridge rebus had noted that one of the long jetties was actually a wooden pontoon providing tieups for visiting boats this must be it siobhan said tossing her halfempty cup into a nearby bin rebus did the same though hed taken only a couple of sips of the warmish milkyish concoction if there was caffeine in there hed failed to find it bless the lord for nicotine the shed was just that a shed albeit a wellfed example of the species about twenty feet wide knocked together from a mixture of wooden slats and corrugated metal half its width was a sliding door which stood closed two sets of chains lay on the ground evidence that police had forced their way in with bolt cutters a length of blue and white tape had replaced the chains and someone had fixed an official notice to the door warning that entry was prohibited under pain of prosecution a handmade sign above announced that the shed was actually ski and boatprop l herdman catchy title rebus mused as siobhan untied the tape and pushed the door open does exactly what it says on the tin she responded in kind this was where herdman ran his business teaching fledgling sailors and scaring the wits out of his waterskiing clientele inside rebus could see a dinghy maybe a twentyfooter it sat on a trailer whose tires needed some air there were a couple of powerboats too again on trailers their outboard motors gleaming as was a newlooking jet ski the place was almost too tidy as though swept and polished by an obsessive against one wall stood a workbench the tools neatly arrayed on the wall above a single oily rag gave the clue that mechanical work might actually go on here lest the unwary visitor suspect theyd stepped into the marinas exhibit space where was the gun found rebus asked walking in cabinet under the workbench rebus looked a neatly severed padlock lay on the concrete floor the cabinet door was open showing only a selection of ratchets and wrenches dont suppose theres much left for us to find siobhan stated probably not but rebus was still interested curious as to what the space could tell him about lee herdman so far it told him herdman had been a conscientious worker tidying up after himself his flat had indicated a man who wasnt nearly as fussy in his personal life but professionally professionally herdman gave a hundred percent this chimed with his background in the army it didnt matter how messy your personal life might be you didnt let it interfere with your work rebus had known soldiers whose marriages were collapsing but still kept their kit immaculate perhaps because as one rsm had put it the armys the best fucking shag youll ever have what do you think siobhan asked its almost as if he was waiting for a visit from health and safety looks to me like his boats are worth more than his flat agreed signs of a split personality how so chaotic home life quite the opposite at his place of work cheap flat and furnishings expensive boats quite the little psychoanalyst a voice boomed from behind them the speaker was a stocky woman of about fifty hair pulled back so tightly into a bun that it seemed to push her face forwards she was wearing a black twopiece suit and plain black shoes olivecolored blouse with a string of pearls at the neck a black leather backpack was slung over one shoulder next to her stood a tall broadshouldered man maybe half her age black hair cropped short hands pressed together in front of him he wore a dark suit white shirt and navy tie youll be detective inspector rebus the woman said stepping forwards briskly as if to shake hands unfazed when rebus didnt reciprocate her voice had dropped a single decibel im whiteread this is simms her small beady eyes fixed on rebus youve been to the flat i take it di hogan said you might her voice drifted off as she moved just as briskly away from rebus into the interior of the shed she circled the dinghy inspecting it with a buyers eye english accent rebus was thinking im ds clarke siobhan piped up whiteread stared at her and gave the briefest of smiles of course you are she said simms had walked forwards in the meantime repeating his name by way of introduction and then turning to siobhan to go through the exact same procedure but this time with a handshake his accent was english too voice emotionless the pleasantries a formality where was the gun found whiteread asked then she noticed the broken padlock and answered her own question with a nod walking over to the cabinet and squatting down sharply in front of it her skirt rising to just above the knees mac she stated notorious for jamming she stood up again patted her skirt back down better than some kit simms responded introductions over he was standing between rebus and siobhan legs slightly apart back straight hands again clasped in front of him care to show some id rebus asked di hogan knows were here whiteread replied casually she was examining the surface of the workbench now rebus followed her slowly i asked you for id he said im well aware of that whiteread said her attention shifting to what looked like a small office at the rear of the building she made off towards it rebus at her heels youre marching he warned her dead giveaway she said nothing the office had once sported a large padlock but it too had been broken open and the door fixed shut afterwards with more policeissue tape plus your partner used the word kit rebus went on whiteread peeled the tape away and looked inside desk chair a single filing cabinet no space for anything else other than what looked like a twoway radio on a shelf no computers or copiers or fax machines the desk drawers had been opened contents examined whiteread lifted out a sheaf and started flipping through youre army rebus stated into the silence you might be in mufti but youre still army no women in the sas as far as i know so what does that make you she snapped her head towards him it makes me someone who can help help what with this sort of thing she went back to her work to stop it from happening again rebus stared at her siobhan and simms were standing just outside the door siobhan call bobby hogan for me i want to know what he knows about these two he knows were here whiteread said not looking up he even told me we might be bumping into you how else would i know your name siobhan had the mobile in her hand make the call rebus told her whiteread stuffed the paperwork back into its drawer and pushed it shut you never quite made it into the regiment did you di rebus she turned slowly towards him way i hear it the training broke you how come youre not in uniform rebus asked it scares some people whiteread said is that it couldnt be that you dont want to add to all the bad publicity rebus was smiling coldly doesnt look good when one of your own throws a maddie does it last thing you want is to remind everybody that he was one of yours whats done is done if we can stop it from happening again so much the better she paused standing right in front of him half a foot shorter but every bit his equal why should you have a problem with that now she returned his smile if his had been cold hers came straight from the deep freeze you fell down didnt make the grade no need to let that get to you detective inspector rebus heard detective as defective either her accent or shed been trying for the pun siobhan had been connected but it was taking a few moments for hogan to come to the phone we should take a look in the boat whiteread said to her partner squeezing past rebus theres a ladder simms said rebus tried to place the accent lancashire or yorkshire maybe whiteread he wasnt so sure about home counties whatever that meant a kind of generic english as taught in the posher schools rebus realized too that simms didnt appear comfortable in either his suit or this role maybe it was a class thing again or maybe he was new to both first names john by the way rebus told him whats yours simms looked to whiteread well tell the man she snapped gav gavin gav to your friends gavin when on business rebus guessed siobhan was handing him the phone he took it bobby what the hell are you doing letting two numpties from her majestys armed forces crawl all over our case he paused to listen then spoke again i used the word advisedly bobby as theyre about to start crawling over herdmans boat another pause thats hardly the point though and then okay okay were on our way he pushed the phone back into siobhans hand simms was steadying the ladder while whiteread climbed were just away rebus called to her and if we dont see each other again well ill be crying inside believe me the smile will just be for show he waited for the woman to say something but she was aboard now and seemed to have lost interest in him simms was climbing the ladder giving a backwards glance at the two detectives ive half a mind rebus said to siobhan to grab the ladder and run for it i dont think that would stop her do you probably right he admitted then raising his voice one last thing whitereadyoung gav was looking up your skirt as rebus turned to leave he shrugged at siobhan as if to acknowledge that the shot had been cheap cheap but worthwhile i mean it bobby what the hells the matter with you rebus was walking down one of the schools long corridors towards what looked very much like a floortoceiling safe the old kind with a wheel and some tumblers it stood open as did an interior steel gate hogan was staring inside god almighty man those bastards have no place here john hogan said quietly i dont think youve met the principal he gestured into the vault where a middleaged man was standing surrounded by enough guns to start a revolution dr fogg hogan said by way of introduction fogg stepped over the threshold he was a short stocky man with the look of a onetime boxer one ear seemed puffy and his nose covered half his face a nick of scar tissue cut through one of his bushy eyebrows eric fogg he said shaking rebuss hand sorry about my language back there sir im di john rebus working in a school you hear worse fogg stated making it sound like something hed said a hundred times before siobhan had caught up and was about to introduce herself when she saw the contents of the vault jesus christ she exclaimed my thoughts exactly rebus agreed as i was explaining to di hogan fogg began most independent schools have something like this on the premises ccf is that right dr fogg hogan added fogg nodded the combined cadet forcearmy navy and air force cadets they parade each friday afternoon he paused i think a big incentive is that they can eschew school uniforms that day for something slightly more paramilitary rebus guessed automatic semiautomatic and other weapons hogan recited probably deters the odd housebreaker actually fogg said i was just telling di hogan that if the schools alarm system is activated the responding police units are instructed to make for the armory first it dates back to when the ira and suchlike were looking for guns youre not saying the ammos kept here too siobhan asked fogg shook his head theres no live ammo on the premises but the guns are real enough theyre not deactivated oh theyre real enough he looked at the contents of the vault with something approaching distaste youre not a fan rebus guessed i think the practice is slightly in danger of outliving its useful application there speaks a diplomat rebus said forcing a smile from the principal herdman didnt get his gun from here siobhan was asking hogan shook his head thats another thing im hoping the army investigators might help us with he looked at rebus always supposing you cant give us a break bobby weve hardly been here five minutes do you do any teaching sir siobhan asked fogg hoping to defuse any argument her two senior officers might be thinking of starting fogg shook his head i used to rmereligious and moral education instilling a sense of morality in teenagers that mustve been tough ive yet to meet a teenager who started a war the voice rang slightly false another prepared answer to an oftput point only because we dont tend to give them the firepower rebus commented staring again at the array of arms fogg was relocking the iron gate so nothings missing rebus asked hogan shook his head but both victims were in the ccf rebus looked at fogg who nodded confirmation anthony was a very keen member derek a little less so anthony jarvies the judges son his father roland jarvies was well known in scottish courts rebus had probably given evidence fifteen or twenty times in cases over which lord jarvies had presided with wit and what one lawyer had described as a gimlet eye rebus wasnt sure what a gimlet eye was but he got the idea we were wondering siobhan was saying whether anyones been looking at herdmans bank or credit union hogan studied her his accountants been very helpful business wasnt going to the wall or anything but no sudden deposits rebus asked hogan narrowed his eyes why rebus glanced in the principals direction he hadnt meant for fogg to notice but he did would you like me to fogg said were not quite finished dr fogg if thats all right hogans eyes met rebuss im sure whatever di rebus wants to say will be kept between us of course fogg stressed he had locked the door of the vault and now turned the combination wheel the other kid who was killed rebus started to explain to hogan he was in a car crash last year the driver was killed were wondering if its too far back for revenge to be a motive doesnt explain why herdman would top himself after botched job maybe siobhan said folding her arms two other kids got hit herdman panicked so when you talk about herdmans bank youre thinking a big recent deposit rebus nodded ill get someone to take a look only thing weve got from his business accounts is a missing computer oh siobhan asked if it could be a tax dodge could be hogan agreed but theres a receipt weve talked to the shop that sold him the setuptop of the line reckon he ditched it rebus asked why would he do that rebus shrugged perhaps to cover something up fogg suggested when they looked at him he lowered his eyes not that its my place to dont apologize sir hogan reassured him you might have a good point hogan rubbed a hand across his eyes turned his attention back to rebus anything else these army bastards rebus began hogan held up the same hand you just have to accept them come on theyre not here to shed any light if anything itll be the opposite they want his sas past forgotten hence the plainclothes for whiteread read whitewash look im sorry if theyre stepping on your toes or trampling us to death rebus interrupted john this investigations bigger than you and me bigger than anything hogans voice had risen quavering slightly last thing i need is this sort of shit language please bobby rebus said glancing meaningfully towards fogg as rebus had hoped hogan started to remember rebuss own recent outburst and his face cracked into a smile just get on with it eh were on your side bobby siobhan took a step forwards one thing wed like to doshe ignored rebuss gaze a gaze that said this was the first hed heard of itis interview the survivor hogan frowned james bell what for his eyes were on rebus but it was siobhan who answered because he survived and hes the only one in the room who did weve talked to him half a dozen times kids in shock god knows what else wed go easy siobhan insisted quietly you might but then its not you that worries me his eyes were still on rebus itd be good to hear it from someone who was there rebus said how herdman acted anything he said nobody seems to have seen him that morning not the neighbors no one at the marina we need to fill in some of the blanks hogan sighed first of all listen to the tapes meaning recordings of the interviews with james bell if you still think you need to see him facetoface well well see thank you sir siobhan said feeling the moment merited a certain formality i said well see no promises hogan raised a warning finger and take another look at his finances rebus added just in case hogan nodded tiredly ah there you are a voice boomed jack bell was marching down the corridor towards them oh christ hogan muttered but bells attention was focused on the principal eric he said loudly what the hells this im hearing that you wont go on the record about the schools inadequate security the school had adequate security jack fogg said with a sigh indicating that this was an argument hed had before complete rubbish and you know it look all im trying to do is highlight that the lessons of dunblane have not been learned he held up a finger our schools still arent safe a second finger was raised and guns are flooding the streets he paused for effect and somethings got to be done you must see that his eyes narrowed i could have lost my son a school is not a fortress jack the principal pleaded but to no effect nineteen ninetyseven bell steamrollered on aftermath of dunblane hand weapons above were banned legitimate owners surrendered their weapons and what did that leave us he looked around but no answer was forthcoming the only people hanging on to their guns were the underworld who seem to find it increasingly easy to get hold of any amount of armaments they desire youre preaching to the wrong audience rebus stated bell stared at him maybe i am he agreed pointing a finger because you lot seem utterly incapable of tackling the problem to any degree whatsoever now hang on sir hogan started to argue let him rattle on bobby rebus interrupted the hot air might help keep the school heated how dare you bell snarled what makes you think you can talk to me like that i suppose i just elected to rebus retorted stressing the word reminding the msp of the precarious nature of his calling in the silence that followed bells mobile phone began to trill he managed a sneer in rebuss direction before turning on his heels moving a few paces back down the corridor as he answered the call yes what glanced at his wristwatch is it radio or tv listened again local radio or national ill only do national he kept walking leaving his audience to relax a little sharing looks and gestures right the principal was saying i suppose id best get back to mind if i walk you to your office sir hogan asked couple more things we need to talk about he nodded to rebus and siobhan back to work he said yes sir siobhan agreed suddenly the corridor was empty save for rebus and her she puffed out her cheeks then exhaled noisily bells a real piece of work rebus nodded hes ready to exploit this whole thing to the hilt he wouldnt be a politician if he didnt natural instincts eh funny how things turn out his career could have gone down the toilet pan after he was nabbed in leith think he wants a spot of revenge hell drag us down if he can we have to make sure were moving targets and that was you being a moving target was it answering him back like that mans got to have a little fun siobhan rebus stared down the empty corridor you think bobbys going to be okay he looked knackered if im being honest by the way you dont think he needs to be told told what that the renshaws are your family rebus fixed her with his eyes might lead to complications i dont think bobby needs any more of those right now its your decision thats right it is and we both know im never wrong id forgotten that siobhan said happy to remind you ds clarke always happy to oblige the south queensferry police station was a squat box most of it singlestory sited across the road from an episcopal church a notice outside stated that the station was open for public inquiries between nine and five on weekdays manned by a civilian assistant another notice explained that there was contrary to local rumors a twentyfourhour police presence in the town this soulless spot was where the witnesses had been interviewed all except james bell cozy isnt it siobhan said pulling open the front door there was a short narrow waiting area its only inhabitant a constable who put down his bike magazine and lifted himself from his seat at ease rebus told him while siobhan showed her id we need to listen to the bell tapes the officer nodded and unlocked an interior door leading them into a dispiriting windowless room the desk and chairs had seen better days last years calendarpromoting the merits of a local shopcurled on one wall there was a tape player on top of a filing cabinet the uniform lifted it down and plugged it in placing it on the desk then he unlocked the cabinet and found the correct tape sealed in a clear plastic bag this is the first of six he explained youll need to sign for it siobhan did the necessary any ashtrays around here rebus asked no sir smokings not allowed that was more information than i needed yes sir the constable was trying not to stare at rebuss gloves is there so much as a kettle no sir the constable paused neighbors sometimes drop off a flask or a bit of cake any chance of that happening in the next ten minutes unlikely id say off you go and do some foraging then see what marks you can get for initiative the constable hesitated im supposed to stay here well guard the fort son rebus said sliding off his jacket and hanging it over the back of a chair the constable looked skeptical ill take mine white rebus said me too no sugar siobhan added the constable stood there a moment or two longer watching them get as comfortable as the room would allow then he backed out and closed the door slowly after him rebus and siobhan looked at each other and shared a complicit smile siobhan had brought the notes relevant to james bell and rebus reread them while she took the tape out and slotted it home eighteen son of the msp jack bell and his wife felicity who worked as an administrator at the traverse theatre the family lived in barnton james intended going to university to study politics and economics a competent pupil according to the school james goes his own way not always outgoing but can turn on the charm when necessary he preferred chess to sports probably not ccf material rebus mused a moment later he was listening to james bells voice the interviewing officers identified themselves di hogan dc hood a shrewd move involving grant hood being press liaison officer on the case he would need to know the survivors story some of it might provide morsels that he could offer the journos in return for favors it was important to have the media on your side important too to maintain as much control over them as possible they wouldnt be getting near james bell yet theyd have to go through grant hood bobby hogans voice identified the date and timemonday eveningand the scene of the interviewa ampe at the royal infirmary bell had been wounded in the left shoulder a clean shot ripping through flesh missing bones exiting again the bullet lodged in the wall of the common room are you up to talking james i think so hurts like buggery im sure it does for the tape then you are james elliot bell is that correct yes elliot siobhan asked mothers maiden name rebus explained checking the notes again very little background noise had to be a private room at the hospital a clearing of the throat from grant hood the squall of a squeaky chair hood probably holding the mike his chair closest to the bed turning the mike between hogan and the boy not always timing it right so that a voice was sometimes muffled can you tell me what happened jamie please my names james could i have some water the sound of the mike being laid down on top of bedclothes water poured thank you a pause until the cup was replaced on the bedside table rebus thought of his own cup falling siobhan catching it like james bell on monday night he too had been in the hospital it was midmorning break we get twenty minutes i was in the common room was that your usual hangout better there than the grounds it wasnt a bad day though warm enough i prefer to be inside do you think ill be able to play the guitar when i get out of here i dont know hogan said could you play before you came in you spoiled the patients punch line shame on you sorry about that james so how many of you were in the common room three tony jarvies derek renshaw and me and what were you doing there there was some music on the hifi i think jarvies was doing homework renshaw was reading the paper is that how you talk to one another using surnames most of the time the three of you were friends not especially but you often spent time together in the common room more than a dozen of us use that room a pause are you trying to ask me if i think he targeted us deliberately its one thing were wondering about why because it was break time lots of pupils outdoors but he walked into the school into the common room before he started shooting youd make a good detective james its not high on my list of career options did you know the gunman yes you knew him lee herdman yes quite a lot of us knew him some of us took waterskiing lessons and he was an interesting guy interesting his background the man was a trained killer after all he told you that yes he was in special forces did he know anthony and derek quite possibly but he knew you wed met socially then youve maybe been asking yourself the same question we have you mean why did he do it yes ive heard that people with his sort of background they dont always fit into society do they something happens and it tips them over the edge any idea what tipped lee herdman over the edge no a long pause followed the mike muffled against the sheets as the two detectives seemed to confer then hogans voice again so can you take us through it james you were in the room id just put on a cd one thing the three of us didnt share was musical taste when the door opened i dont think i even bothered looking round then there was this horrendous explosion and jarvies collapsed id been crouching in front of the hifi but i stood up again turning i saw this hugelooking gun i mean im not saying it was particularly large but it seemed that way pointing at renshaw now there was a figure behind the gun but i couldnt really see him because of the smoke no i dont remember smoke the only thing i seemed to be able to focus on was the gun barrel i was sort of frozen then a second explosion and renshaw sort of collapsed like a puppet just crumpled to the floor rebus found that hed closed his eyes it wasnt the first time hed pictured the scene then he turned the gun on me did you know who he was by this point yes i suppose so did you say anything i dont know maybe i opened my mouth to say something i think i must have started moving because when the shot came it well it didnt kill me did it it was like a hard shove pushing me back and over he hadnt said anything up to this point not a word mind you my ears were ringing small room like that im not surprised is your hearing okay now theres still a hissing but they say thatll go away he didnt say anything i didnt hear him say anything i just lay there getting ready to play dead and then there was the fourth shot and for a split second i thought it was me finishing me off but when i heard the body fall i sort of knew what did you do i opened my eyes i was at floor level and i could see his body through the legs of the chair he still had the gun in his hand i started to get up my shoulder was feeling numb and i knew there was blood pouring out but i couldnt take my eyes off the gun i know thisll sound ridiculous but i was thinking of those horror films you know hoods voice where you think the bad guys dead and he keeps coming back to life yes and then there were people in the doorway teaching staff i suppose they must have got a hell of a shock what about you james you bearing up to be honest im not sure its really hit me yetpardon the pun were all being offered counseling i suppose thatll help youve been through an ordeal i have havent i something to tell the grandkids i suppose hes so calm about it siobhan said rebus nodded we really appreciate you talking to us would it be okay if we left you a notepad and pen you see james youre probably going to find yourself going back over it time and again in your mindand thats good its how we deal with things like this but maybe youll remember something and want to write it down putting it all down is one more way of dealing with it yes i can see that and well want to talk to you again hoods voice as will the media its up to you whether you want to say anything to them but i can talk you through it if you like i wont be talking to anybody for a day or two and dont worry i know all about the media well thanks again for this james i think your mum and dad are waiting outside look im feeling a bit tired after everything do you think you could tell them ive nodded off at which point the tape went dead siobhan let it run for a few more seconds then switched off the machine end of first interviewwant to listen to another she nodded towards the filing cabinet rebus shook his head not for now but id still like to talk to him he said he says he knew herdman that makes him relevant he also says he doesnt know why herdman did it all the same he sounded so calm probably the shock hood was right it takes time to sink in siobhan was thoughtful why do you think he didnt want to see his parents are you forgetting who his dad is yes but all the same something like that happens doesnt matter what age you are you want a hug rebus looked at her do you most people would most normal people i mean a knock at the door it opened a fraction and the constables head appeared no joy with the drinks he said were done here anyway thanks for trying they left the constable to lock the tape away again and headed out squinting into the daylight james didnt tell us much did he siobhan said no rebus admitted he was replaying the interview in his mind seeking anything they could use the only glimmer james bell had known herdman but so what plenty of people in the town had known lee herdman shall we head up the high street see if we can find a café i know where we can get a cuppa rebus said where same place we got one yesterday allan renshaw hadnt shaved since the day before he was alone in the house having sent kate out to see some friends not good for her being cooped up here with me he said as he led them through to the kitchen the living room hadnt been touched photos still waiting to be pored over sorted or shoved back into their boxes rebus noted that some remembrance cards had appeared on the mantelpiece renshaw picked up a remote from the arm of the sofa and switched off the tv a video had been playing homemade family holiday rebus decided not to comment renshaws hair stuck up in places and rebus wondered if hed slept in his clothes renshaw sat down heavily on one of the kitchen chairs leaving siobhan to fill the kettle boethius was lying on the countertop and siobhan made to stroke him but the cat leapt onto the floor and padded through to the living room rebus sat down opposite his cousin just wondered how you were he said sorry i left you with kate the other night no need to apologize you sleeping okay far too much a humorless smile a way of shutting it all out i suppose how are the funeral arrangements they wont let us have his body not just yet itll be soon allan itll all be over soon renshaw looked up at him with bloodshot eyes you promise john he waited till rebus nodded then how come the phone keeps ringing reporters wanting to talk to me they dont think its going to end soon yes they do thats why theyre pestering you theyll move on somewhere else in a day or so just you watch anyone in particular you want me to chase off theres a guy kates talked to he seems to upset her whats his name its written down somewhere renshaw looked around as if the name might be right there under his nose next to the phone maybe rebus guessed he got up and walked back into the hall the phone was on a ledge just inside the front door rebus picked it up hearing only silence he saw that the line had been disconnected at its wall jack kates work there was a pen next to the phone but no paper he looked over towards the stairs and saw a pad scribbled names and numbers on its top sheet rebus walked back through to the kitchen placing the notepad on the table steve holly he announced thats the name renshaw agreed siobhan whod been pouring tea paused and looked at rebus they both knew steve holly he worked for a glasgow tabloid and had proved his nuisance value in the past ill have a word rebus promised reaching into his pocket for the painkillers siobhan handed around the mugs and sat down you okay she asked fine rebus lied what happened to your hands john renshaw asked rebus shook his head nothing allan hows the tea its fine but renshaw made no move to drink rebus stared at his cousin thinking of the tape of james bells calm narrative derek didnt suffer rebus said quietly probably didnt know anything about it renshaw nodded if you dont believe me well one day soon youll be able to ask james bell hell tell you another nod i dont think i know him james derek had a lot of friends but i dont think he was one of them he was friends with anthony jarvies though siobhan asked oh aye tony was round here a lot theyd help each other with homework listen to music what sort rebus asked jazz mostly miles davis coleman something i forget the names derek said he was going to buy a tenor sax learn to play it when he went to university kate was saying derek didnt know the man who shot him did you know him allan id seen him in the pub bit of a loners not the right word but he wasnt always in company used to disappear for days at a time hill walking or something or maybe away on that boat of his allan if this is out of order youve every right to say so renshaw looked at him what i was wondering if i could maybe take a look at dereks room renshaw climbed the stairs in front of rebus siobhan at the rear he opened the door for them but stood aside to let them enter havent really had a chance to he apologized not that the place is the bedroom was small dark with the curtains closed mind if i open them rebus asked renshaw just shrugged unwilling to cross the threshold rebus pulled the curtains apart the window looked down onto the back garden where the dishcloth still hung from the whirligig the mower still stood on the lawn there were prints on the walls moody blackandwhite shots of jazz players photos torn from magazines showing elegant young women in repose bookshelves a hifi a fourteeninch combination tvvcr a desk with a laptop computer connected to a printer barely leaving space for the single bed rebus looked at the spines of some of the cds ornette coleman coltrane john zorn archie shepp thelonious monk there was some classical stuff too draped over a chair a running vest and shorts a sheathed tennis racket derek was into sports rebus remarked did a lot of jogging and crosscountry who did he play tennis with tony a few others didnt get any of it from me ill tell you that renshaw looked down at himself as if assessing his girth siobhan gave him the smile she felt was expected she knew though that there was nothing natural about anything he said it was coming from a small part of his brain while the rest still reeled in horror he liked dressing up too rebus said holding up a framed photo of derek with anthony jarvies both in their ccf uniforms and caps renshaw stared at it from the safety of the doorway derek only joined because of tony he said rebus remembered eric fogg saying much the same thing did they ever go out sailing together siobhan asked might have done kate tried waterskiing renshaws voice died his eyes widened slightly that bastard herdman took her out in his boat her and some friends if i ever see him hes dead allan rebus said reaching out to touch his cousins arm football down in the park in bowhill young allan grazing his knee on the pavement rebus rubbing a dock leaf over the broken skin i had a family but i let them get away his wife estranged daughter in england brother god knew where see when they bury him renshaw was saying ive a good mind to dig him up and kill him again rebus squeezed the arm watching the mans eyes brim with fresh tears lets go down he said guiding renshaw back to the top of the stairs there was just enough room for them to stand side by side in the passageway two grown men hanging on allan rebus said any chance we could borrow dereks laptop his laptop rebus stayed silent whats the point of i dont know john just for a day or two ill bring it back renshaw seemed to be having difficulty making sense of the request i suppose if you think thanks allan rebus turned his head nodding to siobhan who retreated back up the staircase rebus took renshaw into the living room seating him on the sofa renshaw immediately picked up a handful of photographs i need to get these sorted he said what about work how long are you off for they said i could go back after the funeral its a quiet time of year maybe ill come and see you rebus said its time i traded my junk heap in ill look after you renshaw promised looking up at rebus you see if i dont siobhan appeared in the doorway laptop tucked beneath her arm trailing cables we better be going rebus said to renshaw ill look in again allan youll always be welcome john renshaw made the effort to stand up reaching out a hand then he pulled rebus to him in a sudden embrace slapping his hands against rebuss back rebus returned the gesture wondering if he looked as awkward as he felt but siobhan had averted her eyes studying the tips of her shoes as if to assess their need for a polish when they walked out to the car rebus realized he was sweating his shirt sticking to him was it hot in there not especially siobhan said you still running a temperature looks like it he mopped his brow with the back of one glove why the laptop no reason really rebus met her look maybe to see if theres anything about the car crash how derek felt whether anyone blamed him apart from the parents you mean rebus nodded maybe i dont know he sighed what maybe i just want to go through it to get a sense of the lad he was thinking of allan perhaps even now switching the tv back on and settling down with the video remote bringing his son back to life in color and sound and movement but only a facsimile contained by the tight confines of the box siobhan nodded and bent down to slide the laptop onto the backseat of the car i can understand that she said but rebus wasnt so sure that she could you keep up with your family he asked her a phone call every other weekend he knew both her parents were alive lived down south rebuss mother had died young hed been in his midthirties when his father had joined her did you ever want a sister or brother he asked sometimes i suppose she paused something happened to you didnt it how do you mean i dont know exactly she thought about it i think at some point you decided that a family was a liability because it could make you weak as youve already surmised i was never one for hugs and kisses maybe so but you hugged your cousin back there he got into the passenger seat and closed his door the painkillers were coating his brain in bubble wrap just drive he said she put the key in the ignition where rebus remembered something get your mobile out and call the portakabin she pushed the numbers and relinquished the phone to his outstretched hand when it was answered rebus asked to speak to grant hood grant its john rebus listen i need a number for steve holly any particular reason hes been hassling one of the families i thought id have a quiet word hood cleared his throat rebus remembered the same sound from the tape and wondered if it was becoming a regular thing with hood when the number came rebus repeated it so siobhan could note it down hold on a minute john boss wants a word meaning bobby hogan bobby rebus said news on that bank account what the bank account any big deposits jog your memory at all never mind that there was urgency in hogans voice what is it rebus prompted seems lord jarvies put away one of herdmans old pals oh aye when was this just last year guy by the name of robert nilesring any bells rebus furrowed his brow robert niles he repeated siobhan nodded made a slashing motion across her neck the guy who cut his wifes throat thats the one hogan said found fit to plead guilty verdict and life from lord jarvies i got a call seems herdmans been a regular visitor to niles ever since what was it nine ten months back they put him in barlinnie but he flipped went for another prisoner then started cutting at himself so wheres he now carbrae special hospital rebus was thoughtful you think herdman was after the judges son its a possibility revenge and all that yes revenge that word now hung over both the dead boys im going to see him hogan was saying niles is he fit to see anyone seems like want to tag along bobby im flattered why me because niles is exsas john served alongside herdman if anyone knows the inside of lee herdmans head its him a killer locked up in a psycho ward my arent we lucky the offers there john when i was thinking first thing tomorrow its a couple of hours by car count me in good man who knows you might get stuff out of niles empathy and all that you think so way i see it one look at your hands and hell take you for a fellow sufferer hogan was chuckling as rebus handed the phone to siobhan she ended the call i got most of that she said her phone chirruped immediately it was gill templer how come rebus never answers his phone templer bellowed i think he has it switched off siobhan said eyes on rebus he cant push the buttons funny ive always taken him for an expert at pushing buttons siobhan smiled especially yours she thought do you want him she asked i want the pair of you back here templer said pronto with no excuses whats happened youve got trouble thats what the worst kind templer let her words hang in the air siobhan saw what she must mean the papers bingo someones on to the story only theyve added some bells and whistles that id like john to explain to me what sort of bells and whistles he was spotted leaving the pub with martin fairstone walking home with him in fact spotted leaving too a good while later and just before the house went up in flames the paper in question is getting ready to lead with it were on our way ill be waiting the phone went dead siobhan started the car weve to go back to st leonards she informed rebus going on to explain why which paper is it was all rebus said at the end of a lengthy silence i didnt ask call her again siobhan looked at him but made the call give me the phone rebus ordered dont want you going off the road he took the phone and held it to his ear asked to be put through to the chief supers office its john he said when templer answered whos got the story reporter by the name of steve holly and the sods like a terrier at a lamppost convention i knew it would look bad rebus explained to templer thats why i didnt say anything they were in templers office at st leonards she was seated rebus standing she held a sharpened pencil in one hand manipulating it studying its tip maybe weighing it as a weapon you lied to me i just left out a few details gill a few details none of them relevant you went back to his house we had a drink together just you and a known criminal whod been threatening your closest colleague whod made an allegation of assault against you i had a word with him we didnt argue or anything rebus began to fold his arms but this served to increase the blood pressure in his hands so he unfolded them again ask the neighbors see if they heard raised voices ill tell you right now they didnt we were drinking whiskey in the living room not the kitchen rebus shook his head i wasnt in the kitchen all night what time did you leave no idea gone midnight easy not long before the fire then long enough she stared at him the man had had a skinful gill weve all seen it they get the munchies turn on the chip pan and fall asleep its either that or the lit cigarette down the side of the sofa templer tested the pencils sharpness against her finger how much trouble am i in rebus asked the silence getting to him depends on steve holly he makes a song and dance we have to be seen to be doing something about it like putting me on suspension it had crossed my mind i dont suppose i could blame you thats awfully magnanimous john why did you go to his house he asked me i think he liked playing games thats all siobhan was to him then i came along he sat there feeding me drinks spouting on about his adventures i think it gave him a buzz and what did you think you were going to get out of it i dont know exactly i thought it might distract him from siobhan she asked you for help no no ill bet she didnt siobhan can fight her own battles rebus nodded so its a coincidence fairstone was a disaster waiting to happen its a blessing he didnt take anyone else with him a blessing i wont be losing too much sleep gill no i suppose that would be too much to ask rebus straightened his back held on to the silence embracing it templer flinched shed drawn a bead of blood from her finger with the pencil tip final warning john she said dropping her hand unwilling to deal with the injurythat sudden fallibilityin front of him yes gill final means final with me i understand want me to fetch a bandaid his hand reached for the doorknob i want you to leave if youre sure theres nothing out rebus closed the door after him feeling the muscles in his legs starting to work again siobhan was standing not ten feet away one questioning eyebrow raised rebus gave her an awkward thumbsup and she shook her head slowly i dont know how you get away with it he wasnt sure he knew either let me buy you a drink he said cafeteria coffee all right thats pushing the boat out im on a final warning its hardly the winning goal at hampden more of a throwin at easter road she managed a smile from him he felt an aching in his jaw the feeling of sustained tension that a simple smile could displace downstairs however it was chaos people milled around the interview rooms all seemed to be full rebus recognized faces from leith cid meaning hogans team he grabbed an elbow whats going on the face glowered at him then softened as he was recognized the detective constables name was pettifer hed been only half a year in cid already he was toughening up nicely leiths jampacked pettifer explained thought wed use st leonards for the overflow rebus looked around pinched faces illfitting clothes bad haircuts the cream of edinburghs lower depths informers junkies touts scammers housebreakers muscle alkies the station was filling with their mingled scents their slurred expletivestrewn protestations theyd fight anyone anytime where were their lawyers nothing to drink needing a pish what was the game what about human rights no dignity in this fascist state detectives and uniforms tried for a semblance of order taking names details pointing to a room or a bench where a statement could be taken everything denied a muttered complaint made the younger men had a swagger not yet ground down by the constant attentions of the law they smoked despite the warning signs rebus bummed a cigarette from one of them he wore a checked baseball cap its rim pointing skywards rebus reckoned one gust of edinburgh wind would have the thing sailing from its owners head like a frisbee no done nothing like the youth said twitching one shoulder just helping out so they says dinne want nothing to do with shooters chief thats the gospel pass it along eh he winked a snakes cold eye one good turn and all that meaning the rumpled cigarette rebus nodded moved off again bobbys looking for whoever might have supplied the guns rebus told siobhan rounding up the usual desperadoes thought i recognized some faces aye and not from judging any bonny baby contests rebus studied the menthey were all men easy to see them as mere debris work hard enough and you might find a smear of sympathy somewhere in your soul these were men on whom the fates had decided not to shine men whod been brought up to respect greed and fear men whose whole lives had been tainted from the word go rebus believed this he saw families where the children ran wild and would grow up indifferent to anything but the rules of survival in what they saw as a jungle neglect was almost in their genes cruelty made people cruel with some of these young men rebus had known their fathers and grandfathers too criminality in their blood aging the one and only disincentive to their recidivism these were basic facts but there was a problem by the time rebus and his like had reason to confront these men the damage was already done and in many cases appeared irreversible so there could be little room for sympathy instead it came down to attrition and then there were men like peacock johnson peacock wasnt his real name of course it was because of the shirts he wore shirts that could curdle any hangover an onlooker might be harboring johnson was lowlife masquerading as high he made money and spent it too the shirts were often custommade by a tailor in one of the narrow lanes of the new town johnson sometimes affected a homburg and had grown a thin black mustache probably thinking he looked like kid creole his dental work was goodwhich by itself would have marked him out from his fellow denizensand he used his smile prodigally he was a piece of work rebus knew he was in his late thirties but could pass for either ten years older or a decade younger depending on his mood and outfit he went everywhere with a runt of a guy named evil bob bob sported what was almost a uniform baseball cap tracksuit top baggy black jeans and oversized sneakers gold rings on his fingers id bracelets on both wrists chains around his neck he had an oval spotty face with a mouth that hung open almost permanently giving him a look of constant bewilderment some people said that evil bob was peacocks brother if so rebus guessed some cruel genetic experiment had taken place the tall nearly elegant johnson and his brutish sidekick as for the evil in evil bob as far as anyone knew it was just a name as rebus watched the two men were being separated bob was to follow a cid officer upstairs to where a space was newly available johnson was about to accompany dc pettifer into interview room rebus glanced towards siobhan then pushed his way through the scrum mind if i sit in on this one he asked pettifer the young man looked flustered rebus tried for a reassuring smile mr rebus johnson was holding out his hand what a pleasant surprise rebus ignored him he didnt want a pro like johnson to know just how new pettifer was to the game at the same time he had to persuade the detective constable that no dirty trick was being played that rebus wasnt going to be there as invigilator all he had was his smile so he tried it again fine pettifer said at last the three men entered the interview room rebus holding his index finger up in siobhans direction hoping shed know he wanted her to wait for him ir was small and stuffy and held the body odors of what seemed like its last half a dozen guests there were windows high up on one wall but they wouldnt open on the small table sat a dualtape deck there was a panic button at shoulder height behind it a video camera was trained on the room from a bracket above the door but thered be no recording today these interviews were informal goodwill a priority pettifer carried nothing into the room but a couple of sheets of blank paper and a cheap pen he would have studied the file on johnson but wasnt about to brandish it take a seat please pettifer said johnson brushed the chairs surface with a bright red handkerchief before lowering himself onto it with showy deliberation pettifer sat down opposite then realized there was no chair for rebus he made to stand up again but rebus shook his head ill just stand here if thats okay he said he was leaning against the wall opposite legs crossed at the ankles hands resting in his jacket pockets hed found a spot where he was in pettifers line of vision but where johnson would have to turn to see him youre sort of like a guest star mr rebus johnson obliged with a grin vip treatment for you peacock the peacock always travels firstclass mr rebus johnson sounded satisfied resting against the back of the chair arms folded his hair was jetblack slicked back from the brow curling where it met the nape of his neck hed been known to keep a cocktail stick in his mouth working it like a lollipop not today though today he was chewing a piece of gum mr johnson pettifer began i assume you know why youre here youre asking all us cats about the shooter i told the other cop told anyone whod listen the peacock doesnt do that sort of thing shooting kids man thats pure evil he shook his head slowly id help you if i could but youve got me here under false pretexts youve been in a spot of trouble before over firearms mr johnson we just wondered if you might be the sort of man whod have his ear to the ground could be youve heard something maybe a rumor someone new in the marketplace pettifer sounded confident it could be percent front inside he could be shivering like the last leaf on autumns tree but he sounded okay and that was what mattered rebus liked what he saw the peacock isnt what youd call a snitch your honor but in this case its a definite if i hear something i come straight to you no worries on that bulletin board and for the record i deal in replica weaponscollectors market respectable gentlemen of industry and suchlike when the powers above make such trade illegal you can be sure the peacock will cease operations youve never sold illegal firearms to anyone never and dont happen to know of anyone who might as i said in a previous answer the peacock is not a snitch what about reactivating these collectors guns of yours know anyone whod be able to do that not a scooby mlud pettifer nodded and looked down at the sheets of paper which were just as blankly white as theyd been when hed placed them on the table during the lull johnson turned his head to check on rebus whats it like back in cattle class mr rebus i like it the people tend to be that bit cleaner in their habits now now another grin this time accompanied by a wagging finger i wont have uppity public servants soiling my vip suite youre going to love it in barlinnie peacock rebus said put it another way the guys in there are going to love you to absolute bits dressing up always tends to go down well in the barl mr rebus johnson lowered his head and produced a sigh vendettas are ugly things ask the italians pettifer shifted in his chair its legs scraping the floor maybe if we could get back to the question of where you think lee herdman could have scored those guns theyre mostly made in china these days arent they johnson said i mean pettifer went on an edge creeping into his voice how would someone go about getting hold of them johnson gave an exaggerated shrug by the grip and the trigger he laughed at his own joke laughed alone into the rooms silence then he shifted in his seat tried for a solemn face most gun sellers are glasgowbased theyre the cats you should be talking to our colleagues in the west are doing just that pettifer said but meantime you cant think of anyone in particular we should be asking johnson shrugged search me you should do that dc pettifer rebus said making for the door you should definitely take him up on that outside the situation was no calmer and there was no sign of siobhan rebus guessed shed retreated to the cafeteria but instead of looking for her he headed upstairs glancing in on a couple of rooms before finding evil bob who was being interviewed by a shirtsleeved ds named george silvers around st leonards silvers was known as hiho he was a timeserver awaiting the oncoming pension with all the anticipation of a hitchhiker at a truck stop he didnt so much as nod when rebus entered the room there were a dozen questions on his list and he wanted them asked and answered so that the specimen in front of him could be deposited back on the street bob watched as rebus pulled a chair between the two men and sat down his right knee only inches from bobs left bob squirmed ive just been in with peacock rebus said ignoring that he was interrupting one of silverss questions he should change his name to canary bob stared at him dully whys that then why do you think dunno what do canaries do fly around live in trees they live in your grannies fucking birdcage you moron and they sing bob thought about this rebus could almost hear the cogs grinding with a lot of lowlifes it was an act many of them were clever enough wise not just in the ways of the street but either bob was robert de niro in full method mode or else he was no actor at all what sort of stuff he asked then he saw rebuss look i mean what sort of stuff do they sing not de niro then bob rebus said elbows on knees leaning close to the squat young man you hang around with johnson youre going to spend half your life behind bars so doesnt that bother you stupid question rebus realized as the words came out the arch look from silvers told him as much prison would be just another sleepwalking session for bob it would have no effect on him whatsoever peacock and me were partners oh aye and im sure hes splitting it right down the middle come on bob rebus smiled conspiratorially hes ripping you off big grin on his face blinding you with dental work but hes framing you and when things start going wrong guess wholl be taking the fall thats why he keeps you around youre the guy in the panto who gets the custard pie in his face every performance the pair of you buy and sell guns for christs sake think were not on to you replicas bob stated as if remembering a lesson and repeating it rote for collectors to hang on their walls oh aye everybody wants a bunch of fake glock s and walther ppks above the fireplace rebus straightened up he didnt know if it was possible to get through to bob there had to be something a weakness to be exploited but the guy was like so much wet dough you could knead him twist him all out of shape youd only ever end up with a spongy mass he decided on one last try one of these days bob a kids going to draw one of your replicas and someonell take him down thinking the guns real its only a matter of time rebus was aware that he was allowing some emotion to creep into his voice silvers was studying him beginning to wonder what he was up to rebus looked at him then shrugged started to push up from the chair think about it bob just do that for me rebus tried for eye contact but the young man was staring at the ceiling lights as if at a fireworks display ive never been to a panto he was starting to tell silvers as rebus left siobhan dumped by rebus had gone upstairs to cid the main office was busy detectives seated at borrowed desks facing their interviewees at her own desk the computer monitor had been pushed to one side her intray relegated to the floor detective constable davie hynds was taking notes as a young man pupils reduced to pinpoints droned on whats wrong with your own desk siobhan asked ds wylie pulled rank on me hynds nodded towards where detective sergeant ellen wylie sat at his desk preparing for her next interview she looked up at the mention of her name and smiled siobhan smiled back wylie was based at the west end station same rank as siobhan but more years on her clock siobhan knew they might become rivals in the promotion stakes she decided to squeeze her intray into one of the desk drawers didnt like the idea of this invasion each police station was a fiefdom of sorts no telling what the raiders could take away with them when she picked up the intray she saw the corner of a white envelope poking out from beneath a series of stapled reports she eased it out then placed the intray in the desks single deep drawer closing and locking it hynds was looking at her nothing you need is there siobhan asked him he shook his head wondering if an explanation was on its way but all siobhan did was walk away heading back downstairs to the drink machine it was more peaceful down here a couple of the visiting detectives were on a break smoking and sharing some joke in the car park she didnt see rebus there so she stayed by the machine opening the icecold can the sugar hit her teeth and then her stomach she found the cans list of contents reminding herself that the panic attack books said to lay off caffeine she was trying to find room in her affections for decaf coffee and she knew there were caffeinefree soft drinks out there somewhere salt that was another one to avoid high blood pressure and all that alcohol was all right in moderation she wondered if a bottle of wine in the evening after work could be classed as moderate doubted it somehow thing was if she drank half a bottle the rest tasted foul the next day memo to self explore possibility of buying halfbottles of wine only she remembered the envelope lifted it from her pocket handwritten more of a scrawl really she put her can down on top of the machine already getting a bad feeling as she peeled the envelope open just a single sheet of paper she was sure of that no razor blades no glass plenty of nutters out there keen to share their thoughts with her she unfolded the letter big scrawled capitals look forward to seeing you again in hellmarty the name was underlined her heart was racing she didnt doubt who marty was martin fairstone but fairstone was a tub of cinders and bone on a shelf in someones lab she studied the envelope address and postcode perfect somebodys idea of a joke but who could it be who knew about her and fairstone rebus and templer anyone else she thought back a few months someone had left messages on her screen saver had to be cid one of her socalled colleagues but the messages had stopped davie hynds and george silvers they worked beside her grant hood too most of the time others came and went but she hadnt told any of them about fairstone hold on when fairstone had made his complaint had any of it become a matter of record she didnt think so but cop shops were hives of gossip hard to keep any secrets she realized she was staring through the glass outer doors and the two detectives in the car park were staring back at her wondering what it was about them that she was finding so mesmeric she tried for a smile and a shake of the head as if to say shed been in a dwam for lack of anything else to do she took out her mobile intending to check for messages but started to make a call instead punching in the number from memory ray duff speaking ray you busy siobhan knew what the initial answer would be an intake of breath preceding an elongated sigh duff was a scientist working for the forensics lab at howdenhall you mean apart from checking that all the port edgar bullets came from the same gun then examining blood spatter configurations and powder residues ballistic angles all that at least we keep you in a job hows the mg running like a dream the last time the two had spoken duff had just finished rebuilding a special that offer of a spin some weekend still stands maybe come the better weather theres a top you know not the same though is it look ray i know youre up to your eyes in work from the school but i was wondering if i could ask a wee favor siobhan you know im going to say no everyone wants this done and dusted i know im working port edgar too you and every other cop in the city another sigh just out of curiosity what is it exactly between you and me of course siobhan looked around the detectives outside had lost interest in her three constables sat together at a table in the cafeteria eating sandwiches and drinking tea maybe twenty feet away from her she turned her back to them so she was facing the machine i just got this letter anonymous threatening sort of you should show it to someone i was thinking of showing it to you see if you can take anything from it i meant show it to your boss gill templer isnt it im not exactly her star pupil right now besides shes snowed under and im not just a quick recon ray it could be something or nothing but on the qt am i right right which is wrong someones threatening you you need to report it shiv that nickname again shiv more and more people seemed to be using it she decided this wasnt the time to tell ray how much she disliked it thing is ray its from a dead man there was a pause on the line okay duff drawled at last youve got my attention housing project in gracemount chippan fire ah yes mr martin fairstone ive been trying to get some work done on him too come up with anything bit early to tell port edgar came straight in at number one fairstone dropped a few places she had to smile at the analogy ray liked his charts their conversations usually contained top threes and fives and right on cue by the way shivtop three scottish rock and pop acts ray humor me no thinking allowed just off the top of your head rod stewart big country travis no room for lulu annie lennox im not much good at this ray rods an interesting choice though blame di rebus he loaned me the early albums she attempted a sigh of her own so are you going to help me or not how soon can you get it to me within the hour i suppose i could stay late wouldnt that make a change have i ever mentioned your good looks wit and charm only every time i agree to do you a favor youre an angel ray call me asap come for a drive sometime duff was telling her as she ended the call she carried the letter through the cafeteria into the booking area beyond got an evidence bag by any chance she asked the custody sergeant he opened a couple of drawers i could get one from upstairs he said admitting defeat what about one of the possessions envelopes the custody sergeant stooped again and produced a legalsized manila envelope from below the counter thatll do siobhan said dropping her own envelope in she wrote ray duffs name on the front adding her own name as reference and the word urgent then walked back through the cafeteria and out into the car park the smokers had gone back inside meaning she wouldnt have to apologize for her earlier fit of the stares two uniforms were getting into a patrol car hey guys she called getting closer she recognized the passenger as pc john mason his station nickname the utterly obvious perry the driver was toni jackson hiya siobhan jackson said missed you friday night siobhan shrugged an apology toni and some of the other female uniforms liked to let off steam once a week siobhan was the only detective allowed into their fold im assuming i missed a good night she asked a great night my livers still recovering mason looked interested so what did you get up to wouldnt you like to know his partner responded with a wink then to siobhan you wanting us to play postman she nodded towards the envelope could you its for forensics at howdenhall delivered into this guys hands if at all possible siobhan tapped duffs name weve a couple of calls to make its not much of a detour i promised itd be there inside an hour way toni drives that wont be a problem mason offered jackson ignored this rumor has it youve been relegated to chauffeur siobhan siobhan twitched her mouth only for a few days how did he manage to hurt his hands siobhan stared at jackson i dont know toni what do the bush drums say they say all sorts of things everything from fistfights to fat fryers not that the two are mutually exclusive nothings mutually exclusive where di rebus is concerned jackson smiled wryly holding her hand out for the envelope youre on a yellow card siobhan ill be there friday if you want me promise cross my cid heart in other words it depends it always does toni you know that jackson was looking over siobhans shoulder speak of the devil she said getting back behind the steering wheel siobhan turned around rebus was watching from the doorway she didnt know how long hed been there long enough to see the envelope change hands the engine caught and she stepped away from the car watching it depart rebus had opened his cigarette packet and was pulling one out with his teeth funny how the human animal can adapt siobhan said walking towards him im thinking of extending my repertoire rebus told her might try playing the piano with my nose he got the lighter to work on the third attempt started puffing thanks for leaving me out in the cold by the way its not cold out here i meant i know what you mean he looked at her i just wanted to hear what johnson had to say for himself johnson peacock johnson he saw her eyes narrow he calls himself that why you saw the way he dresses i meant why did you want to see him im interested in him any particular reason rebus just shrugged who is he anyway siobhan asked should i know him hes smalltime but those can be the most dangerous sells replica guns to anyone who wants them might even deal in a few examples of the real thing fences stolen goods dispenses soft drugs just the odd bit of hash where does he operate rebus looked like he was thinking out burdiehouse way she knew him too well to be conned burdiehouse that direction the cigarette flexing in his mouth maybe i could go look in the files she held his gaze waited until he blinked southhouse burdiehouse somewhere out there smoke spilled down his nostrils reminding her of a cornered bull in other words next door to gracemount he shrugged its just geography its where fairstone lived his patch what are the chances of two scumbags like that not knowing each other maybe they did john what was in the envelope her turn to try for the poker face dont change the subject subjects closed what was in the envelope nothing for you to worry your pretty little head about di rebus now youve got me worried it was nothing honest rebus waited then nodded slowly because you can take care of yourself right thats right he tipped his head let the remains of the cigarette fall to the ground crushed it under the toe of his shoe you know i wont need you tomorrow she nodded ill try to while away the hours he tried to think of a comeback gave up eventually come on then lets skedaddle before gill templer can find another excuse for a bollocking he started walking towards her car good siobhan said and while im driving you can be telling me all about mr peacock johnson she paused by the way top three scottish rock and pop acts why do you ask come on off the top of your head rebus thought for a moment nazareth alex harvey deacon blue not rod stewart hes not scottish youre still allowed him if you want then ill get to him eventually probably right after ian stewart but first i need to go through john martyn jack bruce ian anderson not forgetting donovan and the incredible string band lulu and maggie bell siobhan rolled her eyes is it too late for me to say i wish id never asked far too late rebus said getting into the passenger side frankie millers another simple minds in their heyday i always had a soft spot for pallas siobhan stood by the driversside door gripping the handle but making no further effort from inside she could hear the catalogue continuing rebuss voice rising making sure she didnt miss a single name not the sort of place where id normally drink dr curt muttered he was tall and thin often described behind his back as funereal late fifties with a long slack face and baggy eyes he reminded rebus of a bloodhound a funereal bloodhound which was apt in its way considering that he was one of edinburghs most highly respected pathologists under his guidance corpses could tell their stories sometimes revealing secrets suicides who turned out to be murder victims bones that turned out not to be human curts skill and intuition had helped rebus solve dozens of cases down through the years so it would have been churlish to turn the man down when he called and asked rebus to join him for a drink adding as a postscript somewhere quiet mind somewhere we can talk without tongues wagging all around us which was why rebus had suggested his regular haunt the oxford bar tucked away in an alley behind george street and a long way from both curts office and st leonards they were seated in the back room at the table at the far end no one else about midweek and midevening the main bar boasting only a couple of suits who were about to go home and one regular whod just come in rebus brought the drinks to the table a pint for him gin and tonic for the pathologist slainte curt said raising his glass cheers doc rebus still couldnt lift his beer with just the one hand its like youre holding a chalice curt commented then do you want to talk about how it happened no the rumors are flying they can be stacking up frequent flier miles for all i care whats intriguing me is your phone call do you want to talk about that rebus had arrived home soaked in a tepid bath and phoned out for a curry jackie leven on the hifi singing about the romantic hard men of fifehow could rebus have forgotten to put him on the list and then curts phone call can we talk maybe in person tonight no hint as to why just an arrangement to be in the oxford bar at half past seven curt savored his drink hows life been treating you john rebus stared at him with some men men of a certain age and class there had to be this preamble he offered a cigarette which the pathologist accepted take one out for me too rebus asked curt did so and both men smoked in silence for a moment ive been hunkydory doc how about yourself often get this urge to phone cops up of an evening and arrange assignations in dingy back rooms i believe the dingy back room was your choice rather than mine rebus acknowledged as much with a slight bow of the head curt smiled youre not a man of great patience john rebus shrugged actually i can sit here all night but ill be a lot more relaxed once i know what this is about its about whats left of a man called martin fairstone oh yes rebus moved a little in his chair crossing one leg over the other you know him of course when curt sucked on the cigarette his whole face seemed to collapse inward hed become a smoker only in the past five years as if keen to test his own mortality i knew him rebus said ah yes past tense unfortunately not too unfortunate i cant see him being missed be that as it may professor gates and myself well we think there are gray areas ash and bone you mean curt shook his head slowly refusing to see the joke forensics will tell us more his voice drifted off dcs templer has been persistent i think gates will talk to her tomorrow and whats this got to do with me she thinks you may have been involved in some way in this mans murder the final word lay in the smoky air between them rebus didnt need to repeat it aloud curt heard the unspoken question we think maybe murder he said nodding slowly some evidence that he was tied to the chair i have photos he reached into a briefcase that was on the floor next to him doc rebus was saying you probably shouldnt be showing me these i know and i wouldnt if i thought there was the slightest chance that you were involved he looked up but i know you john rebus was looking towards the briefcase people have been wrong about me before maybe the manila file was on the table between them resting on damp coasters rebus picked it up opened it there were a couple of dozen photographs of the kitchen wisps of smoke still evident in the background martin fairstone was barely recognizable as human more like a blackened blistered store mannequin he was lying facedown a chair lay behind him reduced to a couple of stumps and part of the seat what got rebus was the oven for some reason its surface had been left mostly untouched he could see the chip pan sitting on one of its rings christ clean it up and it might still be useable hard to think that a chip pan could survive where a human couldnt what youll see from this is the way the chair has fallen its tipped forwards taking the victim with it its almost like he fell on his knees pitched that way and then later slid into a completely prone position and you see how his arms are positioned flat by his sides rebus saw but wasnt sure what he was supposed to take from any of it we think we found the remains of some rope a plastic clothesline the covering has melted but the nylon was pretty resilient you often get a clothesline in a kitchen rebus said playing devils advocate now because suddenly he knew where this was leading agreed but professor gates well hes got the forensics people looking at it because he thinks fairstone was tied to the chair curt just nodded the other photos in some of them the closeups you can see the bits of rope rebus saw and theres this train of events you see a man is unconscious tied to a chair he wakes up fire is raging around him the fumes already deep in his lungs hes trying to wrestle himself free the chair tips and he starts to suffocate its the smoke thats killing him hes dead before the flames can break his bonds its a theory rebus said yes it is the pathologist said quietly rebus sorted through the pictures again so suddenly its murder or culpable homicide i suppose a lawyer could argue that tying him up wasnt what killed him that it was meant merely as a warning say rebus looked at him youve been giving this some thought curt lifted his glass again professor gates will talk to gill templer tomorrow hell show her these photos forensics will have their say people are whispering that you were there has a reporter been in touch by any chance rebus watched curt nod name of steve holly another nod rebus cursed out loud just as harry the barman came in to clear the empty glasses harry was whistling a sure sign that he had a woman on the go probably wanted to brag about it but rebuss outburst had him beating a retreat how are you going to curt couldnt find the right words fight it rebus suggested then he smiled sourly i cant fight something like this doc i was there whole world knows it or will soon he made to gnaw at a fingernail then remembered he couldnt he felt like punching the table but couldnt do that either its all circumstantial curt was saying well almost he reached across the table and found one particular photograph a closeup of the skull its mouth gaping rebus felt the beer churning in his stomach curt was pointing to the neck might look like skin to you but theres something theres been something hanging around the throat the deceased didnt wear a cravat or anything the idea was so ridiculous that rebus burst out laughing this was a housing project in gracemount doc not a gentlemens club in the new town rebus started to pick his drink up but found he didnt want it he was still shaking his head at the notion of martin fairstone in a cravat why not a smoking jacket too a butler to roll him his cigarettes the thing is dr curt was saying if he wasnt wearing something around his throat a neckerchief or something then what this begins to look like is a gag of some sort maybe a handkerchief stuffed into his mouth knotted behind the head only he was able to slip it off maybe too late by then to call out it slid down around his neck you see and again rebus saw he saw himself trying to talk his way out of it saw himself failing siobhan had this idea the panic attacks often came when she was asleep maybe it had to do with her bedroom so she decided to try sleeping on the sofa perfect arrangement really duvet thrown over her tv in the corner coffee and a box of pringles three times during the evening shed found herself standing by the window looking out on to her street if the shadows seemed to have movement to them shed watch the same spot for a few minutes until reassured when rebus had called to tell her about his meeting with dr curt shed asked him a question had the body been properly idd hed asked what shed meant charred remains the id will come down to dna right has anyone done that yet siobhan just for the sake of argument hes dead siobhan you can start to forget about him biting her bottom lip less reason than ever now to bother him with the letter his plate was already heaped hed rung off reason for calling her if the shit hit the fan the next day he wouldnt be around for it and templer might go looking for a surrogate siobhan decided to make more coffeeinstant decaf it left a sour taste in her mouth she stopped by the window a quick glance out before she headed for the kitchen her doctor had asked her to write down a list of her menus for a typical week then had circled everything he thought might be contributing to her attacks she tried not to think about the pringles problem was she liked them liked wine too and fizzy drinks and takeout as shed reasoned with her doctor she didnt smoke exercised regularly she had to let off steam sometime booze and fast food are how you let off steam theyre how i wind down at days end maybe you should try not getting wound up in the first place youre going to tell me youve never smoked or had a drink but of course he wasnt going to say that doctors had higher stress levels than cops one thing she had doneher own initiativewas try getting into ambient music lemon jelly oldsolar boards of canada some hadnt workedaphex twin and autechre not enough meat on their bones meat on their bones she was thinking of martin fairstone the way he smelled male chemicals his discolored teeth standing by her car chewing his way into her shopping casual in his aggression secure in it rebus was right he had to be dead the note was a sick joke problem was she couldnt seem to find a candidate there had to be someone out there someone she was failing to remember bringing her coffee in from the kitchen she wandered over to the window again there were lights on in the tenement across the way a while back someone had spied on her from there a cop called linford he was still on the force working at hq at one time shed thought about moving but she liked this place liked her flat the street the area corner shops young families and professional singles most of the families were younger than her she realized she was always being asked when you going to find a fellah toni jackson seemed to ask every time the friday club met she would point out eligible men in the bars and clubs not taking no for an answer leading them over to the table where siobhan sat with her head in her hands maybe a boyfriend was the answer keep away the prowlers but then a dog would do just as well thing about a dog was thing about a dog was she didnt want one didnt want a boyfriend either shed had to stop seeing eric bain for a while when hed started talking about taking their friendship to the next stage she missed him he would arrive late in the evening sharing pizza and gossip listening to music maybe playing a computer game on his laptop soon shed try inviting him around again see how it went soon but not yet martin fairstone was dead everyone knew it she wondered who would know if he wasnt the girlfriend maybe close friends or family he had to be staying with someone making money to keep himself together maybe this peacock johnson would know rebus said the guy was a magnet for local info she didnt feel sleepy could be a drive would do her good ambient on the car hifi she picked up her phone called the leith cop shop knowing the port edgar case was financed to the hilt meaning thered be bodies on the night shift keen to top up their bank accounts she got through to one asked for some details peacock johnson i dont know his first name not sure anybody else does he was interviewed earlier today at st leonards what is it you need ds clarke for the moment just his address siobhan said rebus had taken a taxieasier than driving even then opening the passenger door had required a hard squeeze of his thumb on the latch and his thumb was still burning his pockets bulged with change small change was hard for him to deal with he was using notes for every possible transaction filling his pockets with the residual coins his conversation with dr curt was still echoing in the back of his mind a murder inquiry was all he needed right now especially with himself as prime suspect siobhan had asked him about peacock johnson but hed managed to keep his answers vague johnson the reason he was standing here ringing the doorbell the reason hed gone back to fairstones house that night too the door was opened to him bathing him in light ah its you john good man come in a midterraced house newly built off alnwickhill road andy callis lived there on his own his wife dead a year cancer snatching her too young a framed wedding photo hung in the hall callis a good twenty pounds lighter mary radiant haloed by light flowers in her hair rebus had been at the graveside callis placing a posy on the coffin rebus had accepted the role of pallbearer one of six including andy himself keeping his eyes on the posy as the coffin was lowered into the earth a year back andy seeming to be getting over it but then this how are you doing andy rebus asked the electric heater was on in the living room leather chair and matching footstool facing the tv the room tidy freshsmelling the garden outside welltended its borders free of weeds another picture above the mantelpiece marys portrait done in a studio same smile as in the wedding photo but a few lines around the eyes the face fuller a woman growing into maturity im fine john callis settled into his chair moving like an old man he was early forties hair not yet gray the chair creaked as it adjusted itself to him help yourself to a drink you know where it is i might have a nip not driving taxi brought me rebus went to the liquor cabinet raised a bottle watched callis shake his head still on those tablets not supposed to mix them with drink me too rebus poured himself a double is it cold in here callis was asking rebus shook his head whats with the gloves then i hurt my hands thats why im on tablets he lifted the glass and other nonprescribed painkillers he brought his drink over to the sofa made himself comfortable the tv was playing silently some sort of game show whats on christ knows so im not interrupting youre fine callis paused keeping his eyes on the screen unless youve come here to try pushing me again rebus shook his head im past that andy though im bound to admit were stretched to the limit that school thing from the corner of his eye he watched rebus nod terrible thing to happen im supposed to be working out why he did it whats the point give people the opportunity its going to happen rebus reflected on the pause after people callis had been about to say guns but had swallowed the word and hed called it that school thing thing rather than shooting not out of the woods yet then you still seeing the shrink rebus asked callis snorted fat lot of good she wasnt really a shrink of course it wasnt lying on the sofa and talking about your mother but rebus and callis had turned it into this joke joking made it easier to talk about apparently there are worse cases than me callis said guys who cant so much as pick up a pen or a bottle of sauce everything they see reminds them his voice faded rebus finished the sentence in his head of guns everything reminded them of guns bloody odd when you think about it callis went on i mean were supposed to be scared of them isnt that the whole point but then someone like me reacts and suddenly its a problem its a problem when it affects the rest of your life andy having any trouble pouring sauce onto your chips callis patted his stomach not so youd notice rebus smiled leaned back against the sofa whiskey glass resting on the arm he wondered if andy knew about the tic in his left eye or the slight catch in his voice it had been nearly three months since hed taken sick leave from the force up until then hed been a patrol officer but with specialist training in firearms lothian and borders had only a handful of such men they couldnt just be replaced edinburgh had only the one armed response vehicle what does your doctor say john doesnt matter what he says the force isnt going to let me back in without a battery of tests youre scared you might fail callis stared at him im scared i might pass they sat in silence after that watching the tv it looked to rebus like one of those survival programs strangers cooped up together whittled down each week so tell me whats been happening callis said well rebus considered his options not much really apart from the school thing apart from that yes the guys keep asking for you callis nodded the odd face pops round now and then rebus leaned forward elbows on knees youre not coming back then a tired smile from callis you know im not theyll call it stress or something put on disability how many years is it andy since i joined calliss lips puckered in thought fifteen fifteen and a half one incident in all that time and youre ready to call it a day not even really an incident john look at me will you notice anything the way the hands tremble he raised a hand for rebus to see and this vein that seems to keep pulsing in my eyelid raised the same hand to his eye for effect its not me thats calling time its my body all these warning signs you saying i just ignore them know how many calls we had last year not far short of three hundred we drew weapons three times more often than in the previous year worlds toughening up all right maybe so but im not no reason you should rebus was thoughtful so lets say you dont go back on gun duty plenty of desks need filling callis was shaking his head thats not for me john the paperwork always got me down you could go back on the beat callis was staring into space not really listening the thing that gets me is i sit here with the shakes and those little bastards are still out there carrying guns and getting away with it what sort of system is that john he turned to stare at rebus what the hell use are we if we cant stop that from happening sitting here and getting maudlins not going to change things rebus said quietly there was as much anger as defeat in his friends eyes slowly callis lifted both feet from the stool and eased himself upright im going to put the kettle on can i get you anything on the television several contestants were arguing over some task rebus checked his watch im fine andy i should really be going its nice of you to keep dropping in john but you shouldnt feel you have to its only a pretext for raiding your liquor cabinet andy soon as thats empty you wont see me for dust callis tried smiling phone for a cab if you like ive got my mobile and he could use it tooalbeit by pushing each key with a pen sure i cant get you something else rebus shook his head busy day tomorrow me too andy callis said rebus obliged him with a nod their conversation always finished this way busy tomorrow john always busy andy aye me too he thought of things he could sayabout the shooting about peacock johnson he didnt think they would do any good in time theyd be able to talktalk properly rather than the games of pingpong that so often passed for conversation between them but not yet ill see myself out rebus called to the kitchen stay till the taxi gets here i need a breath of air andy what you mean is you need a ciggie instincts like that i cant believe they never made you a detective rebus opened the front door never wanted to be one came andy calliss closing words in the cab rebus decided on a detour telling the driver to head towards gracemount then directing him to martin fairstones house the windows had been boarded up door padlocked against vandals it would only take a couple of junkies to turn the place into a crack den there were no scorch marks on the exterior walls the kitchen was to the back of the property that was where the damage would be the fire crew had dragged some fittings and furnishings out onto the overgrown lawn chairs a table a brokendown upright hoover left there not even worth looting rebus told the driver they could go some teenagers had gathered at a bus stop rebus didnt think they were waiting for a bus the shelter was their gang hut two of them stood on top of it three others lurked in its shadows the driver came to a stop whats up rebus asked i think theyve got rocks we drive past theyll pelt us rebus looked the boys on top of the shelter were standing stockstill he couldnt see anything in their hands give me a second rebus said getting out the driver turned you off your rocker pal no but ill be mad as hell if you drive off without me rebus warned then leaving the cab door open he walked towards the bus stop three bodies stepped out of the shelter they wore hooded tops the hoods pulled tight around their faces to ward off the night chill hands tucked into pockets thin wiry specimens in baggy denims and sneakers rebus ignored them kept his eye on the two atop the shelter collecting rocks eh he called it was birds eggs with me fuck are you talking about rebus lowered his eyes meeting the hard stare of the leader had to be the leader flanked either side by his lieutenants i know you rebus said the youth looked at him so so maybe you remember me i ken you all right the youth made a snorting noise in imitation of a pig then youll know how much damage i can do you one of the boys on top of the shelter let out a laugh theres five of us ya wanker good for you youve learned to count to five a cars headlights appeared and rebus could hear his taxis engine start to whine he glanced back but the driver was only moving it closer to the curb the approaching car slowed but then sped up unwilling to get involved and i take your point rebus continued five against one youd probably kick the shit out of me but thats not what i meant what i meant was what happens after because the one thing you can be sure of is that id see you charged sentenced and stuck in jail young offenders fine youd get a spell in some cushy institution but before that theyd have you locked up in saughton adult wing and that believe me would be an absolute pain in the arse rebus paused your arses to be precise this is our fucking ground one of the others spat not yours rebus gestured back towards the taxi which is why im leaving with your permission his eyes were back on the leader again his name was rab fisher he was fifteen and rebus had heard his gang called the lost boys plenty of arrests under their belts no actual prosecutions mums and dads at home who would say theyd done their bestbattered the life out of him first few times he was caught according to fishers dad but what can you do rebus had a few answers too late for them though easier just to accept the lost boys as another statistic do i have your permission rab fisher was still staring relishing this moment of power the world waited on his sayso i could do with some gloves he said at last not these ones rebus told him they look comfy rebus shook his head slowly started sliding one glove off trying not to flinch he held up a blistered hand yours if you want rab but this has been inside it thats fucking gross one of the lieutenants stated which is why you wouldnt want to wear them rebus slipped the glove back on turned and headed back to the cab he got in and shut the door after him drive past them he ordered the cab moved forwards again rebus kept his eyes front though he knew five separate stares were on him as the cab sped up there was a thud on the roof and a halfbrick bounced across the road just a shot across our bow rebus said easy for you to say chief its not your fucking cab back on the main road they paused at a red light a car had stopped across the road its interior light on as the driver pored over a street map poor sod the cabbie commented wouldnt like to get lost around here do a uturn rebus ordered what do a uturn and pull over in front of it what for because im asking rebus snapped the drivers body language told rebus hed had easier fares as the lights turned green he signaled for a right turn and executed the maneuver pulling up to the curb rebus already had the money ready keep the change he said getting out ive earned it pal rebus walked back to the parked car opened the passenger door and slid inside nice night for a drive he told siobhan clarke isnt it the street map had disappeared probably beneath her seat she was watching the cabbie getting out examining the roof of his vehicle so what brings you to this part of the world i was visiting a friend rebus told her whats your excuse do i need one the cabbie was shaking his head casting a baleful look in rebuss direction before getting back into the drivers seat and heading off executing another uturn so he could make for the safety of town which street is it youre looking for rebus asked she looked at him and he smiled i saw you studying the a to z let me guess fairstones house it took her a moment to answer how did you know he shrugged call it a mans intuition she raised an eyebrow im impressed im also guessing thats where youve just come from i was visiting a friend does this friend have a name andy callis i dont think i know him andy was one of the woolly suits hes on sick leave you say was makes me think hes not coming back from sick leave now its my turn to be impressed rebus shifted in the seat andys lost it mentally i mean lost it for good rebus shrugged i keep thinking ach never mind where does he live alnwickhill rebus had answered without thinking he glared at siobhan knowing it had been no innocent question she was smiling back at him thats near howdenhall isnt it she reached under her seat produced the street map bit of a distance from here all right so i took a detour on the way back to look at fairstones house yes she seemed satisfied closed the map im in the frame for this siobhan rebus said that gives me a reason to be nosy whats yours well i just thought she was struggling tables effectively turned thought what he held up a gloved hand never mind its painful watching you trying to come up with a story heres what i think what i think you werent looking for fairstones house oh rebus shook his head you were going to do some sniffing see if you could conduct a little private investigation maybe track down friends people whod known him maybe someone like peacock johnson how am i doing why would i do that i get the feeling youre not convinced fairstones dead male intuition again you hinted as much when i phoned you she gnawed her bottom lip want to talk about it he offered quietly she looked down into her lap i got a message what sort of message it was signed marty waiting for me at st leonards rebus was thoughtful then i know just the thing to do what head back into town and ill show you what he had to show her was the high street and gordons trattoria where they stayed open late serving strong coffee and pasta rebus and siobhan slid into an empty booth either side of the tightfitting table ordering double espressos make mine decaf siobhan remembered to say whats with the unleaded rebus asked im trying to cut down he accepted this anything to eat or is that verboten too im not hungry rebus decided that he was and ordered a seafood pizza warning siobhan that shed have to help him out with it the back half of gordons was the restaurant only one voluble table left sitting polishing off digestifs where rebus and siobhan sat near the front door it was all booths and snacks so tell me again what the message said she sighed and repeated it for him and the postmark was local yes first or secondclass stamp what does it matter rebus shrugged fairstone struck me as definitely secondclass he watched her she looked tired and wired at the same time a potentially fatal conjunction unbidden the image of andy callis came to his mind maybe ray duff will shed some light siobhan was saying if anyone can its ray the coffee arrived siobhan lifted hers to her lips theyre going to string you up tomorrow arent they maybe he said whatever happens i think you should keep well clear that means not talking to fairstones friends if the complaints catch you theyll smell a plot you definitely think it was fairstone who died in that fire no reason not to apart from the message it wasnt his style siobhan he wouldnt have posted a letter hed have come straight to you same as all the other times she considered this i know she said at last there was a lull in the conversation both of them sipping the strong bitter coffee sure youre all right rebus eventually asked fine sure do you want it in writing i want you to mean it her eyes had darkened but she didnt say anything the pizza arrived and rebus cut it into slices cajoling her into taking one there was silence again as they ate the drunken table was leaving laughing noisily all the way into the street closing the door their waiter raised his eyes to heaven giving thanks that the restaurant was quiet again everything okay over here fine rebus said eyes on siobhan fine she repeated holding his gaze siobhan said shed give him a lift home getting into the car rebus glanced at his watch eleven oclock can we get the news headlines he asked see if port edgars still the main story she nodded switched on the radio where a candlelit vigil is being held tonight our reporter janice graham is at the scene tonight in south queensferry the residents are making their voices heard hymns will be sung and the local church of scotland minister will be joined by the school chaplain candles may be a problem however as theres a stiff breeze blowing from the firth of forth for all of that a sizable crowd is already beginning to gather with local msp jack bell in attendance mr bell whose son was wounded in the tragedy is hoping to gather support for his gun legislation campaign heres what he said earlier stopped at a red light rebus and siobhan shared a look then she nodded no words needed between them when the light changed to green she drove across the intersection pulled over to the side of the road and waited for traffic to clear before doing a uturn the vigil was being held outside the school gates a few flickering candles were managing to stay lit but most people knew better and had brought flashlights siobhan doubleparked next to a news van the crews were out in force tv cameras microphones flashbulbs but they were outnumbered ten to one by singers and the merely curious got to be four hundred people here siobhan said rebus nodded the road was completely blocked by bodies a few uniformed constables were standing on the periphery hands behind their backs in what was probably meant as a gesture of respect rebus saw that jack bell had been pulled to one side so that he could share his views with half a dozen journalists who were busily nodding and scribbling filling sheet after sheet of their notebooks as he talked nice touch siobhan said rebus saw what she meant bell was wearing a black armband subtle definitely he agreed at that moment bell looked up and noticed them eyes staying on them as he continued his oration rebus started winding his way through the crowd standing on tiptoe to view the scene immediately in front of the gates the church minister was tall young and in good voice next to him stood a much smaller woman of similar age rebus guessed that this was the chaplain of port edgar academy a hand tugged at his arm and he looked to his immediate left where kate renshaw was standing wellwrapped against the cold a pink woolen scarf muffling her mouth he smiled and nodded a couple of men nearby their singing enthusiastic but offkey looked to have come directly from one of south queensferrys hostelries rebus could smell beer and cigarettes in the air one man jabbed his friend in the ribs nodding towards a roving tv camera they straightened up and sang all the louder rebus didnt know if they were local or not sightseers possibly hoping to catch a glimpse of themselves on the box over tomorrow mornings breakfast the hymn finished and the chaplain started saying a few words her voice faint hardly carrying as a strong wind started gusting in from the coast rebus looked at kate again and gestured towards the back of the crowd she followed him to where siobhan was standing on the periphery a cameraman had climbed up onto the schools perimeter wall to get an overview of the crowd and was being told to come down again by one of the uniforms hi there kate siobhan said kate pulled her scarf down hello she said your dad not here rebus asked kate shook her head hell hardly set foot outside the house she folded her arms around herself bounced on her toes feeling the chill good turnout rebus said eyes on the crowd kate nodded im amazed how many of them know who i am they keep saying how sorry they are about derek something like this it can bring people together siobhan said if it didnt well what would that say about us someone else had caught her attention sorry ive got to she started walking over towards the huddle of journalists it was bell bell who had gestured for her to join him he put an arm around her shoulder as more flashguns lit the hedgerow behind them wreaths and bunches of flowers had been left there with fluttering messages and snapshots of the victims and its thanks to the support of people like her that i think we stand a chance more than a chance in fact because something like this canand shouldnever be tolerated in what we like to call a civilized society we never want to see it happen again and thats why were taking this stand when bell paused to show the journalists the clipboard he was holding the questions started he kept a protective arm on kates shoulders as she answered them protective rebus wondered or proprietary well kate was saying the petitions a good idea an excellent idea bell corrected her but its only the start whats really needed is action action from the authorities to stop guns getting into the wrong hands at the word authorities she glanced towards rebus and siobhan if i can just give you some figures bell interrupted again brandishing the clipboard gun crime is on the increasewe all know that but the statistics dont begin to tell the story depending on who you listen to youll hear that gun crime is rising at ten percent a year or twenty percent or even forty percent any rise whatsoever is not only bad news not only a shameful blot on the records of police and intelligencegathering resources but more important kate if i could just ask you one of the journalists butted in how do you think you can get the government to listen to the victims im not sure i can maybe its time to ignore the government altogether and appeal directly to the people whore actually doing the shooting the people selling these guns bringing them into the country bell pitched his voice even louder as far back as the home office reckoned that two thousand guns per weekper weekwere coming into the uk illegally many of them through the channel tunnel since the dunblane ban came into force handgun crimes have increased forty percent kate if we could ask you for your opinion of rebus had turned away walking back to siobhans car when she caught up with him he was lighting a cigarette or trying to the wind meant his lighter kept sputtering going to help me he asked no cheers but she relented holding her coat open so that he could shelter himself long enough to get the cigarette lit he nodded his thanks seen enough she asked reckon were every bit as bad as the ghouls she considered this then shook her head were interested parties thats one way of putting it the crowd was beginning to disperse many were lingering to study the hedgerows makeshift shrine but others started passing the spot where rebus and siobhan stood the faces were solemn resolute tearstained one woman was hugging both her preteen children to her the kids bemused perhaps wondering what theyd done to bring on their mothers sobs an elderly man leaning heavily on a walker seemed determined to walk the route home without any other help shaking his head at the many who offered a group of teenagers had come dressed in their port edgar uniforms rebus didnt doubt theyd been captured by a few dozen cameras since their arrival the girls mascara had run the boys looked awkward as if regretting coming rebus looked for miss teri but didnt see her isnt that your friend siobhan said gesturing with her head rebus studied the crowd again saw immediately who she meant peacock johnson part of the procession heading back into town and beside him a full foot shorter evil bob bob had removed his baseball cap for the duration showing the balding crown of his head now he was fixing the cap back into place johnson had dressed down for the occasion a gray shimmering shirt silk maybe beneath a fulllength black raincoat there was a black string tie around his neck fixed with a silver clasp he too had removed his headgeara gray trilbywhich he held in both hands running his fingers around its rim johnson seemed to sense that he was being stared at when his eyes met rebuss rebus crooked a finger at him johnson said something to his lieutenant the pair of them threading their way through the throng mr rebus paying your respects like the true gentleman you doubtless perceive yourself to be thats my excuse whats yours the selfsame mr rebus the selfsame he made a little bow at the waist in siobhans direction lady friend or colleague he asked rebus the latter siobhan answered no requirement for the two to be as they say mutually exclusive he grinned at her while sliding his hat back on see that guy over there rebus said nodding towards where jack bell was finishing his interview if i told him who you are and what you do hed have a field day mr bell you mean first thing we did when we got here was sign his petition isnt that right wee man looking down at his companion bob didnt seem to understand but nodded anyway clear conscience you see johnson continued doesnt begin to explain what youre doing here unless that conscience of yours is guilty rather than clear a low blow if you dont mind me saying johnson winced for effect say good night to the nice detectives he said patting evil bobs shoulder good night nice detectives a wet smile appearing on the overfed face peacock johnson had joined the crowd again head bowed as if in christian contemplation bob fell in a couple of paces behind his master for all the world like a pet being taken for a walk what do we make of that siobhan asked rebus shook his head slowly maybe your comment about guilt isnt wide of the mark be nice to nail the bastard for something she gave him a questioning look but his attention had turned to jack bell who was whispering something in kates ear kate nodded and the msp gave her a hug reckon shes got a future in politics siobhan mused i hope to christ thats the attraction rebus muttered showing his cigarette stub little mercy as he ground it under his heel day three thursday is this country the pits or what bobby hogan asked rebus felt it was an unfair question they were on the m one of the most lethal roads in scotland tractortrailers were lashing hogans passat with a spray that was nine parts grit to one of water the wipers were on at high speed and still not coping despite which hogan was trying to do seventy but doing seventy meant getting past the trucks and the truck drivers were enjoying an extended game of leapfrog leading to a queue of cars waiting to pass dawn had brought milky sunshine to the capital but rebus had known it wouldnt last the sky had been too hazy blurred like a drunks good intentions hogan had decided they should rendezvous at st leonards by which time fully half of arthurs seats great stone outcrop had vanished into the cloud rebus doubted david copperfield could have pulled the trick off with any more brio when arthurs seat started disappearing rain was sure to follow it had started before they reached the city limits hogan flipping the wipers to intermittent then to constant now on the m south of glasgow they were flying to and fro like the roadrunners legs in the cartoon i mean the weather the traffic why do we put up with it penitence rebus offered suggesting weve done something to deserve it like you say bobby there must be a reason we stay put maybe were just lazy we cant change the weather i suppose its in our power to tweak the amount of traffic but that never seems to work so why bother hogan raised a finger exactly we simply cant be arsed you think thats a fault hogan shrugged its hardly a strength is it i suppose not whole countrys gone to cack jobs up the khyber politicians with their snouts in the trough kids with no i dont know he exhaled noisily touch of the victor meldrews this morning bobby hogan shook his head ive been thinking this for ages and i thank you for inviting me into the confessional know something john youre more cynical than i am thats not true give me a for instance for instance i believe in an afterlife whats more i think the pair of us are going to be entering it sooner than expected if you dont ease your foot off hogan smiled for the first time that morning signaled to pull into the middle lane better he asked better rebus agreed then a few moments later you really believe theres something there after we die rebus considered his answer i believe it was a way of getting you to slow down he pushed in the button for the cars cigarette lighter then wished he hadnt hogan noticed him flinch still hurting like hell its getting better tell me again how it happened rebus shook his head slowly lets talk about carbrae instead how much are we really going to get from robert niles with a bit of luck more than his name rank and serial number hogan said pulling out again to pass carbrae special hospital was sited as hogan himself described it in the sweaty armpit of who knows where neither man had been there before hogans directions were to take the a west of dumfries and head towards dalbeattie they seemed to miss a turnoff hogan cursing the solid wall of lorries in the inside lane reckoning theyd hidden a signpost or access road from view as a result they didnt come off the m till lockerbie heading west into dumfries were you at lockerbie john hogan asked just for a couple of days remember that fuckup with the bodies laying them out on the ice rink hogan shook his head slowly rebus remembered the bodies had stuck to the ice meaning the whole rink had to be defrosted thats what i mean about scotland john that just about sums us up rebus disagreed he thought the quiet dignity of the townspeople in the aftermath of pan am said a hell of a lot more about the country he couldnt help wondering how the people of south queensferry would cope once the threering circus of police media and mouthy politicians had moved on hed watched fifteen minutes of morning news while slurping down a coffee but had to turn the sound off when jack bell appeared snaking one arm around kate whose face shone a ghostly white hogan had picked up a bundle of newspapers between his home and rebuss some had managed to get photos from the vigil into their later editions the minister leading the singing the msp holding up his petition i cant sleep at all one resident was quoted as saying for fear of who else might be out there fear the crucial word most people would live their whole lives untouched by crime yet they still feared it and that fear was real and smothering the police force existed to allay such fears yet too often was shown to be fallible powerless on hand only after the event clearing up the mess rather than preventing it meanwhile someone like jack bell began to look as if he was at least trying to do something rebus knew the terms they trotted out at seminars proactive rather than reactive one of the tabloids had latched on to this they were backing bells campaign whatever it might be if our forces of law and order cant deal with this very real and growing problem then its up to us as individuals or organized groups to take a stand against the tide of violence that is engulfing our culture an easy enough editorial to write rebus surmised the author merely parroting the msps words hogan glanced at the newspaper bells on a roll isnt he it wont last i hope not sanctimonious bastard gives me the boak can i quote you on that detective inspector hogan journalists now theres another reason this countrys the pits they stopped for coffee in dumfries the café was a dreary combination of formica and bad lighting but neither man cared once hed taken a bite from the thick bacon sandwiches hogan looked at his watch and calculated that theyd been on the road the best part of two hours least the rains stopping rebus said put out the flags hogan responded rebus decided to try a change of subject ever been this way before im sure i mustve driven through dumfries doesnt ring a bell though i came on holiday once caravan on the solway firth when was this hogan was licking melted butter from between his fingers years back sammy was still in nappies sammy rebuss daughter you ever hear from her a phone call now and then she still down in england hogan watched rebus nod good luck to her he opened his roll and peeled some of the fat from the bacon scottish diet thats another thing were cursed with christ bobby shall i just drop you off at carbrae you could sign yourself in play mr grumpy to a captive audience im just saying saying what we get shit weather and eat shit food maybe you should have grant hood stage a press conference seeing how its going to come as news to every bugger who lives here hogan concentrated on his snack chewing without seeming to swallow too long cooped up in that car maybe he finally offered too long on the port edgar case rebus countered its only been i dont care how long its been dont tell me youre getting enough sleep putting it all behind you when you go home at night switching off delegating letting others share the i get the point hogan paused i brought you in didnt i just as well or i suspect youd have been driving down here on your lonesome and and there wouldnt have been anybody to moan at rebus looked at him feel better for letting it all out hogan smiled maybe youre right well wouldnt that be a first for the books both men ended up laughing hogan insisting on picking up the tab rebus leaving a tip back in the car they found the road to dalbeattie ten miles out of dumfries a single signpost pointed right taking them up a narrow winding track with grass growing in the middle not much traffic then rebus commented bit out of the way for visitors hogan agreed carbrae had been purposebuilt in the forwardlooking s a long boxshaped structure with annexes none of which could be seen until they had parked the car identified themselves at the gate and been met and escorted within the thick gray concrete walls there was an outer perimeter too a wire fence twenty feet high topped here and there with security cameras at the gatehouse theyd been given laminated passes hung by a red ribbon from the neck signs warned visitors of forbidden items within the complex no food or drink newspapers or magazines no sharp objects nothing was to be passed to a patient without prior consultation with a member of the staff mobile phones were not permitted our patients can be upset by the slightest thing no matter how harmless it may seem to you if in doubt please ask any chance we might upset robert niles hogan asked his eyes meeting rebuss not in our nature bobby rebus said switching off his phone and then an orderly appeared and they were in they walked down a garden path neat flower beds to either side there were faces at some of the windows no bars on the windows themselves rebus had expected the orderlies to be thinly disguised bouncers huge and silent dressed in hospital whites or some other form of uniform but their guide billy was small and cheerylooking casually clothed in tshirt jeans and softsoled shoes rebus had a horrible thought the lunatics had taken over the asylum the real staff locked away it would explain billys beaming rosycheeked countenance or maybe hed just been dipping into the medicine locker dr lesser is waiting in her room billy was saying what about niles youll talk to robert there he doesnt like strangers going into his own room oh hes funny that way billy shrugged his shoulders as if to say dont we all have our little foibles he punched numbers into a keypad by the front door smiling up at the camera trained on him the door clicked open and they entered the hospital the place smelled of not exactly medicine what was it then rebus realized it was the aroma of new carpetsspecifically the blue carpet that stretched before them down the corridor fresh paint too by the look of it apple green rebus guessed it had said on the industrialsized cans pictures on the walls stuck there with tape nothing framed and no thumbtacks the place was quiet their shoes made no noise on the carpet no piped music no screams billy led them down the hall stopping before an open door dr lesser the woman inside was seated at a modern desk she smiled and peered over her halfmoon glasses you got here then she stated sorry were a few minutes late hogan began to apologize its not that she reassured him its just that people miss the turnoff and then phone to say theyre lost we didnt get lost so i see she had come forward to greet them with handshakes hogan and rebus introduced themselves thanks billy she said billy gave a little bow and backed away wont you come in i wont bite she offered her smile again rebus wondered if it was part of the job description for working at carbrae the room was small comfortable a yellow twoseat sofa bookshelf hifi no filing cabinets rebus guessed the patient files would be kept well away from prying eyes dr lesser said they could call her irene she was in her late twenties or early thirties with chestnutbrown hair falling to just below her shoulders her eyes were the same color as the clouds that had obscured arthurs seat earlier that morning please sit yourselves down her accent was english rebus thought liverpudlian dr lesser hogan began irene please of course hogan paused as if weighing whether to use her first name if he did she might start using his first name and that would be way too cozy you understand why were here lesser nodded she had pulled over a chair so she could sit in front of the detectives rebus was aware that the sofa was a tight fit bobby and him probably over four hundred pounds between them and you understand lesser was saying that robert has the right to say nothing if he starts to get upset the interview is over and thats final hogan nodded youll be sitting in of course she raised an eyebrow of course it was the answer theyd expected but disappointing all the same doctor rebus began maybe you could help prepare us what can we expect from mr niles i dont like to preempt for example is there anything we should avoid saying maybe trip words she looked appraisingly at rebus he wont talk about what he did to his wife thats not why were here she thought for a moment he doesnt know his friend is dead he doesnt know herdmans dead hogan repeated news doesnt interest the patients on the whole youd prefer it if we kept it that way rebus guessed im assuming you dont need to tell him why youre so interested in mr herdman youre right we dont rebus looked to hogan just have to watch we dont slip up eh bobby as hogan nodded there was a knock on the stillopen door all three of them stood up a tall muscular man was waiting there bull neck tattooed arms for a moment rebus thought now thats what orderlies are supposed to look like then he saw lessers face and realized that this giant was robert niles robert the doctors smile was back in place but rebus knew she was wondering how long niles had been there and how much hed taken in billy said the voice was like a rumble of thunder thats right come in come in as niles entered the room hogan made to close the door after him not in here lesser commanded the door is always open two ways of taking that openness nothing to hide or meaning an attack was more likely to be spotted lesser was gesturing for niles to take her chair while she retreated behind her desk as niles sat down so did the two detectives wedging themselves back into the sofa niles stared at them face angled downwards eyes hooded these men have a few questions theyd like to ask you robert what sort of questions niles was wearing a dazzling white tshirt and gray jogging bottoms rebus was trying not to stare at the tattoos they were old probably dated back to his army days when rebus had been a soldier hed been the only recruit not to celebrate joining up by getting a few tattoos on his first home leave niless specimens included a thistle a couple of writhing snakes and a dagger with a banner wrapped around it rebus suspected the dagger had something to do with his time in the sas even though the regiment frowned upon ornamentation tattoos were like scarsmeans of identification which meant they could be used against you if you were ever captured hogan decided to take the initiative we want to ask you about your friend lee lee lee herdman he visits you sometimes sometimes yes the words came slowly rebus wondered how much medication niles was on have you seen him lately few weeks back i think niles swung his head towards dr lesser time probably didnt mean much in carbrae she nodded encouragingly what do you talk about when he comes to see you the old days anything in particular just the old days life was good back then was that lees opinion too hogan ended the question and sucked in air realizing hed just used the past tense about herdman whats all this about another look towards lesser reminding rebus of a trained animal seeking some instruction from its owner do i have to be here doors open robert lesser waved a hand in its direction you know that lee seems to have gone mr niles rebus said leaning forwards a little we just want to know what happened to him gone rebus shrugged its a long drive down here from queensferry the pair of you must be pretty close we were soldiers together rebus nodded sas regiment you were the same unit c squadron that was nearly me once rebus tried a smile i was a para tried for the regiment what happened rebus was trying not to think back there were horrors lurking there flunked the training how soon did you drop easier to tell the truth than to lie i passed everything up until the psychological stuff a smile broke niless face wide open they cracked you rebus nodded i cracked like a fucking egg mate mate a soldiers word when was this early seventies bit before me then niles was thinking they had to change the interrogations he remembered used to be a lot harder i was part of that you cracked under interrogation what did they do to you niless eyes narrowed he was more alert now having a conversation someone else answering his questions kept me in a cell constant noise and light screams from the other cells rebus knew he had everyones attention now niles clapped his hands together the chopper he asked when rebus nodded he clapped again turned to dr lesser they put a sack over your head and take you up in a chopper then say theyll drop you if you dont give them what they want when they dump you out youre only eight feet above the ground only you dont know that he turned back to rebus it really fucks you up then he thrust forwards a hand for rebus to shake it really does rebus agreed trying to ignore the searing pain of the handshake sounds barbaric to me dr lesser commented her face paler than before it breaks you or it makes you niles corrected her it broke me rebus agreed but you robert did it make you for a while it did niles grew a little less agitated its when you get out thats when it hits you what the fact that all the things you he fell silent as still as a statue some new set of chemicals kicking in but behind niless back lesser was shaking her head meaning there was nothing to worry about the giant was just lost in thought i knew some paras he said at last right hard bastards they were i was rifle company second para saw time in ulster then rebus nodded and elsewhere niles tapped the side of his nose rebus imagined those fingers gripping a knife drawing the blade across a smooth white throat mums the word niles said but the word rebus had been thinking of was wife last time you saw lee he asked quietly did he seem okay maybe he was worried about something niles shook his head lee always puts on a brave face i never get to see him when hes down but you know there are times when he is down were trained not to show it were men yes we are rebus confirmed army doesnt have any place for crybabies crybabies cant shoot a stranger dead or lob a grenade at him youve got to be able to what youre trained for is but the words wouldnt come niles twisted his hands together as though trying to choke them into existence he looked from rebus to hogan and back again sometimes sometimes they dont know how to switch us off hogan sat forwards does that apply to lee do you think niles stared at him hes done something hasnt he hogan swallowed back a response looked to dr lesser for guidance but it was too late niles was rising slowly from his chair im going to go now he said moving towards the door hogan opened his mouth to say something but rebus touched his arm stilling him knowing he was probably about to toss a grenade into the room your pals dead and he took some schoolkids with him dr lesser got up and walked to the doorway reassuring herself that niles wasnt hiding just out of sight satisfied she took the chair hed just vacated he seems pretty bright rebus commented bright in control is that the medication medication plays its part she crossed one trousered leg over the other rebus noticed that she wore no jewelry at all nothing on her wrists or around her neck and no earrings that he could see when hes cured does he go back to jail people think coming to a place like this is a soft option i can assure you it isnt thats not what i was getting at i just wondered from what i remember hogan interrupted niles never explained why he slit his wifes throat has he been any more forthcoming with you doctor she looked at him unblinking that has no relevance to your visit hogan shrugged youre right im just curious lesser turned her attention to rebus maybe its a kind of brainwashing how so hogan asked rebus answered him dr lesser agrees with niles she thinks the army trains men to kill then does nothing to switch them off before theyre returned to civvy street plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest just that lesser said she leaned her hands on her thighs the gesture telling them the session was over rebus got up same time as she did hogan more reluctant to follow her lead we came a long way doctor he said i dont think youll get any more from robert not today i doubt we can afford the time to come back thats your decision of course finally hogan rose from the sofa how often do you see niles i see him every day i mean oneonone what is it youre asking maybe next time you could ask him about his friend lee maybe she conceded and if he says anything then that would be between him and me hogan nodded patient confidentiality he agreed but there are families out there whove just lost their sons maybe you could try thinking of the victims for a change hogans tone had hardened rebus started steering him towards the door i apologize for my colleague he told lesser a case like this it takes its toll her face softened slightly yes of course if youll wait a second ill call billy i think we can find our own way out rebus said but as they entered the corridor he saw billy approaching thanks for your help doctor then to hogan bobby say thank you to the nice doctor cheers doc hogan grudgingly managed freeing himself from rebuss grip he started down the corridor rebus making to follow di rebus lesser called rebus turned to her you might want to talk to someone yourself counseling i mean its thirty years since i left the army dr lesser she nodded a long time to be carrying any baggage she folded her arms think about it will you rebus nodded backing away he offered her a parting wave then turned and started walking feeling her eyes still on him hogan was ahead of billy and seemed in no need of company rebus fell into step with the orderly that was helpful he commented speaking to billy but knowing hogan could hear im glad well worth the trip billy just nodded satisfied that someone elses day was turning out as bright as his own billy rebus said laying a hand on the young mans shoulder do we look at the visitors book here or over at the gatehouse billy looked baffled didnt you hear dr lesser say rebus plowed on we just need the dates for lee herdmans visits the books kept at the gatehouse then thats where well give it the onceover rebus fixed the orderly with a winning smile any chance of a coffee while were at it there was a kettle in the gatehouse and the guard made two mugs of instant billy headed back into the hospital think hell go straight to lesser hogan said in an undertone lets be as quick as we can not easy when the guard was so interested in them asking about life in cid probably stircrazy cooped up in his box all day a bank of cctv monitors a few cars to process every hour hogan offered him tidbits most of which rebus suspected he was making up the visitors book was an oldfashioned ledger broken up into columns for date time visitors name and address and person visited this last was subdivided so that both patients and doctors name could be recorded rebus started with visitors names and ran his finger quickly down three pages until he found lee herdman almost exactly a month back so niless estimate hadnt been far off a month further back another visit rebus jotted the details into his notebook holding the pen lightly at least theyd be taking something back to edinburgh he paused to take a sip from the chipped flowerpatterned mug it tasted like one of those cheap supermarket mixtures more chicory than coffee his father used to buy the same stuff saving a few pence one time the teenage rebus had brought home a more expensive substitute which his father had shunned good coffee he said now to the guard who looked pleased with the compliment we about done here hogan asked tiring of telling stories rebus nodded but then let his eyes glance down the columns one final time not visitors this time but patients visited companys on its way hogan warned rebus looked up hogan was pointing at one of the tv screens dr lesser accompanied by billy striding out of the hospital building and down the path rebus went back to the ledger and saw r niles again r niles dr lesser another visitor not lee herdman we didnt ask her rebus could have kicked himself were out of here john bobby hogan was saying putting down his mug but rebus wasnt moving hogan stared at him and rebus just winked then the door flew open and lesser was standing there who gave you permission she spat to go trawling through a confidential record we forgot to ask about other visitors rebus told her calmly then his finger tapped the ledger whos douglas brimson thats none of your business how do you know rebus was jotting the name into his notebook as he spoke what are you doing rebus closed the notebook slipping it into his pocket then he nodded to hogan thanks again doc hogan said preparing to leave she ignored him glaring at rebus ill be reporting this she warned him he shrugged ill be suspended by the end of the day anyway thanks again for all your help he squeezed past her following hogan to the car park i feel better hogan said it might have been cheap but we ended up scoring a point a cheap point is always worth scoring rebus agreed hogan stopped at the passat fumbling in his pocket for the keys douglas brimson he asked another of niless visitors rebus explained with an address at turnhouse turnhouse hogan frowned you mean the airport rebus nodded is there anything else out there apart from the airport you mean rebus shrugged might be worth finding out he said as the cars central lock clunked open whats this about you waiting to be suspended i had to say something but why pick that jesus bobby i thought the analyst had left the building if theres anything i should know john there isnt i brought you in on this i can dump you just as quickly remember that youre a real motivator bobby rebus pulled the passengerside door closed it was going to be a long drive make my day cody siobhan stared at the note again same handwriting as yesterday she was sure of that secondclass mail but it had taken only a day to reach her the address was perfect down to the st leonards postcode no name this time but she didnt need a name did she that was the point the writer was making make my day a reference to clint eastwoods dirty harry who did she know called harry nobody she wasnt sure whether she was meant to get the cody reference but straight off she knew what it meant come on die young she knew it because it was the title of a mogwai album one shed bought a while back a piece of american gang graffiti something like that who did she know apart from her who liked mogwai shed loaned rebus a couple of cds months ago nobody in the station really knew her taste in music grant hood had been to her flat a few times so had eric bain maybe she hadnt been meant to get the meaning not without working at it she guessed most fans of the band were younger than her teens and early twenties probably mostly male too mogwai played instrumentals mixing ambient guitar with earwrenching noise she couldnt remember if rebus had ever given her back the cds had one of them been come on die young without realizing it shed walked from her desk to the window peering out on to st leonards lane the cid room was dead all the port edgar interviews concluded transcripts would be typed up collated it would be someones job to feed it all into the computer system see if technology could find connections missed by the merely mortal the letter writer wanted her to make his day his day she studied the writing again maybe an expert could tell if it was a masculine or feminine hand she suspected the writer had disguised his or her real handwriting hence the scrawl she went back to her desk and called ray duff ray its siobhangot anything for me morning to you too ds clarke didnt i say id get back to you whenifi found something meaning you havent meaning im up to my neck meaning i havent yet got round to doing very much about your letter for which i can only offer an apology and the excuse that im flesh and blood sorry ray she gave a sigh pinched the bridge of her nose youve had another one he guessed yes one yesterday one today thats right want to send me it i think ill hang on to this one ray as soon as ive got news ill call you i know you will sorry ive bothered you speak to someone siobhan i already have bye ray she cut the call tried rebuss mobile but he wasnt answering she didnt bother with a message folded the note put it back in its envelope slipped the envelope into her pocket on her desk sat a dead teenagers laptop her task for the day there were over a hundred files in there some would be computer applications but most were documents created by derek renshaw shed already looked at a few correspondence school essays nothing about the car crash in which his friend had died looked like hed been trying to set up some sort of jazz fanzine there were pages of layout photos scanned in some of them lifted from the net plenty of enthusiasm but no real talent for writing miles was an innovator no question but later on he acted more as a scout finding the best new talent around and embracing it hoping something would rub off on himself siobhan just hoped miles had wiped himself clean afterwards she sat in front of the laptop and stared at it trying to concentrate the word cody was bouncing around her head maybe it was a clue leading to someone with that surname she didnt think she knew anyone named cody for a moment she had a jarring thought fairstone was still alive and the charred corpse belonged to someone called cody she shook the notion aside took a deep breath got back to work and hit an immediate brick wall she couldnt log on to derek renshaws email account without his password she picked up the phone and called south queensferry thankful that kate answered rather than her father kate its siobhan clarke yes ive got dereks computer here dad told me but i forgot to ask for his password what do you need that for to look at any new emails why sounding exasperated wanting it all to be finished because thats what we do kate silence on the line kate what just checking you hadnt hung up on me oh right and then the line went dead kate renshaw had hung up on her siobhan gave a silent curse decided shed try again later or get rebus to do it he was family after all besides she had the folder with all dereks old emailsno code needed to access that she scrolled back found that there were four years worth of emails in the folder she hoped derek had been neat and tidy hoped hed erased all the junk she was five minutes into the task and bored of rugby scores and match reports when her phone rang it was kate im really sorry the voice said dont be its all right no its not youre just trying to do your job doesnt mean you have to like it if im being honest i dont always like it either his password was miles of course it would have taken siobhan only a few minutes of lateral thinking thanks kate he liked to go online dad complained for a while about the phone bills you were close werent you you and derek i suppose so not every brother would share his password a snort something almost like a laugh i guessed it only took me three goes he was trying to guess mine and i was trying to guess his did he get yours bugged me for days about it kept coming up with new ideas siobhans left elbow rested on the desktop she bunched her fist and rested her head against it maybe this was going to turn into a long call a conversation kate needed to have memories of derek did you share his taste in music god no his stuff was all shoegazing sat in his room for hours and if you went in he was crosslegged on the bed head in the clouds i tried dragging him to a few clubs in town but he said they just depressed him another snort different strokes i suppose he got beaten up once you know where in town i think thats when he started sticking close to home some kids he bumped into didnt like his posh accent theres a lot of that you know were all snobs because our parents are rich shits who pay for our education theyre all schemies wholl end up on the dole thats where it starts where what starts the aggression i remember my last year at port edgar we got a letter advising us not to wear our uniform in town unless we were on a supervised trip she gave a long sigh my parents pinched and scraped so we could go private it might even be what broke them up im sure thats not true a lot of their fights had to do with money even so there was silence on the line for a moment ive been going on the net looking up stuff what sort of stuff all sorts trying to work out what made him do it lee herdman you mean theres this book its by an american hes a psychiatrist or something know what its called what bad men do what good men dream do you think theres any truth in that maybe id have to read the book i think hes saying weve all got it in us the potential to well you know i dont know about that siobhan was still thinking of derek renshaw the beating was another thing he hadnt mentioned so far in his computer files so many secrets kate is it all right if i ask what derek wasnt depressed or anything was he i mean he liked sports and stuff yes but when he came home hed rather sit in his room siobhan guessed with his jazz and his surfing any sites in particular any favorites he used a couple of chat rooms bulletin boards let me guess sports and jazz bullseye there was a pause you know what i said about stuart cotters family stuart cotter the crash victim i remember siobhan said did you think i was crazy kate trying for a lightness of tone itll be looked into dont worry i didnt really mean it you know i dont really think stuarts family would would do something like that fair enough kate another silence on the line longer this time have you hung up on me again no anything else you want to talk about i should let you get back to work you can always call again kate anytime you want to chat thanks siobhan youre a pal bye kate siobhan ended the call stared at the screen again she pressed a palm to her jacket pocket felt the shape of the envelope cody suddenly it didnt seem so important she got back to work plugged the laptop into a phone jack and used dereks password to access a slew of new emails most of which turned out to be junk or regular sports updates there were a few from names she recognized from the folder friends derek had probably never met except when online friends around the globe who shared his passions friends who didnt know he was dead she straightened her back feeling vertebrae crackle her neck was stiff and her watch told her it was going to be a late lunch she didnt feel hungry but knew she should eat what she really felt like was a double espresso maybe with a side order of chocolate that double combo sugarcaffeine rush that made the world go round i wont give in she said to herself instead shed go to the engine shed where they served organic meals and fruit teas she fished a paperback and her mobile phone out of her shoulder bag then locked the bag in the bottom drawer of her deskyou could never be too careful in a police station the paperback was a critique of rock music by a female poet shed been trying to finish it for ages george hiho silvers came into the office as she was leaving just off to lunch george siobhan told him he looked around the empty office mind if i join you sorry george im meeting someone she lied blithely besides one of us has to hold down the fort she walked downstairs and out of the stations main entrance turning left onto st leonards lane her eyes were on the tiny screen of her phone checking for messages a hand landed heavily on her shoulder a deep voice growled hey siobhan spun around dropping both phone and paperback she grabbed at a wrist twisted it hard pulling down so that her attacker dropped to his knees jesus fuck the man gasped she couldnt see much more than the top of his head short dark hair gelled to stand up in little spikes charcoal suit he was heavily built not tall not martin fairstone who are you siobhan hissed she was holding his wrist high up his back pressing forwards on it she heard car doors open and close glanced up saw a man and woman hurrying towards her i just wanted a word her assailant gasped im a reporter holly steve holly siobhan let go of his wrist holly cradled his hurt arm as he got to his feet whats going on here the woman asked siobhan recognized her whiteread the army investigator simms was with her a thin smile on his face nodding approval of siobhans reflexes nothing siobhan told them didnt look like nothing whiteread was staring at steve holly hes a reporter siobhan explained if wed known that simms said wedve waited a bit longer before stepping in cheers holly muttered rubbing his elbow he looked from simms to whiteread ive seen you before outside lee herdmans flat if im not mistaken i thought i knew all the cid faces he straightened up held out a hand to simms mistaking him for the superior steve holly simms glanced at whiteread alerting holly immediately to his error he swiveled slightly so the hand was facing the woman and repeated his name whiteread ignored him do you always treat the fourth estate this way ds clarke sometimes i go for a headlock instead thats a good idea changing your attack whiteread agreed means the enemy cant predict your move simms added why do i get the feeling you three are taking the piss holly asked siobhan had bent down to retrieve her phone and book she checked the phone for damage what is it you want a quick couple of questions concerning what exactly holly was staring at the army pair sure you want an audience ds clarke ive got nothing to say to you anyway siobhan told him how do you know until youve heard me out because youre going to ask me about martin fairstone am i holly raised an eyebrow well maybe that was the plan but im also wondering why youre so jumpy and why you dont want to talk about fairstone im jumpy because of fairstone siobhan felt like shouting but she sniffed dismissively instead the engine shed was no longer an option nothing to stop holly following her there taking the chair next to her im going back in she said watch out nobody in there taps your shoulder holly said and tell di rebus im sorry siobhan wasnt going to fall for it she turned towards the door only to find whiteread blocking her way mind if we have a word she asked im on my lunch break i could do with something myself whiteread said glancing at her colleague who nodded agreement siobhan sighed you better come in then she pushed the revolving door whiteread right behind her simms made to follow but paused for a moment turning his attention to the reporter you work for a newspaper he asked holly nodded simms smiled at him i killed a man once with one of those then he turned and followed the women inside the cafeteria didnt have much left whiteread and siobhan opted for sandwiches simms a heaping plate of chips and beans what did he mean about rebus whiteread asked stirring sugar into her tea doesnt matter siobhan said sure about that look were not the enemy here siobhan i know what its like you probably dont trust officers at the next station never mind outsiders like us but were on the same side i dont have a problem with that but what just happened hasnt got anything to do with port edgar lee herdman or the sas whiteread stared at her then gave a shrug of acceptance so what was it you wanted siobhan asked actually we were hoping to talk to di rebus hes not here so they told us at south queensferry but you still came whiteread made a show of studying her sandwich filling obviously yes he wasnt here but you knew i was whiteread smiled rebus trained for the sas but didnt make the grade so youve said has he ever told you what happened siobhan decided not to answer unwilling to admit that hed never let her into that part of his history whiteread took her silence as answer enough he cracked up left the army altogether had a nervous breakdown lived beside a beach for a while somewhere north of here fife simms added mouth stuffed with chips how come you know all this its supposed to be herdman youre looking at whiteread nodded thing is we didnt have lee herdman flagged flagged as a potential psycho simms said whitereads eyes flared and he swallowed hard went back to his eating psychos not the right word whiteread corrected him for siobhans benefit but you had john flagged siobhan guessed yes whiteread admitted the breakdown you see and then he became a policeman his name appearing quite regularly in the media and about to appear again siobhan was thinking i still dont see what this has to do with the inquiry she said hoping she sounded calm its just that di rebus may have insights that could prove useful whiteread explained di hogan certainly seems to think so hes taken rebus with him to carbrae hasnt he to see robert niles another of your spectacular failures siobhan felt compelled to say whiteread seemed content to accept the comment putting most of the sandwich back down on her plate lifting her cup instead siobhans mobile rang she checked its screen rebus sorry she said getting up from the table walking towards the drink machine how did it go she asked into the mouthpiece we got a name can you start running a check whats the name brimson rebus spelled it for her first name douglas address at turnhouse as in the airport so far as we know he was another of niless visitors and doesnt live far from south queensferry so chances are he might have known lee herdman siobhan looked back to where whiteread and simms sat talking to each other ive got your army pals here want me to run this brimson character past them just in case hes exforces christ no are they listening in i was having lunch with them in the cafeteria dont worry theyre out of earshot what are they doing there whitereads got a sandwich simms is wolfing down a plate of chips she paused but its me theyve been trying to grill am i expected to laugh at that sorry feeble effort has templer spoken with you yet no what sort of moods she in ive managed to steer clear of her all morning shes probably been meeting the pathologists prior to giving me a roasting now whos the one making jokes i wish it was a joke siobhan how soon will you be back not today if i can help it bobby wants to talk to the judge why to clear up a couple of points and thatll take you the rest of the day youve plenty to keep you busy without me there meantime tell the gruesome twosome nothing the gruesome twosome siobhan glanced over in their direction theyd stopped talking finished eating both were staring at her steve hollys been sniffing around too siobhan told rebus i assume you kicked him in the balls and sent him on his way not far off it actually lets talk again before the end of play ill be here nothing from the laptop not so far keep trying the phone went dead a merrysounding series of bleeps telling siobhan that rebus had cut the connection she walked back to the table fixing a smile on her face ive got to get back she said we could give you a lift simms suggested i mean back upstairs youre finished at south queensferry whiteread asked i just have some stuff here to be getting on with stuff odds and ends from before this all started paperwork eh simms sympathized but the look on whitereads face said she wasnt falling for it id better see you out siobhan added what does a cid office look like whiteread asked ive often wondered ill give you the tour sometime siobhan answered when were not up to our eyes it was an answer whiteread was forced to accept but siobhan could see she liked it about as much as she would a mogwai concert lord jarvies was in his late fifties bobby hogan had filled rebus in on family history during the drive back to edinburgh divorced from his first wife remarried anthony the only child from this second relationship the family lived in murrayfield plenty of good schools around there rebus had commented wondering at the distance between murrayfield and south queensferry but roland jarvies was a former pupil of port edgar in his twenties hed even played for the port edgar fp rugby team what position rebus had asked john hogan had replied what i know about rugby could be written on the leftovers of one of your cigarettes hogan had expected that they would find the judge at home in shock and in mourning but a couple of calls revealed that jarvies was back at work and therefore to be found in the sheriff court on chambers street opposite the museum where jean burchill worked rebus considered calling herthere might be time for a quick coffeebut decided against it she was bound to notice his hands wasnt she best to hang fire till theyd mended he could still feel the handshake robert niles had pressed on him you ever come up against jarvies hogan asked as he parked on a single yellow line outside what had been the citys dental hospital now transformed into a nightclub and bar a few times you once or twice give him any cause to remember you lets find out shall we hogan said placing a notice on the inside of the windshield identifying the car as being on police business might be cheaper to risk a ticket rebus advised how so think about it hogan frowned in thought then nodded not everyone who walked out of the courthouse would have reason to be enamored of the police a ticket might cost thirty quid and could always be canceled after a quiet word scratched bodywork came in a little more expensive hogan removed the notice the sheriff court was a modern building but its visitors were taking their toll dried spittle on the windows graffiti on the walls the judge was in the robing room and that was where rebus and hogan were taken to meet with him the attendant bowed slightly before he left jarvies had just about finished changing out of his robes of office and back into a pinstripe suit complete with watch chain his burgundy tie sported a perfect knot and his shoes were highly polished black brogues his face looked polished too highlighting a network of tiny red veins in either cheek on a long table sat other judges workday clothes black gowns white collars gray wigs each set bore its owners name take a seat if you can find one jarvies said i wont be long he looked up mouth hanging slightly open as it often did when he was in the courtroom the first time rebus had given evidence in front of jarvies the mannerism had disconcerted him making him think the judge had been about to interrupt i do have another appointment which is why i had to see you here or not at all quite all right sir hogan said to be honest rebus added with everything youve been through were surprised to see you here at all cant let the bastards beat us can we the judge replied it didnt sound like the first time hed had to offer the explanation so what is it i can do for you rebus and hogan shared a look both finding it hard to believe the man in front of them had just lost a son its about lee herdman hogan stated seems he was friends with robert niles niles the judge looked up i remember him stabbed his wife didnt he slit her throat rebus corrected he went to jail but right now hes in carbrae what were wondering hogan added is whether youve ever had cause to fear a reprisal jarvies stood up slowly took out his watch and flipped it open checking the time i think i see he said youre seeking a motive isnt it enough to say that herdman merely lost the balance of his mind that may end up as our conclusion hogan conceded the judge was examining himself in the rooms fulllength mirror there was a faint aroma in rebuss nostrils and at last he was able to place it it was the smell of gentlemens outfitters shops hed been taken to as a child on those occasions when his father was being measured for a suit jarvies patted down a single stray hair there were touches of gray at the temples but otherwise his hair was chestnutbrown almost too brown rebus thought wondering if some coloring had gone into it the judges haircut with its precise left part gave the impression that no other style had been attempted since his schooldays sir hogan prompted robert niles ive never received any kind of threat from that direction detective inspector hogan nor had i heard the name herdman until after the shootings he turned his head from the mirror does that answer your questions yes sir if herdman had set out to target anthony why turn the gun on the other boys why wait so long after sentencing yes sir motive isnt always the issue rebuss phone trilled suddenly sounding out of place a modern distraction he smiled an apology and stepped into the redcarpeted hallway rebus he said ive just had a couple of interesting meetings gill templer said straining to keep her temper in check oh aye the forensics from fairstones kitchen show that he was probably bound and gagged that makes it murder or someone trying to give him a bloody good scare you dont sound surprised nothing much surprises me these days you already know dont you rebus stayed silent no point getting dr curt into trouble well you can probably guess who the second meeting was with carswell rebus said colin carswell assistant chief constable thats right and im now to consider myself under suspension pending investigation yes fine is that all you wanted to tell me youll be required to attend an initial interview at hq with the complaints something like this it could even be the psu meaning the professional standards unit ah the complaints paramilitary wing john her tone was a mixture of warning and exasperation ill look forward to talking to them rebus said ending the call hogan was stepping out of the robing room thanking the judge for his time he closed the door after him spoke in an undertone hes taking it well bottling it up more like rebus said falling into step ive got a bit of news by the way oh ive been suspended from duty i daresay carswells trying to find you right now to let you know hogan stopped walking turned to face rebus as predicted by you at carbrae i went back to a guys house same night he died in a fire hogans gaze dropped to rebuss gloves nothing to do with it bobby just a coincidence so whats the problem this guy had been hassling siobhan and and it looks like he was tied to a chair when the fire started hogan puffed out his cheeks witnesses i was seen going into the house with him apparently hogans phone went off different tone from rebuss caller id brought a twitch to hogans mouth carswell rebus guessed hq then thats who it is hogan nodded dropped the phone back into his pocket no point putting it off rebus told him but bobby hogan shook his head theres every point putting it off john besides they may be pulling you off casework but port edgar isnt really a case is it nobodys going to go to court its just housekeeping i suppose so rebus gave a wry smile hogan patted his arm dont you worry john uncle bobby will look after you thanks uncle bobby rebus said right up until the moment when the shit really does hit the fan by the time gill templer got back to st leonards siobhan had already tracked down douglas brimson it hadnt been exactly onerous due to the fact that brimson was in the phone book two addresses and phone numbers one home the other business templer had disappeared into her office across the corridor slamming the door after her george silvers had looked up from his desk sounds like shes on the warpath hed said pocketing his pen and preparing to beat a retreat siobhan had tried phoning rebus but he was busy busy warding off blows from the chief supers tomahawk most probably with silvers gone siobhan again found herself alone in the cid room dci pryde was around somewhere so was dc davie hynds but both were managing to make themselves invisible siobhan stared at the screen of derek renshaws laptop bored to death of sifting its inoffensive contents derek she was sure had been a good kid but dull with it hed already known the path his life would take three or four years at uni business studies with computing and then an office job maybe in accountancy money to buy a waterfront penthouse fast car and the best hifi system around but that future remained frozen realized only in words on a screen bytes of memory the thought made her shiver everything changing in an instant she held her face in her hands rubbing her fingers over her eyes knowing only one thing she didnt want to be here when gill templer emerged from behind that door because for once siobhan suspected she would give her boss as good as she got and maybe even a bit more besides she wasnt in the mood to be anybodys victim she looked at her phone then at the notebook containing brimsons details decided she shut down the laptop placing it in her shoulder bag picked up her mobile and the notebook walked her one detour a quick stop home where she found her cd of come on die young she played the album as she drove listening for clues not easy when so much of it was instrumental brimsons home address turned out to be a modern bungalow on a narrow road between the airport and what had been gogarburn hospital as siobhan got out of her car she could hear demolition work in the distance gogarburn was being dismantled she thought the site had been sold to one of the major banks to be transformed into their new headquarters the house in front of her sat behind a tall hedge and green wroughtiron gates she pushed open the gates and crunched across pink gravel tried the doorbell then peered in through the windows on either side one belonged to a living room the other a bedroom the bed had been made and the living room looked little used a couple of magazines sat on the blue leather sofa pictures of airplanes on their covers the garden to the front was mostly paved with just a couple of beds where roses waited to grow a narrow path separated the bungalow from its garage with another gate that opened when she turned the handle allowing entry to the rear garden it comprised a huge expanse of sloping lawn at the bottom of which stretched what looked like acres of farmland the timberframed conservatory seemed a recent addition to the house its door was locked windows showed her a large very white kitchen and another bedroom she got no sense of family life no garden toys nothing to suggest a womans touch all the same the place was kept in immaculate condition walking back down the path she noticed a glass pane in the garages side door there was a car inside one of the sportier jaguars but its owner definitely wasnt home she got back into her own car and headed for the airport stopping in front of the terminal building a security man warned her that parking wasnt allowed but waved her on when she showed her id the terminal was busy long queues for what looked like a charter flight to the sun business suits wheeling their cases briskly towards the escalator siobhan studied the signs saw one for information and headed that way asking at the desk to speak to mr brimson a quick clatter of a keyboard then a shake of the head im not getting that name siobhan spelled it for the woman who nodded that shed entered it correctly she picked up her phone spoke to someone her turn now to spell out the letters brimson she pulled her mouth down again shaking her head sure he works here she asked siobhan showed her the address copied from the phone book the woman smiled that says airfield love she explained thats what you want not the airport she then gave directions and siobhan thanked her and left face flushed from having made the mistake in the first place the airfield was just that it adjoined the airport and could be reached by driving halfway around the perimeter light aircraft were hangared here and according to the sign on the gate it was also home to a flying school there was a phone number below the number siobhan had copied from the phone book the high metal gate was padlocked but there was an oldfashioned telephone receiver in a wooden box attached to a post siobhan picked it up and heard the ringing tone hello a mans voice im looking for mr brimson youve found him sweetheart what can i do for you mr brimson my names detective sergeant clarke im with lothian and borders police i was wondering if i could have a word with you there was a moments silence then just wait a tick ill have to unlock the gate siobhan started to say another thankyou but the phone was dead she could see a few hangars a couple of airplanes one had a single propeller on its nose the other boasted two one on either wing they looked like twoseaters there were also a couple of squat prefabricated buildings and it was from one of these that the figure emerged hoisting itself into an opentopped venerablelooking land rover a plane coming in to land at the airport drowned out any sound of the engine starting the land rover jolted forwards speeding the hundred or so yards to the gate the man leapt out again he was tall tanned and muscularlooking probably just into his fifties with a lined face that had cracked into a brief smile of introduction a shortsleeved shirt the same greenolive color as the land rover showed off silverhaired arms brimsons thick head of hair was the same silver color and had probably been ashblond in his youth the shirt was tucked into gray canvas trousers showing the beginnings of a gut have to keep the place locked he started to explain jangling a vast set of keys taken from the land rovers ignition security she nodded her understanding there was something immediately likable about this man maybe it was his sense of energy and selfconfidence the way he rolled his shoulders as he walked up to the gate that brief winning smile but as he pulled open the gate for her she noted that his face had become more serious i suppose its about lee he said solemnly bound to happen sooner or later then he motioned for her to drive in park by the office he said ill catch up with you as she drove past him she couldnt help wondering about his choice of words bound to happen sooner or later seated opposite him in the office she got the chance to ask all i meant was he replied you were bound to want to talk to me how so because im guessing you want to know why he did it and and youll be asking his friends if they can help you were a friend of lee herdmans yes he frowned isnt that why youre here in a roundabout way yes we found out that both yourself and mr herdman paid visits to carbrae brimson nodded slowly thats clever he said the kettle having come to a boil clicked off and he leapt from his chair to pour water into two mugs of instant coffee handing one to siobhan the office was tiny just enough room for the desk and two chairs the door led back to an anteroom with a few more chairs and a couple of filing cabinets there were posters on the wallsvarious forms of aircraft youre a flying instructor mr brimson siobhan said accepting the mug call me doug please brimson sat back down a figure appeared framed by the window behind him a rap of knuckles on the pane brimson turned his head gave a wave which the other man returned thats charlie he explained going for a spin works as a banker says hed swap jobs with me tomorrow if it meant he could spend more time in the sky you rent out your planes then it took brimson a moment to follow her question no no he said at last charlie has his own plane he just keeps it here the airfields yours though brimson nodded inasmuch as i rent the actual ground from the airport but yes all this is mine he opened his arms wide offering another smile and how long have you known lee herdman the arms dropped and the smile with them a good few years can you be more specific pretty much since he moved here that would be six years then if you say so he paused im sorry ive forgotten your name detective sergeant clarke were the two of you close close brimson shrugged lee didnt really let people get close i mean he was friendly liked meeting up all that sort of thing but brimson frowned in concentration i was never really sure what was going on in here he tapped his head what did you think when you heard about the shooting he shrugged it was impossible to believe did you know herdman had a gun no he was interested in them though thats true but he never showed me one never talked about it never so what did the two of you talk about planes boats the service i served seven years in the raf as a pilot brimson shook his head didnt do much piloting back then i was the electrics wizard keeping the crates up in the air he leaned across the desk have you ever flown just holiday trips he wrinkled his face i mean like charlie there he hooked his thumb towards where a small plane was taxiing past the window engines droning i have enough trouble driving a car a planes easier believe me so all those dials and switches are just for show he laughed we could go right now what do you say mr brimson doug mr brimson i dont really have time for a flying lesson right now tomorrow then ill think about it she couldnt help smiling thinking that a thousand feet above edinburgh might be safe from gill templer youll love it thats a promise well see but youll be off duty right which means youll be allowed to call me doug he waited till shed nodded and what will i be allowed to call you detective sergeant clarke siobhan an irish name gaelic your accents not my accents not what im here to talk about he raised his hands in mock surrender why didnt you come forward she asked he seemed not to understand after the shooting some of mr herdmans friends called to talk to us did they what for all kinds of reasons he considered his answer i didnt see the point siobhan lets save first names for later eh brimson tilted his head in apology there was a sudden burst of static then transistorized voices the tower he explained reaching down behind his desk to tweak the volume on the radio set thats charlie requesting a slot he glanced at his watch should be okay this time of day siobhan listened to a voice warning the pilot to watch out for a helicopter over the city center roger control brimson turned the volume lower still id like to bring a colleague out here to talk to you siobhan said would that be all right brimson shrugged you can see how hectic life is around here only really busy on weekends i wish i could say the same dont tell me youre not busy on weekends goodlooking young woman like you i meant he laughed again im only teasing no wedding ring though he nodded towards her left hand do you think id make the grade in cid i notice you dont wear a ring either eligible bachelor thats me friends say its because ive got my head in the clouds he pointed upwards not too many singles bars up there siobhan smiled then realized that she was enjoying the conversationalways a bad sign there were questions she knew she should be asking but they werent coming into focus maybe tomorrow then she said getting up from the chair your first flying lesson she shook her head talking to my colleague but youll come too if i can he seemed satisfied came around the desk hand outstretched good to meet you siobhan good to meet you mr she faltered as he raised a warning finger doug she relented ill see you out i can manage opening the door wanting a little more space between them than he was allowing really youre good at picking locks then are you she remembered the padlocked gate right enough she said following doug brimson outside just as charlies machine came to the end of its runup and lifted its wheels clear of the ground has gill tracked you down yet siobhan asked speaking into her phone as she drove back into the city affirmative rebus replied not that i was hiding or anything so whats the outcome suspended from duty except that bobby doesnt see it that way he still wants me helping out which means you still need me right i think i could just about drive myself if i had to but you dont have to he laughed im just teasing siobhan the gigs yours if you want it good because ive tracked down brimson im impressed who is he runs a flying school out at turnhouse she paused i went to see him i know i should have checked first but your phone was engaged shes been out to see brimson she heard rebus tell hogan hogan muttered something back bobbys of the opinion rebus told her that you should have sought permission before doing that are those his exact words actually he rolled his eyes and uttered a few oaths im choosing to extrapolate thanks for saving my maidenly blushes so what did you get out of him he was friends with herdman they share similar backgrounds army and raf and how does he know robert niles siobhans mouth twitched i forgot to ask him that i did say wed go back sounds like well have to did he offer anything at all says he didnt know herdman kept guns and doesnt know why he went to the school what about niles sod all use to us so where do we go from here lets rendezvous at port edgar we need to have a proper talk with miss teri there was silence on the line and siobhan thought shed lost him but then he asked any more messages from our friend meaning the notes keeping it vague in front of hogan there was another one waiting for me this morning yes much the same as the first sent it to howdenhall didnt see the point good ill want a look at it when we meet up how long will you be fifteen minutes give or take a fiver says we beat you youre on siobhan said pressing her foot a little harder to the accelerator it was a few moments before she realized she didnt know where rebus had been calling from true to form he was waiting for her in the car park of port edgar academy leaning against hogans passat one foot crossed over the other arms folded you cheated she said getting out of her car caveat emptor thats five quid you owe me no way you took the bet siobhan a lady always pays up she shook her head reached into her pocket heres that letter by the way she said producing the envelope rebus held out his hand cost you a fiver to read it rebus looked at her for the privilege of giving you my expert opinion his hand stayed outstretched the envelope just out of reach all right its a deal he said curiosity winning in the end in the car he read it through several times while siobhan drove a fiver wasted he finally offered whos cody i think it means come on die young its a gang thing from america how do you know that its a mogwai album i loaned you their stuff might be a name buffalo bill for example the connection being i dont know rebus refolded the note examining its creases peering inside the envelope good sherlock holmes impression siobhan said what else do you want me to do you could admit defeat she held out her hand rebus returned the note to her tucked back in its envelope make my day dirty harry thats my guess siobhan agreed dirty harry was a cop she stared at him you think someone i work with did this dont say it hasnt crossed your mind it has she finally admitted but it would have to be someone who knows you connect to fairstone yes and that brings it down to me and gill templer he paused and im guessing youve not loaned her any albums of late siobhan shrugged eyes back on the road ahead she didnt say anything for a while and neither did rebus until he checked an address in his notebook leaned forwards in his seat and told her were here long rib house was a narrow whitewashed structure that looked as though it might have been a barn sometime in the past it consisted of a single story but with an attic conversion indicated by a row of windows built out from the sloping redtiled roof a wooden gate barred the entrance but it wasnt locked siobhan pushed it open got back into the car and drove up the few yards of gravel driveway by the time shed closed the gate again the front door was open a man standing there rebus was out of the car introducing himself and you must be mr cotter he guessed william cotter miss teris father said he was in his early forties short and stocky with a fashionably shaven head he shook siobhans hand when she offered it but didnt seem put out that rebus was keeping his own gloved hands firmly by his sides you better come in he said there was a long carpeted hallway decorated with framed paintings and a grandfather clock rooms off to right and left the doors firmly closed cotter led them to the end of the corridor and into an openplan living area with a kitchen off it this had the look of a recent extension french doors leading out to a patio and offering a view across the expanse of rear garden towards another recent addition woodframed but with plenty of windows to show off its contents indoor pool rebus mused that must be handy gets more use than an outdoor one cotter joked so what can i do for you rebus looked to siobhan who was casting an eye over the room taking in the lshaped cream leather sofa the b ampo hifi and flatscreen tv the tv was switched on sound muted it was tuned to ceefax showing a screen of stock market fluctuations it was teri we wanted a word with rebus said not in any trouble is she nothing like that mr cotter its to do with port edgar just a few followup questions cotter narrowed his eyes maybe its something i can help with angling for more information rebus had decided to sit down on the sofa there was a coffee table in front of him newspapers spread out on it open to the business pages cordless phone and a pair of halfmoon reading glasses empty mug pen and legal pad youre in business mr cotter thats right mind if i ask what sort venture capital cotter paused you know what that is investing in startups siobhan offered staring out at the garden more or less i dabble in property people with ideas rebus made a show of taking in his surroundings youre obviously good at it he waited for the flattery to sink in is teri here not sure cotter said he saw rebuss look and gave an apologetic smile youre never sure with teri sometimes shes quiet as the grave knock on her door she doesnt answer he shrugged not like most teenagers then cotter shook his head but then i got that impression when i met her rebus added youve spoken to her before cotter asked rebus nodded in full regalia im guessing she doesnt go to school like that cotter shook his head again theyre not even allowed nose studs dr foggs strict about that sort of thing could we maybe try her door siobhan asked turning to face cotter cant do any harm i suppose cotter said they followed him back down the hall and up a short flight of stairs again they were confronted with a long narrow corridor doors along both sides again all the doors were closed teri cotter called as they reached the top of the stairs you still here love he bit this final word off and rebus guessed hed been warned off using it by his daughter they reached the final door and cotter put his ear to it knocking softly could be dozing i suppose he said in an undertone mind if i without waiting for an answer rebus turned the handle the door opened inwards the room was dark gauzy black curtains drawn shut cotter flicked the light switch there were candles on every available surface black candles many of them melted down to almost nothing prints and posters on the walls rebus recognized some by h r giger knew him because hed designed an album for elp they were set in a kind of stainlesssteel hell the other pictures showed equally dark imaginings teenagers eh was the fathers only comment books by poppy z brite and anne rice another called the gates of janus apparently written by moors murderer ian brady plenty of cds all by noise merchants the sheets on the single bed were black so was the shiny duvet cover the walls of the room were the color of meat the ceiling split into four squares two black two red siobhan was standing by a computer desk the setup on top of it looked highquality flatscreen monitor dvd hard disk scanner and webcam i dont suppose these come in black she mused otherwise teri would have them cotter agreed when i was her age rebus said only goths i knew of were pubs cotter laughed yes gothenburgs they were community pubs werent they rebus nodded unless shes under the bed im guessing shes not here any idea where we might find her i could try her mobile would that be this one siobhan said holding up a small glossy black phone thats it cotter agreed not like a teenager to leave her phone at home siobhan mused no well teris mum can be he twitched his shoulders as if feeling a sudden discomfort can be what sir rebus prodded she likes to keep tabs on teri is that it siobhan guessed cotter nodded relieved that shed saved him the trouble of spelling it out teri should be home later he said if it can wait wed rather get it over and done with mr cotter rebus explained well time being money and all that as im sure youd agree cotter nodded you could try cockburn street a few of her friends sometimes congregate there rebus looked at siobhan we should have thought of that he said siobhans mouth gave a twitch of agreement cockburn street a winding conduit between the royal mile and waverley station had always enjoyed a louche reputation decades back it had been the haunt of hippies and dropouts selling cheesecloth shirts tiedye and cigarette papers rebus had frequented a good secondhand record stall without ever bothering with the clothes these days the new alternative cultures lionized the place a good street for browsing if your tastes inclined towards the macabre or the stoned as they walked back along the hallway rebus noticed that one door had a small porcelain plaque stating that this was stuarts room rebus paused in front of it your son cotter nodded slowly charlotte my wife she wants it kept the way it was before the accident no shame in that sir siobhan offered sensing cotters embarrassment i suppose not tell me rebus said did teris goth phase start before or after her brothers death cotter looked at him soon after the pair of them were close rebus guessed i suppose so but i dont see what any of this has to do with rebus shrugged just curious thats all sorry its one of the pitfalls of the job cotter seemed to accept this and led them back down the staircase i buy cds there siobhan said they were back in the car heading for cockburn street ditto rebus told her and hed often seen the goths taking up more than their fair share of sidewalk spilling down the flight of steps to the side of the old scotsman building sharing cigarettes and trading tips on the latest bands they started to appear as soon as school had finished for the day maybe changing out of their uniforms and into the regulation black makeup and baubles hoping to fit in and stand out at the same time thing was people were harder to shock these days once upon a time collarlength hair would have done it then glam came along followed by its bastard offspring punk rebus still remembered one saturday when hed been out buying records starting the long climb up cockburn street and passing his first punks all slouches and spiky hair chains and sneers it had been too much for the middleaged woman behind him whod spluttered out the words cant you walk like human beings probably making the punks day in the process we could park at the bottom of the road and walk up siobhan suggested as they neared cockburn street id rather park at the top and walk down rebus countered they were in luck a space opened up just as they approached and they were able to park on cockburn street itself only a few yards from where a bunch of goths were milling around bingo rebus said spotting miss teri in animated conversation with two friends youll need to get out first siobhan told him rebus saw the problem there were bags of rubbish sitting curbside awaiting collection and blocking the driversside door he got out holding the door open so siobhan could slide across and make her exit feet were running down the sidewalk and then rebus saw one of the rubbish bags disappear he looked up and saw five youths hurtling past the car dressed in hooded tops and baseball caps one of them was swinging the rubbish bag into the group of goths the bag burst spraying its contents everywhere there were shouts screams feet were swinging as were fists one goth was sent flying headfirst down the stone steps another dodged into the roadway and was winged by a passing taxi bystanders were yelling warnings shopkeepers coming to their doors someone called out to phone the police the fighting was spilling across the street bodies pushed against windows hands clawing at necks only five attackers to a dozen goths but the five were strong and vicious siobhan had run forward to tackle one of them rebus saw miss teri diving through a shop doorway slamming the door after her the door was glass and her pursuer was looking around for something to throw through it rebus took a deep breath and hollered rab fisher hey rab over here the pursuer stopped looked in rebuss direction rebus was waving a gloved hand remember me rab fishers mouth twisted in a sneer another of his gang had recognized rebus polis he yelled the other lost boys heeding his call they gathered in the middle of the road chests pumping breathing hard ready for that trip to saughton lads rebus asked loudly taking a step forwards four of them turned and ran jogging downhill rab fisher lingered then gave the glass door a final stubborn kick before sauntering off to join his friends siobhan was helping a couple of the goths to their feet checking for injuries there had been no knives or missiles mostly it was only pride that had taken a beating rebus walked over to the glass door behind it miss teri had been joined by a woman in a white coat the kind worn by doctors and pharmacists rebus saw a row of gleaming cubicles it was a tanning salon brandnew by the look of it the woman was running a hand down teris hair while teri tried to wriggle free rebus pushed open the door remember me teri he said she studied him then nodded youre the policeman i met rebus held out a hand towards the woman you must be teris mother im di rebus charlotte cotter the woman said taking his hand she was in her late thirties with lots of wavy ashblond hair her face was lightly tanned almost glowing looking at the two women it was hard to see any similarity if told they were related rebus might have guessed they were contemporaries not sisters but maybe cousins the mother was an inch or two shorter than her daughter slimmer and tonedlooking rebus thought he knew now which member of the cotter family made use of the indoor pool what was all that about he asked teri she shrugged nothing you get a lot of hassle theyre always getting hassle her mother answered for her receiving a glare for her trouble verbal abuse sometimes more like youd know her daughter argued i see things is that why you opened this place to keep an eye on me teri had started playing with the gold chain around her neck rebus could see a diamond hanging from it teri charlotte cotter said with a sigh all im saying is im going outside teri muttered before you do rebus interrupted any chance i could have a word im not going to press charges or anything you see how stubborn she is charlotte cotter said sounding exasperated i heard you shout out a name inspector does that mean you know these thugs you can arrest them im not sure it would do any good mrs cotter but you saw them rebus nodded and now theyve been warned could be enough to do the trick thing is its not just chance that i was here i wanted a word with teri oh come on then teri said grabbing him by the arm sorry mum got to go help the police with their inquiries hang on teri but it was too late charlotte cotter could only watch as her daughter dragged the detective back outside and across the road to where the mood was lightening battle scars were being compared one boy in a black trench coat was sniffing his lapels wrinkling his nose to acknowledge that the coat would need a good wash the rubbish from the torn bag had been gathered togethermostly by siobhan rebus guessed she was trying to elicit help in filling an intact bag the gift of a neighboring shop everybody okay teri asked there were smiles and nods it looked to rebus like they were enjoying the moment victims again and happy with their lot like the punks and the woman they had got their reaction still a group but strengthened now war stories they could share other kidson their slow route home from school still dressed in uniformhad stopped to listen rebus led miss teri back up the street and into the nearest watering hole we dont serve her kind the woman behind the bar snapped you do when im here rebus snapped back shes underage the woman pressed then shell take a soft drink he turned to teri whatll it be vodka tonic rebus smiled give her a coke ill have a laphroaig with a splash of water he paid for the drinks confident enough now to try bringing coins from his pocket as well as notes how are the hands teri cotter asked fine he said you can carry the drinks though they received a few stares as they made their way to a table teri seemed pleased with the reception blowing a kiss at one man who just sneered and looked away you pick a fight in here rebus warned her youre on your own i can handle myself i saw that the way you ran to your mums as soon as the lost boys arrived she glowered at him good plan by the way he added defense the better part of valor and all that is it true what your mum says this sort of thing happens a lot not as much as she seems to think and yet you keep coming to cockburn street why shouldnt we he shrugged no reason bit of masochism never hurt anyone she stared at him then smiled gazing down into her glass cheers he said lifting his own you got the quote wrong she said the better part of valor is discretion shakespeare henry iv part one not that you and your pals could be described as discreet i try not to be you do a good job when i mentioned the lost boys you didnt seem surprised meaning you know them she looked down again the hair falling over her pale face her fingers stroked the glass nails glossy black slender hands and wrists got a cigarette she asked light us a couple rebus said digging the pack out of his jacket pocket she placed the lit cigarette between his lips people will start to talk she said exhaling smoke i doubt it miss teri he watched the door swing open siobhan walk in she saw him and nodded towards the toilets holding up her hands to let him know she was going to wash them you like being an outsider dont you rebus asked teri cotter nodded and thats why you liked lee herdman he was an outsider too she looked at him we found your photo in his flat from which i assume you knew him i knew him can i see the photo rebus took it from his pocket it was held inside a clear polyethylene envelope where was it taken he asked right here she said gesturing towards the street you knew him pretty well didnt you he liked us goths i mean never really understood why he had a few parties didnt he rebus was remembering the albums in herdmans flat music for goths to dance to teri was nodding blinking back tears some of us used to go to his place she held up the photo where did you find this inside a book he was reading which book why do you want to know she shrugged just wondered it was a biography i think some soldier who ended up doing himself in you think thats a clue a clue she nodded to why lee killed himself might be i suppose did you ever meet any of his friends i dont think he had many friends what about doug brimson the question came from siobhan she was sliding onto the banquette teris mouth twitched yeah i know him you dont sound enthusiastic rebus commented you could say that whats wrong with him siobhan wanted to know rebus could see her prickling teri just shrugged the two lads who died rebus said ever see them at the parties as if meaning what she looked at him they werent the type rugby and jazz music and the cadets as if this explained everything did lee ever talk about his time in the army not much but you asked him she nodded slowly and you knew he had a thing about guns i knew he kept pictures she bit her lip but too late on the inside of his wardrobe door siobhan added its not everyone whod know that teri doesnt mean anything teris voice had risen she was playing with her neck chain again nobodys on trial here teri rebus said we just want to know what made him do it how should i know because you knew him and it seems not many people did teri was shaking her head he never told me anything that was the thing about himlike he had secrets but i never thought hed no she fixed her eyes on rebuss but said nothing he ever show you a gun teri siobhan asked no ever hint that he had access to one a shake of the head you say he never really opened up to you what about the other way round how do you mean did he ask about you maybe you spoke to him about your family i might have rebus leaned forwards we were sorry to hear about your brother teri siobhan too leaned forwards you probably mentioned the crash to lee herdman or maybe one of your pals did rebus added teri saw that they were hemming her in no escape from their stares and questions she had placed the photo on the table concentrating her attention on it lee didnt take this she said as if trying to change the subject anyone else we should talk to teri rebus was asking people who went to lees little soirees i dont want to answer any more questions why not teri siobhan asked frowning as though genuinely puzzled because i dont other names we can talk to rebus was saying might get us off your back teri cotter sat for a moment longer then rose to her feet and climbed onto the banquette stepped onto the table and jumped down to the floor at the other side the gauzy black layers of her skirts billowing out around her without looking back she made for the door opened it and banged it shut behind her rebus looked at siobhan and gave a grudging smile the girl has a certain style he said we panicked her siobhan admitted pretty much as soon as we mentioned her brothers death could be they were just close rebus argued youre not really going for the assassin theory all the same she said theres something the door opened again and teri cotter strode towards the table leaning on it with both hands her face close to her inquisitors james bell she hissed theres a name for you if you want one he went to herdmans parties rebus asked teri cotter just nodded then turned away again the regulars watching her make her exit shook their heads and went back to their drinks that interview we listened to rebus said what was it james bell said about herdman something about going waterskiing yes but the way he said it wed met socially something like that siobhan nodded maybe we should have picked up on it we need to talk to him siobhan kept nodding but she was looking at the table she peered beneath it lost something rebus asked no but you have rebus looked too and it dawned on him teri cotter had taken her photograph with her think that was why she came back siobhan guessed rebus shrugged i suppose it counts as her property a memento of the man shes lost you think they were lovers stranger things have happened in which case but rebus shook his head using her womanly wiles to persuade him to turn assassin do me a favor siobhan stranger things have happened she echoed speaking of which any chance of you buying me a drink he held up his empty glass none whatsoever she said getting up to leave glumly he followed her out of the bar she was standing by her car seemingly transfixed by something rebus couldnt see anything worthy of note the goths were milling around as before minus miss teri no sign of the lost boys either a few tourists stopping for photographs what is it he asked she nodded towards a car parked opposite looks like doug brimsons land rover you sure i saw it when i was out at turnhouse she looked up and down cockburn street brimson wasnt anywhere to be seen its in worse shape than my saab rebus commented yes but you dont have a jag garaged at home a jag and a clappedout land rover i reckon its an image thing boys and their toys she looked up and down the street again wonder where he is maybe hes stalking you rebus suggested he saw the look on her face and shrugged an apology she turned her attention to the car again certain in her mind that it was his coincidence she told herself thats all it is coincidence but all the same she jotted down the number that evening she settled down on her sofa trying to get interested in anything on tv two gaudily dressed hosts were telling their victim that her clothes were all wrong for her on another channel a house was being decluttered which left siobhan the choice of a graylooking film a dreary comedy series or a documentary about cane toads all of which served her right for not bothering to stop off at the video shop her own collection of films was smallselect as she preferred to call it shed watched each one half a dozen times at least could recite dialogue knew exactly what was coming in every scene maybe she would put some music on turn the tv to mute and invent her own script for the boringlooking film or even for the cane toads shed already skimmed a magazine picked up a book and put it down again eaten the crisps and chocolate shed bought at the garage when shed stopped for petrol there was a halffinished chow mein on the kitchen table which she might get around to microwaving worst of all shed run out of wine nothing in the flat but empty bottles awaiting the recycling run she had gin in the cupboard but nothing to mix it with except diet coke and she wasnt that desperate not yet anyway there were friends she could phone but she knew she wouldnt make great company there was a message on her answering machine from her friend caroline asking if she fancied a drink blond and petite caroline always attracted attention when the two of them went out together siobhan had decided not to return the call just yet she was too tired with the case buzzing around her head refusing to leave her alone shed made herself coffee taking a mouthful before realizing she hadnt boiled the kettle then shed spent a couple of minutes searching the kitchen for sugar before remembering she didnt take sugar hadnt taken it in coffee since shed been a teenager senile dementia shed muttered aloud and talking to yourself another symptom chocolate and crisps werent on her panicfree diet salt fat and sugar her heart wasnt exactly racing but she knew she had to calm down somehow had to relax and start winding down as bedtime approached shed stared out of her window for a while checking on the neighbors across the street pressing her nose to the glass as she looked down two stories to the passing traffic it was quiet outside quiet and dark the pavement picked out by orange streetlamps there were no bogeymen nothing to be scared of she remembered that a long time ago back in the days when shed still taken sugar in her coffee shed been afraid of the dark for a while about the age of thirteen or fourteen too old to confide in her parents she would spend her pocket money on batteries for the flashlight she kept on all night keeping it beneath the covers with her holding her breath in an attempt to pick out the breathing of anyone else in the room the few times her parents caught her they just thought she was staying up late to read she could never be sure which was the right thing to do leave the door open so you could make a run for it or close it to keep out intruders she checked beneath her bed two or three times each day though there was little enough room under there it was where she stored her albums the thing was she never had nightmares when she did eventually drop off to sleep that sleep was deep and cleansing she never suffered panic attacks and eventually she forgot why shed ever been afraid in the first place the flashlight went back in its drawer the money shed been wasting on batteries she now started spending on makeup she could never be sure which came first did she discover boys or did they discover her ancient history girl she told herself now there were no bogeymen out there but precious few knights either tarnished or otherwise she walked over to her dining table looked at her notes on the case they were laid out in no order whatsoevereverything shed been given that first day reports autopsy and forensics photos of crime scene and victims she studied the two faces derek renshaw and anthony jarvies both were handsome in a bland sort of way there was a haughty intelligence to jarviess heavylidded stare renshaw looked a lot less sure of himself maybe it was a class thing jarviess breeding showing through she reckoned allan renshaw would have been proud of the fact that his son boasted a judges son as a friend it was why you sent your kids to private school wasnt it you wanted them to meet the right sort of people people who might prove useful in the future she knew fellow officers not all of them on cid salaries who scrimped to send their offspring to the kind of schools they themselves had never been offered the chance of the class thing again she wondered about lee herdman hed been in the army the sas ordered about by officers whod been to the right schools who spoke the right way could it be as simple as that could his attack have been motivated by nothing more than bitter envy of an elite theres no mystery remembering her own words to rebus she laughed out loud if there was no mystery what was she worrying about why was she slogging her guts out what was to stop her putting it all to one side and relaxing bugger it she said sitting down at the table pushing away the paperwork and pulling derek renshaws laptop towards her she booted it up plugging it in to her phone line there were emails to be gone through enough to keep her awake half the night if need be plenty of other files too that she hadnt checked yet she knew the work would calm her it would calm her because it was work she decided on some decaf this time remembering to turn the kettle on took the hot drink to the living room the password miles got her online but the new emails were junk people trying to sell insurance or viagra to someone they couldnt know was dead there were a few messages from people whod noted dereks absence from various bulletin boards and chat rooms siobhan thought of something and dragged the icon to the top of the screen clicking on favorite places up came a list of sites shortcuts to addresses derek had used regularly the chat rooms and bulletin boards were there along with the usual suspects amazon bbc ask jeeves but one address was unfamiliar siobhan clicked on it connection took only a few moments welcome to my darkness the words were in dull red the color pulsing with life the rest of the screen was a blank background siobhan moved the cursor onto the letter w and doubleclicked connection took a little longer this time the screen changing to a picture of a rooms interior the image was fairly indistinct she tried altering the screens contrast and brightness but the problem was with the image itself there was little she could do to improve it she could make out a bed and a curtained window behind it she tried moving the cursor around the screen but there was no hidden marker for her to click on this was all there was she was sitting back arms folded wondering what it might mean wondering what interest the image could have had for derek renshaw maybe it was his room maybe the darkness was another side to his character then the screen changed a strange yellow light passing across it interference of some kind siobhan sat forwards grasping the edge of her table she knew what it was now it was a cars headlights brief illumination from behind the curtains not a picture then not a captured still webcam she whispered she was watching a realtime broadcast of somebodys bedroom moreover she knew now whose bedroom it was those headlights had done just enough she got up found her telephone and made the call siobhan plugged everything in and rebooted the computer the laptop was on a chairnot enough cable to stretch from rebuss telephone jack to his dining table all very mysterious he said bringing in a traymugs of coffee for the pair of them she could smell vinegar a fish supper probably thinking of the chow mein waiting for her at home she realized how similar they weretakeaway food no one to go home to hed been drinking beer an empty bottle of deuchars on the floor by his chair and listening to music the hawkwind anthology shed bought him last birthday maybe hed put it on specially to make her think he hadnt forgotten almost there she said now rebus had turned off the cd and was rubbing his eyes with his ungloved hotlooking hands nearly ten oclock hed been asleep in his chair when shed phoned quite content to stay there till morning easier than getting undressed easier than untying shoelaces fiddling with buttons he hadnt bothered tidying up siobhan knew him too well but hed closed the kitchen door so she wouldnt see the dirty dishes if she saw them shed offer to wash up for him and he didnt want that just need to connect rebus had brought one of the dining chairs over to sit on siobhan was kneeling on the floor in front of the laptop she angled its screen a little and he nodded to let her know he could see it welcome to my darkness alice cooper fan club he guessed just wait royal society for the blind if i so much as smile you have permission to hit me over the head with the tray she sat back a little there now take a look the room was no longer completely dark candles had been lit black candles teri cotters bedroom rebus stated siobhan nodded rebus watched the candles flicker this is a film its a live feed as far as i know meaning there was a webcam attached to her computer thats where the pictures coming from when i first watched the room was dark she must be home now is this supposed to be interesting rebus asked some people like it some of them pay to watch stuff like this but were getting a show for free seems like you reckon she switches it off when she comes in where would the fun be in that she keeps it on all the time siobhan shrugged maybe were going to find out teri cotter had entered the frame moving jerkily the camera presenting a series of stills broken up by momentary delays no sound rebus inquired siobhan didnt think so but she tried turning up the volume anyway no sound she acknowledged teri had seated herself crosslegged on her bed she was dressed in the same clothes as when theyd met she seemed to be looking towards the camera she leaned forwards and stretched out on her bed supporting her chin on her cupped hands face close to the camera now like one of those old silent films rebus said siobhan didnt know if he was referring to the picture quality or the lack of sound what exactly are we supposed to be doing were her audience she knows were here siobhan shook her head probably no way of knowing whos watchingif anyone but derek renshaw used to watch yes you think she knows siobhan shrugged sipped the bittertasting coffee it wasnt decaf and she might suffer for it later but she didnt care so what do you think he asked its not so unusual for young girls to be exhibitionists she paused not that ive come across anything like this before i wonder who else knows about this i doubt her parents do is it something we need to ask her rebus was thoughtful how would people get here he pointed towards the screen there are lists of home pages shed just have to provide a link maybe a description lets take a look so siobhan quit the page and went hunting through cyberspace typing in the words miss and teri page after page of links came up mostly for porn sites and people called terry terri and teri this could take a while she said so this is what ive been missing out on not having a modem all human life is here most of it ever so slightly depressing just whats needed after a day at the coal mines her face creased in what could almost have passed for a smile rebus made a show of reaching for the tea tray here we go i think siobhan said a couple of minutes later rebus looked at where she was underlining some words with her finger myss terivisit my nonpornographic sorry guys home page why myss rebus asked could be all the other spellings were already taken my emails siobhan because sixtyfive siobhans got there ahead of you she nodded and i thought i had an uncommon name siobhan had clicked on the link teri cotters home page started to load there was a photo of her in full goth mode palms held to either side of her face shes drawn pentagrams on her hands siobhan noted rebus was looking fivepointed stars enclosed by circles there were no other photos just some text outlining teris interests which school she attended and an invitation to come worship me cockburn street most saturday afternoons there was an option of sending her an email adding comments to her guest book or clicking on various links most of which would send the visitor to other goth sites one of which was marked dark entry thatll be the webcam siobhan said she tried the link just to be sure the screen changed back to the same red words welcome to my darkness another click and they were in teri cotters bedroom again shed changed position so that she had her head against the headboard knees tucked in front of her she was writing something in a looseleaf binder looks like homework siobhan said could be her potions book rebus suggested anyone accessing her home page would know her age which school she goes to and what she looks like siobhan was nodding and where to find her on a saturday afternoon a dangerous pastime rebus muttered he was thinking of her potential as prey to any of the hunters out there maybe thats why she likes it rebus rubbed his eyes again he was remembering his first meeting with her the way shed said she was jealous of derek and anthony and her parting remark you can see me whenever you like he knew now what those words had been hinting at seen enough siobhan asked tapping the screen he nodded initial thoughts ds clarke well if she and herdman were lovers and if he was the jealous type that only works if anthony jarvies knew about the site jarvies and derek were best friends what are the chances derek didnt let him in on it good point well need to check and talk to teri again rebus nodded slowly can we open the visitors book they could but it didnt have much to say no obvious notes from either derek renshaw or anthony jarvies just twaddle from some of miss teris admirers the majority of whom seemed to be based abroad if their english was anything to go by rebus watched siobhan as she shut the laptop down did you run that license plate he asked she nodded last thing i did before clocking off it was brimsons curiouser and curiouser siobhan folded the screen shut how are you coping she asked i mean dressing and undressing im all right not sleeping in your clothes no he tried to sound indignant so i can expect to see a clean shirt tomorrow stop mothering me she smiled i could run you another bath i can manage he waited till her eyes met his cross my heart and hope to die which took him back to his first meeting with teri cotter asking him about deaths hed witnessed wanting to know what it felt like to die with a website that would be as good as an invitation to some sick minds theres something i want to show you siobhan said rummaging in her bag she produced a book showed him the cover im a man by ruth padel its about rock music she explained opening it to a marked page listen to this the heroism dream begins in the teenage bedroom meaning what shes talking about how teenagers use music as a kind of rebellion maybe teris using her actual bedroom she flicked to another page and theres something else the gun is male sexuality in jeopardy she looked at him makes sense to me youre saying herdman was jealous after all youve never been jealous never flown into a rage he thought for a moment maybe once or twice kate mentioned a book to me it was called bad men do what good men dream maybe herdmans rage took him too far she held a hand to her mouth stifling a yawn time you got to bed rebus told her plenty of time in the morning for amateur analysis she unplugged the laptop gathered up the cables he saw her out then watched from his window as she made it to the safety of her car suddenly a mans figure appeared at her driversside door rebus turned and ran for the stairs took them two at a time hauled open the front door the man was saying something voice raised above the ticking engine he was holding something to the windshield a newspaper rebus grabbed his shoulder feeling a jab of fire from his fingers turned him around recognized the face it was the reporter steve holly rebus realized that what he was holding was probably the next mornings edition very man i wanted to see holly said shrugging himself free and offering a grin nice to see cid making home visits to each other he turned to glance at siobhan who had cut her engine and was stepping from the car some might think it a bit late in the evening for chitchat what do you want rebus asked just after a comment he held up the papers front page so rebus could make out the headline hell house cop mystery were not printing any names as yet wondered if you wanted to put your side of the story i understand youre on suspension subject to an internal inquiry holly had folded the paper and produced a microrecorder from his pocket that looks nasty he was nodding towards rebuss ungloved hands burns take a while to heal dont they john siobhan warning him not to lose his head rebus pointed a blistered finger at the reporter stay away from the renshaws you hassle them youll have me to deal with understood then give me an interview not a chance holly looked down at the paper he was holding how about this for a headline cop flees murder scene itll look good to my lawyers when i sue you my papers always open to a fair fight di rebus then thats a problem rebus said smothering the tape recorder with his hand because i never fight fair spitting the words out showing holly two rows of bared teeth the reporter pressed his finger to a button stopping the tape nice to know where we stand lay off the families holly i mean it in your sad misguided way im sure you do sweet dreams detective inspector he bowed slightly in siobhans direction then strode off bastard rebus hissed i wouldnt worry about it siobhan said soothingly only a quarter of the population reads his paper anyway she climbed back into her car turned the ignition and backed out of the parking space gave a little wave as she drove away holly had disappeared around a corner heading for marchmont road rebus climbed his stairwell went indoors and found his car keys put his gloves back on doublelocked the door on the way out the streets were quiet no sign of steve holly not that he was looking for him he got into his saab and tried gripping the steering wheel turning it left and right he thought he could manage he drove down marchmont road and onto melville drive heading towards arthurs seat he didnt bother putting any music on thought instead of everything that had happened letting conversations and images swirl around irene lesser you might want to talk to someone a long time to be carrying any baggage siobhan quoting from that book kate bad men do boethius good men suffer he didnt think of himself as a bad man but knew he probably wasnt a good one either im a man title of an old blues song robert niles leaving the sas but without having been switched off first lee herdman too had carried baggage with him rebus felt that if he could understand herdman maybe he would understand himself better too easter road was quiet bars still serving a queue beginning to form in the chip shop rebus was headed for leith police station the driving was okay the pain in his hands bearable the skin there seemed to have grown taut as if from sunburn he saw a space curbside not fifty yards from the front door of the station and decided to take it got out and locked the car there was a camera crew across the street probably wanting the station in the background as the reporter did his piece then rebus saw who it was jack bell bell turning his head recognized rebus pointed to him before turning back to the camera rebus caught his words while cid officers like the one behind me continue to mop up without ever offering workable solutions cut the director said sorry jack he nodded towards rebus who had crossed the road and was standing directly behind bell whats going on rebus asked were doing a piece on violence in society bell snapped annoyed at the interruption i thought maybe it was a selfhelp video rebus drawled what a guide to curb crawling something like that most of the girls work down that way now rebus added nodding in the direction of salamander street how dare you the msp spluttered then he turned to the director symptomatic you see of the very problem were tackling the police have ceased to be anything other than pettyminded and spiteful unlike yourself im sure rebus said he noticed for the first time that bell was holding a photograph bell held it up in front of him thomas hamilton he stated no one thought him exceptional turned out he was evil incarnate when he walked into that school in dunblane and how could the police have prevented that rebus asked folding his arms before bell could answer the director had a question for rebus were any videos or magazines found in herdmans home violent films that sort of thing theres no sign he was interested in anything like that but so what if he was the director just shrugged deciding he wasnt going to get what he wanted from rebus jack maybe you could do a quick interview with sorry i didnt catch your name he smiled at rebus my names fuck you rebus said returning the smile then he crossed the road again and pushed open the door of the police station youre a disgrace jack bell was shouting at him an absolute disgrace dont think i wont take this any further that you making friends again the desk sergeant asked i seem to be blessed that way rebus informed him climbing the stairs to the cid office overtime was available on the herdman case which meant a few souls were still working even at this hour tapping reports into computers or sharing gossip over hot drinks rebus recognized dc mark pettifer and walked over to him something i need mark he said whats that then john the loan of a laptop pettifer smiled thought your generation preferred quill and parchment one other thing rebus added ignoring this it has to be internetready i think i can sort you something out while youre doing that rebus leaned in closer dropping his voice remember when jack bell got pulled in for curb crawling that was some of your lads wasnt it pettifer nodded slowly i dont suppose thered be any paperwork i wouldnt think so he was never charged was he rebus was thoughtful what about the guys who stopped his car any chance i could have a word whats this all about just say im an interested party rebus said but as it turned out the young dc whod dealt with bell had moved stations and was now based at torphichen street rebus eventually got a mobile number for him his name was harry chambers sorry to bother you rebus said having introduced himself no bother im just walking home from the boozer hope you had a good night pool competition i made the semis good for you the reason im calling is jack bell whats the oily bastard gone and done now he keeps getting under our feet at port edgar it was the truth if not the whole truth rebus didnt think he needed to explain his desire to prize kate away from the msp then make sure to wipe your shoes on him chambers was saying about all hes good for im sensing a slight antagonism harry after the curb crawling thing he tried to get me knocked back to uniform and all that guff he came out with first he was on his way home from somewhere then when he couldnt back that up he was researching the need for a tolerance zone aye thatll be right the hoor he was talking to she told me theyd already agreed on a price reckon it was his first trip down that way no idea only thing i do knowand im being as objective as possible hereis that hes a sleazy lying vindictive bastard why couldnt that guy herdman have done us all a favor and popped him instead of those poor bloody kids back home rebus tried to remember pettifers instructions as he set up the computer it wasnt the newest model pettifers comment if it seems sluggish just feed in another shovelful of coal rebus had asked him how old the machine was answer two years and already damn near obsolete rebus decided that something so venerable should be cherished he gave the keyboard and screen a wipe with a damp cloth like him it was a survivor okay oldtimer he told it lets see what you can do after a frustrating few minutes he put in a call to pettifer eventually finding him on his mobilein his car and on his way home to bed more instructions rebus kept the line open until he was sure hed succeeded cheers mark he said cutting the connection then he dragged his armchair over so that he could sit in relative comfort seated one leg crossed over the other arms folded head tilted slightly to one side watching teri cotter as she slept day four friday you slept in your clothes siobhan commented picking him up the next morning rebus ignored her there was a tabloid on the passenger seat same one steve holly had brandished the previous night hell house cop mystery its slim stuff siobhan reassured him and so it was high on conjecture low on facts all the same rebus had ignored phone calls at am and he knew who it would probably be the complaints trying to book an appointment for his persecution he managed to turn the pages by dint of wetting the fingers of his gloves rumors are flying at st leonards siobhan added fairstone was gagged and tied to a chair everyone knows you were there did i say i wasnt she looked at him its just that i left him alive nodding off on his sofa he turned a few more pages seeking refuge found it in the story of a dog whod swallowed a wedding ringthe one shaft of light in a paper full of grim little headlines pub stabbings celebs being outed by their mistresses atlantic oil slicks and american tornadoes funny how a daytime tv host merits more column inches than an ecological disaster he commented folding the paper and tossing it over his shoulder so where are we headed i thought maybe a facetoface with james bell good enough his mobile rang but he left it in his pocket your fan club siobhan guessed i cant help being popular how come you know the gossip at st leonards i went there before i came to pick you up a glutton for punishment i was using the gym not a word ive come across before she smiled when her own phone rang she looked at rebus again he shrugged and she checked the number on her screen bobby hogan she told rebus answering the call he could hear only her side of the conversation were on our way why whats happened a glance in rebuss direction hes right here not sure his phones charged up yes ill tell him time you got one of those handsfree jobs rebus told her as she ended the call is my driving that bad i meant so i could listen in bobby says the complaints are looking for you really they asked him to pass on the message seems youre not answering your phone im not sure its charged up what else did he say wants to meet us at the marina did he say why maybe hes treating us to a days cruising thatll be it a thankyou for all our diligence and hard work just dont be surprised if the skipper turns out to be from complaints you saw this mornings paper bobby hogan asked he was leading them along the concrete pier i saw it rebus admitted and siobhan passed on your message none of which explains what were doing here ive also had a call from jack bell hes toying with making an official complaint hogan glanced at rebus whatever it was you did please keep it up if thats an order bobby then im happy to oblige rebus saw that there was a cordon at the top of the wooden ramp leading down to the pontoons where the yachts and dinghies were moored three uniforms standing guard beside a sign saying berth holders only hogan lifted the tape so they could pass through leading them down the slope something we shouldnt have missed hogan frowned for which i take responsibility naturally naturally seems herdman owned another boat something a bit bigger seagoing a yacht siobhan guessed hogan nodded they were passing a series of anchored vessels bobbing up and down that same clanking sound from the rigging gulls overhead there was a stiff breeze and occasional salt spray too big for him to store in his shed he obviously used it otherwise itd be kept ashore he indicated the shoreline where a series of boats sat on blocks well away from the aging effects of seawater and rebus asked and see for yourself rebus saw he saw a crowd of figures recognized a couple of them as coming from customs and excise knew what that meant they were examining something that had been laid out on a folded sheet of polyethylene shoes were being pressed to the corners of the polyethylene to stop it from blowing away sooner we get this lot indoors the better one officer was saying another was arguing that forensics should take a look first before quitting the locus rebus stood behind one of the crouched figures and saw the haul eckies hogan explained sliding his hands into his trouser pockets we reckon about a thousand enough to keep a few allnight raves going the ecstasy tablets were in twelve or so translucent blue plastic bags the kind you might use to store scraps of food in a freezer hogan tipped a few onto his palm anything from eight to ten grands worth at street prices the pills had a greenish tinge to them each one half the size of the painkillers rebus had taken that morning theres some cocaine too hogan continued for rebuss benefit only a grand or sos worth maybe for personal use we found traces of coke in his flat didnt we siobhan asked thats right and where was this lot rebus inquired stored in a locker belowdecks hogan said not very well hidden who found it we did rebus turned towards the voice whiteread was walking down the short plank connecting yacht to pontoon a smuglooking simms right behind her she made a show of brushing dust from her hands rest of the boat looks clean but your officers might want to check anyway hogan nodded dont worry we will rebus was standing in front of the two army investigators whiteread met his stare you seem happy enough rebus said is that because you found the drugs or were able to put one over on us if youd done your job in the first place di rebus whiteread left it for rebus to fill in the rest of the sentiment im still asking myself the how whitereads mouth twitched there were records in his office after which it was just a matter of talking to the marina manager you searched the boat rebus was studying the yacht it looked wellused on your own or did you follow sop sop standard operating procedure whitereads smile leveled out rebus turned his attention to hogan jurisdiction bobby you might want to ask yourself why they went ahead with the search without contacting you first he pointed towards the two investigators i trust them about as much as id trust a junkie with a chemistry set what gives you the right to say that simms was smiling but only with his mouth he looked rebus up and down and talk about the pot calling the kettle blackits not us being investigated for thats enough gavin whiteread hissed the young man fell silent the whole marina seemed suddenly still and noiseless this isnt going to help us bobby hogan said lets send the stuff for analysis i know who needs analysis simms muttered and meantime put our heads together to see what all of this might add to the inquiry that all right with you he was looking at whiteread who nodded apparently content but she shifted her eyes to rebus daring him to hold her gaze he stared back at her knowing his message was being reinforced i dont trust you they ended up in a convoy of cars heading for port edgar academy there were fewer ghouls and news crews outside the gates and no uniforms patrolling the perimeter to repel trespassers the portakabin had outgrown its usefulness and someone had finally thought of annexing one of the classrooms in the school building the school itself wouldnt reopen for a few days yet even then the crime scene would remain locked and unused everyone had gathered behind desks where pupils would normally have been seated to listen to their geography teacher there were maps on the walls rainfall charts pictures of tribesmen bats and igloos some of the team preferred to stand legs slightly apart arms folded bobby hogan stood in front of the pristine blackboard beside it was a marker board bearing the single word homework followed by three exclamation points could have been meant for us hogan stated tapping the board thanks to our friends from the armed forces herehe nodded in the direction of whiteread and simms whod chosen to stand in the doorwaythe case has taken a slight turn a seagoing yacht and a quantity of drugs what do we make of that smuggling sir a voice stated just to add one fact the speaker was standing at the back of the room customs and excise the majority of ecstasy coming into the uk originates in holland so we need to take a look at herdmans logs hogan announced see where hes been sailing to logs can always be falsified of course the customs man added we also need to talk to the drugs squad see what they know about the ecstasy scene were sure its eckies sir a voice piped up whatever it is its not seasickness pills there was some forced laughter at this sir does this mean the case will be handed over to dmc dmc drugs and major crime i cant answer that as yet what we need to do is focus on the work were already doing hogan looked around the room making sure he had everyones attention the only person not looking at him he noted was john rebus rebus was staring at the two figures in the doorway his eyebrows lowered in a thoughtful frown we also need to go over that yacht with a finetooth comb see if we managed to miss anything else hogan saw whiteread and simms share a look right any questions he asked there were a few but he dealt with them briskly one officer wanted to know how much a yacht like herdmans would cost an answer had already been provided by the marina manager for a fortyfoot yacht six berths youd need sixty thousand pounds if you were buying secondhand which didnt come from his pension fund trust me whiteread commented were already looking at herdmans various bank accounts and other assets hogan told the room glancing again in rebuss direction mind if were included in the search of the boat whiteread asked hogan couldnt think of any reason to refuse so just gave a shrug as the meeting broke up he found rebus by his side bobby the voice reduced to a murmur those drugs could be a plant hogan stared at him to what possible purpose i dont know but i dont trust youve made that abundantly clear things were looking like they were winding down this gives whiteread and her lackey an excuse to stick around i dont see that you forget ive dealt with their kind before no old scores to settle hogan was trying to keep his voice down its not like that then what is it an exsoldier goes off on one last people youll see afterwards are his old employers they dont want the publicity the two men were out in the corridor now there was no sign of the army duo more than that they dont want any blame attaching thats why they steer clear so so the gruesome twosome are sticking to this like shit to a shoe sole theres got to be more to it more to it than what despite his best endeavors hogans voice had risen people were looking towards them herdman paid for that boat somehow rebus shrugged just do me a favor bobby get hold of herdmans army record hogan stared at him im willing to bet whitereads got a copy with her you could ask to see it tell her youre just curious she might be willing jesus christ john you want to know why herdman did what he did thats why you brought me here unless im mistaken rebus looked around to make sure no one was within earshot first time i met them they were crawling all over herdmans boat shed next thing theyre snooping around his yacht now theyre heading back there its like theyre looking for something what rebus shook his head i dont know john complaints and conduct are just about to start crawling all over you so so is there any way you could be i dont know you think im reading too much into it youre under a lot of stress bobby either you think im up to the job or you dont rebus folded his arms which is it rebuss mobile was trilling again you going to answer that rebus shook his head bobby hogan sighed okay ill talk to whiteread dont mention my name and dont seem too worried about getting hold of the files youre just curious thats all im just curious hogan echoed rebus gave him a wink and moved off siobhan was waiting at the entrance to the school are we going to talk to james bell she asked rebus nodded but first lets see how good a detective you really are ds clarke i think we both know the answer okay then smartypants youre army personnel fairly senior level and youre dispatched from hereford to edinburgh for a week or so where do you base yourself siobhan thought about it as she got into her car she slid the key into the ignition and turned to rebus redford barracks maybe or the castle theres a garrison there isnt there rebus nodded they were decent enough answers he just didnt think they were right does whiteread look as though she roughs it besides shed want to stick close to the action fair enough a local hotel then rebus nodded thats what i reckon either that or bedandbreakfast he gnawed at his bottom lip the boatmans has a couple of rooms doesnt it rebus nodded slowly lets start there then am i allowed to ask why rebus shook his head less you know the betterthats a promise you dont think youre in enough trouble room for a bit more i think he tried a reassuring wink but siobhan looked far from convinced the boatmans wasnt yet open for business but when the barman recognized siobhan he let them in its rod isnt it siobhan said rod mcallister nodded this is my colleague di rebus hello mcallister said rod knew lee herdman siobhan reminded rebus did he ever sell you any eckies rebus asked pardon rebus just shook his head now that they were inside the bar he breathed deeply last nights beer and cigarettes failing to be masked by furniture polish mcallister had been busy with paperwork piled on top of the bar he was running a hand beneath his baggy tshirt scratching his chest the tshirt had faded badly its seam broken at one shoulder you a hawkwind fan siobhan asked mcallister looked down at the front of the shirt the faint print showed the cover of in search of space we wont keep you siobhan went on just wondered if you had a couple of guests rebus butted in to provide the names but mcallister shook his head he was looking at siobhan didnt seem interested in rebus anywhere else in the town that might put up visitors siobhan asked mcallister scratched at his stubble reminding rebus that the shaving he himself had carried out this morning had been tentative at best theres a few mcallister admitted you said someone might come to talk to me about lee did i well its just that nobody has any idea why he did it rebus asked abruptly mcallister shook his head then lets concentrate on those addresses shall we addresses b and bs other hotels mcallister understood siobhan took out her notebook and he started reciting the names after half a dozen he shook his head to let them know he was finished might be more he admitted with a shrug enough to be going on with rebus said well let you get back to the important work mr mcallister right thanks mcallister made a little bow and held the door open for siobhan outside she consulted her notebook this could take all day if we want it to rebus said looks like youve got an admirer she looked up in the direction of the hotel window saw mcallisters face there he shrank back turned away you could do a lot worsejust imagine never having to pay for another drink in your life something youve striven towards thats a low blow i pay my share if you say so she waved the notebook at him theres an easier route you know name it ask bobby hogan hes bound to know where theyre staying rebus shook his head best keep bobby out of it why am i getting such a bad feeling about this lets get back in the car and you can start making those calls sliding into her seat she turned to him a sixtygrand yachtwhere did the money come from drugs obviously you think so i think its what were supposed to be thinking nothing weve learned about herdman makes him look like a drug baron except his magnetic attraction for bored teenagers didnt they teach you anything at college such as not jumping to conclusions i forgotthats your department another one below the belt careful or the referee will step in she stared at him you know something dont you he held her stare and shook his head slowly not until you make those calls they got lucky the third address was a hotel just outside town overlooking the road bridge its car park was blustery and deserted two telescopes were waiting forlornly for tourists rebus tried one but couldnt see anything you have to put money in siobhan explained indicating the coin slot rebus didnt bother made for reception instead you should wait out here he warned her and miss all the fun she followed him in trying not to show how worried she was he was on painkillers and looking for trouble a bad combination shed seen him cross the line before but hed always been in control but with his hands still blistered and pink and the complaints about to investigate him for involvement in a possible murder there was a member of the staff behind the reception desk good morning the woman said brightly rebus already had his id out lothian and borders police he said youve got a woman named whiteread staying here fingers clacked against a computer keyboard thats right rebus leaned across the desk i need access to her room the receptionist looked confused im not if youre not in charge can i speak with whoever is im not sure or you could save us the trouble and just give me a key the woman looked more flustered than ever ill have to find my supervisor you do that then rebus placed his hands behind his back as though impatient the receptionist picked up her phone tried a couple of numbers but didnt find who she was looking for the lift sounded doors slid open one of the cleaners got out carrying a duster and a can of aerosol spray the receptionist put down the phone ill just have to find her rebus sighed and checked his watch then stared at the receptionists back as she pushed open some swing doors and disappeared he leaned over the desk again this time pulling the computer screen around so he could see it room twotwelve he told siobhan you staying here she shook her head followed him to the lift he pushed the button for the second floor the doors closed with a dry rasping sound what if whiteread comes back siobhan asked shes busy searching the yacht rebus looked at her and smiled a bell sounded and the doors shuddered open as rebus had hoped the cleaning staff were still working this floor a couple of their carts were parked in the corridor sheets and towels were piled up waiting to be taken away for the laundry he had his story ready forgotten something key down in reception any chance you could open the door for me if that didnt work maybe a fiver or a tenner would but his luck was in the door to stood wide open the maid was in the bathroom he put his head around the door had to pop back for something he told her just you carry on then he scanned the bedroom the bed had been made personal items sat on the dressing table clothes hung in the narrow wardrobe whitereads suitcase was empty she probably takes everything with her siobhan whispered keeps it in the car rebus paid her no heed he checked beneath the bed went through both clothes drawers and slid open the drawer to the bedside table revealing a gideon bible just like rocky raccoon he muttered to himself then he straightened up there was nothing here hed seen nothing in the bathroom either when hed peered around its door but now he was staring at another door a connecting door he tried the handle and it opened leading to another door with no handle on rebuss side which didnt matter it was already open an inch rebus pushed it and found himself in the next bedroom clothes strewn over both available chairs magazines on the bedside table ties and socks spilling from an oversized black nylon sports holdall simmss room rebus commented and there on the dressing table a brown manila file rebus turned it over picked out the words confidential and personnel picked out the name lee herdman simmss idea of security placing it facedown so no one would see what it was you want to read it here siobhan asked rebus shook his head had to run to forty or fifty sheets reckon our receptionist would copy it for us ive got a better idea siobhan lifted the file there was a sign in reception for a business suite im guessing theyll have a photocopier then lets go but siobhan was shaking her head one of us stays here last thing we want is the cleaner disappearing leaving the place locked tight behind her rebus saw the reasonableness of this and nodded so siobhan took the file while rebus made a cursory examination of simmss room the mags were the usual mens fare fhm loaded gq nothing under the pillows or mattress none of simmss clothes had made it as far as the chest of drawers though a couple of shirts and suits hung in the wardrobe connecting doors he didnt know what if anything to read into that whitereads door had been kept closed meaning simms couldnt get into her room but simms had left his own door an inch or two open inviting her to join him some night in his bathroom toothpaste and batteryoperated toothbrush hed brought his own shampoo antidandruff twinblade razor and a can of shaving cream back in the bedroom rebus looked more closely at the black holdall five pairs of socks and underpants two shirts hanging up two more on the chairs making five shirts in total a weeks worth simms had packed for a weeks trip rebus was thoughtful an exsoldier goes on a killing spree the army sends two investigators to make sure nothing links back to the killers past why send two people and would they require a full week at the scene what kind of people would you send psychologists maybe to look into the killers state of mind neither whiteread nor simms struck him as having any experience of psychology or any interest in herdmans state of mind they were hunters maybe huntergatherers rebus was convinced of it there was a soft tapping at the door rebus checked the spy hole it was siobhan he let her in and she put the file back on the dressing table pages in the right order rebus asked good as gold she had the copied sheets in a padded yellow envelope we ready to leave rebus nodded and followed her to simmss door but then he stopped turned back the file was lying faceup he turned it over gave the room a final look around and left theyd offered the receptionist a smile as theyd passed her a smile but no words think shell tell whiteread siobhan had asked i doubt it and hed shrugged because even if she did there was nothing whiteread could do about it thered been nothing in her room for anyone to find and nothing was missing while siobhan drove them along the a towards barnton rebus got started on the file a lot of it was chaff various test scores and reports medical stuff results from promotion boards penciled marginalia commented on herdmans strengths and weaknesses his physical stamina was questioned but his career was textbook stuff tours of duty in northern ireland the falklands the middle east training exercises in the uk saudi arabia finland germany rebus turned a page and found himself staring at a sheet blank save for a few typed words removed by order there was a scribbled signature and a stamped date going back only four days the date of the killings rebus turned to the next page and found himself reading about herdmans closing few months in the army he had told his employers that he wouldnt be signing up againa copy of his letter was enclosed moves had been made to entice him to stay but to no avail after which the file descended into a bureaucracy of form filling events taking their course did you see this rebus said tapping the words removed by order siobhan nodded what does it mean it means somethings been taken out probably locked away somewhere in sas hq sensitive information not for whitereads and simmss eyes rebus was thoughtful maybe he flicked back a page concentrated on the final paragraphs seven months before herdman had walked away from the sas hed been part of a salvage team on jura on first glancing down the page rebus had seen the word jura and assumed it referred to an exercise jura a narrow island off the west coast isolated just the one road and some mountains real wilderness country rebus had done some training there himself back in his army days long marshy hikes broken up with rock climbing he remembered the range of hills the paps of jura recalled the short ferry crossing to islay and how at the end of the exercise theyd all been taken to a distillery there but herdman hadnt been there on an exercise hed been part of a salvage team salvaging what exactly any further forwards siobhan asked braking hard as the divided highway ended ahead of them lay a backup from the barnton roundabout im not sure rebus admitted nor was he sure how he felt about siobhans involvement in his little spot of subterfuge he should have made her stay in simmss room that way it would have been his face the staff member in the business suite would remember his description they would give to whiteread if she ever came sniffing was it worth it then siobhan was asking he just shrugged growing thoughtful as they took a left at the roundabout watching as she pulled up at a driveway then turned the car into it where are we he asked james bells house she told him remember we were going to talk to him rebus just nodded the house was modern and detached with small windows and harled walls siobhan pressed the bell and waited the door was opened by a tiny woman in her wellpreserved fifties with piercing blue eyes and her hair tied back with a black velvet bow mrs bell im ds clarke this is di rebus we were wondering if we could have a word with james felicity bell examined both ids then stepped back to allow them inside jacks not here she said in a voice devoid of energy its your son we wanted to see siobhan explained voice dropping for fear of scaring this small harriedlooking creature but all the same mrs bell looked around her wildly shed brought them into the living room in an attempt to calm her rebus lifted a family photo from the windowsill youve got three children mrs bell he asked she saw what he was holding stepped forward to pluck it from his grasp and did her best to put it back in the exact spot it had come from james is the last she said the others are married flown the nest she made a little flapping movement with one hand the shooting must have been a terrible shock siobhan said terrible terrible the wild look had come back into her eyes you work at the traverse dont you rebus asked thats right she didnt seem surprised that he would know this about her weve got a new play just starting really i should be there to help out but im needed here you see whats the play its a version of the wind in the willows do either of you have children siobhan shook her head rebus explained that his daughter was too old never too old never too old felicity bell said in her quavering voice i take it youre staying home to look after james rebus said yes so hes upstairs is he in his room yes and would he be able to spare us a couple of minutes do you think well i dont know mrs bells hand had gone to her wrist at rebuss mention of minutes now she decided that shed better look at her watch gracious nearly lunchtime already she made to wander out of the room perhaps in the direction of the kitchen but then remembered these two strangers in her midst maybe i should call jack maybe you should siobhan conceded she was studying a framed photo of the msp triumphant on election night wed be happy to speak to him mrs bell looked up focusing on siobhan her eyebrows drew together what do you need to speak to him for she had a clipped educated edinburgh accent its james we want to talk to rebus explained taking a step forwards hes in his room is he he waited till shed nodded and thats upstairs i take it another nod then heres what well do he had laid a hand on her bonethin arm you go get the lunch started and well find our own way less fuss all round dont you think mrs bell seemed to take this in only slowly but at last she beamed a smile then thats what ill do she said retreating into the hall rebus and siobhan shared a look then a nod of agreement the woman was not cooking with a full set of saucepans they climbed the stairs found what they took to be jamess room stickers placed on the door in childhood had been scraped off nothing on it now but old concert tickets mostly from english citiesfoo fighters in manchester rammstein in london puddle of mudd in newcastle rebus knocked but got no answer he turned the handle and opened the door james bell was sitting up in bed white sheets and duvet starkwhite walls with no ornamentation pale green carpet halfcovered with throw rugs books were crammed onto bookshelves computer hifi tv cds scattered around bell wore a black tshirt he had his knees up propping up a magazine he turned the pages with one hand the other arm being strapped across his chest his hair was short and dark face pale one cheek picked out by a mole few signs of teenage rebellion in this room when rebus had been in his teens his own bedroom had been little more than a series of hiding places softporn mags under the carpet the mattress wouldnt do it got turned occasionally cigarettes and matches behind one leg of the wardrobe a knife tucked away beneath the winter sweaters in the bottom drawer of the chest he got the feeling that if he looked in the drawers here hed find clothes nothing under the carpet but thick underlay music was leaking from the headphones james bell wore he still hadnt looked up from his reading rebus guessed he thought his mother had come in and was studiously ignoring her the facial similarity between son and father was remarkable rebus bent down a little angling his face and james finally looked up eyes widening in surprise he slipped off the headphones turned the music off sorry to interrupt rebus said your mum said we should just come up who are you were detectives james wondered if you could give us a moment of your time rebus was standing by the bed being careful not to kick over the large bottle of water by his feet whats going on rebus had lifted the magazine from the bed it was about gun collecting funny subject he said im trying to find the one he shot me with siobhan had taken the magazine from rebus i think i can understand that she said you want to know all about it i didnt get much of a look at it you sure about that james rebus asked lee herdman collected gun stuff he nodded towards the magazine which siobhan was now flicking through that one of his what did he let you borrow it we hear you knew him a bit better than youve been letting on i never said i didnt know him wed met sociallyyour exact words james i heard them on the tape you make it sound like youd bump into him in the pub or the newsagents rebus paused except that hed told you he was exsas and thats more than just a casual comment isnt it maybe you were talking about it at one of his parties another pause you used to go to his parties didnt you some he was an interesting guy james glared at rebus i probably said that on the tape too besides i told the police all this already told them how well i knew lee and that i went to his parties even about that time he showed me the gun rebuss eyes narrowed he showed you christ havent you listened to the tapes rebus couldnt help but glance towards siobhan tapes plural theyd only bothered listening to the one which gun was this the one he kept in his boathouse did you think it was real siobhan asked it looked real anyone else there at the time james shook his head you never saw the other one the pistol not until he shot me with it the teenager looked down at his injured shoulder you and two others rebus reminded him am i right to say that he didnt know anthony jarvies and derek renshaw not that i know of but he left you alive are you just lucky james jamess fingers hovered just above his wound ive been wondering about that he said quietly maybe he recognized me at the last moment siobhan cleared her throat and have you been wondering why he did it in the first place james nodded slowly but didnt say anything maybe siobhan continued he saw something in you he didnt see in the others they were both pretty active in the ccf could be it had something to do with that james offered how do you mean well lee was in the army half his life and then they kicked him out he told you that rebus asked james nodded again maybe he had this grudge ive said he didnt know renshaw and jarvies but that doesnt mean he hadnt seen them around maybe in their uniforms some kind of trigger he looked up smiled i knowi should leave the hack psychology to the hack psychologists youre being very helpful siobhan said not because she believed it necessarily but because she thought he was looking for some sliver of praise the thing is james rebus said if we could understand why hed left you alive wed maybe know why the others had to die do you see james was thoughtful does it really matter in the end we think it does rebus straightened up who else did you see at these parties james youre asking for names thats the general idea it wasnt always the same people teri cotter rebus hinted yes she was there sometimes always brought a few goths with her youre not a goth yourself james siobhan asked he gave a short laugh do i look like one she shrugged the music you listen to its just rock music thats all she lifted the small machine attached to his headphones mp player she commented sounding impressed what about douglas brimson ever see him at the parties is he the guy who flies planes siobhan nodded i spoke to him one time yes he paused look these werent really parties not like the organized sort it was just people dropping in having a drink doing drugs rebus asked casually sometimes yes james admitted speed coke a bit of e the teenager snorted a couple of joints passed round if you were lucky nothing harder no there was a knock at the door it was mrs bell she looked at the two visitors as though shed forgotten all about them oh she said confused for a moment then ive made some sandwiches james what would you like to drink im not hungry but its lunchtime do you want me puking up mum no of course not ill tell you when im hungry his voice had hardened not because he was angry rebus thought but because he was embarrassed but ill have a mug of coffee not too much milk in it right his mother said then to rebus would you like a were just on our way thanks all the same mrs bell she nodded stood for a moment as though forgetting what shed been about to do then turned and left her feet making no sound on the carpet your mothers all right is she rebus asked are you blind james shifted position a lifetime with my dad its no wonder you dont get on with your father not particularly you know hes started a petition james screwed up his face fat lot of good itll do he was silent for a moment was it teri cotter what was she the one who told you i went to lees flat the detectives stayed silent wouldnt put it past her he shifted again as if trying to get comfortable want me to help you siobhan offered james shook his head i think i need some more painkillers siobhan found them by the other side of the bed sitting in their silver strip of foil on a readied chess board she gave him two tablets which he washed down with water one more question james rebus said then well leave you to it what rebus nodded towards the foil mind if i nick a couple of tabs ive run out siobhan had half a bottle of flat irnbru in her car rebus took a mouthful after each tablet careful they dont turn into a habit siobhan said what did you reckon to back there rebus asked changing the subject he could be on to something combined cadet force kids running around in uniforms he also said herdman was kicked out of the army not true according to his file so so either herdman lied to him or young james made it up active fantasy life youd need one in a room like that it was certainly tidy siobhan started the engine you know what he was saying about miss teri he was right it was her who told us yes but more than that what she put the car in gear and started off just the way he spoke you know that old thing about someone protesting too much making out he doesnt like her because he really likes her siobhan nodded reckon he knows about her little website i dont know siobhan finished her threepoint turn should have asked him whats this siobhan asked peering through the windshield a patrol car its blue light flashing was blocking the entrance to the driveway as siobhan put the brakes on the back door of the patrol car opened and a man in a gray suit got out he was tall with a shiny bald dome of a head and large heavylidded eyes he held his hands together in front of him feet apart dont worry rebus told siobhan its just my twelve oclock appointment what appointment the one i never got round to making rebus told her opening his door and stepping out then he leaned back in with my own personal executioner the bald man was named mullen he was from the professional standards unit of the complaints up close his skin had a slightly scaly quality not rebus thought unlike that of his own blistered hands his elongated earlobes had probably brought him a few dumbosourced nicknames at school yet it was his fingernails that fascinated rebus they were almost too perfect pink and shiny and unridged with just enough white cuticle during the hourlong interview rebus was tempted more than once to add a question of his own and ask if mullen ever visited a manicurist but in fact all hed done was ask if he could get a drink the aftertaste of james bells painkillers lingered in his mouth the tablets themselves had done their jobcertainly better than the scabby wee pills he himself had been prescribed rebus was feeling at one with his world he didnt even mind that assistant chief constable colin carswell all haircut and eau de cologne was sitting in on the interview carswell might hate his guts but rebus couldnt find it in himself to blame him for it too much history between them for that they were in an office at police hq on fettes avenue and it was carswells turn to have a go at him what the hell did you think you were doing last night last night sir jack bell and that tv director theyre both demanding an apology he wagged a finger at rebus and youre going to do it in person would you rather i dropped my trousers and bent over for them carswells face seemed to swell with rage once again di rebus mullen interrupted we find ourselves returning to the question of what you thought you might hope to gain by going along to a known criminals home for a nighttime beverage i thought i might gain a free drink carswell expelled a slow hiss of air hed uncrossed and recrossed his legs unfolded and refolded his arms many dozens of times in the course of the interview i suspect there was more to your visit than that rebus just shrugged he wasnt allowed to smoke so was playing with the halfempty pack instead opening and closing it sending it spinning across the table with the flick of a finger he was doing this because he could see how much it annoyed carswell what time did you leave fairstones house sometime before the fire broke out you cant be more specific rebus shook his head id been drinking drinking more than he should have much much more hed been a good boy since trying to atone so sometime after you left mullen continued someone else arrivedunseen by neighborsand proceeded to gag and tie mr fairstone before turning on the heat beneath a chip pan and then departing not necessarily rebus felt obliged to state the chip pan could already have been on did mr fairstone say he was going to make some chips he might have mentioned being a bit peckish i cant be sure rebus straightened in his chair feeling vertebrae click look mr mullen i can see that youve got a fair amount of circumstantial evidence sitting herehe tapped the manila file not unlike the one that had sat on simmss dressing tablewhich tells you that i was the last person to see martin fairstone alive he paused but thats all it tells you wouldnt you agree and im not denying the fact rebus sat back and waited except the killer mullen said so softly he might have been speaking to himself what you should have said was i was the last person to see him alive except his killer he glanced up from beneath his drooping eyelids thats what i meant to say its not what you said di rebus youll have to excuse me then im not exactly a hundred percent are you on drugs of some kind painkillers yes rebus held up his hands to remind mullen of why and you took the most recent dose when sixty seconds before clapping eyes on you rebus let his eyes widen maybe i should have mentioned at the start mullen slapped the desk with both palms of course you should have he wasnt talking to himself anymore he let his chair fall backwards as he got to his feet carswell had risen too i dont see mullen leaned across the desk to switch off the tape recorder you cant hold an interview with someone whos under the influence of prescribed drugs he explained for the accs benefit i thought everyone knew that carswell started muttering something about how hed just forgotten that was all mullen was glaring at rebus rebus gave him a wink well talk again detective inspector once im off the medication rebus pretended to guess ill need the name of your doctor so i can ask when thats likely to be mullen had opened the file his pen poised over an empty sheet it was the infirmary rebus stated blithely i cant remember the doctors name well then ill just have to find out mullen closed the file again meantime carswell piped up i dont need to remind you about making that apology or that youre still on suspension no sir rebus said which rather begs the question mullen said quietly of why i found you in the company of a fellow officer at jack bells house i was hitching a lift thats all ds clarke had to stop off at bells place to talk to the son rebus gave a shrug while carswell expelled more air we will get to the bottom of this rebus you can be sure of that i dont doubt it sir rebus was the last of the three to rise to his feet well ill leave you to it then enjoy the bottom when you get there siobhan as hed guessed was waiting with her car outside nicely timed she said the back of the car was full of shopping bags i waited ten minutes to see if youd tell them straight off and then went to do some shopping supermarket at the top of the road i was going to ask if you fancied coming round for dinner tonight lets see how the rest of the day pans out she nodded agreement so when did the question of the painkillers arise about five minutes ago you left it a while wanted to see if theyd anything new to tell me and did they he shook his head doesnt look like they consider you a suspect though he told her me why should they because he was stalking you because every cop knows the old chippan trick he shrugged any more of that and the dinner invites canceled she started driving them out of the car park next stop turnhouse she asked you think i need to be on the next plane out of here we were going to talk to doug brimson rebus shook his head you talk to him drop me off somewhere first she looked at him where anyplace on george street will do she was still looking suspiciously close to the oxford bar that wasnt what i had in mind but now that you come to mention it drink and tranqs dont mix john its an hour and a half since i took those pills besides im on suspension remember im allowed to misbehave rebus was waiting for steve holly in the back room of the oxford bar it was one of the citys smaller pubs just the two rooms neither much bigger than the living room of a normal house the front room was usually busy in that three or four bodies could make it seem so the back room had tables and chairs and rebus had positioned himself in the darkest corner farthest from the window the walls were the same jaundiced color theyd been when hed first found the place three decades back the stark oldfashioned interior had the power to intimidate newcomers but rebus wasnt betting on it having any such effect on the journalist hed called the tabloids edinburgh officeonly a tenminute walk from the bar his message had been curt i want to talk to you oxford bar now cutting the connection before holly could start a conversation rebus knew he would come hed come because he would be intrigued hed come because of the story hed broken hed come because that was his job rebus heard the door open and close he wasnt worried about the occupants of the other tables anything they happened to overhear they would keep to themselves it was that kind of place rebus hoisted what was left of his pint his grip was improving he could pick up a glass onehanded flex his wrist without the pain becoming unbearable he was steering clear of whiskey siobhan had given him good advice and for once he would heed it he knew he needed his wits about him steve holly wasnt going to want to play on rebuss terms feet on the steps a shadow preceding hollys entrance into the back room he peered into the afternoon gloom squeezing between chairs as he approached the table he was carrying what looked like a glass of lemonade maybe with vodka added for good measure he gave a slight nod stayed standing until rebus gestured for him to sit holly did so checking to the left and right unhappy about sitting with his back to the bars other denizens nobodys going to leap from the shadows and headbutt you rebus reassured him i suppose i should be congratulating you holly said i hear youre managing to get right up jack bells nose and i notice your papers supporting his campaign hollys mouth twitched doesnt mean hes not a prick you lot should have stuck to your guns that time you caught him with the prossie better yet you should have phoned my paper wed have come down and got some snaps of him in flagrante have you met the wife rebus nodded bananas she is the reporter continued nervous wreck by all accounts she stood by him though thats what mps wives do isnt it holly said dismissively then so to what do i owe the honor decided to put your side of the story i need a favor rebus said placing his gloved hands on the table a favor rebus nodded in return for what exactly special relationship status meaning holly lifted his glass to his mouth meaning whatever i get on the herdman case you get first shout holly snorted had to wipe some of his drink from around his mouth youre on suspension as far as i know doesnt stop me from keeping my ear to the ground and what exactly is it you can tell me about herdman that i cant get from a dozen of my other sources depends on that favor its one thing ive got that they havent holly rolled some more of his drink around the inside of his mouth then he swallowed smacked his lips trying to throw me off the scent rebus ive got you by the short and curlies over marty fairstone everyone knows it and now youre asking favors he chuckled but there was no humor in his eyes you should be begging me not to rip your gonads right off think youve got the balls for it rebus said finishing his own drink he slid the empty glass across the table towards the journalist pint of ipa when youre ready holly looked at him then smiled with half his mouth and rose to his feet maneuvering his way back through the chairs rebus lifted the lemonade glass and sniffed vodka definitely he managed to light a cigarette had smoked half of it by the time holly returned barmans got an attitude hasnt he maybe he doesnt like what you said about me rebus explained so go to the press complaints commission holly handed the pint over hed brought another vodka and lemonade for himself only i dont see you doing that he added thats because youre not worth the effort and this is the guy who wants a favor doing a favor you havent bothered listening to yet well here i am holly opened his arms wide a salvage operation of some kind rebus said quietly it happened on jura june of ninetyfive i need to know what it was for salvage holly frowned his instincts aroused a tanker something like that rebus shook his head on land the sas were brought in herdman he might have been involved holly chewed on his bottom lip as if trying to dislodge the hook rebus had landed there whats it got to do with anything we wont know that till we take a look and if i agree what do i get out of it like i said first go at any story rebus paused i might also have access to herdmans army files hollys eyebrows rose perceptibly anything good in them rebus shrugged at this stage i couldnt possibly comment reeling the reporter in knowing full well there was little in the file to interest any tabloid reader but then how was steve holly to know that well we could have a looksee i suppose holly was rising to his feet again no time like the present rebus studied his beer glass still threequarters full holly had yet to start on his own second drink whats the rush he said you dont think i came here to pass the time of day with you holly said i dont like you rebus and i certainly dont trust you he paused no offense none taken rebus said rising to follow the reporter out of the bar by the way holly said something thats been bugging me what i was talking to a guy and he said he could kill someone with a newspaper you ever heard of that rebus nodded a magazines better but a paper might just do it holly looked at him so how does it work smothering or what rebus shook his head you roll it up tight as you can then you use it on the throat enough force youll crush the windpipe holly was staring you learned that in the army rebus nodded again as did whoever you were talking to it was a bloke at st leonards him and some stroppylooking woman her names whiteread his is simms army investigators holly nodded to himself as though it all made sense rebus stopped himself from smiling putting holly onto whiteread and simms was most of his plan they were outside the pub now and rebus expected that theyd be walking to the newspaper office but holly had turned left rather than right pointing his ignition key at the line of cars parked curbside you drove rebus said as the locks clunked open on a silvergray audi tt its what your legs are for holly informed him now get in rebus slid into what space there was thinking that an audi tt was the car teri cotters brother had been driving the night hed died with derek renshaw sitting in the passenger seat same seat rebus was in now remembering the photos of the crash stuart cotters ragdoll body he watched as holly slipped a hand beneath the drivers seat sliding out a thin black laptop computer he placed it across his legs opening it and holding his mobile phone in one hand while he operated the keyboard with the other infrared connection he explained gets us online in a hurry and why are we going online rebus had to push back a sudden memory of his nighttime vigil at miss teris website embarrassed that hed allowed himself to be drawn into her world because thats where my paper has most of its library i just enter the password holly stabbed half a dozen keys rebus trying to see what they were no peeking rebus he warned theres all sorts of stuff on here clippings dropped stories archives lists of the cops you pay for information would i be that stupid i dont know would you when people talk to me they know i can keep a secret those names go to my grave holly turned his attention back to the screen rebus had no doubt this machine was state of the art connection had been fast and now pages were popping up in the blink of an eye the laptop rebus had borrowed was as pettifer had said coalfired by comparison search mode holly was talking to himself we enter the month and year keywords jura and salvage and see what brainiac comes up with he hit a final key and sat back turning again towards rebus to measure how impressed he was rebus was hellish impressed but hoped it didnt show the screen had changed again seventeen items holly said christ yes i remember this he angled the screen a little and rebus leaned towards him so that he could see what was there and suddenly rebus remembered it too remembered the incident but hadnt registered it as happening on jura an army helicopter half a dozen top brass on board killed outright along with the pilot when the chopper had crashed speculation at the time that it had been downed jubilation in some quarters in northern irelanda splinter republican group taking early credit but in the end pilot error had been given as the cause no mention of the sas holly pointed out instead a vague mention of a rescue team sent to locate the debris and more important the bodies whatever was left of the chopper would be taken away for analysis the bodies sent for autopsy prior to the funerals an inquiry was set in motion its findings a long time coming pilots family werent happy holly said racing through time to the end of the investigation memories tarnished by that conclusion pilot error go back again rebus said annoyed that holly was a faster reader than him holly obliged the screen switching in an instant so herdman was part of the rescue team holly observed makes sense army sending in their own he turned to rebus what point is it youre supposed to be making rebus didnt want to give him much more so said he wasnt sure then im wasting my time here holly hit another button blacking out the screen then he twisted his body so he was facing rebus so what if herdman was on jura what the hells it got to do with what went on in that school you going for the stress trauma angle im not sure rebus repeated he stared at the reporter but thanks anyway he pushed open the door and started levering himself out of the lowbuilt seat is that it holly spat i show you mine and you chicken out rebus leaned back down into the car mines more interesting than yours pal you didnt need me for this holly said glancing towards his laptop half an hour with a search engine and youdve learned as much rebus nodded or i could have asked whiteread and simms only i dont think theyd have been quite as accommodating holly blinked why not bait taken rebus just winked and slammed shut the door walked back into the ox where harry was about to pour his drink down the sink let me relieve you of that rebus said stretching out his hand towards the barman he heard the roar of the audis engine steve holly making a quick and angry getaway rebus wasnt bothered he had what he needed a helicopter crash top brass involved now there was something to whet the appetite of a couple of army investigators what was more when holly had flicked back through the screens rebus had registered the news that a few of the locals on the island had helped with the search men who knew the paps of jura well one of them had even been interviewed giving his description of the crash site his name was rory mollison rebus finished off the pint standing at the bar his eyes staring at the tv without taking any of it in a kaleidoscope of colors that was all it meant to him his mind was elsewhere crossing land and then water gliding over hilltops sending the sas to pick up bodies jura wasnt exactly the most mountainous terrain certainly a long way short of the peaks youd find in the grampians why send such a specialized team gliding over moor and glen inlets and sheer cliff faces rebus fumbled for his phone pulled off his glove with his teeth and punched numbers with his thumbnail waited for siobhan to pick up where are you he said never mind that what the hell are you doing talking to steve holly rebus blinked ran to the door and pulled it open she was standing right in front of him he put the phone back in his pocket as if in a mirror image she did the same with hers youre tailing me he said trying to sound appalled only because you need tailing where were you he started pulling the glove back on she nodded towards north castle street cars parked just around the corner now to return to my original question never mind that at least this means youve not been back to the airfield not yet no good because i want you to talk to him who brimson she watched him nod and after that youll tell me what you were doing with steve holly rebus looked at her then nodded again and thisll be over a drink which youre going to buy me the look became a glare siobhan had taken the phone back out of her pocket and was waving it in rebuss face all right he growled just call the guy okay siobhan checked in her notebook finding brimsons details started punching numbers what exactly is it that im telling him charm offensive you need a big favor maybe more than one actually but for starters you can ask him if theres a landing strip anywhere on jura when rebus arrived at port edgar academy he saw that bobby hogan was remonstrating with jack bell bell wasnt alone he had the same camera crew with him plus he had one hand clamped around kate renshaws forearm i think weve every right the msp was saying to see where our loved ones were gunned down with respect sir that classroom remains a crime scene no one goes in without good reason were the family which id have thought was the best reason there was hogan pointed to the crew pretty extended family sir the director had noticed rebuss approach he tapped bells shoulder bell turned his face forming a cold smile youll have come to apologize he guessed rebus ignored him dont go in there kate he said standing directly in front of her it cant do any good she couldnt meet his gaze people need to know she spoke in an undertone bell nodding in agreement maybe so but what they dont need is a publicity stunt it just cheapens everything kate you must see that bell had turned his attention back to hogan i must insist that this man be removed from here must you hogan echoed he is already on record as having uttered abusive comments at my crew and myself plenty more where that came from rebus stated john hogans eyes warning him to calm down then im sorry mr bell but i really cant allow filming inside that room what if theres no camera the director offered sound only hogan was shaking his head youre not going to move me on this he folded his arms as if to signal an end to the discussion rebus was still concentrating on kate trying for eye contact she seemed to be finding something fascinating in the near distance the gulls on the playing field perhaps or the rugby posts well where can we film the msp was asking outside the gates same as everyone else hogan replied bell exhaled furiously you can be sure your obstructiveness will be noted he warned thank you sir hogan said keeping his voice level while his eyes burned the common room had been emptied no chairs hifi or magazines the principal dr fogg was standing in the doorway hands held before him palms pressed together he was dressed in a sober charcoal suit white shirt black tie his eyes had dark rings around them hair speckled with dandruff he sensed rebus behind him and turned offered a watery smile trying to decide what use might best be made of the room he explained the chaplain thinks it could be turned into a sort of chapel something the pupils could use for contemplation its an idea rebus said the principal had moved aside so rebus could enter the room blood had dried into the walls and floor rebus tried to sidestep the stains you could always lock it leave it a few years kids will all have moved on by then few coats of paint new carpet hard to look that far ahead fogg said managing another smile well ill leave you to to your he made a little bow and turned away walking back towards his office rebus was staring at the blood spatter pattern on one wall this was where derek had been standing derek part of his family now obliterated lee herdman rebus was trying to visualize him waking up that morning and reaching for a gun what had happened what in his life had changed were demons dancing around his bed when he awoke were the voices teasing him the teenagers hed befriended had something broken that spell fuck you kids im coming for you driving into the school grounds stopping the car rather than actually parking it in a rush leaving his drivers door wide open in through the side entrance no cameras to catch him up the corridor and into this room here i am kids anthony jarvies shot through the head hed probably been first all the army teaching told you to aim for the center of the chest bigger target harder to miss and usually deadly but herdman had opted for the head why that first shot had lost him the element of surprise maybe derek renshaw had been in movement receiving a shot to the face for his trouble james bell ducking down one bullet to the shoulder squeezing his eyes shut tight as herdman turned the gun on himself the third head shot this time to his own temple why lee thats all we want to know rebus whispered into the silence he walked to the door turned entered the room again holding out his right gloved hand as though it were the weapon swiveled from one firing position to another he knew that the forensics team would be doing much the same albeit in front of their computers reconstructing the scene in the room computing the angles of bullet entry positioning the gunman for each shot every shred of evidence added its own sentence to the story heres where he was standing then he turned moved forwards if we match angle of entry to the blood spatter pattern eventually they would know every move herdman had made they would have brought the scene vividly to life with their graphics and ballistics and none of it might make them any the wiser about the only question that mattered the why dont shoot a voice said from the doorway it was bobby hogan standing with arms raised he had with him two figures rebus knew claverhouse and ormiston claverhouse tall and lanky was a detective inspector ormiston shorter and stocky with a permanent sniffle was a detective sergeant both worked for drugs and major crime and had close links to the assistant chief constable colin carswell in fact on a bad day rebus might have called them carswells hatchet men he realized that he still had his gun hand out so he lowered it i hear the fascist looks in this year claverhouse said indicating rebuss leather gloves making you fashionable year in and year out rebus retorted now children hogan warned ormiston was peering at the blood on the floor rubbing the tip of his shoe over it so what brings you sniffing around rebus asked eyes on ormiston as the stocky man rubbed the back of his hand across his nostrils drugs claverhouse said with all three buttons of his suit jacket closed he resembled a shopwindow mannequin looks like ormys been sampling the goods hogan bowed his head to try to hide a smile claverhouse swiveled towards him i thought di rebus was out on his ear news travels fast rebus said aye especially good news ormiston snapped back hogan straightened up do the three of you want detention no one replied to answer your question di claverhouse johns here in a purely advisory capacity due to his army background hes not working per se no change there then ormiston muttered and the kettles trailing the pot onenil at halftime rebus informed him hogan held up a hand and thats a yellow card from the referee any more shite and youre out of here i mean it his voice had hardened claverhouses eyes flickered but he didnt say anything ormiston had his nose all but pressed to one of the bloodstains on the wall right hogan said into the silence sighing heavily so what is it youve got for us claverhouse took this as his cue looks like the stuff you found on the boat is checking out ecstasy and cocaine the cocaines pretty high grade maybe it was due to be cut a bit further crack hogan asked claverhouse nodded its taken hold in a few placesfishing towns up north some of the housing projects here and in glasgow a grands worth of good stuff can turn into ten when its cut theres also a bundle of hash going around ormiston added claverhouse glared at him not wanting to have his thunder stolen ormys right theres plenty of hash on the streets what about ecstasy hogan asked claverhouse nodded we thought it was coming up from manchester could be we were wrong from herdmans logs hogan said we know hes been to and fro to the continent seems to stop off at rotterdam lot of e factories in holland ormiston stated casually he was still studying the wall in front of him hands in pockets and leaning back on his heels as if concentrating on the exhibit at a gallery lot of cocaine over there too and customs wasnt suspicious of these jaunts to rotterdam rebus asked claverhouse shrugged those poor buggers are stretched to the breaking point no way they can check up on everybody hopping over to europe especially in these days of open borders so what youre saying is you let herdman slip through your net claverhouses eyes met rebuss like customs we depend on intelligence gathering not much sign of that around here rebus countered shifting his gaze from claverhouse to ormiston and back again bobby have herdmans finances been looked into hogan nodded no evidence of sudden large deposits or withdrawals dealers steer clear of banks claverhouse stated hence the need for money laundering herdmans boat business would do just fine what about herdmans autopsy rebus asked bobby hogan any sign that he was a drug user hogan shook his head blood tests negative dealers arent always users claverhouse intoned the big players are in it for the money in the past six months we busted one operation carrying a hundred and thirty thousand tabs of e street value of a million and a half fortyfour kilos worth four kilos of opium was intercepted after being flown in from iran he stared at rebus that was a customs bust based on intelligence and how much did we find on herdmans boat rebus asked a drop in the ocean if youll pardon the expression he had started to light a cigarette but caught hogans look eyes casting around the room its not a church bobby he said finishing what hed started he didnt think derek or anthony would mind didnt care what herdman thought for personal use perhaps claverhouse offered except he didnt use rebus blew smoke down his nostrils in claverhouses direction maybe he had friends who did i hear he used to host a few parties weve not spoken to anyone who says he gave them coke or eckies as if theyd want to advertise the fact claverhouse snorted fact is im astonished you can find anyone wholl admit to having known the bastard he stared down at the bloodstained floor ormiston ran a hand beneath his nose again then let out a huge sneeze further mottling the wall ormy you insensitive bastard rebus hissed hes not the one flicking ash on the floor claverhouse growled the smoke tickles my nose ormiston was saying rebus had strode over to stand next to him that was somebody from my fucking family he snarled pointing at the pattern of blood i didnt mean it what did you just say john hogans voice was a low rumble nothing rebus said but it was too late hogan was standing right beside him sliding hands into pockets expecting an explanation allan renshaws a cousin of mine rebus admitted and you didnt feel that was information i might need to know hogans face was puce with anger not really bobby no over hogans shoulder rebus could see a huge grin spreading across claverhouses narrow face hogan removed his hands from his pockets tried clenching them behind his back but found the maneuver unsatisfactory rebus knew where bobby really wanted those hands he wanted them around rebuss neck it doesnt change anything he argued like you said im here as an advisor thats all were not building a court case bobby no lawyers going to be able to use me as a technicality bastard was a drug smuggler claverhouse interrupted there must be associates out there for us to catch one of them gets a bright enough lawyer claverhouse rebus said wearily do the world a favor andhis voice a sudden howljust shut the fuck up claverhouse started forwards rebus ready to meet him hogan stepping between them though in the certain knowledge of being as useful as chocolate handcuffs ormistons role was spectator no way hed interrupt unless his partner was getting the worst of it phone call for di rebus a sudden shout from the open doorway siobhan standing there holding out a mobile phone i think its urgent the complaints claverhouse stepped back allowing rebus clear passage he even made a mocking motion with his arm signaling after you and the grin was back on his face rebus looked down to where bobby hogan still had a handful of the front of his suit jacket hogan let go and rebus walked to the doorway want to take it outside siobhan suggested rebus nodded held out his hand for the phone but she was keeping it walking with him all the way out of the building she looked around saw that they were at a safe distance and held the phone out to him better make it look like youre talking she warned rebus held the phone to his ear nothing there at all no call he asked she shook her head just thought you needed rescuing he managed a smile keeping the phone to his ear bobby knows about the renshaws i know i heard spying on me again not much going on in the geography class they were heading towards the portakabin so what do we do now whatever it is it better be away from here give bobby time to cool off rebus looked back towards the school three figures were watching from the doorway and claverhouse and ormiston time to crawl back under their rock youre reading my mind he paused so what am i thinking now youre thinking we could go for a drink this is uncanny and youre also thinking of paying as a way of saying thanks for saving your arse that is the incorrect answer still as meat loaf used to say theyd reached her car he handed back her phone two out of three aint bad so if no money turned up in herdmans bank siobhan said we can scratch him as a hired killer unless he turned the money into drugs rebus replied for the sake of argument they were in the boatmans drinking with the lateafternoon crowd suits and laborers whod finished work for the day rod mcallister was behind the bar yet again rebus had asked jokingly if he was a permanent feature day shift mcallister had replied unsmilingly youre a real asset to the place rebus had added accepting his change now he sat with a halfpint of beer and the remains of a glass of whiskey siobhan was drinking a garishly colored mixture of lime juice and soda you really think whiteread and simms might have planted those drugs rebus shrugged there isnt much i wouldnt put past the likes of whiteread based on he looked at her i mean she went on youve always stayed pretty tightlipped about your army years not the happiest of my life he admitted i saw guys broken by the system fact of the matter is i only just about held on to my own sanity when i left i had a nervous breakdown rebus swallowed back the memories he thought of all the comfortable clichés whats done is done you cant go living in the past one guya guy i was close tohe went to pieces during the training they turfed him out but forgot to switch him off his voice trailed away what happened he blamed me came looking for revenge way before your time siobhan so you can understand why herdman might lose it maybe but youre not sure he did are you there are usually warning signs herdman wasnt the archetypal loner no arsenal in his home just that one gun rebus paused we could do with knowing when he got hold of it the gun rebus nodded then wed know whether he bought it with that one specific purpose chances are if he was smuggling drugs hed feel the need for some kind of protection might explain the mac in the boathouse siobhan was following the progress of a young blond woman whod just entered the bar the barman seemed to know her he was pouring out her drink before she got to him bacardi and coke it looked like no ice nothing came of all those interviews rebus was asking siobhan shook her head he meant all the lowlifes and firearm merchants the brocock wasnt the most recent model thinking seems to be he brought it north with him when he moved here as for the machine gun who knows rebus was thoughtful siobhan watching as rod mcallister leaned on the bartop resting his forearms there deep in conversation with the blonde the blonde siobhan knew from somewhere he looked as contented as siobhan had ever seen him head tilted to one side the woman was smoking blowing ashgray plumes ceilingwards do me a favor will you rebus asked suddenly get on the phone to bobby hogan why because he probably doesnt want to speak to me right now and what is it im phoning him for siobhan had her mobile out to ask if whiteread was forthcoming with lee herdmans army records the answers probably no in which case he should have called the army direct i want to know if theyve come through siobhan was nodding pushing buttons the conversation from then on was onesided di hogan its siobhan clarke listening she looked up at rebus no ive no idea what that was about i think he was called to fettes she widened her eyes questioningly and rebus nodded to let her know shed said the right thing what i was wondering was did you get round to asking ms whiteread for the records on herdman she listened to hogans reply well john mentioned it to me and i just thought id follow up she listened again squeezing her eyes shut tight no hes not here listening in shed opened her eyes again rebus winked to let her know she was doing fine mmm hmm she was listening to hogan doesnt sound like shes being as cooperative as wed have liked yes ill bet you told her a smile what did she say more listening and did you follow her advice so what did they say down at hereford meaning sas hq so were denied access another look at rebus well he can be a difficult creature we both know that talking about rebus now hogan probably saying that he would have told rebus all this if the scene in the common room hadnt imploded no id no idea he was related to them siobhan made an o of her mouth well thats my story and im sticking to it her turn to wink at rebus he drew a finger across his neck but she shook her head she was beginning to enjoy herself and ill bet youve got a few stories about him too i know he is a laugh no no youre absolutely right god its just as well hes not here rebus made a move to snatch the phone from her but she turned away from him really well thanks no thats yes yes id like that well maybe yes after this has all ill look forward to it bye bobby she was smiling as she ended the call picked up her glass and took a sip i think i got the gist of that rebus muttered im to call him bobby he says im a good officer jesus and hes invited me for a meal once the case is finished hes a married man hes not okay his wife left him hes old enough to be your dad though rebus paused what did he say about me nothing you laughed when he said it i was winding you up rebus glowered at her i buy the drinks and you do the winding up is that the basis of our relationship i offered to cook you a meal so you did bobby knows a nice restaurant in leith wonder which kebab shop hes meaning she thumped his arm go get us another round after what ive just been through rebus shook his head your shout he sat back in his chair as if getting comfortable if thats the way you want to play it siobhan got to her feet she wanted a closer look at the woman anyway but the blonde was leaving tucking cigarettes and lighter into her shoulder bag head dipped so that siobhan could make out only part of her face see you later the woman called aye see you mcallister called back he was wiping the bartop with a damp cloth the smile slid from his face at siobhans approach same again is it he asked she nodded friend of yours hed turned away to measure out rebuss whiskey in a way i seem to know her from somewhere oh aye he placed the drink in front of her you want the half as well she nodded and another lime juice and and soda i remember nothing in the whiskey ice in the lime another order was already coming from farther down the bar two lagers and a rum and black he rang up siobhans drinks was brisk with her change and started on the lagers making a show of being too busy for chitchat siobhan stood her ground a few moments longer then decided it wasnt worth it she was halfway back to the table when she remembered brought up short some of rebuss beer trickled down the side of the glass dripping onto the scuffed wooden floor whoa there rebus cautioned watching from his chair she got the drinks to the table and set them down went to the window and looked out but there was no sign of the blonde i know who she was she said who the woman who just left you must have seen her long blond hair tight pink tshirt short leather jacket black ski pants and heels slightly too high for their own good rebus took a sip of beer cant say i noticed but you didnt recognize her any reason i should well according to todays front page you only went and torched her boyfriend siobhan sat back holding her own glass in front of her waiting for her words to sink in fairstones girlfriend rebus said eyes narrowing siobhan nodded i only saw her the once the day fairstone walked free rebus was looking towards the bar youre sure it was her fairly sure when i heard her speak yes im positive i saw her outside the court when the trial finished just that once siobhan nodded again i wasnt the one who interviewed her about the alibi she gave her boyfriend and she wasnt in court when i gave my evidence whats her name siobhan narrowed her eyes in concentration rachel something where does rachel something live siobhan shrugged id guess not too far from her boyfriend making this not exactly her local not exactly ten miles from her local to be precise more or less siobhan was still holding the glass had yet to take her first sip you had any more of those letters she shook her head think she could be following you not every minute of the day idve spotted her now siobhan looked towards the bar too mcallisters flurry of activity had ended and he was back to washing glasses of course it might not be me she came here to see rebus got siobhan to drop him off at allan renshaws house he told her she should go home hed take a taxi back into town or get a patrol car to pick him up i dont know how long ill be hed said not an official visit just family shed nodded driven off hed rung the doorbell with no success peered through the window the boxes of snapshots were still spread out across the living room no sign of life he tried the door handle and it turned the door was unlocked allan he called kate he closed the door behind him there was a buzzing noise from upstairs he called out again but without answer cautiously he climbed the stairs there was a metal stepladder in the middle of the upstairs hall leading up through an open hatch in the ceiling rebus took each rung slowly allan there was a light on in the attic and the buzzing was louder rebus stuck his head through the hatch his cousin was seated crosslegged on the floor a control panel in his hand mimicking the sound the toy racing car made as it sped around the figureeight track i always let him win allan renshaw said giving the first sign that he was aware of rebuss appearance derek i mean we got him this for christmas one year rebus saw the open box lengths of unused track spilling from it packing boxes had been emptied suitcases opened rebus saw womens dresses childrens clothes a stack of old s he saw magazines with longforgotten tv stars on the front he saw plates and ornaments peeled from their protective newsprint some might have been wedding gifts dispatched to darkness by changing fashions a folded stroller waited to be claimed by the generation to come rebus had reached the top of the ladder and settled his weight against the edge of the hatch somehow amidst the clutter allan renshaw had negotiated room for the racetrack his eyes following the red plastic car as it completed its endless circuits never saw the attraction myself rebus commented same with train sets cars are different youve got that illusion of speed and you can race against everyone else plus renshaw pushed his finger down harder on the accelerator button if you take a bend too fast and crash his car spun from the track he reached out for it slid its guiding front brush into the slot on the roadway pressed the button and sent it on its renewed journey you see he said glancing towards rebus you can always start again rebus guessed nothings changed nothings broken renshaw said nodding its as if nothing happened its an illusion then rebus intimated a comforting illusion his cousin agreed he paused did i have a race set when i was a kid i dont remember rebus shrugged i know i didnt if they were around they were probably too expensive the money we spend on our kids eh john renshaw produced the glimmer of a smile always wanting the best for them never begrudging anything mustve been expensive putting your two through port edgar wasnt cheap youve just got the one is that right shes all grown now allan kates growing too moving on to another life shes got a head on her shoulders rebus watched as the car tripped from the track again it ended up near him so he reached forwards to replace it that crash derek was in he said it wasnt his fault was it renshaw shook his head stuart was a wild one were lucky derek was all right he set the car moving again rebus had noticed a blue car in the box and a spare controller sitting by his cousins left shoe we going to have a race then he asked sliding farther into the space picking up the small black box why not renshaw agreed placing rebuss car on the starting line he brought his own car to meet it then counted down from five both cars jolted towards the first bend rebuss careering off straightaway he crawled over on hands and knees and fixed it back onto the track just as renshaws car lapped him youve had more practice than me he complained sitting back down again drafts of warm air were gusting up through the open hatch providing the attic with its only source of heat rebus knew that if he stood there wouldnt be quite enough room for him so how long have you been up here he asked renshaw ran a hand over what was now more beard than stubble since first thing he said wheres kate out helping that msp the front door isnt locked oh anyone could walk in rebus had waited for renshaws car to catch up with him and now they were racing again crossing lanes at one point in the track know what i was thinking about last night renshaw said i think it was last night what i was thinking about your dad i really liked him he used to do tricks for me do you remember that producing pennies from behind your ear and making them disappear he said hed learned it in the army probably he was in the far east wasnt he rebus nodded his father had never said much about his wartime exploits mostly all hed shared were anecdotes things they could laugh at but later on towards the end of his life hed let slip details of some of the horrors hed witnessed these werent professional soldiers john they were conscriptsmen who worked in banks shops factories war changed them changed all of us how could it not thing is allan renshaw continued thinking about your dad got me thinking about you remember that day you took me to the park the day we played football renshaw nodded gave a weak smile you remember it probably not as well as you oh i remember all right we were playing football and then some guys you knew turned up and i had to play by myself while you talked to them renshaw paused the cars crossed each other again coming back to you not really but rebus supposed it could be true whenever hed gone home on leave thered been friends from school to catch up with then we started walking home or you and your pals did me trailing behind carrying the ball youd bought us now this bit this bit id pushed to the back of my mind what bit rebus was concentrating on the racetrack the bit where we were passing the pub you remember the pub on the corner the bowhill hotel that was it we were passing only then you turned to me pointed at me told me id to wait outside your voice was different a lot harder like you didnt want your pals to know we were pals you sure about this allan oh im sure because the three of you went inside and i sat at the curb and waited i was holding on to the ball and after a while you came out again but just to hand me a bag of crisps you went back inside and then these other kids came up and one of them kicked the ball out of my grasp and they ran off laughing and kicking it to each other thats when i started crying and still you didnt come out and i knew i couldnt go in so i got to my feet and walked back to the house by myself i got lost once but i stopped and asked someone the racing cars were speeding towards the point at which they would switch lanes they arrived at the same time met and bounced off the track landing on their backs neither man moved the attic was silent for a moment you came home later renshaw continued breaking the silence and nobody said anything because id not said anything to them but you know what really got me you never asked what had happened to the ball and i knew why you didnt ask it was because youd forgotten all about it because it wasnt important to you renshaw paused and i was just some little kid again and not your friend jesus allan rebus was trying to remember but there was nothing there the day hed thought hed known had been sunshine and football nothing else im sorry he said at last tears were dripping down renshaws cheeks i was family john and you treated me like i was nothing allan believe me i never out renshaw yelled sniffing back more tears i want you out of my housenow hed risen stiffly to his feet rebus was up too the two men standing awkwardly heads angled against the roofbeams backs bent look allan if its any but renshaw had him by the shoulder trying to maneuver him to the hatch all right all right rebus was saying he tried yanking himself free of the other mans grip and renshaw stumbled one foot finding no purchase sending him falling through the hatch rebus grabbed him by the arm feeling his fingers burn as he tightened his grip renshaw scrabbled back upright you okay rebus asked didnt you hear me renshaw was pointing at the ladder okay allan but well talk again sometime eh thats what i came here for to talk to get to know you you had your chance to get to know me renshaw said coldly rebus was making his way back down the ladder he peered up through the gap but his cousin wasnt visible are you coming down allan he called no response then the buzzing sound again as the red car recommenced its journey rebus turned and headed downstairs didnt really know what to do whether it was safe to leave allan like this he walked into the living room through to the kitchen outside the lawn mower had yet to move there were sheets of paper on the table computer printouts petitions calling for gun control for more safety in schools no names as yet just row after row of blank boxes the same thing had happened after dunblane a tightening of rules and regulations result more illegal guns than ever out there on the street rebus knew that in edinburgh if you knew where to go asking you could get a gun in under an hour in glasgow it was reckoned to take all of ten minutes guns were run like rental videos you hired them for a day if they came back unused you got some money back used and you didnt a simple commercial transaction not too far removed from peacock johnsons activities rebus thought about signing his name to the petition but knew it would be an empty gesture there were lots of newspaper cuttings and reprints of magazine articles the effects of violence in the media kneejerk stuff like saying a horror video could make two kids kill a toddler he had a look around wondering if kate had left a contact number he wanted to talk to her about her father maybe tell her allan needed her more than jack bell did he stood at the foot of the stairs for a few minutes listening to the noises in the attic then checked the phone book for a taxi firm be with you in ten the voice on the phone told him a cheery female voice it was almost enough to persuade him that there was another world than this siobhan stood in the middle of her living room and looked around her she walked over to the window and closed the shutters against the dying light she picked up a mug and plate from the floor toast crumbs identifying her last meal in the flat she checked that there were no messages on her phone it was friday which meant toni jackson and the other female officers would be expecting her but the last thing she felt like was girlie bonhomie and the drunken eyeingup of pub talent the mug and plate took half a minute to wash and place on the draining board a quick look in the fridge the food shed bought intending to cook a meal for rebus was still there a few days shy of its best before date she closed the door again and went into her bedroom straightened the duvet on her bed confirmed that doing laundry would be necessary this weekend then into the bathroom a glance at herself in the mirror before heading back into the living room where she opened the days mail two bills and a postcard the postcard was from an old college friend they hadnt managed to see each other this year despite living in the same city now the friend was enjoying a fourday break in rome probably already back judging by the date on the card rome siobhan had never been there i walked into the travel agent asked them what they had at short notice having a great time chilling doing the café thing a bit of culture when the mood takes me love jackie she stood the card on her mantelpiece tried remembering her last real holiday a week with her parents that weekend break in dublin it had been a hen party for one of the uniforms and now the woman was expecting her first kid she looked up at the ceiling her upstairs neighbor was thumping around she didnt think he did it on purpose but he walked like an elephant shed met him on the sidewalk outside when she was coming home complaining that hed just had to fetch his car from the city impound twenty minutes i left it twenty on a single yellow by the time i got back itd been towed hundred and thirty quid can you believe it i almost told them it was more than the bloody things worth then hed stabbed a finger at her you should do something about it because she was a cop because people thought cops could pull strings get things sorted change things you should do something about it he was raging all around his living room a caged animal ready to hurl itself against the bars he worked in an office on george street account executive retail insurance not quite siobhans height he wore glasses with narrow rectangular lenses had a male flatmate but had stressed to siobhan that he wasnt gay information for which she had thanked him stomp thunk plod she wondered if there was any purpose to his movements was he opening and closing drawers looking for the lost remote perhaps or was movement itself his purpose and if so what did that say about her own stillness about the fact that she was standing here listening to him one postcard on her mantelpiece one plate and mug on the draining board one shuttered window with a horizontal locking bar that she never bothered fastening safe enough in here as it was cocooned smothered sod it she muttered turning to make good her escape st leonards was quiet shed intended burning off some frustration in the gym but instead got herself a can of something cold and fizzy from the machine and headed upstairs to cid checking her desk for messages another letter from her mystery admirer do black leather gloves turn you on referring to rebus she surmised there was a note for her to call ray duff but all he wanted to say was that hed managed to test the first of her anonymous letters and its not good news meaning its clean she guessed as the proverbial whistle she let out a sigh sorry i cant be more helpful would buying you a drink help some other time maybe fair enough ill probably be here for another hour or two as it is here being the forensic lab at howdenhall still working on port edgar matching blood types see whose spatters are whose siobhan was seated on the edge of her desk phone tucked between cheek and shoulder as she sifted through the rest of the paperwork in her intray most of it concerned cases from weeks back names she could barely remember better let you get back to it then she said keeping busy yourself siobhan you sound tired you know what its like ray lets have that drink sometime by then i reckon well both need it she smiled into the phone bye ray take care of yourself shiv she put the phone down there it was again somebody calling her shiv trying for a kind of intimacy they thought the foreshortening would bring shed noticed though that no one ever tried the same tack with rebus never called him jock johnny jojo or jr because they looked at him or listened to him and knew he was none of those things he was john rebus detective inspector rebus to his closest friends john yet some of these same people would happily see her as shiv why because she was a woman did she lack rebuss gravitas or sense of perpetual threat were they just trying to worm their way into her affections or would the conferring of a nickname make her seem more vulnerable less edgy and potentially dangerous to them shiv it meant a knife didnt it american slang well right now she felt just about as blunt as she ever had and here was another nickname walking into the room ds george hiho silvers looking around as if for someone in particular spotting her it took him a second to make up his mind that she might suit his particular requirements busy he asked what does it look like fancy a wee drive then youre not really my type george a snort weve got a dp dp deceased person where over gracemount way abandoned railway track looks like he fell from the footbridge an accident then like fairstones chippan fire another gracemount accident silvers shrugged his shoulders as far as he could within the confines of a suit jacket that had fitted him with room to spare three years before story is he was being chased chased another shrug thats as much as i know till we get there siobhan nodded so what are we waiting for they took silverss car he asked her about south queensferry about rebus and the house fire but she kept her answers short eventually he got the message and turned on the radio whistling along to trad jazz possibly her least favorite music you listen to any mogwai george never heard of it why just wondering there was nowhere to park near the railway line silvers pulled up to the curb behind a patrol car there was a bus stop and behind it an area of grassland they crossed it on foot approaching a low fence overgrown with thistles and brambles the fence was broken by a short metal stairway leading to the bridge across the railway where sightseers from the local apartment houses had gathered a uniformed officer was asking each one if theyd seen or heard anything how the hell are we supposed to get down silvers growled siobhan pointed to the far side where a makeshift stile had been erected from plastic milk crates and cinder blocks an old mattress folded across the top of the fence when they reached it silvers took one look and decided it wasnt for him he didnt say anything just shook his head so siobhan clambered up and over skidding down the steep embankment digging her heels as far as possible into the soft ground feeling nettles sting her ankles briars snag at her trousers several figures had gathered around the prone body on the track she recognized faces from the craigmillar police station and the pathologist dr curt he saw her and smiled a greeting were lucky they havent reopened this line yet he said at least the poor chaps in one piece she looked down at the twisted broken body his duffel coat had been thrown open exposing a torso clad in a loosefitting checked shirt brown cord trousers and brown loafers a couple of people called in one of the craigmillar detectives was telling her saying theyd seen him wandering the streets probably not too unusual around here except he looked like he was on the hunt for somebody kept a hand in one pocket like he might be carrying and is he the detective shook his head might be he dropped it when he was being chased local kids by the sound of it siobhan looked from the body to the bridge and back again did they catch him the detective shrugged so do we know who he is video rental card in his back pocket names callis initial a weve got someone checking the phone book if that doesnt work well get an address from the video shop callis siobhans eyebrows creased she was trying to remember where shed heard that name then it hit her andy callis she said almost to herself the detective had heard her you know him she shook her head but i know someone who might if its the same guy he lives in alnwickhill she was reaching for her mobile oh and one other thing if it is him hes one of us a cop she nodded the detective from craigmillar sucked air through his teeth and stared up at the spectators on the bridge with a new sense of purpose there was nobody home rebus had been watching miss teris room for almost an hour dark dark dark just like his memories he could not even recall which friends hed met with that day in the park yet the scene had stayed with allan renshaw these past thirtyodd years indelible it was funny the things you couldnt help remembering the ones you chose to forget the little tricks your brain could play on you sudden scents or sensations reviving the longforgotten rebus wondered if perhaps allan was angry with him because such anger was possible after all what point was there in getting angry with lee herdman herdman wasnt there to bear the brunt while rebus conspicuously was as if conjured up for the very purpose the laptop kicked into screensaver mode shooting stars moving out of the far darkness he hit the return key and was back in teri cotters bedroom what was he watching for because it satisfied the voyeur in him hed always enjoyed surveillances for the same reason glimpses into secret lives he wondered what teri herself got out of it she wasnt making money there was no interaction as such no way for the viewer to make contact with her or for her to communicate with her audience why then because she felt the need to be on display like hanging out on cockburn street stared at and sometimes set upon she had accused her mother of spying on her yet had made straight for her mothers door when the lost boys had attacked hard to know what to think about that particular relationship rebuss own daughter had lived her teenage years in london with her mother remaining a mystery to him his exwife would call him to complain about samanthas attitude or her moods would let off steam at him and then put down the phone the phone his phone was ringing his mobile phone it was plugged into the wall recharging he picked it up hello i tried ringing your home phone siobhans voice it was engaged rebus looked at the laptop the laptop that was hooked up to his phone line whats up your friend the one you were visiting that night you bumped into me she was on her mobile sounded like she was out doors andy he said andy callis can you describe him rebus froze whats happened look it might not be him where are you describe him for me that way youre not headed all the way out here for nothing rebus squeezed his eyes shut saw andy callis in his living room feet up in front of the tv early forties dark brown hair fiveeleven probably a hundred and sixtyfive pounds or thereabouts she was silent for a moment okay she sighed maybe you should come after all rebus was already looking for his jacket he remembered the laptop broke the internet connection so where are you he asked how are you going to get here my problem he told her looking around for his car keys just give me the address she was waiting for him curbside watched him pull on the hand brake and get out of the drivers seat how are the hands she asked they were fine before i got behind the wheel painkillers he shook his head i can do without he was looking around at the scene a couple of hundred yards or so up the road was the bus stop where his taxi had stopped for the lost boys they started walking towards the bridge hed been stalking the place for a couple of hours siobhan explained two or three people reported seeing him and did we do anything about it there wasnt a patrol car available she said quietly if there had been he might not be dead rebus stated starkly she nodded slowly one of the neighbors heard shouts she thinks some kids had started chasing him did she see anyone siobhan shook her head they were on the bridge now the onlookers had started drifting away the body had been wrapped in a blanket and loaded onto a stretcher hitched to a length of rope with which to haul it up the embankment a van from the morgue had pulled up next to the stile silvers was standing there chatting to the driver and smoking a cigarette weve checked the callises in the phone book he told rebus and siobhan no sign of him unlisted rebus said same as you and me george you sure its the same callis silvers inquired there was a yell from below the driver flicking away his cigarette so he could concentrate on his end of the rope silvers kept on smoking not offering a hand until the driver asked for one rebus kept his own hands in his pockets they felt like they were on fire heave away came the call in under a minute the stretcher was being carried over the fence rebus stepped forwards unwrapped the face stared at it noting how peaceful andy callis looked in death its him he said standing back again so the body could be loaded into the van dr curt was at the top of the incline having been helped by the craigmillar detective he was breathing hard climbing over the stile with difficulty when someone stepped forwards to help he spluttered that he could manage his speech thick with effort its him silvers was telling the new arrivals according to di rebus that is andy callis someone asked is he the guy from firearms rebus nodded any witnesses the craigmillar detective was asking one of the uniforms answered people heard voices nobody seems tove seen anything suicide someone else asked or he was trying to escape siobhan commented noting that rebus wasnt adding anything to the conversation even though hed known andy callis best or maybe because they watched the morgue van bump over the uneven ground on its way back to the road silvers asked siobhan if she was headed back she looked at rebus and shook her head johnll give me a lift she said please yourself looks like craigmillarll be handling it anyway she nodded waiting for silvers to leave then left alone with rebus you okay i keep thinking of the patrol car that never came and he looked at her theres more to it isnt there eventually he nodded slowly care to share it she asked he kept on nodding when he moved off she followed back over the bridge across the grass to where the saab was sitting it wasnt locked he opened the drivers door thought better of it and handed her the keys you drive he said i dont think im up to it where are we going just cruising around maybe well get lucky find ourselves in nevernever land it took her a moment to decode the reference the lost boys she said rebus nodded walked around the car to the passenger side and while im driving youll be telling me the story ill tell you the story he agreed and he did what it boiled down to was andy callis and his partner on patrol in their car called to a nightclub on market street just behind waverley station it was a popular spot people queuing to get in one of them had called the police reporting someone brandishing a handgun vague description teenager green parka three mates with him not in the queue as such just walking past pulling open his coat so people could see what was tucked into his waistband by the time andy got there rebus said there was no sign of him hed gone heading off down towards new street so thats where andy and his partner went theyd called it in and been authorized to unlock their guns had them on their laps flak jackets on backup was on its way just in case you know where the railway passes over the bottom of new street at calton road rebus nodded stone railway arches its pretty gloomy down there not much in the way of street lighting siobhans turn to nod it was a desolate spot all right lots of nooks and crannies too rebus continued andys partner thought he spotted something in the shadows they stopped the car got out saw these four guys probably the same ones kept their distance asked if they were carrying any weapons ordered them to place anything on the ground the way andy told it it was like shadows that kept shifting he rested his head against the back of the seat closed his eyes wasnt sure if what he was looking at was a shadow or flesh and blood he was unclipping his flashlight from his belt when he thought he saw movement a hand stretching pointing something he aimed his own gun safety off what happened something fell to the ground it was a pistol a replica as it turned out but too late hed fired rebus nodded not that he hit anyone he was aiming at the ground ricochet could have gone anywhere but it didnt no rebus paused there had to be an inquiry happens every time a weapons discharged partner backed him up but andy knew the guy was just mouthing words he started doubting himself and the guy with the gun four of them none would own up to carrying it three were wearing parkas and the kid from the nightclub queue wasnt about to id the carrier the lost boys rebus nodded thats the neighborhood name for them theyre the ones you ran into on cockburn street the leaderhis names rab fisherhe went to court for carrying the replica but the case was booted out waste of the lawyers time and meanwhile andy callis was playing it over and over again in his head trying to sort out the shadows from the truth and this is the lost boys patch siobhan asked peering out through the windshield rebus nodded siobhan was thoughtful then asked where did the gun come from at a guess peacock johnson is that why you wanted a word with him that day he was brought into st leonards rebus nodded again and now you want a word with the lost boys looks like theyve gone home for the night rebus admitted turning his head to watch from the passengerside window you think callis came here on purpose maybe looking to confront them they got off scotfree siobhan andy wasnt too thrilled at that she was thoughtful so why arent we telling all this to craigmillar ill let them know he felt her staring cross my heart it could have been an accident that railway line would look like an escape route maybe nobody saw anything he turned towards her spit it out she sighed its just the way you keep trying to fight other peoples battles for them is that what i do sometimes yes well im sorry if that upsets you it doesnt upset me but sometimes she swallowed back what shed been about to say sometimes rebus encouraged her she shook her head exhaled noisily and stretched her back working her neck thank god for the weekend you got any plans thought i might do some hill walking pump some iron at the gym just a hint of sarcasm there just a hint hed spotted something slow down a bit he was turning to watch from the rear window back the car up she did so they were on a street of lowrise flats a supermarket cart itself a long way from home sat abandoned on the pavement rebus was looking down an alley between two blocks one no two figures just silhouettes so close together they seemed to merge then rebus realized what was happening a good oldfashioned kneetrembler siobhan commented who said the art of romance was dead one of the faces had turned towards the car noting the idling engine a rough masculine voice called out enjoying the view pal better than youre getting at home eh drive rebus ordered siobhan drove they ended up at st leonards siobhan explaining that her car was there without elaborating any further rebus had told her hed be okay to drive home arden street was five minutes away but by the time he parked outside his flat his hands were burning in the bathroom he smeared more cream on and took a couple of painkillers hoping hed be able to snatch a few hours sleep a whiskey might help so he poured a large measure and sat himself down in the living room the laptop had gone from screensaver to sleep mode he didnt bother waking it walked over to his dining table instead he had some stuff about the sas laid out there alongside the copy of herdmans personnel file he sat down in front of it enjoying the view pal better than youre getting at home enjoying the view day five monday the view was magnificent siobhan was in the front next to the pilot rebus was tucked in behind an empty seat next to him the noise from the propellers was deafening we couldve taken the corporate plane doug brimson was explaining but the fuel bills massive and it mightve been too big for the lz lz landing zone not a term rebus had heard since hed left the army corporate siobhan was asking ive got a sevenseater companies hire me to fly them to meetingsotherwise known as jollies i lay on some chilled champagne crystal glasses sounds fun sorry all weve got today is a canteen of tea he offered a laugh turning to look at rebus i was in dublin for the weekend flew a bunch of bankers there for some rugby match they paid for me to stay over lucky you a few weekends back it was amsterdam businessmans stag party rebus was thinking of his own weekend when siobhan had picked him up this morning shed asked what hed done not much hed said you ditto funny the guys down at leith said youd been dropping in funny they told me the same thing about you enjoying it so far brimson asked now so far rebus said in truth he had no great head for heights all the same hed watched with fascination the aerial view of edinburgh amazed at how indistinguishable landmarks like the castle and calton hill were from their surroundings no mistaking the volcanic heft of arthurs seat but the buildings suffered from a uniform gray coloring still the elaborate patterning of the new towns geometric streets was impressive and then they were out over the forth passing south queensferry and the road and rail bridges rebus sought port edgar school saw hopetoun house first and then the school building not half a mile distant he could even make out the portakabin they were heading west now following the m towards glasgow siobhan was asking brimson if he did a lot of corporate work depends how the economys doing to be honest if a companys sending four or five people to a meeting it can be cheaper to charter than to fly regular business class siobhan tells me you were in the forces mr brimson rebus said leaning as far forward as his seat belt would allow brimson smiled i was raf what about you inspector forces background rebus nodded even trained for the sas he admitted didnt quite make the grade few do and some of those falter down the line brimson looked at him again you mean lee and robert niles how did you come to know him through lee he told me he visited robert i asked if i could go with him one day and after that you started going on your own rebus was remembering the entries in the visitors log yes hes an interesting chap we seem to get along he looked at siobhan fancy taking over the controls while i chat with your colleague no fear another time maybe i think youd like it he gave her a wink then to rebus the army seems to treat its old boys pretty shabbily wouldnt you say i dont know theres support available when you hit civvy street wasnt in my day high rate of marriage failures breakdowns more falklands veterans have taken their own lives than were killed in the actual conflict a lot of homeless people are exforces on the other hand rebus said the sas is big business these days you can sell your story to a publisher sell your services as a bodyguard way i hear it all four sas squadrons are below quota too many are leaving suicide rates lower than the average too brimson didnt appear to be listening one guy jumped out of a plane a few years back maybe you heard about that too recipient of the qgm queens gallantry medal rebus explained for siobhans benefit tried stabbing his exwife thinking she was trying to kill him suffered from depression couldnt take it anymore went into freefall if youll pardon the pun it happens rebus said he was remembering the book in herdmans flat the one teris photo had fallen from oh it happens all right brimson was continuing the sas chaplain who took part in the iranian embassy siege he ended up committing suicide another exsas man shot his girlfriend with a gun hed brought back from the gulf war and something similar happened to lee herdman siobhan asked seems like brimson said why pick on that school though rebus continued you went to a few of his parties didnt you mr brimson he threw a good party always used to be plenty of teenagers hanging around brimson turned again is that a question or a comment ever see any drugs brimson seemed to be concentrating on the control panel in front of him maybe a bit of pot he finally conceded is that as strong as it got its as much as i saw not quite the same thing did you ever hear a rumor that lee herdman might be dealing no or smuggling brimson looked towards siobhan shouldnt i have a solicitor present she gave a reassuring smile i think the detective inspectors just making conversation she turned to rebus isnt that right her eyes telling rebus to go easy thats right he said just a bit of chat he tried not to think about the hours of lost sleep his stinging hands andy calliss death concentrated instead on the view from his window the changing landscape theyd be over glasgow soon and then out into the firth of clyde bute and kintyre so you never associated lee herdman with drugs he asked i never saw him with anything stronger than a joint thats not exactly answering my question what would you say if i told you drugs had been found on one of herdmans boats id say its none of my business lee was a friend inspector dont expect me to play along with whatever game it is youre some of my colleagues think he was smuggling cocaine and ecstasy into the country rebus stated its not my problem what your colleagues think brimson muttered sinking into silence i saw your car on cockburn street last week siobhan said trying for a change of subject just after id been out to turnhouse to see you id probably stopped off at the bank this was past closing time brimson was thoughtful cockburn street then he nodded to himself some friends have got a shop there i think i popped in which shop is it he looked at her its not really a shop as such one of those tanning places owned by charlotte cotter brimson looked amazed we interviewed the daughter shes a pupil at the school right brimson nodded hed been flying with a headset on one of the ear protectors pushed away from his ear but now he fixed it on and angled the mike towards his mouth go ahead tower he said then he listened as the control tower at glasgow airport told him which route to take so as to avoid an incoming flight rebus was staring at the back of brimsons head thinking to himself that teri hadnt mentioned him being a friend of the family hadnt sounded as if she liked him at all the cessna banked steeply rebus trying not to grip his armrest too tightly a minute later they were passing over greenock and then the short stretch of water that separated it from dunoon the countryside below was growing wilder more forests fewer settlements they crossed loch fyne and were out into the sound of jura the wind seemed to pick up almost immediately buffeting the plane ive not been this way before brimson admitted looked at the charts last night just the one road up the eastern side of the island bottom halfs mostly forest and some decent peaks and the landing strip siobhan asked youll see he turned to rebus again ever read any poetry inspector do i look the type frankly no im a great fan of yeats theres a poem of his i was reading the other night i know that i shall meet my fate somewhere among the clouds above those that i fight i do not hate those that i guard i do not love he looked at siobhan isnt that the saddest thing you think lee felt that way she asked he shrugged the poor bastard who jumped out of the plane did he paused know what the poems called an irish airman foresees his death another glance at the instrument panel this is us over jura now siobhan looked out on to wilderness the plane made a tight circuit and she could see the coastline again and a road running alongside it as the plane made its descent brimson seemed to be checking the road for something some marker perhaps i dont see anywhere to land siobhan said but she noticed a man who appeared to be waving both arms at them brimson took the plane back up and made a further circuit any traffic he said as they flew low over the road once more siobhan thought he must be talking to someone on the mike some tower somewhere but then she realized he was talking to her and by traffic he meant on the road beneath youve got to be kidding she said turning to see if rebus shared her disbelief but he seemed to be concentrating on guiding the plane down by willpower alone the wheels rumbled as they hit the tarmac the plane bouncing once as if straining to be airborne again brimson had his teeth clenched but was smiling too he turned to siobhan as if in triumph and taxied along the highway towards the waiting man the man who was still waving his arms and now guiding the small plane through an open gateway leading to a field of stubble they bumped over the ruts brimson cut the engines and slid off his headphones there was a house next to the field and a woman standing there watching them nursing a baby siobhan opened her door undid her selt belt and leapt out the ground felt as if it were vibrating but she realized it was her body still shaken up from the flight ive never landed on a road before a grinning brimson was telling the man it was that or the field the man said in a thick accent he was tall and muscular with curly brown hair and bright pink cheeks im rory mollison he shook brimsons hand then was introduced to siobhan rebus who was lighting a cigarette nodded but didnt offer his own hand you found the place all right then mollison said as if theyd arrived by car as you can see siobhan said thought it would work mollison said the sas guys landed by helicopter it was their pilot who told me the road would make a good landing strip no potholes you see he was right brimson said mollison was the rescue teams local guide when siobhan had asked her favor of brimsona plane ride to jurahed asked if she knew anywhere they could land rebus had passed along mollisons name siobhan waved at the woman who waved back with no real enthusiasm my wife mary mollison said and our little one seona are you coming in for some tea rebus made a show of looking at his watch best if we get started actually he turned to brimson youll be all right here till we get back what do you mean we should only be a few hours hang on im coming too i dont suppose mrs mollison wants me moping around here and after flying you here i dont see how you can turn me down rebus looked to siobhan then conceded with a shrug youll want to come in and get changed mollison was saying siobhan lifted her backpack and nodded changed rebus echoed climbing gear mollison looked him up and down is that all youve brought rebus shrugged siobhan had opened her own pack to show hiking boots cagoule and canteen a regular mary poppins rebus commented you can borrow from me mollison assured him leading the three visitors towards the house youre not a professional guide then siobhan asked mollison shook his head but i know this island like the back of my hand i must have traversed every square inch of it these past twenty years they had taken mollisons land rover as far as they could along muddy logging tracks bumpy enough to shake the fillings from their teeth mollison was a skilled driver either that or a madman there were times when there seemed to be no track at all and they were pitching wildly across the mosscovered forest floor dropping down a gear to pass over rocky outcrops or through streams but eventually even he had to concede defeat it was time for them to walk rebus was wearing a venerable pair of climbing boots whose leather had turned implacably hard making it difficult for him to bend his feet at the toes he had on waterproof trousers splattered with old mud and an oily barbour jacket with the car engine turned off silence had returned to the woods ever see the first rambo film siobhan asked in a whisper rebus didnt think she was expecting an answer he turned to brimson instead what made you leave the raf i just got tired of it i suppose tired of taking orders from people i didnt respect what about lee did he ever say why he left the sas brimson shrugged his eyes were on the ground watching for roots and puddles much the same thing id guess but he never spelled it out no so what did the two of you find to talk about brimson glanced up at him plenty of things he was easy to get along with no fallingsout we might have argued about politics once or twice the way the world was headed nothing to make me think he was about to go off the rails id have helped him if hed hinted rails rebus thought of that word saw andy calliss body being hauled up from the railway tracks he wondered if his visits had helped or had they merely been painful reminders of everything the man had lost then he remembered how siobhan had been about to say something in the car last night maybe to do with why he felt he had to get involved in all these other lives not always for the best how far are we going brimson was asking mollison maybe an hours hike the same back mollison had a knapsack slung over one shoulder he looked at his companions eyes lingering on rebus actually he corrected himself maybe an hour and a half rebus had already told brimson part of the story back at the house asking if herdman had ever mentioned the mission to him brimson had shaken his head i remember it from the papers though people thought the ira had blown the chopper out of the skies now as they commenced the climb mollison was talking thats what they told me we were looking for evidence of a missile attack so they werent interested in finding the bodies siobhan asked she had changed into thick socks tucking her trouser bottoms into them the boots looked new or if not new then seldom worn oh i think there was that too but they were more interested in why the crash happened how many of them were there rebus asked half a dozen and they came straight to you i daresay they spoke to someone from mountain rescue who told them i was as good a guide as they were going to get he paused not that theres much in the way of competition he paused again they made me sign the official secrets act rebus stared at him before or after mollison scratched behind one ear right at the start they said it was standard procedure he looked at rebus does that mean i shouldnt be talking to you i dont know did you find anything you think needs to be kept secret mollison considered his answer then shook his head then its all right rebus told him probably just procedure after all mollison set off again rebus keen to keep by his side though the boots seemed to have other ideas has anyone been here since rebus asked we get plenty of walkers in the summer i meant from the army mollisons hand went to his ear again there was one woman middle of last year i think it was maybe more than that she was trying to look like a tourist but not quite pulling it off rebus suggested going on to describe whiteread youve got her to a t mollison admitted rebus and siobhan shared a look it may just be me brimson said pausing to catch his breath but what has any of this got to do with what lee did maybe nothing rebus conceded but the exercise will do us good all the same as the walk continued all of it uphill now they fell quiet saving energy eventually they emerged from the forest the steep slope directly in front of them boasted only a few stunted trees grass heather and bracken were broken by jagged stumps of rock no more walking if they wanted to go any farther it would be by climbing rebus craned his neck seeking the distant summit dont worry mollison said were not going up there he pointed upwards helicopter hit the rock face about halfway to the top came tumbling down here he waved an arm in the direction of the area around them it was a big helicopter looked to me like it had too many propellers it was a chinook rebus explained two sets of rotor blades one lot at the front one at the back he looked at mollison there mustve been a lot of debris there was that and the bodies well they were all over one stuck on a ledge a hundred meters up myself and another fellow brought him down they brought in a salvage team to take away what wreckage there was but they had someone here to examine it he didnt find anything meaning it wasnt a missile mollison shook his head in agreement he pointed back towards the tree line a lot of papers had been blown about mostly they were scouring the woods for them some of the sheets were stuck up trees would you believe they shinnied up to fetch them did anyone say why mollison shook his head again not officially but when the guys stopped to boil a brewthey were always doing thatid hear what they were saying the helicopter was on its way to ulster majors and colonels onboard had to be carrying documents they didnt want the terrorists to see might explain why they were carrying guns guns the rescue team brought rifles with them i thought it was a bit odd at the time did you ever happen across any of these documents yourself rebus asked mollison nodded but i never looked at them just crunched them into a ball and brought them back pity rebus said with the wriest smile he could manage its beautiful up here siobhan said suddenly shielding her eyes from the sun it is isnt it mollison agreed face breaking into a grin speaking of boiling a brew brimson interrupted got that canteen of tea on you siobhan opened her backpack and handed it over the four of them passed the single plastic cup between them it tasted the way tea always did from a canteen hot but somehow not quite right rebus was walking around the area at the foot of the incline did anything strike you as strange he was asking mollison strange about the mission about the people or what they were up to mollison shook his head did you get to know them at all we were only out here the two days you didnt know lee herdman rebus had brought a photo with him he handed it over hes the one who shot the schoolkids mollison waited for rebus to nod then stared at the photo again i remember him all right nice enough guy quiet not exactly what youd call a team player how do you mean he liked it best in the woods tracking down the bits and pieces of paper every little scrap the others joked about it theyd have to call him two or three times when the tea was being poured maybe he knew it wasnt worth hurrying for brimson sniffed the surface of the cup are you saying i cant make tea siobhan complained brimson held up his hands in surrender how long were they here rebus was asking mollison two days the salvage squad arrived on the second day took them another week to ship the wreckage out did you get talking to them much mollison shrugged seemed nice enough lads very focused on their work rebus nodded and started walking into the forest not too far but it was amazing how quickly you started to get the sense of being isolated cut off from the still visible faces and still audible voices what was that brian eno album another green world first there had been the world as seen from the air and now this equally alien and vibrant lee herdman had walked into these woods and almost not come out again his last mission before leaving the sas had he learned something here found something rebus had a sudden thought you never really left the sas an indelible mark remained just beyond your everyday feelings and actions you came to the realization that there were other worlds other realities youd had experiences beyond the usual youd been trained to see life as just another mission filled with potential booby traps and assassins rebus wondered how far he himself had been able to travel from his days in the paras and training for the sas had he been in free fall ever since and had lee herdman like the airman of the poem foreseen his own death he crouched down ran a hand over the ground twigs and leaves springy moss a covering of native flowers and weeds saw in his minds eye the helicopter hit the rock face malfunction or pilot error malfunction pilot error or something more terrible saw the sky explode as the fuel ignited rotor blades slowing buckling it would drop like a stone bodies flying from it concertinaing on impact the dull thud of flesh hitting solid ground same noise andy calliss body would have made when it hit the railway line the explosion sending the contents of the chopper bursting outwards paper crisped at the edges or reduced to confetti secret papers needing the sas to recover them and lee herdman busier than most as he plunged deeper and deeper into the woods he recalled teri cotters words about herdman that was the thing about him like he had secrets he thought of the missing computer the one herdman had bought for his business where was it who had it what secrets might it reveal you okay siobhans voice she was holding the cup newly replenished rebus rose to his feet fine he said i called you i didnt hear he took the cup from her a touch of the lee herdmans she said could be he took a slurp of tea are we going to find anything here he shrugged maybe its enough just to see the place you think he took something dont you her eyes were on his you think he took something and the army wants it back no longer a question but a statement rebus nodded slowly and this concerns us how she asked maybe because we dont like them rebus answered or because whatever it is they havent found it yet which means someone else might maybe someone found it last week and when herdman found out he went berserk rebus shrugged again handed back the empty cup you like brimson dont you she didnt blink but couldnt hold his gaze its okay he said with a smile she misread his tone managed a glare oh so i have your permission do i his turn to raise his hands in surrender i just meant but he didnt think anything he said would help so he let the words trail off teas too strong by the way he told her making his way back towards the rock face at least i thought to bring some siobhan muttered tipping out the dregs on the flight back rebus sat silently in the backseat though siobhan had offered to swap he kept his face to the window as if transfixed by the passing views giving siobhan and brimson the chance to talk brimson showed her the controls and how to use them and made her promise to take a flying lesson from him it was as if theyd forgotten about lee herdman and maybe rebus was forced to reflect they had a point most people in south queensferry even the families of the victims just wanted to get on with their lives what was past was past and there was no changing it or making things right again you had to let go sometime if you could rebus closed his eyes against the suns sudden glare it bathed his face in warmth and light he realized he was exhausted in danger of dropping off to sleep realized too that it didnt matter sleep was fine but he awoke again minutes later with a start having dreamed that he was alone in a strange city clad only in an oldfashioned pair of striped pajamas barefoot and with no money on him seeking out anyone who might help while all the time trying to look as if he fitted in peering through a café window hed spotted a man sliding a gun beneath a table hiding it there on his lap rebus knowing he couldnt go in not without money so just standing there watching with his palms pressed to the glass trying not to make a fuss blinking his eyes back into focus he saw that they were over the firth of forth again making their final approach brimson was talking i often think about the damage a terrorist could do even with something as small as a cessna youve got the dockyard the ferry road and rail bridges airport nearby theyd be spoiled for choice siobhan agreed i can think of bits of the city id rather see leveled rebus commented ah youre with us again inspector i can only apologize that our company wasnt more sparkling brimson and siobhan shared a smile letting rebus know he hadnt been too sorely missed the landing was smooth brimson taxiing towards where siobhans car sat waiting climbing out rebus shook brimsons hand thanks for letting me tag along brimson said its me who should be thanking you send us the bill for your fuel and your time brimson just shrugged turned to squeeze siobhans hand holding on to it a little longer than necessary wagged a finger of his free hand at her remember ill be expecting you she smiled a promise is a promise doug but meantime i wonder if i can be cheeky go ahead i just wondered if i could take a peek at the corporate jet to see how the other half lives he stared at her for a moment then smiled back no problem its in the hangar brimson started to lead the way coming inspector ill wait here rebus said after theyd gone he managed to get a cigarette lit sheltering by the side of the cessna they reappeared five minutes later brimsons good humor evaporating as he saw the stub of rebuss cigarette strictly forbidden he said fire hazard you understand rebus gave a shrug of apology nipped the cigarette and crushed it underfoot as he followed siobhan to her car brimson was getting into the land rover ready to drive to the gate and unlock it nice guy rebus said yes siobhan agreed nice guy you really think so she looked at him dont you rebus shrugged i get the feeling hes a collector of what rebus thought for a moment of interesting specimens people like herdman and niles he knows the cotters too dont forget siobhans hackles werent ready to go down just yet look im not saying youre warning me off him arent you rebus stayed silent arent you she repeated i just dont want all that corporate jet glamour going to your head he paused what was it like anyway she glared at him then relented smallish leather seats they do champagne and hot meals on the flights dont go getting any ideas she gave a twitch of the mouth asked where he wanted to go and he told her craigmillar police station the detective there was named blake he was a dc less than a year out of uniform rebus didnt mind that it meant hed be keen to prove himself so rebus told him what he knew about andy callis and the lost boys blake kept a look of concentration on his face throughout stopping rebus from time to time and asking a question noting everything on a lined legal pad siobhan sat in the room with them arms folded mostly just staring at the wall ahead rebus got the feeling she was thinking of airplane rides at the end of the interview rebus asked if thered been any progress blake shook his head still no witnesses dr curts doing the autopsy this afternoon he checked his watch i might head on down there youre welcome to but rebus was shaking his head he had no wish to see his friend dissected will you bring rab fisher in blake nodded dont worry about that ill have a word with him dont expect much in the way of cooperation rebus warned ill talk to him the young mans tone told rebus that he was close to pushing too hard nobody likes to be told how to do their job rebus acknowledged with a smile at least not until after theyve screwed it up blake got to his feet rebus doing the same the two men shook hands nice guy rebus said to siobhan as they walked back to her car too cocky by half she responded he doesnt think hes going to screw anything up ever then hell learn the hard way i hope so i really do the plan had been for them to head back to siobhans flat so she could cook the dinner shed been promising they were quiet in the car and as they got to the junction of leith street and york place the lights were against them rebus turned to her drink first he suggested with me as designated driver you could take a taxi home after pick up the car in the morning she was staring at the red light making up her mind when it turned green she signaled to move into the next lane over heading for queen street ill assume were gracing the ox with our precious custom rebus said would anywhere else suit sirs stringent requirements tell you what well have one drink there and after that you can choose deal so they had their one drink in the smoky front room of the oxford bar the place loud with afterwork chat the late afternoon drifting towards evening ancient egypt on the discovery channel siobhan was watching the regulars more entertaining than anything the tv could provide she noticed that harry the dour barman was smiling he seems unusually chipper she commented to rebus i think young harrys in love rebus was trying to make his pint last siobhan still hadnt intimated whether theyd be sticking around for a second drink shed ordered a half of cider already mostly gone want the other half of that he asked nodding towards her glass one drink you said just to keep me company he held his own glass aloft showing how much was left but she shook her head i know what youre trying to do she told him he attempted a look of shocked innocence knowing it wouldnt fool her for a second a few more regulars were squeezing into the mêlée there were three women seated at a table in the otherwise empty back room but none in the front bar save siobhan she wrinkled her nose at the crush and steady escalation in noise put her glass to her lips and drained it come on then she said where rebus affected a frown but she just shook her head not telling my jackets hanging up he told her hed taken it off in the hope of gaining a psychological advantage a sign of how comfortable he felt here then get it she ordered so he did and gulped down the remains of his own drink before following her outside fresh air she was saying breathing deeply the car was parked on north castle street but they walked past it heading for george street directly ahead of them the castle was illuminated against the inkdark sky they turned left rebus feeling a stiffness in both legs the legacy of his trek across jura long soak for me tonight he commented bet that was the most exercise youve had this year siobhan replied with a smile this decade rebus corrected her shed stopped at some steps and was heading down her chosen bar was tucked away below sidewalk level a shop directly above it the interior was chic with subdued lighting and music your first time in here siobhan asked what do you think he was heading for the bar but siobhan tugged his arm and gestured towards a free booth its table service she said as they sat down a waitress was already standing in front of them siobhan ordered a gin and tonic rebus a laphroaig when his malt arrived he lifted the glass and peered at it as if disapproving of the size of measure siobhan stirred her own drink mashing the slice of lime against the ice cubes want to keep the tab open the waitress asked yes please siobhan said then when the waitress had gone are we any nearer finding out why herdman shot those kids rebus shrugged i think maybe well only know when we get there and everything up to that point is potentially useful rebus said knowing this wasnt how shed have chosen to finish the sentence he lifted his glass to his mouth but it was already empty no sign of the waitress behind the bar one of the staff was mixing a cocktail friday night out at that railway line siobhan was saying silvers told me something she paused he said the herdman case was being handed over to dmc makes sense rebus muttered but with claverhouse and ormiston running the show thered be no place for him or siobhan didnt there used to be a band called dmc or am i thinking of elton johns record company siobhan was nodding run dmc i think they were a rap band rap with a capital c most likely no match for the rolling stones certainly dont knock the stones dc clarke none of the stuff you listen to would exist without them a point on which youve probably had many an argument she went back to stirring her drink rebus still couldnt see their waitress im getting a refill he said sliding out of the booth he wished siobhan hadnt mentioned friday night all weekend andy callis hadnt been far from his thoughts he kept thinking of how different sequences of eventstiny chinks of altered time and spacecould have saved him probably could have saved lee herdman too and stopped robert niles from killing his wife and stopped rebus from scalding his hands everything came down to the most minute contingencies and to tinker with any single one of them was to change the future out of all recognition he knew there was some argument in science something to do with butterflies flapping their wings in the jungle maybe if he flapped his own arms he would end up getting served the barman was pouring a bright pink concoction into a martini glass turning away from rebus to serve it the bar was doublesided dividing the room in half rebus peered across into the gloom not too many customers in the other half a mirror image of booths and squishy chairs same decor and clientele rebus knew that he stood out by about thirty years one young man had ranged himself across an entire banquette arms stretched out behind him legs crossed looking cocksure and relaxed wanting to be seen seen by everyone but rebus the barman was ready to take rebuss order but rebus shook his head walked to the end of the bar and through the short corridor that led to the bars other half across the floor until he was standing in front of peacock johnson mr rebus johnsons arms fell to his sides he glanced to the right and left as if expecting rebus to have reinforcements the dapper detective and no mistake looking for yours truly not especially rebus slid into the space across from johnson the young mans choice of hawaiian shirt didnt look quite so garish in this light a new waitress had appeared and rebus ordered a double on my friends tab he added nodding across the table johnson just shrugged magnanimously and ordered another glass of merlot for himself so this is by way of a pure and actual coincidence he asked wheres your mongrel rebus said looking around the wee evil fellow doesnt quite have the cachet for an establishment of this caliber you tie him up outside johnson grinned i let him off the leash now and again an owner could get fined for that sort of thing he only bites when the peacock gives the order johnson finished the dregs of his wine just as the new drinks arrived the waitress put down a bowl of rice crackers between the two glasses cheers then johnson said hoisting the merlot rebus ignored this i was just thinking of you actually he said the purest of thoughts i dont doubt funnily enough no rebus leaned across the table keeping his voice low in fact if you were a mindreader theyd have scared the shit out of you he had johnsons attention now know who died last friday andy callis you remember him dont you cant say i do he was the armedresponse cop who stopped your friend rab fisher rabs not so much a friend as a casual acquaintance acquainted enough for you to sell him that gun a replica if you dont mind me reminding you johnson was diving into the bowl of snacks holding his paw to his mouth and feeding them in morsel by morsel so that bits flew out as he spoke no case to answer and i resent any implication to the contrary except that fisher was going around scaring people and it nearly got him killed no case to answer johnson repeated and he turned my friend into a nervous wreck and now that friends dead you sold someone a gun and someone else ended up dying a replica perfectly legitimate at this point in time and space johnson was trying not to listen making to grab another fistful of crackers rebus swiped at the hand scattering the bowl and its contents he grabbed the young mans wrist squeezed it hard youre about as legitimate as every other bad bastard ive ever come across johnson was trying to free his hand and youre pure as the driven is that what youre saying everybody knows the lengths youll go to rebus and what lengths are those anything thatll get me i know you tried framing me saying im retooling deactivated guns says who rebus had released his grip says everyone there were flecks of saliva on johnsons chin bits of snack food mixed in with them christ youd have to be deaf in this town not to hear it was true rebus had been putting out feelers hed wanted peacock johnson hed wanted somethingsomethingas repayment for callis leaving the force and though people had shaken their heads and muttered words like replicas and trophies and deactivated rebus had gone on asking and somehow johnson had got to hear of it how long have you known rebus asked now what how long but johnson just picked up his glass eyes beady waiting for rebus to try to knock it from his grasp rebus lifted his own glass drained it in one burning mouthful something you ought to know he said nodding slowly i can hold a grudge for a lifetime just you watch me even though ive done nothing oh youll have done something believe me rebus made to stand i just havent found out what it is yet thats all he winked and turned away heard the table being pushed aside looked around and johnson was on his feet fists clenched lets settle it now he was shouting rebus slipped his hands into his pockets id prefer to wait for the court case if thats all right with you he said no way im sick and tired of this good rebus said he saw siobhan emerging from the corridor looking at him in disbelief probably thought hed gone to the toilet her eyes said it all i cant leave you five damned minutes any trouble here the question coming not from siobhan but from some sort of doorman thicknecked and wearing a tight black suit over a black polo neck he was fitted with an earpiece and microphone his shaven head shone beneath what light there was just a little argument rebus assured him in fact maybe you can settle it name of elton johns old record label the doorman looked nonplussed the barman had his hand raised rebus nodded at him djm the barman said rebus snapped his fingers thats the one chalk up a drink for yourself anything you like he headed for the corridor pointed back towards peacock johnson on that little bastards tab you never talk much about your army days siobhan said bringing two plates in from the kitchen rebus had already been provided with a tray knife and fork condiments were on the floor at his feet he gave a nod of thanks accepting the plate a grilled pork chop with baked potato and corn on the cob this looks great he said lifting his wineglass compliments to the chef i microwaved the potatoes and the corn came out of the freezer rebus put a finger to his lips never give away your secrets a lesson youve taken to heart she blew on a forkful of pork want me to repeat the question thing is siobhan it wasnt a question she thought back and saw that he was right nevertheless she said you want me to answer he watched her nod then took a sip of his wine chilean red shed told him three quid a bottle mind if i eat first you cant eat and talk at the same time bad manners so my mum used to tell me you always listened to your parents always and took their advice as gospel he nodded chewing on some potato skin then how come were talking and eating at the same time rebus washed the mouthful down with more wine okay i give in to answer the question you didnt ask yes she was expecting more but he was concentrating on his food again yes what yes its true i dont talk much about my army days siobhan exhaled noisily id get more chat out of one of the clients down at the morgue she stopped squeezed shut her eyes for a second sorry i shouldnt have said that its okay but rebuss chewing had slowed two of the current clients family member and excolleague strange to think of them lying on adjacent metal trays in the morgues chilled lockers thing about my army days is ive spent years trying to forget them why all sorts of reasons i shouldnt have signed on the dotted line in the first place then i woke up and i was in ulster aiming a rifle at kids armed with molotovs ended up trying for the sas and getting my brain scrambled in the process he gave a shrug thats about all there is to it so why did you join the police he raised the glass to his mouth who else was going to take me he put the tray aside leaned down to pour more wine raised the bottle towards siobhan but she shook her head now you know why theyve never got me to front a recruiting drive she looked at his plate most of the chop was still left you going veggie on me he patted his stomach its great but im not that hungry she thought for a moment its the meat isnt it it hurts your hands when you try to cut it he shook his head im just full thats all but he could see she knew she was right she started eating again while he concentrated on the wine i think youre a lot like lee herdman she said at last a backhanded compliment if ever i heard one people thought they knew him but they didnt there was so much he managed to keep hidden and thats me is it she nodded holding his stare why did you go back to martin fairstones house i get the feeling it wasnt just about me you get the feeling he peered down into his wine seeing his reflection there redhued and wavering i knew hed given you that black eye which gave you an excuse to go talk to him but what was it you really wanted fairstone and johnson were friends i needed some ammo on johnson he paused realizing ammo was not the most subtle choice of word did you get any rebus shook his head fairstone and peacock had had a fallingout fairstone hadnt seen him in weeks why had they fallen out he wouldnt say exactly i got the feeling a woman mightve been involved does peacock have a girlfriend one for every day of the year so maybe it was fairstones girlfriend rebus nodded the blonde from the boatmans what was her name again rachel and theres no good reason we can think of why she was in south queensferry on friday siobhan shook her head but peacock popped up in town too night of the vigil coincidence what else could it be rebus asked wryly he stood up taking the bottle with him you better help me out with this went forwards to pour some wine into her glass then emptied what was left into his own he stayed standing walked over to her window you really think im like lee herdman i dont think either of you ever really managed to leave the past behind he turned to look at her she raised an eyebrow inviting a comeback but he just smiled and turned back to stare out at the night and maybe youre a bit like doug brimson too she went on remember what you said about him what you said he collected people and thats what i do it might explain your interest in andy callis and why it pisses you off to see kate with jack bell he turned slowly to face her arms folded does that make you one of my specimens i dont know what do you reckon i reckon youre tougher than that you better believe it she said with just the hint of a smile when hed called for the taxi hed given arden street as the destination but that had been for siobhans benefit he told the driver thered been a change of plan theyd be making a short stop at the leith police station before heading out to south queensferry at journeys end rebus asked for a receipt thinking he could maybe charge it to the inquiry hed have to be quick though he couldnt see claverhouse giving the nod to a twentyquid taxi ride he walked down the dark vennel pushing open the main door there was no police guard anymore no one checking the comings and goings at lee herdmans address rebus climbed the stairs listening for noise from the other two flats he thought he could hear a tv set certainly he could smell the aftermath of an evening meal a growl from his stomach reminded him that he maybe should have tried to eat more of the pork and hang the pain he took out the key to herdmans flat the one hed picked up at the station in leith it was a shiny brandnew copy of the original and took a bit of maneuvering before it would meet with the tumblers opening the door for him once inside he closed the door behind him and switched on the hall light the place was cold electricity hadnt been disconnected yet but someone had thought to turn off the central heating herdmans widow had been asked if she would come north to empty the flat of its contents but she had declined what could that bastard have that id possibly want a good question and one rebus was here to consider lee herdman assuredly had had something something people had wanted he studied the back of the door bolts top and bottom and two mortise locks as well as the yale the mortises would deter housebreakers but the bolts were for when herdman was at home what had he been so afraid of rebus folded his arms and took a few steps back there was one obvious answer to his question the drugdealing herdman had been afraid of a bust rebus had encountered plenty of dealers over the course of his career usually they lived in highrise public housing apartments and their doors were steelplated offering considerably more resistance than herdmans it seemed to rebus that herdmans security measures were there to buy him a certain amount of time and nothing more time perhaps to flush the evidence but rebus didnt think so there was nothing about the flat to suggest that it had been used at any time as a drug factory besides herdman could boast so many other hiding places the boathouse the boats themselves he had no need to use his flat for storage what then rebus turned and walked into the living room seeking and finding the light switch what then he tried to think of himself as herdman then realized he didnt need to hadnt siobhan hinted as much i think youre a lot like lee herdman he closed his eyes saw the room he was standing in as his own this was his domain he was in charge here but say someone wanted in some uninvited guest he would hear them maybe they would try picking the locks but the bolts would do them in so then theyd have to shoulder the door and hed have time time to fetch the gun from wherever it was hidden the mac was kept in the boathouse in case anyone came there the brocock was kept right here in the wardrobe surrounded by pictures of guns herdmans little gun shrine the pistol would give him the upper hand because he didnt expect the visitors to be armed they might have questions might want to take him away but the brocock would deter them rebus knew who herdman had been expecting maybe not simms and whiteread exactly but people like them people who might want to take him away for questioning questions about jura the helicopter crash the papers fluttering from the trees something herdman had taken from the crash site could one of the kids have stolen it from him maybe at one of his parties but the dead boys hadnt known him hadnt come to his parties only james bell the sole survivor rebus sat down in herdmans armchair his palms resting against its arms shooting the other two in order to scare james so that james would tell all no no no because then why would herdman turn the gun on himself james bell so selfcontained and apparently unperturbable flicking through gun magazines to study the model that had wounded him he too was an interesting specimen rebus rubbed his forehead softly with one gloved hand he felt close to an answer so close he could taste it he stood up again walking into the kitchen and opening the fridge there was food in there an unopened packet of cheese some slices of bacon and a box of eggs dead mans food he thought i cant eat it he went to the bedroom instead not bothering this time with the light enough was spilling through the open doorway who was lee herdman a man whod abandoned career and family to head north starting a oneman enterprise living in a onebedroom flat settling by the coast his boats providing a means of escape whenever necessary no close relationships brimson was about the only friend he seemed to have who was near his own age he coveted teenagers instead because they wouldnt be hiding anything from him because he knew he could deal with them because theyd be impressed by him but not just any kids they had to be outsiders had to be cut from similar cloth it struck rebus that brimson seemed to run a oneman show too and had few ties if any at all spent as much time as he liked at one remove from the world exservices too suddenly rebus heard a tapping he froze trying to place it coming from downstairs no the front door someone was knocking at the door rebus padded back down the hall and put his eye to the peephole recognized the face and opened up evening james he said nice to see you back on your feet it took james bell a moment to place rebus he slowly nodded a greeting looking past his shoulder and down the hall i saw lights on wondered if anyone was here rebus pulled the door open a little wider coming in is it all right theres nobody else here i just thought maybe youre doing a search or something nothing like that rebus gestured with his head and james bell walked in his left arm was in its sling his right hand cradling it a long black woolen crombiestyle coat was draped around his shoulders flapping to show its crimson lining what brings you here i was just walking youre a ways from home though james looked at him youve been to my house maybe you can understand rebus nodded closing the door again putting a bit of distance between your mum and yourself yes james was looking around the hall as if seeing it for the first time and my dad keeping busy is he god knows i dont think i ever got round to asking rebus said what how many times youve been here james shrugged with his right shoulder not that many rebus was leading the way to the living room you still havent said why youre here i thought i had not in so many words i suppose south queensferry seemed as good a place as any for a walk you didnt walk here from barnton though james shook his head i was hopping buses just for the hell of it one of them ended up bringing me here when i saw the lights you wondered who was here who were you expecting to find police i suppose who else would be here he was studying the room actually there was one thing yes a book of mine lee borrowed it and i thought i might retrieve it before everything gets well before the place is emptied good thinking jamess hand went to his injured shoulder bloody thing itches if you can believe that i can believe it james smiled suddenly im at a bit of a disadvantage here i dont think i ever caught your name its rebus detective inspector the young man nodded my dads mentioned you casting me in a flattering light no doubt it was hard to meet the sons eyes without being tricked into seeing the father peering from behind them im afraid he sees incompetence wherever he looks kith and kin not excluded rebus had perched on the arm of the sofa nodding towards the chair but james bell seemed happier on his feet did you ever find the gun rebus asked james seemed puzzled by the question the time i visited rebus explained you had a gun magazine looking for the brocock oh right james nodded to himself there were photos of it in the papers my dads been keeping all the stories thinks he can spearhead a campaign you dont sound altogether approving jamess eyes hardened maybe thats because he broke off because what because ive become useful to him not for what i am but because of what happened his hand went to his shoulder again you can never trust a politician rebus commiserated lee told me something once he said if you outlaw guns the only people who have access to them are the outlaws james smiled at the memory seems he was an outlaw all right two unlicensed guns at the very least did he ever tell you why he felt the need to keep a gun i just thought he was interested in them his background and everything you never got the sense that he was expecting trouble what sort of trouble i dont know rebus conceded youre saying he had enemies ever wonder why he had so many locks on his door james walked to the doorway and looked down the hall i put that down to his background too like when he went to the pub he always sat in the corner facing the door rebus had to smile knowing he did the selfsame thing so he could check whoever came in thats what he told me the two of you sound as if you were pretty close close enough for him to end up shooting me jamess eyes went to his shoulder ever steal anything from him james the young mans brow furrowed why would i do that rebus just shrugged did you though never did lee ever mention anything going missing ever seem agitated to you the young man shook his head i dont really see what youre getting at that paranoia of his i just wondered how far it extended i didnt say he was paranoid the locks the corner seat in the pub that just comes of being careful wouldnt you say maybe rebus paused you liked him didnt you probably more than he liked me rebus was remembering his last meeting with james bell and what siobhan had said afterwards what about teri cotter he asked what about her james had taken a couple of steps back into the room but seemed still restless we think herdman and teri may have been an item so did you know james made to shrug with both shoulders ended up flinching in pain forgot your wound for a moment there eh rebus commented i remember you had a computer in your room ever visited teris website didnt know she had one rebus nodded slowly derek renshaw never mentioned it then derek rebus was still nodding seems derek was a bit of a fan you were often in the common room same time as him and tony jarvies thought they mightve talked about it james was shaking his head looking thoughtful not that i remember he said not to worry then rebus made to stand up this book of yours can i help you look for it book the one youre looking for james smiled at his own stupidity yes sure thatd be great he looked around the cluttered room walked over to the desk hang on a sec he said this is it he held up the paperback for rebus to see whats it about a soldier who went off the rails tried killing his wife then leapt from an airplane you know the story rebus nodded james flicked through the book then tapped it against his thigh reckon ive got what i came for he said anything else you want to take rebus lifted a cd itll probably go into a dumpster to be honest will it his wife doesnt seem interested what a waste rebus held out the cd but james shook his head i couldnt it wouldnt seem right rebus nodded remembering his own reticence in front of the fridge ill leave you to it inspector james tucked the book beneath his arm stretched out his right hand for rebus to shake the coat slipped from his shoulder crumpling to the floor rebus stepped around him and picked it up replacing it thank you james bell said ill see myself out cheers james good luck to you rebus waited in the living room chin resting on one gloved hand as he listened to the front door open and then close james was a long way from home drawn by a light shining in a dead mans house rebus still wondered who the young man had expected to find muffled footsteps descending the stone stairs rebus crossed to the desk and shuffled through the remaining books they all had a military theme but rebus was confident he knew which one the young man had taken the same one siobhan had held up on their first visit to the flat the one from which teri cotters photo had fallen day six tuesday tuesday morning rebus left his flat walked to the foot of marchmont road and proceeded across the meadows an area of parkland leading to the university students passed him some of them on creaky bicycles others shuffled sleepily towards classes the day was overcast the skys color mirroring the slategray roofs rebus was headed for george iv bridge by now he knew the drill at the national library the guard would allow you through but you then had to climb the stairs and persuade the librarian on duty that your need was desperate and no other library would do rebus showed his warrant card explained what he wanted and was directed towards the microfiche room that was the way they kept the old papers nowadays as rolls of microfilm years back working one particular case rebus had taken a seat in the reading room a janitor dutifully unloading a cart of bound broadsheets onto the desk now it was a case of switching on a screen and threading a spool of tape through the machine rebus had no specific dates in mind hed decided to go back a full month before the crash on jura and just let the days roll across his vision see what was happening back then by the time he got to the day of the crash he had a pretty good idea the story had made the front page of the scotsman accompanied by photos of two of the victims brigadier general stuart phillips and major kevin spark a day later phillips being scotsborn the paper ran a lengthy obituary giving rebus more than he needed to know about the mans upbringing and professional accomplishments he checked the notes hed been scribbling and wound the film to its end replacing it with a roll from the previous two weeks eventually spooling back to the date in his notes the story about the ira ceasefire in northern ireland and the part being played in ongoing negotiations by brigadier general stuart phillips preconditions being discussed distrustful paramilitaries on both sides splinter groups to be appeased rebus tapped his pen against his teeth until he noticed another user nearby frowning rebus mouthed the word sorry and cast his eyes over some of the other stories in the paper earth summits foreign wars football reports the face of christ found in a pomegranate a cat that got lost but found its way back to its owners even though theyd moved in the interim the photo of the cat reminded him of boethius he went back to the main desk asked where the encyclopedias were kept he looked up boethius roman philosopher translator politician accused of treason and while awaiting execution wrote the consolations of philosophy in which he argued that everything was changeable and lacked any measure of certainty everything except virtue rebus wondered if the book might help him comprehend derek renshaws fate and its effect on those closest to him somehow he doubted it in his universe the guilty too often went unpunished while the victims went unnoticed bad things were always happening to good people and vice versa if god had planned things that way the old bastard was blessed with a sick sense of humor easier to say that there was no plan that random chance had taken lee herdman into that classroom but rebus suspected that this wasnt true either he decided to head out onto george iv bridge for coffee and a cigarette hed spoken to siobhan first thing by telephone letting her know hed be busy in town and wouldnt be hooking up with her she hadnt sounded too bothered hadnt even seemed curious she seemed to be drifting away from him not that he could blame her hed always been a magnet for trouble and her career prospects wouldnt exactly be enhanced by his proximity all the same he thought there was more to it than that maybe she really did see him as a collector as someone who got too close to certain people people he cared about or was interested in uncomfortably close at times he thought of miss teris website how it maintained an illusion that the viewer was connected to her a oneway relationship they could see her but she couldnt see them was she another example of a specimen seated in the elephant house coffee shop sipping a large milky coffee rebus took out his mobile hed smoked a cigarette on the pavement before coming in never knew these days whether smoking would be allowed indoors or not he punched buttons with his thumbnail connecting to bobby hogans mobile goon squad taken over yet bobby he asked not completely hogan knowing who rebus meant claverhouse and ormiston but theyre in the area pallying up to your girlfriend it took rebus a moment to work it out whiteread he guessed thats the one nothing claverhouse would like more than hearing a few old stories about me might explain the grin on his face exactly how persona non grata do you reckon i am nobodys said whereabouts are you anyway is that an espresso machine i can hear hissing in the background midmorning break guvnor thats all im digging into herdmans time in the regiment you know i fell at the first hurdle dont worry about it bobby i couldnt see the sas handing over his file without a bigger fight than we can put up so how are you managing to look into his army record laterally you might say care to enlighten me further not until ive found something useful john the parameters of the inquiry are shifting in plain english bobby the why doesnt seem to matter so much anymore because the drug angles a lot more interesting rebus guessed are you shutting me down bobby not my style john you know that what im saying is it may be out of my hands and claverhouse isnt running my fan club hes not even on the mailing list rebus was thoughtful hogan filled the silence way things are going i might as well join you for that coffee youre being sidelined from referee to fourth official rebus had to smile at the image claverhouse as ref ormiston and whiteread his linesmen any other news he asked herdmans boat the one with the dope on it seems that when he purchased it he paid the bulk in cashdollars to be precise the international currency of illegal substances more than a few trips to rotterdam this past year most he tried to keep hidden looks good doesnt it claverhouse is wondering if there might be a porn angle too the mans mind is a sewer he may have a point plenty of hard core to be found in places like rotterdam thing is our friend herdman seems to have been a bit of a lad rebuss eyes narrowed defined as we took his computer from home remember rebus remembered it had already gone by the time hed made his first visit to herdmans flat the lab guys at howdenhall were able to pinpoint sites hed been using a lot of them were aimed at peepers you mean voyeurs thats what i mean mr herdman liked to watch and how about this some of the sites are registered in the netherlands herdman paid his dues every month by credit card rebus was staring out of the window it had started to rain a softly angled drizzle people were lowering their heads walking faster ever heard of a porn baron paying to watch the stuff bobby first time for everything its a nonstarter trust me rebus paused eyes narrowing youve looked at these sites dutybound to study the evidence john describe them you after a cheap thrill for those i go to frank zappa humor me bobby a girl sits on a bed shes wearing stockings suspenders all that sort of stuff then you type in whatever it is you want her to do do we know what herdman liked them to do afraid not apparently theres only so much the lab guys can extract you got a list of the sites bobby rebus was forced to listen to a low chuckle on the line im just hazarding a guess here but was there one called miss teris or dark entry silence at the other end and then how did you know i was a mindreader in a previous life i mean it john how did you know see i knew you were going to ask that rebus decided to put hogan out of his misery miss teri is teri cotter shes a pupil at port edgar and doing porn on the side her sites not porn bobby rebus broke off but too late youve seen it a webcam in her room rebus admitted seems to run twentyfour hours a day he winced realizing again that hed said too much and how long have you spent watching it just so you could be sure im not certain its got anything to do with hogan ignored him i need to go to claverhouse with this no you dont john if herdman was obsessed with this girl if youre going to interview her i want to be there i dont think you i gave you this bobby rebus looked around realizing his voice had risen he was seated at a communal counter beside the window he caught two young women office workers on a break just as they averted their eyes how long had they been eavesdropping rebus lowered his voice i need to be there promise me that bobby hogans voice softened a little for what its worth i promise doesnt mean claverhouse will be so accommodating sure you have to go to him with this what do you mean the two of us bobby we could talk to her thats not how i work john the tone stiffening again i suppose not bobby rebus had a thought is siobhan there i thought shed be with you no matter youll let me know about that interview yes the word dissolving into a sigh cheers bobby i owe you rebus ended the call and walked away from what was left of his coffee outside he lit another cigarette the office girls were in a huddle cupping hands to their mouths maybe in case he could lipread they tried not to make eye contact with him he blew smoke at the window and headed back to the library siobhan had got to st leonards early done some work in the gym and then headed to the cid suite there was a large walkin closet where old case notes were stored but when she examined the spines of the brown cardboard document boxes she realized one was missing in its place was a slip of paper martin fairstone removed by order gill templers signature stood to reason fairstones death was no accident a murder investigation was being instigated linked to an internal inquiry templer would have removed the file so it could be passed on to whoever needed it siobhan closed the door again and locked it then went into the corridor and listened at gill templers door nothing but the distant trill of a telephone she looked up and down the hall there were bodies in the cid suite dc davie hynds and hiho silvers hynds was still too new to query anything she might do but if silvers spotted her she took a deep breath knocked and waited then turned the handle and pushed the door wasnt locked she closed it behind her and tiptoed across her bosss office there was nothing on the desk itself and the drawers werent big enough she stared at the green fourdrawer filing cabinet in for a penny she told herself sliding open the top compartment there was nothing inside plenty of paperwork in the other three but not what she was looking for she exhaled noisily and took another look around who was she kidding there were no hiding places here it was as utilitarian a space as was feasible once upon a time templer had nurtured a couple of plants on the windowsill but even those had gone either killed by neglect or thrown away during a sortout templers predecessor had lined his desk with framed photos of his extended family but there was nothing here even to identify the occupant as a woman confident that she hadnt missed anything siobhan opened the door only to find a frowning man standing there the very person i wanted to see he said i was just siobhan glanced back into the room as if seeking a believable end to the sentence shed started dcs templers in a meeting the man explained id gathered as much siobhan said regaining control of her voice she clicked the door shut by the way the man was saying my names mullen siobhan straightened her back bringing her to within a few inches of his height of course mullen said displaying the thinnest of smiles you were di rebuss driver the day i managed to run him to ground and now you want to ask me about martin fairstone siobhan guessed thats right he paused always supposing you can spare me a few minutes siobhan shrugged and smiled as if to say that she could think of nothing more pleasant if youll follow me then mullen said as they passed the open door of the cid suite siobhan glanced in and saw that silvers and hynds were standing side by side both were holding their neckties above their heads necks twisted as though they were swinging from a noose the last they saw of their victim was her raised middle finger as it disappeared from view she followed the complaints officer as he descended the staircase and just before reaching the reception area unlocked the door to interview room i assume you had a good reason to be in dcs templers office he said sliding out of his suit jacket and placing it over the back of one of the rooms two chairs siobhan sat down watching him as he took his seat opposite the chipped and inkstained desk between them mullen leaned down and lifted a cardboard box from the floor yes i had she said watching him prize open the lid the first thing she saw was a photo of martin fairstone taken shortly after his arrest mullen took the picture out and held it in front of her she couldnt help noticing that his nails were immaculate do you think this man deserved to die ive no real opinion she said this is just between us you understand mullen lowered the photo a little so that the top half of his face appeared above it no taping no third parties all very discreet and informal is that why you took your jacket off trying for informality he chose not to answer ill ask you again ds clarke did this man deserve his fate if youre asking me if i wanted him dead the answer is no ive come across plenty of scumbags worse than martin fairstone youd class him as what then a minor irritation i wouldnt bother classifying him at all he died horribly you know waking up to those flames and the choking smoke trying to wrestle his way free from the chair not the way id choose to leave this life id guess not they locked eyes and siobhan knew that any moment now he would get to his feet start walking around trying to unnerve her she beat him to it her chair scraping the floor as she rose arms folded she walked to the farthest wall so that her interrogator had to turn around to see her you look like you might make the grade ds clarke mullen said inspector within five years maybe chief inspector before youre forty that gives you a whole ten years to catch up on dcs templer he paused for effect all of that waiting for you if you manage to steer clear of trouble i like to think ive got a pretty good navigation system i hope for your sake that youre right di rebus on the other hand well whatever compass he uses seems to point unerringly towards grief wouldnt you say ive no real opinion then its time you did a career like the one you seem destined for you need to choose your friends with care siobhan paced to the other end of the room turning when she reached the door there must be plenty of candidates out there whod want fairstone dead hopefully the inquiry will turn up lots of them mullen said with a shrug but meantime in the meantime you want to give di rebus a goingover mullen studied her why dont you sit down do i make you nervous she leaned down over him knuckles resting against the edge of the desk is that what youve been trying to do i was beginning to wonder she held his stare then relented and sat down tell me he said quietly when you first found out that di rebus had visited martin fairstone on the night he died what were your thoughts she offered a shrug nothing more one theory the voice intoned is that someone could have been trying to give fairstone a fright it just went wrong thats all could be that di rebus tried to get back into the house to save the man his voice trailed away we had a call from a doctor a psychologist name of irene lesser she had dealings recently with di rebus on another matter she was thinking of making a complaint actually something to do with a breach of patient confidentiality at the end of her call she offered the opinion that john rebus is a haunted man mullen leaned forwards would you say he was haunted ds clarke he lets his cases get to him sometimes siobhan conceded i dont know if thats the same thing i think dr lesser meant that he has trouble living in the present that theres a rage in him something bottled up from years back i dont see where martin fairstone fits in dont you mullen smiled ruefully do you consider di rebus a friend someone you spend time with outside work yes how much time some is he the kind of friend youd take problems to maybe but martin fairstone wasnt a problem no not to you at any rate mullen let the silence lie between them then leaned back in his chair do you ever feel the need to protect rebus ds clarke no but youve been driving him around while his hands mend not the same thing has he offered a believable explanation of how he managed to burn them in the first place he put them in water that was too hot for them i specified believable i believe it you dont think it would be entirely in his nature for him to see you with a black eye put two and two together and go out hunting for fairstone they sat in a pub together i havent heard anyone saying they were having a fight not in public perhaps but once di rebus had inveigled an invite back to the house in the privacy of that place siobhan was shaking her head thats not what happened id love to have your confidence ds clarke would that mean swapping it for your smug arrogance mullen seemed to consider this then he smiled and placed the photograph back in its box i think thats all for now siobhan made no motion to leave unless theres something else mullens eyes glinted actually there is she nodded towards the box the reason i was in dcs templers office mullen looked at the box too oh sounding interested its nothing to do with fairstone really its the port edgar inquiry she decided she had nothing to lose by telling him fairstones girlfriend shes been seen in south queensferry siobhan gave a surreptitious swallow before uttering her little white lie di hogan wants her for interview but i couldnt remember her address and its in here mullen patted the box considered for a moment and then prized open the lid again cant see the harm he said pushing it towards her the blondes name was rachel fox and she worked in a supermarket at the foot of leith walk siobhan drove down there past the uninviting bars secondhand shops and tattoo parlors leith it seemed to her was always on the verge of some renaissance or other when the warehouses were turned into loftstyle apartments or a cinema complex opened or the queens superannuated yacht was berthed there for tourists to visit there was always talk of the ports rejuvenation but to her mind the place never really changed same old leith same old leithers shed never felt apprehensive there even at the dead of night when knocking on the doors of brothels and drug dens but it could seem a spiritless place too where a smile might mark you as an outsider there were no spaces in the supermarket car park so she did a circuit eventually noting that a woman was loading her trunk with grocery bags siobhan waited engine idling the woman was shouting at a sobbing fiveyearold two lines of light green mucus connected the boys nostrils to his top lip his shoulders were slumped hiccuping with each sob he was dressed in a puffy silver le coq sportif jacket two sizes too big for him so that he appeared to have no hands when he began to wipe his nose on one sleeve his mother erupted shaking him watching siobhan realized that her fingers were gripping the door handle but she didnt get out of the car knew her interference wouldnt make things any better for the child and the woman wasnt suddenly going to see the error of her ways just because a complete stranger bothered to give her a chewingout the trunk was being closed the child pushed into the car as the woman walked around to the drivers side she looked at siobhan and shrugged in what she thought was a sharing of her burden you know what its like the shrug seemed to say siobhan just glared the futility of the gesture lingering as she parked grabbed a cart and wheeled it into the store what was she doing here anyway was she here because of fairstone or the notes or because rachel fox had turned up at the boatmans maybe all three fox was a checkout assistant so siobhan scanned the row of registers and saw her almost immediately she was wearing the same blue uniform as the other women and had piled her hair atop her head a ringlet hanging down over either ear she had a vacant look on her face as she slid item after item over the barcode reader the sign above her register read nine items or less siobhan made her way down the first aisle couldnt find anything she needed she didnt want to wait in the queues at the fish and meat counters it would be just her luck if fox took a break or skipped out early two bars of chocolate went into the cart followed by a kitchen towel and a can of scotch broth four items at the top of the next aisle she made sure fox was still working the checkout she was and three pensioners were waiting their turn to pay siobhan added a tube of tomato puree to her provisions a woman in an electric wheelchair whizzed past her husband toiling to keep up she kept yelling instructions to him toothpaste the pump mind not the tube and did you remember the cucumber his sudden wince told siobhan that he had in fact forgotten the cucumber and would need to go back the other shoppers seemed to be moving at halfspeed as if trying to make the activity last longer than was strictly necessary theyd probably end the trip with a visit to the instore cafétea and a slice of cake the cake to be chewed slowly the tea sipped and then home to the afternoon cooking shows a bag of pasta six items only one pensioner was now waiting at the express lane siobhan fell in behind him he said hello to fox who managed a tired hiya cutting off any further conversation grand day the man said his mouth seemed to be lacking the necessary dental plates tongue protruding wetly fox just gave a nod concentrating on processing his purchases as speedily as possible looking down at the conveyor belt two things struck siobhan the first was that the gentleman had twelve items the second that like him she should have bought some eggs eighteighty fox said the mans hand withdrew slowly from his pocket counting out coins he frowned and counted again fox held out her hand and took the money from him fifty pence short she informed him eh youre fifty pence short youll have to put something back here take this siobhan said adding another coin to the collection the man looked at her gave a toothless grin and a bow of his head then he lifted his bag and shuffled towards the exit rachel fox began dealing with her new customer youre thinking poor old soul she said without looking up but he tries pulling that one every week or so more fool me then siobhan said it was worth it just to stop him doing another slowmotion recount fox glanced up then back to the conveyor belt then up again i know you from somewhere been sending me any letters rachel foxs hand froze on the pasta how dyou know my name its on your badge for one thing but fox knew now her eyes were heavily made up she narrowed them as she stared at siobhan youre that cop tried to get marty put away i gave evidence at his trial siobhan conceded yeah i remember you got one of your pals to torch him too dont believe everything the tabloids tell you rachel you were giving him hassle werent you no he talked about you said you had it in for him i can assure you i didnt then how come hes dead the last of siobhans six items had gone through and she was holding out a tenpound note the cashier at the next register had stopped serving and like her customer was now listening in can i talk to you someplace rachel siobhan looked around somewhere more private but foxs eyes were filling with tears suddenly she reminded siobhan of the kid outside in some ways she thought we just dont grow up emotionally we never grow up rachel she said but fox had opened the register to give siobhan her change she was shaking her head slowly got nothing to say to you lot what about the notes ive been getting rachel can you tell me about the notes i dont know what youre talking about the sound of a motor told siobhan that the woman in the wheelchair was right behind her no doubt there were exactly nine items in her husbands cart siobhan turned and saw that the woman was cradling a hand basket with what looked like another nine items inside the woman was glowering at siobhan wishing her gone i saw you in the boatmans siobhan told rachel fox what were you doing there where the boatmans south queensferry fox handed over siobhans change and receipt gave a loud sniff thats where rod works hes a friend is he hes my brother rachel fox said when she looked up at siobhan the water in her eyes had been replaced by fire does that mean youre going to want him killed too eh does it maybe well try another register davie the woman in the wheelchair told her husband she was backing away as siobhan snatched her shopping bag and headed for the exit rachel foxs voice following her all the way out murdering bitch what had he ever done to you murderer murderer she dumped the bag on the passenger seat got in behind the steering wheel nothing but a slut rachel fox was walking towards the car couldnt get a man if you tried siobhan turned the ignition backed out of the space as fox aimed a kick at the driversside headlight she was wearing sneakers and her foot glanced off the glass siobhan was craning her neck around making sure she didnt hit anyone behind her when she turned fox was wrestling with a line of parked carts siobhan moved the car forwards pushing the accelerator hard hearing the clatter of the carts as they just missed her looked in the rearview and saw them blocking the road behind her their leader bumping against a parked vw beetle and rachel fox still snarling shaking both fists then pointing a finger in the direction of the disappearing car drawing the same finger across her throat nodding slowly to let siobhan know she meant it right you are rachel siobhan muttered turning out of the car park it had taken all of bobby hogans powers of persuasionsomething he wasnt going to let rebus forget the look he gave said it all number one you owe me number two dont screw this up they were in one of the offices at the big house lothian and borders police hq on fettes avenue this was the home of drugs and major crime and as such rebus was here on sufferance rebus didnt know quite how hogan had persuaded claverhouse to let him sit in on the interview but here they were ormiston was present too snuffling and screwing his eyes shut tight whenever he blinked teri cotter had come accompanied by her father and a female police constable was seated nearby sure you want your father present claverhouse asked matteroffactly teri looked at him she was in full goth camouflage down to kneelength boots with multiple shiny buckles way you make it sound mr cotter said maybe i shouldve brought my solicitor too claverhouse just shrugged i merely asked because i dont want teri getting embarrassed in front of you he let his voice trail off eyes fixing on teris embarrassed mr cotter echoed looking in his daughters direction so that he missed it when claverhouse made a gesture with his fingers as if typing on a keyboard but teri saw it and knew what it meant dad she said maybe itd be better if you waited outside im not sure i dad she laid her hand on his its fine ill explain later honest i will her eyes boring into his well i dont know cotter looked around the room itll be fine sir claverhouse was reassuring him leaning back in his chair and crossing one leg over the other nothing to worry about just some background info we think teri can help us with he nodded towards ormiston ds ormiston can show you to the cafeteria get yourself a cup of something and well be finished here before you know it ormiston looked unhappy eyes flickering towards rebus and hogan as if asking his partner why one of them couldnt go in his place cotter was studying his daughter again i dont like leaving you here but his words had a defeated sound to them and rebus wondered if the man had ever stood up to either teri or his wife a man happiest with rows of numbers stock market movementsthings he felt he could predict and control maybe the car smash the death of his son had robbed him of selfbelief showing him up as powerless and puny in the face of random chance he was already rising to his feet ormiston meeting him at the door the two men exiting rebus thought suddenly of allan renshaw of the effect losing a son could have on a father claverhouse beamed a smile at teri cotter who responded by folding her arms defensively you know what this is about teri do i claverhouse repeated the typing motion with his fingers you know what that means though why dont you tell me it means youve got a website miss teri it means people can watch your bedroom any hour of the day or night di rebus here seems to be one of your fans claverhouse nodded in rebuss direction lee herdman was another claverhouse paused studying her face you dont seem very surprised she offered a shrug mr herdman had a bit of a voyeur thing going claverhouse glanced towards rebus as if wondering whether he might fit this category too quite a lot of sites he liked to go to most of them he had to use his credit card so so youre giving it away for free teri im not like those sites she spat then what sort of site are you she seemed about to say something but bit it back you like being watched claverhouse guessed and herdman liked to watch seems the two of you were pretty compatible hed screwed me a few times if thats what you mean she said coldly i might not have used quite those words teri rebus said theres a computer lee bought were having trouble tracing it is that because its sitting in your bedroom maybe he bought it for you set it up for you did he showed you how to design a site set up the webcam why are you asking me if you already know her voice had taken on an edge of petulance what did your parents say she looked at him ive got money of my own they thought youd paid for it they didnt know about you and lee she gave him a look that confirmed how stupid his questions were he liked watching you claverhouse stated wanted to know where you were what you were doing thats why you set up the site she was shaking her head dark entry is for anyone who cares to look was that his idea or yours hogan asked she gave a shrill laugh am i supposed to be red riding hood is that it with lee as the big bad wolf she took a breath lee gave me the computer said maybe we could keep in touch by webcam dark entry was my idea no one elses just mine she pointed a finger at herself finding a piece of bare flesh between her breasts her black lace top was lowcut her finger went to the diamond hanging from its gold chain and she played with it absentmindedly did he give you that too rebus asked she peered down at the chain nodded folded her arms again teri rebus said quietly did you know who else was accessing your site she shook her head being anonymous is part of the fun you were hardly anonymous there was plenty of information to tell people who you were she considered this and shrugged anyone from your school know about it rebus asked another shrug ill tell you one person who did know derek renshaw her eyes widened mouth opening into an o and derek probably told his good friend anthony jarvies rebus went on claverhouse had straightened in his seat holding up a hand wait a minute he looked towards hogan who offered a shrug then back to rebus this is the first im hearing about this teris site was bookmarked on dereks computer rebus explained and the other kid knew too the one herdman killed rebus shrugged id say its likely claverhouse bounded to his feet rubbing at his jaw teri he asked was lee herdman the jealous type i dont know he knew about your site im assuming you told him he was standing over her yes she said how did he feel about that i mean about the fact that anyoneanyonecould watch you in your bedroom of a night her voice dropped to a whisper you think thats why he shot them claverhouse leaned down over her so his face was inches from hers how does it look to you teri do you think its possible he didnt wait for her reply wheeled away on one heel and clapped his hands together rebus knew what he was thinking he was thinking that he personally detective inspector charlie claverhouse had just cracked the case on his first day in charge and he was wondering how soon he could go trumpeting his triumph to his senior officers he went to the door and threw it open looking up and down the corridor disappointed to find it empty rebus took the opportunity to rise from his own chair and place himself in claverhouses teri was staring into her lap one finger running up and down the chain again teri he said quietly to get her attention she looked at him eyes redrimmed behind the liner and mascara you okay she nodded slowly sure of that anything i can fetch you im fine he nodded as if trying to convince himself hogan had shifted places too and was now standing next to claverhouse in the doorway one calming hand on his shoulder rebus couldnt make out what they were saying wasnt really interested i cant believe that bastard was watching me who lee derek renshaw she spat he as good as killed my brother her voice was rising rebus lowered his even further when he spoke as far as i can see he was in the car with your brother but that doesnt mean he was responsible unbidden an image of dereks father flashed into rebuss head a kid abandoned at the edge of the sidewalk gripping a newly bought football for dear life while the dizzying world spun past you really think lee would walk into a school and kill two people because he was jealous she thought about this then shook her head me neither rebus said she looked at him for one thing he went on how could he have known doesnt look like he knew either of the victims so how would he have been able to pick them out he watched her take this in shootings a bit excessive wouldnt you say and in such a public place hed have tove been mad with jealousy out of his mind with it so what did happen she asked rebus looked towards the doorway ormiston had returned from the cafeteria and was now being hugged by claverhouse whod probably have lifted the larger man off his feet if hed been able rebus caught a hissed we did it followed by a cautious muttering from hogan im still not sure rebus said answering teris question its a pretty good motive which is why youve made di claverhouse a happy man you dont like him do you a smile flitted across her face dont worry the feelings entirely mutual when you clicked on dark entry she lowered her eyes again was i doing anything in particular rebus shook his head the room was empty didnt want her to know hed watched her sleeping mind if i ask you something he looked towards the doorway again checking that no one was listening doug brimson says hes a family friend but i get the feeling hes not at the top of your hit parade her face sagged my mums having an affair with him she said dismissively you sure she nodded not making eye contact does your dad know now she did look up horrorstruck he doesnt need to know does he rebus considered this suppose not he decided how did you find out womans intuition she said with no trace of irony rebus sat back deep in thought he was thinking about teri and lee herdman and dark entry wondering if any or all of it was a way of getting back at the mother teri youre sure youd no way of knowing who was watching you on the webcam none of the other kids at school ever hinted she shook her head i get messages in my guest book but never from anyone i know are any of those messages ever i dont know off the wall thats the way i like them she angled her head slightly trying for the persona of miss teri but too late rebus had seen her as plain teri cotter and that was who shed remain he stretched his own neck and back tell you who i saw last night he said chattily who james bell so inspecting her black gloss fingernails so i was wondering that photo of you do you remember you palmed it that day we were in the pub on cockburn street it belonged to me im not saying it didnt i also seem to recall that as you lifted it you were telling me how james used to turn up at lees parties does he say he didnt on the contrary the two of them seem to have known each other pretty well wouldnt you say the three detectivesclaverhouse hogan and ormistonwere coming back into the room ormiston was patting claverhouses back and with it his ego he liked lee teri was saying no doubt about that but was it mutual her eyes narrowed james bell he could have pointed renshaw and jarvies out to lee couldnt he wouldnt explain why lee then shot him too thing is rebus knew he had seconds before the interview was wrenched away from him again that photo of you you said it was taken on cockburn street what im wondering is who took it she seemed to be looking for the purpose behind the question claverhouse was standing in front of them clicking his fingers to let rebus know it was time to relinquish the chair rebus kept his eyes on teri as he rose slowly to his feet james bell he asked her was that who it was and she nodded unable to think of any reason not to tell him he came to see you in cockburn street he was taking shots of all of usa school project whats this claverhouse said bouncing down on to the chair with a grin he was asking me about james bell teri told claverhouse matteroffactly oh aye what about him nothing she said sending a wink towards the retreating rebus claverhouse twitched turned in his seat but rebus offered nothing more than a smile and a shrug when claverhouse turned away again rebus made a downstroke in the air with his forefinger letting teri know he owed her one he knew what claverhouse would have done with the information james bell lends lee herdman a book not realizing theres a photo of teri inside maybe being used as a bookmark herdman finds it and feels jealous it gave him a reason to wound james not a gross enough infringement to merit killing him and besides james was a friend as it was claverhouse would be wrapping up the inquiry today straight to the assistant chief constables office to ask for his gold star the portakabin at port edgar academy would be emptied officers returned to their normal duties rebus back under suspension and yet none of it really added up rebus knew that now knew too that something was staring him in the face then he looked at teri cotter playing with her chain again and he knew exactly what it was porn and drugs werent rotterdams only businesses rebus reached siobhan in her car where are you he asked the a heading for south queensferry what about you sitting at a red light on queensferry road driving and using your phone the hands must be healing getting there whatve you been up to fairstones girlfriend any joy of a sort what about you sitting in on an interview with teri cotter claverhouse thinks hes found his motive oh yes herdman was jealous because the two kids were logging on to teris site and james bell just happened to get in the way im sure thats how claverhouse will see it so what now everything shuts down and whiteread and simms youre right they wont like it he watched the light in front of him turn green because theyll go away emptyhanded yes rebus thought for a moment holding the phone between jaw and shoulder as he changed up through the gears then so whats waiting for you in queensferry the barman at the boatmans hes foxs brother fox fairstones girlfriend explaining why she was in the bar yes so youve talked to her we exchanged a few pleasantries did she say anything about peacock johnson whether his fallingout with fairstone had anything to do with her i forgot to ask you forgot things got a bit fraught i thought maybe id ask her brother instead you reckon hed know if she had a thing going with peacock dont know till i ask why dont we hook up i was planning a trip to the marina you want to go there first then we can end the day with a wellearned drink ill see you at the boatyard then she ended the call and came off the highway at the last offramp before the forth road bridge drove down the hill into south queensferry and turned left on shore road her phone trilled again change of plan she asked into the mouthpiece not until weve got a plan to change which is the very reason im calling she recognized the voice doug brimson sorry i thought you were someone else what can i do for you i was just wondering if youre ready to take to the skies again she smiled to herself maybe i am great how about tomorrow she considered for a moment i could probably sneak out for an hour late afternoon just before the sun goes down okay and youll take the controls this time i think i could be persuaded great how does sixteen hundred hours sound it sounds like four in the afternoon he laughed ill see you then siobhan goodbye doug she placed the phone back on the passenger seat staring at the sky through her windshield imagined herself flying a plane imagined having a panic attack in the middle of it but she didnt think shed panic besides doug brimson would be there with her no need for her to worry she parked outside the marinas cafeteria went in and reappeared with a mars bar she was throwing out the wrapper when rebuss saab arrived he passed her and stopped at the far end of the car park fifty yards closer to herdmans shed by the time hed got out and locked his door shed caught up with him so what are we doing here she asked swallowing the last cloying mouthful apart from ruining our teeth he said i want one last look at the shed why just because the doors to the boathouse were closed but not locked rebus slid them open simms was crouching on the deck of the parked dinghy he looked up at the interruption rebus nodded towards the crowbar in his hand taking the place apart he guessed never know what youll find simms said our record in that department is rather better than yours after all hearing the voices whiteread had emerged from the office she was holding a sheaf of papers all getting a bit frantic isnt it rebus said walking towards her claverhouse is getting ready to call it a day and thats not what youd call music to the ears is it whiteread managed a thin cold smile rebus wondered what it would take to faze her thought he had a pretty good idea i assume it was you who put that journalist on to us she said he wanted to ask about a helicopter crash on jura which got me wondering do tell rebus said i had an interesting chat this morning she drawled with a man named douglas brimson seems the three of you took a little trip together her eyes flitted towards siobhan did we rebus said hed stopped walking but whiteread hadnt not until her face was inches from his he took you to jura from there you went looking for a crash site she was studying his face for any sign of weakness rebuss eyes flickered in siobhans direction bastard didnt need to tell them a red tint had appeared on her cheeks did we was all rebus could think to say whiteread had risen on her toes so her face was level with his the thing is di rebus how could you possibly have known about that about what only way you could have known was if you had access to confidential files is that right rebus watched simms climb down from the boat still holding the crowbar he gave a shrug well if these files youre talking about are confidential i cant have seen them can i not without a spot of breaking and entering whiteread turned her attention to siobhan not to mention photocopying she angled her head pretending to examine the younger womans face caught a touch of the sun ds clarke only your cheeks seem to be burning siobhan didnt move didnt say anything cat got your tongue simms was smirking enjoying the detectives discomfort i hear tell rebus said to him youre scared of the dark eh simms frowned explains why you like to keep your door ajar rebus gave a wink then turned back to whiteread i dont think youre going anywhere with this not unless you want everyone on the inquiry knowing why youre really here from what i hear youre already on suspension could be facing a murder charge anytime soon whitereads eyes were dark points of light added to which the psychologist at carbrae says you went behind her back looked up records without permission she paused seems to me youre already shoulderdeep in shit rebus i cant think why youd want more trouble than youve already got yet here you are ready and willing to pick a fight with me let me try to get through to you she leaned forwards so her lips were an inch from his ear youve not got a prayer she said quietly she pulled back slowly ready to measure his response rebus had one gloved hand held up she wasnt sure what the gesture meant a frown furrowed her brow and then she saw what he was holding between thumb and middle finger saw it glint and sparkle in the light a single diamond what the hell simms muttered rebus closed his hand around the diamond finders keepers he said turning starting to walk away siobhan fell into step with him waited till they were back outdoors before she spoke what was all that about just a fishing expedition but what does it mean where did the diamond come from rebus smiled friend of mine he runs a jewelers shop on queensferry street and i persuaded him to let me borrow it rebus was tucking the diamond back into his pocket thing is they dont know that but youre going to explain it to me right rebus nodded slowly just as soon as i find out what ive caught with my hook john half warning half pleading we going for that drink now rebus asked she didnt reply tried staring him down as they walked back to his car she was still staring as he unlocked his door and got in he started the engine put it in gear then rolled down his window ill see you there then was all he said making to drive off siobhan stood her ground but he just gave her a wave cursing silently she started stalking towards her own car rebus was seated at a window table in the boatmans checking a text message from steve holly wot u got me mite av refresh chip pan story if u dont help rebus debated whether to reply or not then started pressing keys jura crash herdman there took sth army want back u could ask whiteread again he wasnt sure that holly would understand rebus not having worked out how to add punctuation or capitals to his text messages but it would keep the reporter busy and if he did end up confronting whiteread and simms so much the better let them think the world was closing in on them rebus picked up his halfpint and made a little toast to himself with it just as siobhan arrived hed been debating whether to pass on teris news brimson and her mum thing was if he told her she probably couldnt keep it to herself next time she met brimson hed see it in her face the way she spoke to him a reluctance to meet his eyes rebus didnt want that couldnt see it doing anyone any good not at this juncture siobhan slung her bag onto the table and looked towards the bar where a woman shed never seen before was pulling pints dont worry rebus said i had a word mcallisters shift starts in a few minutes just long enough for you to enlighten me then she slipped off her coat rebus was rising to his feet let me get you a drink first whatll it be lime and soda nothing stronger she frowned at his nearempty glass some of us are driving dont worry im only having the one he made his way to the bar came back with two drinks lime and soda for her cola for him see he said i can be all smug and virtuous too when i want to be better that than drunk at the wheel she lifted the straw from her glass and deposited it in the ashtray sat back and placed her hands on her thighs right then im ready if you are at which the door creaked open speak of the devil rebus said as rod mcallister walked in mcallister saw that he was being stared at when he looked rebus beckoned him over mcallister was unzipping a scuffed leather jacket he pulled the black scarf from around his neck and stuffed it into a pocket ive got to start work he said when rebus patted an empty stool thisll only take a minute rebus offered with a smile susie wont mind he nodded towards the barmaid mcallister hesitated then sat down elbows pressing against his thin legs hands cupped below his chin rebus mimicked the posture its about lee then mcallister guessed not strictly speaking rebus said then he glanced towards siobhan we may come back to that she told the barman but right now were more interested in your sister he looked from siobhan to rebus and then back again which one rachel fox funny youve got different surnames we havent mcallisters eyes were still shifting between the two detectives unable to decide whom he should be addressing siobhan answered with a click of her fingers he focused on her narrowed his eyes slightly she changed her name a while back trying to get into modeling whats she got to do with you lot you dont know he shrugged marty fairstone siobhan prompted dont tell me she never introduced you yeah i knew marty i was gutted when i heard what about a fellow named johnson rebus asked his nicknames peacock friend of martys yeah ever come across him mcallister seemed to be thinking not sure he said at last peacock and rachel siobhan began angling her head to catch his attention again we think they mightve had a thing going oh aye mcallister raised an eyebrow thats news to me she never mentioned him no the pair of them have been hanging about town plenty of people hanging about recently take you two for example he sat back stretching his spine glancing at the clock above the bar dont want to get in susies bad books rumor is fairstone and johnson had a fallingout maybe over rachel oh aye if youre finding the questions too awkward mr mcallister rebus said feel free to say siobhan was staring at mcallisters tshirt revealed now that he wasnt slouched forwards anymore it showed an album cover an album she knew mogwai fan eh rod anything thats loud mcallister examined his shirt its their rock action album isnt it thats the one mcallister made to stand up turning towards the bar siobhan locked eyes with rebus and nodded slowly rod she said that first time we met you remember i gave you my card mcallister nodded walking away from her but siobhan was on her feet following him her voice rising it had the st leonards address on it didnt it rod and when you saw my name you knew who i was didnt you because marty had mentioned me or maybe it was rachel you remember that mogwai album rod the one before rock action mcallister had lifted the hatch so he could move behind the bar he slammed it shut after him the barmaid was staring at him siobhan lifted the hatch hoi staff only susie said but siobhan wasnt listening was hardly aware that rebus had risen from his chair and was approaching the bar she grabbed mcallister by the sleeve of his jacket he tried to shake her off but she turned him to face her remember what it was called rod it was come on die young cody rod same letters as on your second note get the fuck off me he yelled whatever it is between you susie was saying take it outside its a serious offense rod sending threats like that let go of me you bitch he jerked his arm free then swung it catching her on the side of her face she crashed into the shelves sending bottles flying rebus had reached over the bar and grabbed mcallister by his hair pulling his head down until it connected hard with the slop tray mcallisters arms were thrashing his voice a wordless bellow but rebus wasnt about to let go any cuffs he asked siobhan she stumbled from behind the bar glass crunching underfoot ran to her bag emptying its contents onto the table until she found the handcuffs mcallister caught her a couple of good ones to the shins with the heels of his cowboy boots but she squeezed the cuffs tight knowing theyd hold she moved away from him feeling dizzy not knowing if it was a concussion adrenaline or the fumes from half a dozen smashed liquor bottles call it in rebus hissed still not letting go of his prisoner a night in the cells wont do this bastard any harm at all here you cant do that susie complained whos going to cover his shift not our problem love rebus told her offering what he hoped might be taken for an apologetic smile theyd taken mcallister to st leonards booked him into the only empty cell left rebus had asked siobhan if theyd be charging him formally shed shrugged i doubt hell be sending any more notes one side of her face was still raw from where hed connected but it didnt look like it would bruise in the car park they went their separate ways siobhans parting words what about that diamond rebus waving to her as he drove off he made for arden street ignoring the ringing of his mobile siobhan wanting to put that question to him again he couldnt find a parking space decided he was too hypedup anyway for a quiet night at home so he kept driving cruising the citys south side until he found himself in gracemount back at the bus shelter where hed confronted the lost boys what seemed like half a lifetime ago had it really only been wednesday night the shelter was deserted now rebus parked curbside anyway let his window down an inch and smoked a cigarette he didnt know what hed do with rab fisher if he found him knew he wanted a few answers about andy calliss death the episode in the bar had given him a taste he looked at his hands they were still tingling from contact with mcallister but it wasnt altogether an unpleasant feeling buses came but didnt linger no one was getting on or off rebus started the ignition and headed into the mazy housing projects covering every possible route sometimes finishing in a culdesac and having to back out there were kids playing a game of football in the neardark on a stunted patch of parkland others skateboarding towards an underpass this was their territory their time of day he could ask about the lost boys but knew that these kids learned the rules young they wouldnt rat out the local gang not when their chief aspiration in life was probably membership of the same rebus parked again outside a lowrise block smoked another cigarette hed need to find a shop soon somewhere he could stock up or head for a pub where one of the drinkers would doubtless sell him a job lot cheap no questions asked he checked the radio to see if anything bearable was being broadcast but all he could find were rap and dance there was a tape in the player but it was rory gallagher jinx and he wasnt in the mood seemed to remember one of the tracks was called the devil made me do it not much of a defense these days but plenty of others had come along in old nicks place no such thing as an inexplicable crime not now that there were scientists and psychologists whod talk about genes and abuse brain damage and peer pressure always a reason always it seemed an excuse so why had andy callis died and why had lee herdman walked into that classroom rebus smoked his cigarette in silence took the diamond out and looked at it pocketed it at a sound from outside one kid wheeling another past in a supermarket cart they both stared at him as if he were the oddity here and maybe he was a couple of minutes later they were back again rebus rolled his window all the way down looking for something mister the cartpusher was nine maybe ten head shaven cheekbones prominent supposed to be meeting rab fisher rebus pretended to look at his watch bastard hasnt shown up the boys were wary but not as wary as they would become in a year or two seen him earlier the cart passenger said rebus decided to skip the grammar lesson i owe him some cash he explained instead thought hed be here making a show now of looking all around as though fisher might suddenly appear we could get it to him the cartpusher said rebus smiling do i look like my head zips up the back up to you the kid offering a shrug try two streets that way his passenger pointing ahead and right well race you rebus turned the ignition again didnt want to race hed be conspicuous enough without a shopping cart rattling along at his side bet you could find me some ciggies he said picking a fivepound note from his pocket cheap as you like and the change is all yours the note was plucked from his hand whats with the gloves mister no fingerprints rebus said with a wink pushing the accelerator but nothing was happening two streets away he came to a junction and looked left and right saw another car parked by the curb a huddle of figures leaning down into it rebus paused at the yield thinking the car was being broken into then he realized they were talking to the driver four of them just the one head visible inside the car looked like the lost boys rab fisher doing all the talking the cars engine was a low growl even in neutral souped up or missing its exhaust pipe rebus suspected the former the car had been worked on big brake light in its back window spoiler attached to the trunk the driver was wearing a baseball cap rebus wanted him to be a victim mugged or threatened something that would give rebus the excuse to go storming in but that wasnt the scenario here he could hear laughter got the feeling some anecdote was being shared one of the gang looked in his direction and he realized hed been sitting too long at the empty intersection he turned on to the new road parked with his back to the other car fifty yards farther along pretended to be looking up at the block of flats just a visitor here to pick up a pal two impatient blasts of his horn to complete the effect the lost boys giving him a moments notice before dismissing him rebus put his phone to his ear as if making a call to his missing friend and watched in his rearview watched rab fisher gesticulating animating his story the driver someone he was keen to impress rebus could hear music a rumble of bass the drivers radio tuned to one of the stations rebus had rejected he was wondering how long he could carry on the pretense and what if the cart twosome really did bring him some cigarettes but now fisher was straightening up backing away from the car door which was opening the driver getting out and rebus saw who it was evil bob bob with his own car acting big and tough shoulders rolling as he walked around to the trunk unlocking it there was something inside he wanted them all to see the gang forming a tight semicircle blocking rebuss view evil bob peacocks sidekick but not acting the sidekick now because though he might not be the brightest light on the christmas tree he was higher up that tree than a bauble like fisher not acting rebus was remembering something from the interview room at st leonards the day the lowlifes were being grilled bob muttering about never having seen a panto sounding disappointed bob the big kid hardly a grownup at all which was why peacock kept him around treating him almost as a pet a pet who did tricks for him and now rebus had another face in his mind another scene james bells mother the wind in the willows never too old wagging her finger at him never too old he gave a final apparently despairing look out of his side window then drove off revving hard as if annoyed by his pals noshow turned at the next junction and then slowed again pulled in and made a call on his mobile scribbled down the number he was given made a second call then did a circuit no sign of the cart or his money not that he was expecting either ended up at another yield a hundred yards in front of bobs car waited saw the trunk being slammed shut the lost boys making their way back to the sidewalk bob getting behind the steering wheel he had an air horn it played dixie as he dropped the hand brake tires squealing sending up wisps of smoke he was heading for fifty as he passed rebus dixie blaring again rebus started to follow he felt calm purposeful decided it was time for the last cigarette in the pack and maybe even a few minutes of rory gallagher too remembered seeing rory in the seventies usher hall the place filled with tartan shirts faded denims rory playing sinner boy im movin on rebus had one sinner boy in his sights hopeful of snaring two more rebus eventually got what he was hoping for having chanced his luck at a couple of amber traffic lights bob was forced to stop for a red rebus drove up behind him then passed and stopped blocking the road opened the drivers door and got out as dixie sounded its warning bob looked angry came out of the car ready for trouble rebus had his hands up in surrender evening bobo he said remember me bob knew him now all right the names bob he stated right you are the lights had turned green rebus waved for the cars behind to come around them whats this all about bob was asking rebus was inspecting the car a prospective buyers onceover ive no done nothing rebus had reached the trunk he tapped it with his knuckles care to give me a quick tour of the exhibit bobs jaw jutted got a search warrant think somebody like me bothers with the niceties the baseball cap was shading bobs face rebus bent at the knees so he was looking up into it think again he paused but as it happens he straightened all i want is for the pair of us to go somewhere ive no done nothing the young man repeated no need to fret the cells are jampacked at st leonards as it is so where are we going my treat rebus nodded towards his saab im going to park curbside you pull in behind and wait for me got that and i dont want to see you with your mobile in your hand ive no understood rebus interrupted but youre about to do something and youll like it i promise you he held up a finger then retreated to his car evil bob parked behind him good as gold and waited while rebus got into the passenger seat telling him he could drive drive where though toad hall rebus said pointing towards the road ahead theyd missed the first half of the show but their tickets for the second half were waiting at the traverse box office the audience comprised families a busload of pensioners and what looked like at least one school trip the children wearing identical paleblue jumpers rebus and bob took their seats at the back of the auditorium its not a panto rebus told him but its the next best thing the lights were just going down for the second half rebus knew hed read the wind in the willows as a kid but couldnt remember the story not that bob seemed to mind his caginess soon melted away as the lights illuminated the scenery and the actors bounded onstage toad was in jail as proceedings opened framed no doubt rebus whispered but bob wasnt listening he clapped and booed with the kids and by the climaxweasels put to flight by toad and his allieswas on his feet bellowing his support he looked down at the stillseated rebus and a huge grin spread across his face like i say rebus offered as the houselights went up and kids began pouring out of the auditorium not quite pantomime but you get the idea and this is all because of what i said that day with the play over some of bobs mistrust was returning rebus shrugged maybe i just dont see you as a naturalborn weasel out in the foyer bob stopped looking all around him as though reluctant to leave you can always come back rebus told him doesnt have to be a special occasion bob nodded slowly and allowed rebus to lead him into the busy street he already had his car keys out but rebus was rubbing his gloved hands together a bag of chips he suggested just to round the evening off im buying bob was quick to stress you stumped up for the seats well in that case rebus said im bumping my order to a fish supper the chip shop was quiet pubs hadnt started emptying yet they carried the warm wrapped packages back to the car and got in windows steaming up as they sat and ate bob gave a sudden openmouthed chuckle toad was an arse wasnt he reminded me of your pal peacock actually rebus said hed removed his gloves so they wouldnt get greasy knew bob wouldnt see his hands in the dark theyd bought cans of juice bob slurped from his not saying anything so rebus tried again i saw you earlier with rab fisher what do you make of him bob chewed thoughtfully rabs okay rebus nodded peacock thinks so too doesnt he how would i know you mean he hasnt said bob concentrated on his food and rebus knew hed found the chink he was looking for oh aye he went on rabs rising in peacocks estimation all the time ask me hes just been lucky see that time we busted him for the replica gun case got tossed and that makes it look like rab outwitted us rebus shook his head trying not to let thoughts of andy callis cloud his concentration but he didnt he just got lucky when youre lucky like that though people start to look up to you they reckon youre more sussed than others rebus paused to let this sink in but ill tell you something bob whether the guns are real or not isnt the issue the replicas look too good no way for us to tell theyre not real and that means sooner or later a kids going to get himself killed and his bloodll be on your hands bob had been licking ketchup from his fingers he froze at the thought rebus took a deep breath and gave a sigh leaning back against the headrest way things are headed he added lightly rab and peacock are just going to get closer and closer rabs okay bob repeated but the words had a new hollowness to them good as gold rab is rebus conceded he buy whatever you were selling bob gave him a look and rebus relented okay okay none of my business lets pretend you dont have a gun or something wrapped in a blanket in your trunk bobs face tightened i mean it son rebus laying some stress on the son wondering what sort of father bob had known no good reason why you should open up to me he picked out another chip dropped it into his mouth gave a satisfied grin is there anything better than a good fish supper cracking chips almost like homemade bob nodded peacock makes the best chips i know crispy at the edges peacock does a bit of cooking eh last time we had to go before hed finished rebus stared ahead as the young man crammed home more chips he picked up his can and held it just for something to do his heart was pounding felt like it was squeezing itself into his windpipe he cleared his throat martys kitchen was it he asked trying to keep his voice level bob nodded scouring the corners of the carton for crumbs of batter i thought theyd fallen out over rachel yeah but when peacock got the phone call bob stopped chewing horror filling his eyes realizing suddenly that this wasnt just another chat with a pal what phone call rebus asked allowing the chill to creep into his voice bob was shaking his head rebus pushed open his door snatched the keys from the ignition out of the car scattering chips on the road around to the back opening the trunk bob was next to him you cant you said you bloody said rebus pushing aside the spare tire revealing the gun not wrapped in anything a walther ppk its a replica bob stuttered rebus felt its heft gave it a good look no its not he hissed you know it and i know it and that means youre going to jail bob next night at the theater for you will be in five years time hope you enjoy it he kept one hand on the gun placed the other on bobs shoulder what phone call he repeated i dont know bob sniffing and trembling just some guy in a pub next thing were in the car some guy in a pub saying what shaking his head violently peacock never said no the head going from side to side eyes suddenly tearful rebus gnawed at his bottom lip looked around nobody was paying much attention buses and taxis on lothian road a bouncer in the doorway of a nightclub nine or ten doors up rebus wasnt really seeing any of it mind spinning could have been any of the drinkers in the pub that night spotting him having a long talk with fairstone the two men seeming too pally thinking peacock johnson might be interested peacock whod once known fairstone as a friend then the fallingout over rachel fox and and what peacock worried that martin fairstone had turned rat because fairstone knew something rebus might be interested in the question was what bob rebuss voice all balm now trying to soothe and calm its all right bob dont worry about it nothing to worry about i just need to know what peacock wanted with marty another shake of the head not as violent now resignation taking hold hell kill me he stated quietly thats what hell do staring at rebus eyes an accusation then you need me to help you bob you need me to start being your friend because if youll let that happen itll be peacock in jail not you youll be right as rain the young man paused as though taking this in rebus wondered what a halfway decent defense counsel would do to him in court theyd question his ability and his wits argue that he didnt make a competent witness but he was all rebus had they drove the route back to rebuss car in silence bob parked his own car on a side road then got into rebuss best if you kip at my place tonight rebus explained that way we both know youre safe safe a nice euphemism tomorrow well have a chat okay chat another euphemism bob nodded not saying anything rebus found a parking space at the top of arden street then led bob down the sidewalk towards the tenements main door pushed the door open and noticed the light in the stairwell wasnt working realizing too late what it might mean hands grabbing him by the lapels hurling him against the wall a knee sought his groin but rebus was wise to the move twisted his lower half so the blow connected with his thigh he thudded his own forehead into his attackers face connecting with a cheekbone one of the hands was at his throat seeking the carotid artery pressure there and rebus would start to lose consciousness he clenched his fists went for kidney blows but the attackers leather jacket took most of the brunt theres someone else a womans voice hissed what the attacker was male english someones with him the pressure on rebuss throat eased the attacker backing off sudden flashlight illuminated the halfopen door bob standing there mouth gaping shit simms said whiteread was carrying the flashlight she shone it in rebuss face sorry about that gavin can get a bit too zealous at times apology accepted rebus said getting his breathing back under control then he swung a punch but simms was quick dodged out of its way and held his own fists up boys boys whiteread chided them were not in the playground now bob rebus ordered up here he started climbing the stairs we need to talk whiteread spoke calmly as though nothing had just happened bob was moving past her making to follow rebus we really do need to talk she called angling her head upwards able to make out rebuss silhouette as he reached the first landing fine he said eventually but put the lights back on first he unlocked his door motioned bob down the hall showing him the kitchen and the bathroom then the spare bedroom single bed prepared for visitors who seldom came he touched the radiator it was cold crouched down and turned the thermostat itll warm up soon enough what was going on back there bob sounded curious but not altogether concerned a lifetimes experience of keeping out of other peoples business nothing for you to worry about when rebus stood again blood rushed into his ears he steadied himself best if you wait in here while i talk to them dyou want a book or something a book to read ive never been a great one for reading bob sat down on the edge of the bed rebus could hear his front door closing which meant whiteread and simms were in the hall just wait here then okay he told bob the young man nodded studying the room as if it were a cell punishment rather than refuge no tv he asked rebus left the room without answering motioned with his head for whiteread and simms to follow him into the living room the photocopy of herdmans file was on the dining table but rebus didnt mind them seeing it he poured himself a glass of malt not bothering to share downed it as he stood by the window where he could watch their reflections where did you get the diamond whiteread began holding her hands in front of her thats what its all about isnt it rebus smiled to himself the reason herdman took so many precautions he knew youd come back someday you found it on jura simms guessed he looked calm unruffled rebus shook his head i just worked it out thats all knew if i waved a diamond at you youd start jumping to conclusions he raised his empty glass towards simms which youve just done cheers for that whiteread narrowed her eyes weve confirmed nothing you came running here confirmation enough in my book plus you were in jura last year failing to pass yourself off as a tourist rebus poured himself another drink took a sip this one was going to last him army brass negotiating an end to hostilities in northern ireland stood to reason thered be a price attached paying off the paramilitaries those guys are greedy werent about to go broke the government was buying them off with diamonds only the stash went down with that helicopter sas sent on a mission to retrieve them armed to the teeth in case the terrorists came looking for them too rebus paused how am i doing so far whiteread hadnt moved simms had seated himself on an arm of the sofa picking up a discarded sunday supplement rolling it into a tube rebus pointed at him going to crush my windpipe simms theres a witness next door remember maybe just wishful thinking simms answered eyes burning voice cold rebus turned his attention back to whiteread who was over by the table one hand resting on herdmans personnel file reckon you can curb your monkeys zeal you were spinning us a story about diamonds she said not about to have her attention deflected i never saw herdman as a drug smuggler rebus continued did you plant that stuff on his boat she shook her head slowly well someone did he thought for a moment took another sip but all those trips across the north sea rotterdams a good place to trade diamonds way i see it herdman found the diamonds but wasnt about to own up to it either lifted them at the time or hid them and came back later sometime after his sudden decision not to reenlist now the armys wondering what did happen to that stash and herdmans suddenly flagged himself up hes got some money buys himself a boat business but you cant prove anything paused to take another sip reckon by now theres much left or has he spent it rebus thought of the boats paid for with cash dollars the currency of the diamond exchange and of the diamond around teri cotters neck which had proved the catalyst hed been looking for hed given whiteread time to answer but she was staying quiet in which case he said your business here was damage control make sure theres nothing anyones going to find that would lift the lid on the whole thing every government says it we dont negotiate with terrorists maybe not but we did once try buying them out and wouldnt that make a juicy story in the papers he stared at whiteread above the rim of his glass thats about it isnt it and the diamond she asked borrowed from a friend she was silent for the best part of a minute rebus content to bide his time thinking that if he hadnt brought bob home well things might not have gone nearly as well for him he could still feel simmss fingers around his neck throat tight when he swallowed the whiskey has steve holly been back in touch rebus asked into the silence see anything happens to me all of this goes to him you think thats enough to protect you shut up gavin whiteread snapped slowly she folded her arms what are you going to do she asked rebus he shrugged its none of my business far as i can see no reason i should do anything provided you can keep monkey boy here on his chain simms had risen to his feet a hand reaching inside his jacket whiteread spun around and slapped his arm away the move was so fast if rebus had blinked hed have missed it what i want he said quietly is for the pair of you to be gone by morning otherwise i have to start thinking about talking to my friend from the fourth estate how do we know we can trust you rebus gave another shrug i dont think either of us wants it in writing he put down his glass now if were all through ive got a guest i need to see to whiteread looked towards the door who is he dont worry hes not the talkative kind she nodded slowly then made as if to leave one thing whiteread she paused turned her head to face him why do you think herdman did it because he was greedy i meant why did he walk into that classroom her eyes seemed to gleam why should i care and with that she walked from the room simms was still staring at rebus who gave him a cheeky wave before turning to face the window again simms drew the automatic pistol from his jacket and took aim at the back of rebuss head made a soft whistling sound between his teeth and then put the gun back in its holster one day he said voice barely above a whisper you wont know when or where but ill be the last face you see great rebus exhaled not bothering to turn around i get to spend my last moments on earth staring at a complete arsehole he listened to the footsteps retreat down the hall the slamming shut of the door went to the doorway to check theyd really gone bob was standing just outside the kitchen made myself a mug of tea youre out of milk by the way the servants are on their day off try to get some shuteye long day ahead bob nodded and went to his room closing the door after him rebus poured himself a third drink definitely the last sat down heavily in his armchair stared at the rolledup magazine on the sofa opposite almost imperceptibly it was starting to uncurl he thought of lee herdman tempted by the diamonds burying them then walking out of the woods with a shrug of his shoulders but maybe feeling guilty afterwards and fearful too because the suspicion would linger hed probably been interviewed interrogated maybe even by whiteread the years might pass but the army would never forget last thing they liked was a loose end especially one that could turn as if by magic into a loose cannon that fear pressing down on him so that he kept friends to a minimum kids were all right kids couldnt be his pursuers in disguise doug brimson was apparently okay too all those locks trying to shut out the world little wonder he snapped but to snap the way he did rebus still didnt get it couldnt see it as plain jealousy james bell photographing miss teri on cockburn street derek renshaw and anthony jarvies logging on to her website teri cotter curious about death exsoldier for a lover renshaw and jarvies close friends different from teri different from james bell jazz fans not metal dressing in their combat uniforms and parading at school playing sports not like teri cotter not at all like james bell and when it came down to it what apart from their forces background did herdman and doug brimson have in common well for a start both knew teri cotter teri with herdman her mother seeing brimson rebus imagined it as a weird sort of dance the kind where you kept swapping partners he rested his face in his hands blocking out the light smelling glove leather mixing with the fumes from his whiskey glass as the dancers spun around in his head when he blinked his eyes open again the room was a blur wallpaper came into focus first but he could see bloodstains in his mind classroom blood two fatal shots one wounding no three fatal shots no he realized hed said the word out loud two fatal shots one wounding then another fatal shot blood spraying the walls and floor blood everywhere blood with its own stories to tell hed poured the fourth whiskey without thinking raised the glass to his lips before he caught himself tipped it back carefully into the neck of the bottle pushed the stopper home went so far as to replace the bottle on the mantelpiece blood with its own stories to tell he picked up his phone didnt think thered be anyone at the forensics lab this time of night but made the call anyway you never could tell some of them had their own little obsessions their own little puzzles to solve not because the case demanded it or even out of a sense of professional pride but for their own more private needs like rebus they found it hard to let go he no longer knew if this was a good or a bad thing it was just the way it was the phone was ringing no one answering lazy bastards he muttered to himself then he noticed bobs head peeping around the door sorry the young man said shuffling into the room hed taken his coat off baggy gray tshirt beneath showing flabby hairless arms cant really settle sit down if you like rebus nodded towards the sofa bob took a seat but looked awkward tvs there if you want it bob nodded but his eyes were wandering he saw the shelves of books walked over to take a look maybe ill help yourself take anything you fancy that show we saw you said its based on a book rebuss turn to nod ive not got a copy though he listened to the ringing tone for another fifteen seconds then gave up sorry if im interrupting bob said he still hadnt touched any of the books seemed to be regarding them as some rare species to be stared at but not handled youre not rebus got to his feet just wait here a minute he went into the hall unlocked a closet door there were cardboard boxes high up and he lifted one down some of his daughters old stuff dolls and paint boxes postcards and bits of rock picked up on seaside walks he thought of allan renshaw thought of the ties which should have bound the two of them ties too easily loosed allan with his boxes of photographs his attic store of memories rebus put the box back brought down the one next to it some of his daughters old books little ladybird offerings some paperbacks with the covers scribbled on or half torn off and a favored few hardcovers yes here it was green dust jacket yellow spine with a drawing of mr toad someone had added a speech bubble and in it the words pooppoop he didnt know if the handwriting was his daughters or not thought again of his cousin allan trying to put names to the longdead faces in the photos rebus put the box back where hed found it locked the cupboard and took the book into the living room here you go he told bob handing it over now you can find out what we missed in the first act bob seemed pleased but held the book warily as if unsure how best to treat it then he retreated back to his room rebus stood by the window staring out at the night wondering if he too had missed something not in the play but right back at the start of the case day seven wednesday the sun was shining when rebus woke up he checked his watch then swiveled out of bed and got dressed filled the kettle and switched it on gave his face a wash before treating it to a onceover with the electric razor listened at the door to bobs bedroom no sound he knocked waited then shrugged and went into the living room called the forensics lab still no answer lazy sods speaking of which this time he banged harder on bobs door then opened it an inch time to face the world the curtains were open the bed empty cursing under his breath rebus walked in but there were no feasible hiding places the copy of the wind in the willows was lying on the pillow rebus pressed his palm to the mattress thought he could still feel some warmth there back in the hall he saw that the door wasnt properly closed should have locked us in he muttered going to push it shut hed get his jacket and shoes on and go out hunting again doubtless bob would head for his car first of all after which if he had any sense at all hed take the road south rebus doubted hed have a passport he wished hed thought to take down bobs license plate it would be traceable but it would take time hang on though he said to himself he went back to the bedroom picked up the book bob had used the flyleaf as a page marker why would he have done that unless rebus opened the front door and stepped out onto the landing feet were shuffling up the steps didnt wake you did i bob said he lifted a carrier bag for rebus to see milk and tea bags plus four rolls and a packet of sausages good thinking rebus said hoping he sounded calmer than he felt breakfast over they headed in rebuss car to st leonards he was trying not to make it seem like a big deal at the same time there was no disguising the fact that they were going to be spending most of the day in an interview room tapes loaded into the dual voice recorder with another tape for the video can of juice or anything before we get started rebus asked bob had brought a morning tabloid with him and had it spread out on the desk lips moving as he read he shook his head ill be back in a sec then rebus told him opening the door and closing it locking it after him he climbed the stairs to the cid suite siobhan was at her desk busy day ahead he asked her ive got my first flying lesson this afternoon she said looking up from her computer courtesy of doug brimson rebus studied her face as she nodded howre you feeling no visible signs of damage has mcallister been let out of the cells yet siobhan looked up at the clock above the door i suppose i better do that not charging him then you think i should rebus shook his head but before you let him waltz out maybe you should ask him a few things she rested against the back of her chair and stared up at him like what ive got evil bob downstairs he says peacock johnson started the fire stuck the heat under the chip pan and left it her eyes widened slightly does he say why my idea is he thought fairstone had turned rat already no love lost between them then someone calls johnson and says im having a friendly drink with fairstone and he murdered him for that rebus shrugged mustve had cause to worry but you dont know why not yet maybe it was just meant to scare fairstone off you reckon this bob characters the missing link i think he can be persuaded how does rod mcallister enter this food chain of yours we wont know that until you use your brilliant detective powers on him siobhan started sliding her mouse around its mat saving what she was working on ill see what i can do you coming with me he shook his head i need to get back to the interview room this talk youre having with johnsons sidekick is it formal informally formal you might say then you should have someone else present she looked at him go by the rule book for once in your life he knew she was right i could wait till youve finished with the barman he suggested kind of you to offer she looked around the suite dc davie hynds was taking a call writing something down as he listened davies your man she said bit more flexible than george silvers rebus looked towards hyndss desk hed finished the call and was putting the receiver down with one hand while still scribbling with the other he saw that he was being stared at looked up and lifted one eyebrow questioningly rebus crooked a finger beckoning him over he didnt know hynds well hadnt really worked with him much but he trusted siobhans judgment davie he said laying a companionable arm on the younger mans shoulder take a walk with me will you i need to fill you in on the guy were about to interview he paused best bring that notebook with you twenty minutes in however and with bob still giving them general background there was a knock at the door rebus opened it saw a female uniform standing there what is it he asked call for you she pointed back towards reception im busy here its di hogan he says its urgent and youre to be pulled out of anything short of triplebypass surgery despite himself rebus smiled his exact words he guessed exact words the female officer echoed rebus turned back into the room told hynds he wouldnt be long hynds switched off the machines get you anything bob rebus asked im thinking maybe you should get me my lawyer mr rebus rebus stared at him thatll be peacocks lawyer too will it bob considered this maybe not just yet he said not just yet rebus agreed leaving the interview room he told the officer he could find reception without her help and entered the comms room crossing the floor and through an open doorway picked up the handset that was lying on the desk hello christ john have you gone into purdah or something bobby hogan sounded not altogether pleased rebus was watching the bank of screens in front of him they showed half a dozen views of st leonards exterior and interior the viewpoints flickering every thirty seconds or so shifting from one camera to another what can i do for you bobby forensics has finally come back to us on the shootings oh aye rebus winced hed meant to try phoning them again im headed down there suddenly remembered that id have to drive straight past st leonards theyve found something havent they bobby they say theyve got a bit of a puzzle hogan agreed then he broke off you knew didnt you not in so many words its to do with the locus am i right rebus stared at one of the screens it showed detective chief superintendent gill templer entering the building she carried a briefcase with a heavylooking satchel slung over one shoulder thats right a few anomalies good word that anomalies covers a multitude of sins i just wondered if you fancied coming with me what does claverhouse say there was a pause on the line claverhouse doesnt know hogan said quietly the call came direct to me why havent you told him bobby another pause i dont know maybe a certain fellow officers pernicious influence maybe rebus smiled pick me up when youre ready bobby depending on what forensics has got to tell us i might have a few questions for them myself he opened the interview room door beckoned for hynds to step into the corridor well just be a minute bob he explained closed the door and faced hynds arms folded i need to go to howdenhall orders from above want him put in the cells till you but rebus was already shaking his head i want you to keep going i shouldnt be too long if it gets sticky call me on my mobile but davierebus laid a hand on hyndss shoulderyoure doing fine in there youll manage without me but there needs to be another officer present hynds objected rebus looked at him has siobhan been coaching you davie he pursed his lips thought for a moment and then nodded youre right he said ask dcs templer if shell sit in with you both eyebrows shot up connecting with hyndss fringe the boss wont yes she will tell her its about fairstone believe me shell be only too happy to oblige shell need to be briefed first the hand that had been resting on hyndss shoulder now patted it you do it but sir rebus shook his head slowly this is your chance to show what you can do davie everything youve learned from watching siobhan rebus removed his hand and bunched it into a fist time to start using it hynds pulled himself a little more upright as he nodded his agreement good lad rebus said he turned to leave but stopped in his tracks oh and davie yes tell dcs templer she needs to act mumsy mumsy rebus nodded just tell her he said making for the exit forget the xjk anything from porsche can leave the jags standing i think the jaguars a betterlooking car though hogan argued causing ray duff to look up from his work more classic oldfashioned you mean duff was sorting out a large number of crime scene photos spreading them across every available wall surface the room they were in looked like a disused school laboratory with four freestanding workbenches at its center the photos showed the port edgar classroom from every conceivable angle concentrating on the bloodied walls and floor and the positioning of the bodies call me a traditionalist hogan said folding his arms in the hope this would put an end to yet another of ray duffs discussions go on then top five british cars im not that much of a buff ray i like my saab rebus added responding to hogans scowl with a wink duff made a noise at the back of his throat dont get me started on the swedes okay how about we concentrate on port edgar instead rebus was thinking of doug brimson another jag fancier duff was looking around locating his laptop he plugged it into an outlet on one of the benches and gestured for the two detectives to join him as he switched it on just while were waiting he said hows siobhan doing fine rebus assured him that little difficulty of hers yes resolved what difficulty hogan asked rebus ignored the question shes having a flying lesson this afternoon really duff raised an eyebrow that doesnt come cheap i think its a freebie courtesy of a guy who owns an airfield and a jag brimson hogan guessed rebus nodded my offer to her of a ride in my mg pales by comparison duff grumbled you cant compete with this guy hes got one of those corporate jets duff whistled must be loaded then those can set you back a few mil aye right rebus said dismissively im serious duff said and thats secondhand you mean millions of pounds this from bobby hogan duff nodded business must be good eh yes rebus was thinking so good brimson could afford a day off for a trip to jura here we go duff was saying drawing their attention back to the laptop basically this has everything i need he ran an admiring finger along the edge of the screen theres a simulation we can run shows the pattern youd expect to get when a gun is fired from whatever distance whatever angle to the head or body he clicked a few more buttons and rebus heard the whirr of the laptops cd drive the graphics appeared a skeletal figure standing sideways to a wall see here duff was saying subject is twenty centimeters from the wall bullet is fired from a distance of two meters entry and exit and boom they watched as a line seemed to enter the skull reappearing as a fine speckling duffs finger moved across the touch pad highlighting the marked area of wall which then was magnified onscreen gives us a pretty good picture he said with a smile ray hogan said quietly just so you know di rebus here lost a family member in that room duffs smile melted away i didnt mean to make light of maybe if we could just cut to the chase rebus replied coolly he didnt blame duff how could he the man hadnt known but anything to speed things up duff plunged his hands into the pockets of his white lab coat and turned towards the photographs we need to look at these now he said eyes on rebus thats fine rebus agreed with a nod lets just get it done eh the early animation had left duffs voice when he spoke now first victim was the one nearest the door that was anthony jarvies herdman walks in and aims at the person nearest himstands to reason from the evidence the two were just under two meters apart no real sense of an angle herdman was about the same height as his victim so the bullet takes a lateral path through the skull blood spatter pattern is pretty much what wed expect to find then herdman turns second victim is a little farther away maybe three meters herdman may have closed that gap before firing but probably not by much this time the bullet angles down through the skull indicating that derek renshaw was maybe trying to duck out of the way he looked at his audience with me so far rebus and hogan nodded and the three men moved along the wall blood stains on the floor are explicable nothing out of place duff paused until now rebus guessed the scientist nodded weve got a lot of data on firearms what sort of damage they do to the human body and to anything else they come in contact with and james bell is proving a puzzle duff nodded a bit of a puzzle yes hogan looked from duff to rebus and back again how so in bells statement he says he was hit while in movement basically he was diving for the floor he seemed to think this might explain why he wasnt killed he also said that herdman was about three and a half meters away when he fired he crossed to the computer again and brought a d simulation onto the screen showing the classroom and pointing to the positions of gunman and schoolboy again the victim is of similar height to herdman but this time the angle of the shot appears to be upwards duff paused to let this sink in as if the person doing the firing was the one crouching down he bent low at the knees and pointed an imaginary pistol then straightened and crossed to another of the benches there was a light box sitting on it and he switched it on illuminating a set of xrays showing the route the bullet had taken in ripping through james bells shoulder entry wound at the front exit at the back you can see the trajectory quite clearly he traced it for them with his finger so herdman was crouching down bobby hogan said with a shrug of the shoulders i get the feeling rays just warming up rebus said quietly thinking that he wouldnt have too many questions for the scientist after all duff returned rebuss look and went back to the photographs no blood spatter pattern he said circling the area of the wall then he held up a hand actually thats not strictly true theres blood present but its such a fine diffusion you cant really make it out meaning what hogan asked not bothering to hide his impatience meaning james bell wasnt standing where he said he was at the time he was shot he was much farther into the room which means closer to herdman yet theres still that upward trajectory to the shot rebus noted duff nodded then pulled open a drawer and brought out a bag it was clear polyethylene edged with brown paper an evidence bag folded up inside lay a bloodstained white shirt the bullet hole at the shoulder clearly visible james bells shirt duff stated and here we find something else powder burns rebus said quietly hogan turned to him how come you already know all this he hissed rebus shrugged ive got no social life bobby nothing to do with myself but sit and think about things hogan glowered letting rebus know this was well short of an acceptable answer di rebus is spot on duff said gaining their attention again you wouldnt expect powder burns on the bodies of the first two victims they were shot from a distance you only get powder burns when the gun is close to the skin or say the victims clothes did herdman himself have powder burns rebus asked duff nodded consistent with placing the pistol to his temple and firing rebus went back along the display of photos taking his time they werent really telling him anything which in a way was the whole point you had to peer beneath their surface to begin to glimpse the truth hogan was scratching the nape of his neck im not really getting this he said its a puzzle duff agreed hard to square the witnesss account with the evidence depends which way you look at it though ray am i right duff fixed eyes with rebus and nodded theres always a way to explain things take your time then hogan slapped his hands down on the workbench i had nothing better to do with myself today anyway just got to look at it a different way bobby rebus told him james bell was shot at pointblank range by someone the approximate size of a garden gnome hogan said dismissively rebus shook his head its just that herdman couldnt have done it hogans eyes widened wait a second isnt that right ray its one conclusion certainly duff was rubbing the underside of his jaw couldnt have done it hogan echoed youre saying there was someone else in there an accomplice rebus shook his head im saying its possiblemaybe even probablethat lee herdman only killed one person in that room hogans eyes narrowed and who would that be rebus turned his attention to ray duff who supplied the answer himself duff stated as though it were the simplest explanation in the world rebus and hogan sat in hogans idling car theyd been silent for a few minutes the passengerside window was open and rebus was smoking while hogans fingers drummed against the steering wheel how do we play this hogan asked this time around rebus had an answer you know my preferred technique bobby he said bull in a china shop hogan guessed rebus nodded slowly finishing his cigarette and flicking the butt onto the roadway its served me well enough in the past but this is different john jack bells an msp jack bells a clown dont underestimate him rebus turned to face his colleague having second thoughts bobby i just wonder if we shouldnt cover our arses unlike you john ive never been an aficionado of china shops rebus stared out through the windshield im going in there anyway bobby you know that whether youre with me or not is up to you you can always call claverhouse and ormiston let them know the score but i need to hear it for myself he turned again to stare at hogan eyes shining sure i cant tempt you bobby hogan ran his tongue around his lips clockwise then counterclockwise his fingers tightened around the steering wheel hell with it he said whats a bit of broken crockery between friends the door to the barnton house was opened by kate renshaw hiya kate rebus said face stony hows your dad hes all right not think youd be better off spending a bit more time with him shed opened the door wide to let them in hogan having phoned ahead to say they were coming im doing something useful here kate argued bolstering a curb crawlers career her eyes flashed fire but rebus ignored them through glass doors to the right he could see the dining room its table spread with the paperwork from jack bells campaign bell himself was descending the staircase rubbing his hands together as though hed just washed them officers he said not bothering to sound welcoming i hope this wont take long same here hogan countered rebus looked around is mrs bell in the house shes out visiting was there something in particular just wanted to tell her i saw wind in the willows last night cracking good show the msp raised an eyebrow ill pass on the message you told your son to expect us hogan asked bell nodded hes watching tv he gestured towards the living room without waiting to be asked hogan walked over to the door and opened it james bell was lying along the cream leather sofa shoes off head resting on the hand of his good arm james his father said the police are here so i see james swiveled his feet back onto the carpet hello again james hogan said i think you know di rebus james nodded mind if we sit down hogan asked aiming the question at son rather than father not that hogan was about to wait for permission he made himself comfortable in an armchair while rebus was content to stand by the fireplace jack bell sat down next to his son and placed a hand on jamess knee which the young man swatted away james leaned down and picked up a glass of water from the floor lifted it to his lips and sipped id still like to know whats going on jack bell said impatiently a busy man a man who had better things to do with his time rebuss mobile sounded and he mouthed an apology as he brought it out of his pocket looked at the display and saw who was calling apologized again as he stood up and left the room gill he said into the mouthpiece hows bob coming along since you ask hes a fund of good stories rebus looked into the dining room there was no sign of kate he didnt know the chip pan was meant to catch fire agreed so what else has he said he seems to have taken against rab fisher without realizing how much hes implicating his friend peacock in the process rebuss eyes narrowed how so the reason fisher was walking up and down nightclub queues letting people get a glimpse of the gun he was carrying yes he was trying to sell drugs drugs working for your friend johnson peacocks sold some hash in the past but not enough to merit an assistant bobs not spelling it out but i think we might be talking crack jesus so who was his source id have thought that was obvious she gave a short laugh your other friend the one with the boats i dont think so rebus stated remind me wasnt cocaine found on his boat all the same well someone else then she took a deep breath anyway its a good start wouldnt you say must be the womans touch he just needs someone to mother him john thanks for the tip does this mean im out of the woods it means i need to bring mullen in let him hear what weve got but you dont think i killed martin fairstone lets just say im wavering thanks for backing me up boss let me know if you get anything else will you ill try what are you up to anything new i should be starting to worry about maybe watch the sky over barnton for fireworks he cut the call made sure his phone was switched off and went back into the room i assure you well be as quick as we can hogan was saying then he looked up at rebus now im going to hand things over to my colleague rebus pretended to take his time over forming his first question then stared hard at james bell why did you do it james what jack bell shifted forwards i think i must protest at your tone sorry about that sir i get a bit agitated sometimes when someones been lying to me not just to me but to everyone the whole inquiry his parents the media everyone james was staring back at him rebus folded his arms see james were beginning to piece together what really happened in that classroom and ive got news for you when you fire a gun there are traces left on your skin they can last weeks last through a dozen washings and scrubbings on your shirt cuffs too remember weve still got the shirt you were wearing what the hell are you saying jack bell snarled face filling with blood do you expect me to let you walk into my house and accuse an eighteenyearold boy of is that the way you work in the police force these days dad its because of me isnt it youre trying to get at me through my son just because you made a horrific mistake that nearly cost me my job my marriage dad jamess voice had risen a fraction now this terrible tragedy occurs and all you can do is theres no vendetta here sir hogan was protesting even though the arresting officer in leith swears he had you dead to rights rebus couldnt help adding john hogan warned you see jack bells voice was a tremor of anger you see the way it is and always will be because youre too arrogant to james leapt to his feet will you shut the fuck up for once in your bloody life will you just shut the fuck up silence in the room even though the words seemed to hang in the air reverberating james bell sat back down again slowly maybe hogan said quietly if we could let james have his say directing his words to the msp who seemed stunned eyes on a son hed never known existed someone suddenly revealed to him you cant talk to me like that looking at james voice barely audible i thought i just did james told his father then eyes focused on rebus lets get this over with rebus moistened his lips right now james probably the only thing we can prove is that you were shot at pointblank rangecontrary to the story youve been sticking to thus farand that the angle of the shot would suggest that you did it yourself however youve also admitted knowing of at least one of lee herdmans guns which is why i think maybe you took the brocock intending to shoot and kill anthony jarvies and derek renshaw they were wankers the pair of them and that constitutes a good enough reason james jack bell warned i dont want you saying anything to these men his son ignored him they had to die jack bells mouth opened but no sound came out james concentrated on the water glass turning it and turning it why did they have to die rebus asked quietly james shrugged ive already said you didnt like them rebus suggested and thats all there is to it plenty of my peers have killed for less or havent you been watching the news america germany yemen sometimes its enough that you dont like mondays help me understand james i know you had different taste in music not just in music in everything a different outlook on life hogan suggested maybe rebus said a part of you wanted to impress teri cotter too james glared at him leave her out of this thats not easy to do james after all terid told you she was obsessed with death hadnt she james said nothing i think youd become a bit infatuated with her how would you know the teenager sneered well for a start you made that trip to cockburn street to take her picture i took a lot of photos but you kept hers in that book you loaned to lee you didnt like it that shed slept with him did you didnt like it when jarvies and renshaw told you theyd found her website watching her in her bedroom rebus paused how am i doing you know a lot inspector rebus shook his head but theres so much i dont know james and im hoping maybe youll fill in the gaps you dont have to say anything james his father croaked youre a minor there are laws to protect you youve suffered a trauma no court in the land would he looked across at the detectives surely he should have a solicitor present i dont want one james snapped but you must the father sounded aghast the son sneered its not about you anymore dad do you see its all about me now im the one whos going to put you back on the front pages but for all the wrong reasons and in case you hadnt noticed im not a minorim eighteen old enough to vote old enough to do lots of things he seemed to wait for a retort that did not come then turned his attention back to rebus what is it you need to know am i right about teri i knew she was sleeping with lee when you gave him that book you left her photo there deliberately i suppose so hoping hed see it and do what rebus watched as james shrugged maybe it was enough that he would know you liked her too rebus paused why that particular book though james looked at him because lee wanted to read it he knew the story how the guy had jumped to his death from a plane he wasnt james seemed unable to find the words he needed he took a deep breath he was a deeply unhappy man you must realize that unhappy in what way the word came to james haunted he said thats the sense i always got he was haunted there was silence in the room for a moment broken by rebus you took the gun from lees flat thats right he didnt know a shake of the head you knew about the brocock bobby hogan asked just about keeping his voice under control james nodded so how come he turned up at the school rebus asked i left him a note didnt expect him to find it so soon what was your plan then james just walk into the common roomusually only the two of them thereand kill them in cold blood thats right two kids whod done you no harm two less on the planet the teenager shrugged i dont see typhoons and hurricanes earthquakes and famine and thats why you did it because it wouldnt matter james was thoughtful maybe rebus looked down at the carpet trying to control the rage growing within him my family my blood it all happened so fast james was telling them i was amazed how calm i felt bang bang two bodies lee was walking in the door as i shot the second one he just stood there the pair of us did didnt know quite what to do he smiled at the memory then he held out his hand for the gun and i handed it over the smile evaporated last thing i expected was for the stupid sod to point it at his own head why do you think he did that james shook his head slowly ive been trying to work it out ever since do you know an imploring edge to the question needing an answer rebus had a few theories because the gun was his and he felt responsible because the incident would bring whole teams of professionals sniffing around including the army because it was a way out because he would no longer be haunted you took the gun from him and shot yourself in the shoulder rebus said quietly then placed it back in his hand yes the note id left for him it was in his other hand i took that too what about fingerprints i did what they do in the films wiped the pistol with my shirt but when you first walked in there you must have been prepared for everyone to know youd done it why the change of heart the teenager shrugged because the chance presented itself maybe do we really know why we do what we do in the heat of the moment he turned to his father instincts sometimes get the better of us those dark little thoughts which was when his father lunged at him grabbing him around the neck the two of them falling backwards over the sofa crashing to the floor you little bastard jack bell was yelling do you know what youve done im ruined now in tatters absolute fucking tatters rebus and hogan separated them the father still snarling and swearing the son almost serene by comparison and studying his fathers incoherent ire as though it was a memory he would treasure in the years to come the door had opened kate standing there rebus wanted to make james bell fall down at her feet beg forgiveness she was taking in the scene trying to make sense of it jack she asked softly jack bell looked at her as if she was a stranger to him rebus was still holding the msp in a bear hug from behind get out of here kate he pleaded just go home i dont understand james bell passive in hogans grasp looked across to the doorway then over to where his father and rebus stood a smile spread slowly across his face will you tell her or shall i i cant believe it siobhan said not for the first time rebuss phone call to her had lasted almost the whole of her drive from st leonards to the airfield im having a hard time taking it in myself she was on the a heading west out of the city looked in her mirror then signaled moving out to pass a taxi businessman in the back of it calmly reading a newspaper on his way to his flight siobhan felt like she needed to pull over on to the hard shoulder bolt from her car and do some screaming just to release whatever it was she was feeling was it the rush of getting a result two results really the herdman case and fairstones murder or was it the frustration of not being around at the time he couldnt have shot herdman too could he she asked who young master bell she could hear rebus turning from his phone to relay her question to bobby hogan he leaves the note knowing herdman will follow him siobhan was saying mind rushing kills all three and turns the gun on himself its a theory rebuss voice crackled sounding unconvinced whats that noise my phone its telling me it needs a recharge she took the airport access road the taxi still visible in her mirror i could cancel you know meaning the flying lesson whats the point nothing doing here youre heading for queensferry already there bobbys driving in through the school gates as i speak he turned away from the phone again said something to hogan sounded like he was saying he wanted to be there when hogan explained everything to claverhouse and ormiston siobhan caught the words especially that the drugrunnings a nonstarter who put the drugs on his boat she asked didnt catch that siobhan she repeated the question you think whiteread did it to keep the inquiry active im not sure even she has the clout for that sort of sting were rounding up the small fry cars are already out looking for rab fisher and peacock johnson bobbys just about to deliver the news to claverhouse i wish i could be there catch us afterwards well be adjourning to the pub not the boatmans though i thought maybe wed try the place next door just for a change i should only be an hour or so take your time i dont suppose well be going anywhere bring brimson with you if you like should i tell him about james bell thats up to you papers will have it by the close of play meaning steve holly reckon i owe the sod that much at least then claverhouse doesnt get the pleasure of breaking the news he paused did you manage to put the frighteners on rod mcallister he still denies writing the letters its enough that you know and that he knows you do feeling okay about the flying lesson ill be fine maybe i should alert air traffic control she could hear hogan saying something in the background and rebus chuckling what did he say she asked bobby reckons we might be better off warning the coast guard thats him crossed off my dinner list she listened as rebus relayed her message to hogan then okay siobhan thats us at the car park got to go deliver the news to claverhouse any chance of you keeping your composure dont worry ill be cool calm and collected really just as soon as ive rubbed his nose in the shit she smiled ended the call decided she might as well switch her phone off wouldnt be making calls at five thousand feet glanced at the dashboard clock and saw that she was going to be early didnt suppose doug brimson would mind she tried to shake her head clear of everything shed heard lee herdman didnt kill those kids john rebus didnt torch martin fairstones house she felt bad about having suspected rebus but it was his own fault always so secretive and herdman too with his secret life his daily fears the media would be forced to eat humble pie and would turn their fury on the easiest target available jack bell which almost counted as a happy ending as she arrived at the airfield gates a car was just leaving brimson got out of the passenger side offered a cautious smile as he undid the lock pulled the gate open waited there as the car drove through passing siobhan at speed a scowling face in its front seat brimson beckoned for siobhan to drive in she did so then waited while the gate was locked again brimson opened the passengerside door got in wasnt expecting you quite yet he said siobhan eased her foot from the clutch sorry about that she said quietly staring through the windshield who was your visitor brimson screwed up his face just someone interested in flying lessons didnt seem the type somehow you mean the shirt brimson laughed bit loud wasnt it a bit theyd arrived at the office siobhan pulling on the hand brake brimson got out she stayed where she was watching him he came around to her side of the car opened the door as if this was what shed been waiting for avoiding eye contact theres some paperwork he was saying liability waiver stuff like that he made towards the open doorway did your customer have a name she asked following him in jackson jobson something like that hed entered his office falling into his chair hands sifting through paperwork siobhan kept on her feet itll be on the paperwork she said what if he was here for lessons i assume youve got his details oh yes here somewhere he shuffled the sheets of paper time i got a secretary he said attempting a grin his names peacock johnson siobhan said quietly is it and he wasnt here for flying lessons did he want you to fly him out of the country you know him then i know hes a wanted man responsible for the death of a petty criminal named martin fairstone and now peacocks panicking because he cant find his trusted lieutenant and probably knows weve got him all of which comes as news to me but you know who johnson is and what he is no i told you he just wanted flying lessons brimsons hands were busier than ever sorting through the paperwork ill let you in on a secret siobhan said weve tied up the port edgar case lee herdman didnt kill those kids it was the msps son what brimson didnt seem to be taking the news in james bell did it then turned the gun on himself after lee had committed suicide really doug are you looking for anything in particular or trying to dig your way out of here through the desk he looked up at her and grinned i was telling you she went on that lee didnt kill those two boys right which means the only puzzle left is the drugs found on his boat im assuming you knew about the yacht he kept moored shoreside he could no longer hold her gaze why would i know anything about that why wouldnt you look siobhan brimson made a show of checking his watch maybe we can leave the paperwork wouldnt do to miss our slot she ignored this the yacht looked good because lee sailed to europe but now we know he was selling diamonds and buying drugs at the same time she shook her head you knew about his boat and probably knew he went to the continent shed taken a step towards the desk its the corporate flights isnt it doug your own little trips to the continent taking businessmen to meetings and on jollies thats how you bring the drugs in its all going to hell he said almost too calmly hed leaned back in the chair hands smoothing his hair eyes staring ceilingwards i told that stupid bastard never to come here you mean peacock he nodded slowly why plant the drugs siobhan asked why not he gave another burst of laughter lee was dead way i saw it it would focus attention on him taking the heat off you she decided to sit down thing was there was no heat on you charlotte thought there was you lot were sniffing into every nook and cranny talking to teri talking to me charlotte cotters involved brimson looked at her as though she were stupid its a cash business all needs to be laundered through the tanning salons siobhan nodded letting him know she understood brimson and teris mother business partners lee wasnt squeaky clean you know brimson was saying he was the one who introduced me to peacock johnson in the first place lee knew peacock johnson is that where the guns came from thats one thing i was going to give you only i couldnt see how what thing johnson had these decommissioned guns needed someone to put the firing pins back that sort of thing and lee herdman did it she thought of the wellstocked workshop at the boatyard yes a simple enough job with the tools and the knowhow herdman had had both brimson was quiet for a moment we could still go for that flight shame to miss the slot ive not brought my passport she reached out a hand towards his phone i need to make a call now doug id cleared our path you know cleared it with the flight tower i was going to show you so much shed risen to her feet lifted the receiver maybe another time eh the two of them knowing there would be no other time brimsons palms were flat against the desktop siobhan was holding the receiver to her ear halfway through punching in the numbers im sorry doug she said me too siobhan believe me im as sorry as hell he pushed up from the desk lunged across it sending all the paperwork flying as he came she dropped the phone and took a step back colliding with the chair behind her tripping over it and hitting the floor hands outstretched to cushion the blow doug brimsons whole weight landing on her pinning her down punching all the breath from her chest got to fly siobhan he snarled gripping her by the wrists got to fly happy bobby rebus asked deliriously so bobby hogan replied they were entering the bar on south queensferrys waterfront the meeting at the school could hardly have been better timed theyd managed to interrupt a meeting between claverhouse and assistant chief constable colin carswell hogan taking a deep breath before stating that everything claverhouse was saying was nonsense before going on to explain why at the end of the meeting claverhouse had walked out without any comment leaving his colleague ormiston to shake hogans hand telling him he deserved the credit which doesnt mean youll get it bobby rebus had said but hed patted ormistons arm to let him know the gesture was appreciated hed even asked him to join them for a drink but ormiston had shaken his head i think youve just assigned me to solace duty hed said so it was just rebus and hogan in the bar as they waited their turn hogan seemed to deflate just a little usually at the end of a case the whole team gathered in the murder room while cases of beer were dragged in and opened maybe a bottle of fizz from the brass whiskey for the more traditionally minded this didnt seem the same just the two of them the original team already dispersed whatll it be hogan asked trying to sound breezy maybe a laphroaig bobby the measures dont look generous hogan had run an expert eye over the gantry better make it a double and decide right now whos the designated driver hogans mouth twitched i thought you said siobhan was joining us thats cruel bobby rebus paused cruel but fair the barman was ready for them hogan ordered rebuss whiskey and a pint of lager for himself and two cigars he added turning towards rebus seeming to study him he rested his arm on the edge of the bar result like this john makes me think i want to go out while im winning christ bobby youre in your prime hogan snorted five years ago id have agreed with you he took a wad of notes from his pocket and extracted a ten but this just about does it for me so whats changed hogan shrugged a kid who can go and shoot two classmates no real motive i mean none that makes any sense to me its a different world from the one i used to know john just means were needed more than ever hogan snorted again you really think so you see yourself as being wanted do you i didnt say wanted i said needed and who needs us people like carswell because we make him look good or claverhouse so hes not screwing up any more than he already is theyll do for a start rebus said smiling his glass was placed in front of him and he dribbled some water into it just enough to take the edge off two thin cigars had arrived and hogan was unwrapping his we still dont really know do we know what why herdman did it topped himself did you think we ever would i had the feeling you brought me in because all the young folk around you were scaring you you needed another dinosaur in the vicinity youre not a dinosaur john hogan lifted his glass chinked it against rebuss heres to the two of us not forgetting jack bell without whose presence james might have realized he could keep quiet and end up getting away with it right enough hogan said with a broad grin families eh john he started shaking his head families rebus agreed lifting the glass to his mouth when his phone sounded hogan told him to leave it but rebus checked the display wondering if it might be siobhan it wasnt rebus motioned to hogan that he was stepping back outside where it was quieter there was a beer garden to the front just an area of pavement with some tables too chill a breeze for anyone to be using them rebus lifted the phone to his ear gill he said you wanted to be kept in touch young bobs still singing then i almost wish hed stop gill templer said with a sigh weve had his childhood bullied at school the time he wet himself he keeps bouncing backwards and forwards i never know if something happened last week or last decade he says he wants to borrow the wind in the willows rebus smiled its at my flat ill fetch it for him rebus heard the drone of a light aircraft in the distance peered up shading his eyes with his free hand the plane was over the forth road bridge too far away to tell if it was the same one theyd traveled to jura in same sort of size crawling almost lazily across the sky what do you know about tanning parlors gill templer was asking why they keep cropping up some connection with johnson and the drugs rebus kept watching the plane it dipped suddenly engine changing tone then it leveled off wings tilting from side to side if it was siobhan up there she was learning the hard way teri cotters mother owns a few rebus said into the phone thats about as much as i know could they be a front i wouldnt have thought so i mean where would she be getting rebus broke off brimsons car parked in cockburn street where teris mum had one of her shops teri admitting to him that her mother was having an affair with brimson doug brimson friend of lee herdman brimson with his planes where the hell had he got the money for them millions ray duff had said it had struck a nerve at the time but rebus had become distracted by james bell millions the kind of money you could make from a few legitimate businesses and dozens of illegal ones rebus remembered what brimson had said on the way back from jura with the forth and rosyth beneath i often think about the damage even with something as small as a cessna dockyard ferry road and rail bridges airport rebuss hand fell he squinted into the light jesus christ he muttered john you still there by the time she had the words out he wasnt ran back into the bar dragged hogan out we need to get to the airfield what for no time hogan unlocking the car rebus getting behind the wheel im driving hogan not about to argue rebus sending the car screaming out of the car park but then screeching to a halt staring from the driversside window jesus no stumbling from the car standing in the middle of the road looking up the plane had gone into a dive but was coming out of it whats going on hogan yelled from the passenger seat rebus got back behind the wheel set off again following the planes progress as it passed over the rail bridge made a steep arc as it neared the fife coastline and started back towards the bridges again that planes in trouble hogan stated rebus stopped the car again to watch its brimson he hissed hes got siobhan with him looks like its going to hit the bridge both men were out of the car they werent alone other drivers had stopped to watch pedestrians were pointing and muttering the drone of the engine had grown louder more discordant jesus hogan gasped as the plane flew underneath the rail bridge mere feet from the surface of the water it climbed steeply almost vertically leveled off and then dived again this time it went below the central span of the road bridge is he showing off or trying to scare the wits out of her hogan said rebus shook his head he was thinking of lee herdman the way he would try to scare his teenage waterskiers testing them brimsons the one who planted those drugs hes bringing them into the country on his plane bobby and i get the feeling siobhan knows that so what the hell is he doing now scaring her maybe i hope to hell thats all it is he thought of lee herdman lifting a gun to his temple and the exsas man who jumped to his death from an airplane will they have parachutes hogan was asking could she get out rebus didnt answer his jaw was locked tight the plane was looping the loop now but still far too close to the bridge one wing clipped a suspension cable sending the plane into a spiraling dive rebus took an involuntary step forwards yelled out the word no stretching it for the length of time it took the machine to hit the water hells fucking bells hogan cried rebus was staring at the spot the plane already reduced to wreckage wisps of smoke rising from it as the pieces began to disappear beneath the surface weve got to get down there rebus shouted how i dont know get a boat port edgar theyve got boats they got back into the car and did a squealing uturn drove to the boatyard where a siren was sounding regular sailors already heading for the scene rebus parked and they ran down to the jetty past herdmans boathouse rebus aware of movement at the corner of his eye a flash of color dismissing it in the urgency to reach the waters edge rebus and hogan showed their id to a man who was untying his speedboat we need a lift the man was in his late fifties baldheaded with a silver beard he looked them up and down you need life jackets he protested no we dont now just get us out there rebus paused please the man took another look at him and nodded agreement rebus and hogan clambered aboard holding on as the owner raced out of the harbor other small boats had already congregated around the slick of oil and the lifeboat from south queensferry was approaching rebus scanned the surface of the water knowing it was futile maybe it wasnt them hogan said maybe she didnt go rebus nodded in the hope that his friend might shut up what debris there was was already spreading out the tide and the swell from the various craft dispersing it we need divers bobby frogmen whatever it takes itll be taken care of john somebody elses job not ours rebus realized that hogans hand was squeezing his arm christ and i made that stupid crack about the coast guard not your fault bobby hogan was thoughtful nothing we can do here eh rebus was forced to admit defeat there was nothing they could do they asked the skipper to take them back which he did terrible accident he yelled above the noise of the outboard engine yes terrible hogan agreed rebus just stared at the choppy surface of the water we still going to the airfield hogan asked as they climbed back onto dry land rebus nodded started striding towards the passat but then he paused outside herdmans boathouse and turned his head to look at the much smaller shed next door the one with the car parked in front the car was an old series bmw tarnished black he didnt recognize it where had the flash of color come from he looked at the shed its door was closed had it been open when theyd arrived had the flash of color flitted across the doorway rebus walked up to the door gave it a push it bounced back someone behind it holding it closed rebus stood back and gave the door an almighty kick then shouldered it it flew open sending the man behind it sprawling red shortsleeved shirt with palm trees on it face turning to meet rebuss holy shit bobby hogan was muttering studying the blanket on the ground the array of weapons laid out on it two lockers stood gaping emptied of their secrets pistols revolvers submachine guns thinking of starting a war peacock rebus said and when peacock johnson scrambled forwards making towards the nearest gun rebus took a single step swung back a foot and kicked him straight in the middle of his face throwing him back onto the floor again johnson lay unconscious spreadeagled hogan was shaking his head how the hell did we miss this lot he was asking himself maybe because it was right under our noses bobby same as everything else in this damned case but what does it mean i suggest you ask our friend here rebus said just as soon as he wakes up he turned to walk away where are you going the airfield you stay here with him call it in john whats the point rebus stopped he knew what hogan meant whats the point of going to the airfield but then he started walking again couldnt think of anything else to do he punched siobhans number into his mobile but a recording told him the number wasnt available and he should try again later he punched it in again same response dropped the tiny silver box onto the ground and stamped on it hard as he could with the heel of his shoe it was dusk by the time rebus arrived at the locked gates he got out of the car and tried the entry phone but no one was answering he could see siobhans car through the fence parked next to the office the office door was standing open as though someone had been in a hurry or maybe struggling not bothering to close it after them rebus pushed at the gate put his shoulder to it the chain rattled but wasnt going to yield he stood back and kicked it kicked it again and again shouldered it smashed his fists against it pressed his head to it eyes squeezed shut siobhan his voice breaking he knew what he needed bolt cutters a patrol car could bring some if rebus had any way of calling one brimson he knew it now knew brimson was running drugs had planted them on his dead friends boat he didnt know why but hed find out siobhan had discovered the truth somehow and had died as a result perhaps shed wrestled with him explaining the erratic flight path he opened his eyes wide blinking back tears staring through the gate blinking his vision back into focus because someone was there a figure in the doorway one hand to its head another to its stomach rebus blinked again making sure siobhan he yelled she raised a hand waved it rebus grabbed the fence and hauled himself onto it shouted her name again she disappeared back into the building his voice cracked was he seeing things now no she was out of the building again getting into her car driving the short distance to the gate as she neared rebus saw that it really was her and she was fine she stopped the car and got out brimson she was saying hes the one with the drugs in cahoots with johnson and teris mother shed brought brimsons keys was finding the right one to use on the padlock we know rebus told her but she wasnt listening mustve made a run for it laid me out cold i only came to when the phone started buzzing she yanked the padlock free the chain coming with it pulled open the gate and was picked off the ground by rebus his hug enveloping her ow ow ow she said causing him to ease off bit bruised she explained her eyes meeting his he couldnt help himself planted his lips on hers the kiss lingered his eyes tight shut hers wide open she broke away took a step back tried to catch her breath not that im not overwhelmed or anything but whats this all about it was rebuss turn to visit siobhan in the hospital shed been admitted for a concussion was due to stay the night this is ridiculous she protested im fine really i am youll stay where you are young lady oh yes like you did you mean as if to emphasize her point the same nurse who had changed rebuss dressings walked past pushing an empty cart rebus pulled a chair across and sat down you didnt bring anything then she asked rebus shrugged been a bit rushed you know how it is whats the story with peacock hes doing a good impression of a clam not that itll do him any good way gill templer sees it herdman wouldnt want the guns lying around in his own boathouse so peacock rented the one next door thats where herdman worked on them reconditioning them and they were stored in the shed when he put a bullet to his head things got too hot no way peacock could shift them but then he panicked either that or he just wanted to tool himself up for what was to come siobhan closed her eyes thank god that didnt happen they stayed quiet for a couple of minutes then and brimson she asked what about him the way he decided to end it all i think he chickened out right at the last she opened her eyes again or came to his senses couldnt bring himself to involve anyone apart from himself rebus shrugged whatever hes another statistic for the armed forces to work on maybe theyll try to say it was an accident maybe it was at that could be he was planning to loop the loop and then smash onto the highway go out in a blaze of mayhem i prefer my version then you stick to it and what about james bell what about him reckon well ever understand how he could do it rebus shrugged again all i know is the papers are going to have a field day with his dad and thats good enough for you itll do to be going on with james and lee herdman i dont really get it rebus thought for a moment maybe james reckoned hed found himself a hero someone different from his dad someone whose respect hed give his eyeteeth for or kill for siobhan guessed rebus smiled and stood up patted her arm you going already he shrugged lots to be getting on with were an officer short at the station nothing that cant wait till tomorrow justice never sleeps siobhan which doesnt mean you shouldnt anything i can get you before i go a sense of having achieved something maybe im not sure the vending machines are up to it but ill see what i can do hed done it again ended up drinking too much slumped on the toilet seat back in his flat jacket discarded on the hall floor leaning forwards head in hands last time last time had been the night martin fairstone had died rebus had spent too long in too many pubs tracking down his prey a few more whiskies back at fairstones place and a taxi home driver had had to wake him up when they reached arden street rebus reeking of cigarettes wanting to slough it all off running a bath just the hot tap thinking hed add cold later sitting on the lavatory halfundressed head in hands eyes closed world tilting in the darkness shifting on its axis pitching him forwards so his head thumped against the rim of the bath waking on his knees hands burning hands hanging over the side of the bath scalded by the rising water scalded no mystery about it the sort of thing that could happen to anyone couldnt it but not tonight he got back to his feet steadied himself managed to make it through to the living room and into his chair pushing it over to the window with his feet the night was still and calm lights on in the tenement windows across the way couples relaxing checking on the kids singles awaiting pizza deliveries or sitting down to the videos theyd rented students debating another night out at the pub unstarted essays troubling them few if any of them harboring mysteries fears yes doubts most certainly maybe even guilt about tiny mistakes and misdemeanors but nothing to trouble the likes of rebus not tonight his fingers patted the floor feeling for the telephone he sat with it in his lap thinking of giving allan renshaw a call there were things he had to tell him hed been thinking about families not just his own but all those connected to the case lee herdman walking away from his family james and jack bell seemingly with nothing to connect them but blood teri cotter and her mother and rebus himself replacing his own family with colleagues like siobhan and andy callis producing ties that oftentimes seemed stronger than blood he stared at the phone in his lap reckoned it was a bit late now to call his cousin shrugged and mouthed the word tomorrow smiled at the memory of lifting siobhan off her feet decided to see if he could make it to his bed the laptop was in sleep mode he didnt bother waking it unplugged it instead it could go back to the station tomorrow he came to a stop in the hallway and walked into the guest room lifted the copy of the wind in the willows hed keep it near him so he wouldnt forget tomorrow hed make a gift of it to bob tomorrow god and the devil willing epilogue jack bell had spared no expense during the preliminary organization of his sons defense not that james had seemed to notice hed remained adamant that he wasnt going to fight anything he was guilty and that was what hed say in court nevertheless the solicitor engaged by jack bell was reckoned to be the best scotland had to offer he was based in glasgow and charged traveling time to edinburgh at his standard rate immaculately dressed in chalkstripe suit and burgundy bow tie he smoked a pipe whenever such was permitted and held the pipe in his left hand at what seemed all other times as he sat opposite jack bell now one leg crossed over the other at the knee staring at a patch of wall just above the msps head bell had become used to his ways and knew this was by no means an indication that the lawyer was distractedrather that he was focused on the matter at hand weve got a case the lawyer said a pretty good one id say really oh yes the lawyer examined the stem of his pipe as if for flaws it all boils down to this you seedetective inspector rebus belongs to derek renshaws family a cousin to be precise as a result of which he should never have been let near the case conflict of interest jack bell guessed selfevidently you cant have a relation of one of the victims going in and questioning possible suspects then theres the matter of his suspension you may not know this but di rebus was being investigated by his own force at the time of the events at port edgar the lawyers attention had shifted to the pipes bowl scrutinizing its interior a question of possible proceedings being taken against him in a murder case better and better nothing came of it but all the same one does have to wonder at the lothian and borders police im not sure that ive ever heard of an officer on suspension being able to move so freely around another ongoing inquiry its irregular then unheardof id suggest which leads to very serious questions about the validity of much of the crowns case the lawyer paused tested the pipe between his teeth his mouth forming a shape that might have been taken for a grin there are so many possible objections and technicalities the crown might even be forced to concede without the need of anything other than a preliminary hearing in other words the case would be tossed out its entirely feasible id say weve got a very strong case the lawyer paused for effect but only if james were to plead not guilty jack bell nodded and the two mens eyes met for the first time then both heads turned to face james who was seated across the table well james the lawyer said what do you think the teenager seemed to be considering the offer he returned his fathers stare as if it were all the nourishment he needed and he had a hunger that would never be stilled about the author ian rankin is the bestselling mystery writer in the
